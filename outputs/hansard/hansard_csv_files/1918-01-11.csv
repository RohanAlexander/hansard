Joseph Oook","In reply to the charges made yesterday by the honourable ' members f o t West Sydney and Dalley, regarding the evictions by the Sydney Harbor Trust, for which they blamed the Coal Board, I wish to say that that Board does not employ labour of any kind whatever. the charge against the Coal Board? being delivered to any place where these men are employed. Mr J. H . CATTS -Thus victimizing the men. that is not so. Government will have an inquiry. MT. WALLACE I understand that the Coal Board does not employ anybody; but the contractors, who aro under the direct supervision f the Goal Board, employ 0 men.

I take this opthe electors. I propose to put into Hanportunity to -remind honourable members that I shall see that the Standing Orders are observed, and I ask their co-operation in tbe maintenance of order. move That the House protests against(a) the repuSiation of the pledges of the Prime Minister and other Ministers; (i) the political persecution of publio men and other citizens and the press under the War Precautions Begulations during ""the recent referendum campaign; (c) the deprivation, of statutory electoral , rights of Australian-born citizens by regulation behind the back of Parliament; (d) the general administration of publie affairs, and wishes to inform His Excellency the Governor General that the Government does not possess, the confidence of the people of Australia. . I make no apology for moving this motion. If ever there was an occasion when suoh a motion was justified, this is such an occasion. A referendum on conscription has just 'been taken, and the majority which voted for the side which this party espoused was larger by 92,000 than the majority we gained on the last referendum. I cannot say from memory whether the number of votes cast on this occasion was as great as the number cast on the last occasion. M T. TTJDOR -Then many who, at'the last referendum, voted with tihe Government party must be tired of those whorepresent them, and showed their feoliug by absenting themselves from the poll. The: motion will have the effect of clearing the political atmosphere. Honourable members opposite who think that* the Ministry has done wrong in breaking its pledge will have an opportunity of ""saying so, but if , notwithstanding,they vote to keep the Government in office, they will endorse its action. company. W. Elliot members opposite may say that tbey were forced either to keep this Government in power or to give office to members of the present Opposition, but that subterfuge will not shelter them from the censure of sard some of. the pledges that were made by Ministers and members 'of the Ministerial party, and I have reason to believe that the issue will not be seized under the",20,Setup

Your duty has to be done. You have to do it. At Hurstville, ou tlie 5th. December, he saidIf you reject these proposals, I wash my hands of all responsibility. I shall not attempt to carry on. At Goulburn, on 6th December, he saidIn effect what the people of Australia have to determine on 20th December is by whom they intend to be governed. quoting ? there is no doubt about the accuracy of these statements, because if they were inaccurate the newspaper would be prosecuted. But I can obtain the same material from other newspapers. 7th December, the Prime Minister saidI 'have said that this Government will not retain office unless you approve of these proposals. At Albury, on the 17th December, he saidAs far as this Government is concerned, I repeat that unless it has the power it seeks it will not attempt to govern the country. Those are the pledges of the right honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Hughes). Is he in office to-day, or is he not ? Is the vision of honourable members right when they see him still in occupation of the Treasury bench? "" I will not attempt to govern the country unless this power is given "" he said, and previously he had laid down the principle that ""an honourable man is bound by his word or action; a dishonourable man cannot be bound, even though his pledge be engraven on steel."" I turn now to the pledges given by the Minister for the Navy( Mr Joseph Cook). Speaking at ""Willoughby, on l l t h December, he saidWe are deliberately taking the risk. It is really we who are making the sacrifice, and we mean to return with a triumphant majority, and we say, "" Unless you do that, somebody else can have the chance of carrying on the Government."" We say we are doing this, even if it involves our own destruction. At .Summerhill, on the 15 th of December, he saidIf our proposal is not carried, we will ask to be relieved from tbe responsibility of conducting the war. At Annandale, on 16 th December, he saidThe Government can get nothing out of this -w e have nothing to gain. We will decline to hold ofiice. At Manly, on the same date, he saidThe Government will not attempt to carry on the government of the country if "" No"" is voted. Senator Pearce, the Minister for Defence, speaking at Maryborough, is reported by the Age as having said° The.alternative was not merely a change to a Labour Government, as it was at the outset of the war, when the last man and last shilling had been pledged. The alternative was Australia's withdrawal from the war. The next pledge of interest is that of the honourable jnember for Flinders, Si r William Irvine. At Junee, on Government. I am putting him in to make weight. The honourable gentleman said at Wagga Wagga on 27th NovemberThe Government has declared in language which admits of no shadow of ambiguity, that it will not attempt to continue governing this country without the powers asked for in this Referendum. That is a clear, definite, and welcome assertion of the principle of Government responsibility in an issue vital to our national honour and safety. No other course would have been possible. The Government says in effect, "" You must choose between our party with conscription and the official Labour party without conscription."" On this pledge the Government must not now be allowed to stand alone. AH members sitting behind the Government are bound by it in honour or they cease to be Government supporters. A t ' No r t h Sydney, on 29th November, he saidThe choice now before the people of Australia is the choice which, in my opinion, should^ have been before them on 5th May last, namely, you have to choose, not between conscription and no conscription, but between the Nationalist party with conscription or the Labour party without conscription. A t Bathurst, on 1st December, he saidThe issue was 'the National Government with conscription against the Labour Government without conscription. I come next to the Postmaster-General, Mr Webster. The honourable member is not present; apparently he is making up the sleep he lost when he rose at 3 o'clock in the morning to write out a character for the Prime Minister.",22,Motion Of No Gonfidenoe

I have here the statement thatMr Greene added that Mr Hughes had stated that if the referendum was defeated the Government would resign. !The pledge given by Mr Hughes to the people had been gazetted by proclamation That is news to meand this he ( Mr Greene) had never heard of being done before. He emphasized the fact that the pledge would be absolutely kept. The pledge was that unless the power sought by the Government was given them they would resign. According to the Minister for the Navy, it was the Government who were making the sacrifice. Adcording to the Postmaster-General they would not carry on for twenty-four hours if the referendum were not carried. According to Senator Milleni n tliat event the Government would go out of office.

But how many did disclaim it? which we should like some information. claimed it . low the example of the Prime Minister who, on one occasion, acting like a schoolmaster before his class, called on all his opponents who had not done a certain thing to stand up. I should like to know, however, how many supporters of the Government specifically disclaimed this pledge from the platforms of the country. If they choose to avail themselves of the opportunity afforded them by this motion they will be able to tell us what stand they took up. They will be able to tell ua whether they did not say with the Government, "" Heads we win, and tails we do not lose."" That was the attitude of the Government. They were playing with a two-headed penny. member a trifle mixed? There could be no tail on a two-headed penny. man knows more about the "" two-up school "" form of gambling than I do. This pledge having been given by Ministers, they returned to Parliament House, and helda meeting up-stairs. When we were in offioe it used to be said by an honourable member who was then leading the Opposition, that we always adjourned to the vaults ,to determine what should be done in the Souse. The Government and their supporters on this occasion, however, met upstairs, and decided upon a policy of "" Hush and smother!"" They said, in effect, ""Hush! Not a word about these pledges! I always endeavour to be Smother them up. Keep them dark! We have the press with us. Ninety-nine per cent, of the press of Australia backed us up on the conscription issue. The press will keep our pledges dark, and the people will not learn anything of them.. I did, in fact, The Labour press will not have a chance of reaching the people. We shall take care that they are carefully censored, and keep out of the Labour journals anything .that does not suit us."" That is the position to-day. A double censorship is going on. The Government and their supporters can secure the publication of anything that suits their party, and friendly editors carefully suppress anything that does not suit them. Wheni t comes to publishing anything in favour of the Labour party, these newspaper editors ruthlessly use tiie blue pencil. And so the Government and their supporters said, "" Smother up the Ministerial pledge. The people of Australia returned us with a triumphant majority after Ready had been got out of the way. They took no notice of that incident, andthey will take no notice of this. Let us again adopt the policy of ' hush and smother,' and the people will forget this pledge."" I warn honourable members opposite, however, that they are mistaken. Some of the people will remember the pledge. .The people who support the Government may have an undying hate for our political programme, and for our policy generally, but a lot of the respect they had for honourable members opposite has been lost as the result of the doings of the past week. They despise the Ministry and the supporters who keep them there. The Government cannot get away from that fact. They say, "" We are prepared to take the chance."" Of course they are. We have all to accept the responsibility for our political actions, and everything we do in this House must bear the light of day. No one knows'better than do the Government and their supporters themselves that they have lost the respect of a great section of the community who supported them at the last general election, and who, on that occasion, were among their best workers.

I believe that'many honourable members opposite would have preferred to see the labour party come into office, even if it had been met with a "" sudden death"" motion, or allowed to remain on the Treasury bench for a little time. They would have preferred that rather than that they should participate in the farce that has been enacted, and in which they will be participants unless they vote for this motion.

We may disagree politically, and honourable members opposite may do their best to bring about my political defeat, just as I shall endeavour to defeat them politically, but there is no reason why we should resort to personalities. In submitting this motion to the House, I am speaking in a strictly political, and not in a personal, sense, so far as any honourable member is concerned. I have always made my attitude perfectly clear, and would not be a party to attacks such as have been made on the Prime Minister by men on his own side. I would not be a party to such attacks either inside Parliament or out of it. The attitude adopted towards the Prime Minister by some men on his own When interrupted I was about to deal with the conduct of the campaign. Honourable members are well aware that any publication representing the views of honourable members on this side of the House was carefully scrutinized by the censor, that prosecutions were instituted, and that some members on this side were bound over not to make certain statements; in fact, we hardly dare open our mouths. to tell the truth! was one of the public men the persecution of whom forms part of my case. A t present, however, I am dealing with the literature that was issued on behalf of the honourable members opposite, and the Reinforcements Referendum Council, and I ask whether, if we on this side had issued to the public such statements, we should not have been, denounced, particularly in the one case, from every pulpit in the country as guilty of blasphemy. I refer to the pamphlet.which contains the words, "" But for Gawd's sake don't send me.""

Greater untruth than that represented by this leaflet was never uttered in any part of the world, so far as I know. as bad as that "" blood vote "" of yours! will have every opportunity to present what documents and arguments he desires during the course of this debate, although some honourable members opposite were very anxious that I should not have equal facility to place my views on record. Of course, I am not now speaking personally of the Minister for the Navy( Mr Joseph Cook) ; but there are honourable members opposite, though not a majority, I think, who were anxious to have no discussion on the question before us. They were prepared to use all the forms of the House to avoid giving a vote which would decide whether the Government should honour their pledges, and be held responsible for the conduct of the campaign. Honourable members are aware that the Government's views during the campaign had e\'ery publicity so far as the news columns of the newspapers were concerned, but they may not be aware of the fact that they also had the advantage of the advertising columns as well. When I was returning from Brisbane, I had, of course, ample time to read the newspapers in the train, and I looked at them more carefully than I am otherwise able to do. It was then that I saw that the Argus of Wednesday, the 12th December, had over three columns of reports of meetings on one page, in addition to a leading article, "" Campaign -Voters,"" amongst the general news all in favour of the Government proposals. A l together, there were about nine. columns devoted to the advocacy of the conscription proposals, while there was not a line in support of those who were against them. We, on this side, at any rate, represent the views of, I think, 1,178,000 of the people of Australia on the question, including a majority of the people in the State of Victoria; and yet we had not the advantage of any space at all in the columns of the general daily press. would the Labour papers give the other side? Labour papers give me? memory, I should, say that there were only two morning Labour daily papers in the Commonwealth, the Daily Post of Hobart, and theDaily Herald of Adelaide. Then there is the Evening Standard of Brisbane. issued as a daily. ' only ""three times a week. If the Labour papers did not give the Minister for the Navy( Mr Joseph Cook) any publicity, I may tell him that, apart from the Sydney meeting at which I spoke, the Labour papers did not report any meetings at all, even on their own side. And in the case of that one meeting the Labour report was cut down by the censor; in fact, the Labour paper was not allowed to publish parts of my speech, although those parts appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph. The Age of the same date, 12th December, had about six and a half columns devoted to the affirmative side. member, in order to be fair, ought to compare the two daily Labour newspapers of the same date with the Melbourne newspapers. can do that for himself.

79,Mr Tudor,"That is not so. As todistinguished from the news, I may refer to the case of the Herald, Melbourne. The Political Labour Council of Victoria, being in charge of the anti-campaign, had, of course, to advertise their side, and they sought to have inserted a halfpage advertisement in the Herald. The man in charge of the advertising department of the Herald said he could accept the advertisement, and it was arranged that it should appear on the Saturday, Monday, and Wednesday with an offer for Tuesday as well. The representatives of the Labour Council offered to pay a deposit, but the advertising man told them it was not necessary, because their name was good enough-as , I say, it ought to be, representing, as they do, the responsible officers of a responsible body. dated them, those who went to men lying The half-page advertisement, which was a very attractive one, appeared in the Saturday issue, but on the Monday the Political Labour Council representative received word from the Herald that there was no space for the advertisement that night-au d this in spite of the fact that practically a contract had been entered into for three insertions. A t ' any rate, although it was said there was no space for this half-page advertisement, there was, on the Monday, space for a two or three column article on the front page by Mr Theodore Eink in reply to the advertisement. The management of the Herald evidently got "" cold"" feet, and was afraid of the advertisement doing the paper an injury, seeing that it was so drafted as to, perhaps, give rise to the idea that it represented the views of the newspaper. However' that may be, the management of the Herald intimated to the Political Labour Council that there would be no room on the Wednesday for any big advertisement, * though on that day a full page, taken by some one, was devoted to giving the result of / the returned soldiers vote, or, rather, I should say, the alleged vote by returned soldiers, because if that was -a true vote fche returned soldiers altered unless I was sure of my ground I would their minds when it came to a general vote, and from being a majority of 150 to 1 in one place the voting was never more than 3 to 1 for "" Yes "" in any State.

Council of Victoria approached the other newspapers of Melbourne. The Age informed them that they could have a page advertisement, and accepted money m payment for it , but at the last moment turned it down, and merely gave a 12-inch double column advertisement, making a refund afterwards. The Argus, the newspaper that professes to be fair, and professes to have a high standard, was also approached, and asked whether an advertisement could be inserted, but the reply waB, "" We have no space'; we will have no space until the Saturday week after the referendum."" That is, until about ten days after the referendum, they could find no space fian "" anti "" advertisement. answer deceive any onef 'A pap*., that would take such action is absolutely despicable. Can the other side point to any case where they took an advertisement to a Labour newspaper, and space was refused, even after the money had been paid, and where the advertisement -was cut down to about a quarter of what was paid for? On the Sunday on which I was to speak in the Sydney Domain an advertisement was taken to one newspaper, and they said, "" We will insert the advertisement only if we are per' mitted to write it . "" There was no chance for the Labour party to put forth its views. There is no doubt that the words vote, and they did it all behind the back which I cabled to Warrant-officer deceived. McGrath, M.P., "" That the Labour members, Federal and State, were unanimously opposed to the Government proposals:"" that there was no chance of expressing their views in the news columns of the newspapers; and that advertisements, even if they were paid for, would not be accepted, correctly expressed the position. This is the fair play that we received from the press. If we take every copy of the newspapers circulating in Australia, the Labour party control probably not more than 1 per cent., the other side controlling 99 per cent.; yet we had the majority of voters. What would the majority have been if we had had at least half of the newspapers with us, or if the press had accepted our advertisements as they should have done? However, I leave the matter there. We had to,fight against extraordinary odds, and we have won through in spite of everything-in spite of pledges that are now dishonoured, and, like a bad cheque, returned to the drawer as "" not negotiable -"" That is the position. When honourable members', pledges are presented for payment they are marked ""return to drawer,"" though they were not pledges made in the heat of platform discussion, but were made by honourable members calmly and deliberately considering them as a Cabinet. They gave the pledge that they would stand or fall by this referendum. Did it ""mean anything ? Yet, with that advantage, they failed, and with all the other advantages which they thought they possessed-for instance, by reducing the number of reinforcements required! DtSf' ,r from 16,500 per month. "" Things are worse,"" they, said; ""worse than they have been since the battle of the Marne, yet we are only going to ask for 7,000 a month."" Were they fooling the people in October, 1916, when they asked for 16,500 each month, and was it their idea to sugarcoat a political pill for the people to swallow when they brought down the number to 7,000 each month, and said, ""These are only reinforcements?"" Why did -they not have the common honesty to put into the question submitted to the people the words "" compulsorily reinforcing our men ?""

100,Mr Tudob,"The Political LabourI f time permits, I propose to refer to some of those who have objected, to being struck off the roll, and who are just as loyal as is any honourable member in this House. I met one man in another State. I did not ask him how he proposed to voteI have never asked any man that question-bu t he asked me what I thought of things, and told me that he was prohibited from voting. to certain battalion colours that he was -wearing, and asked him what it meant. He said, "" My son has just returned after serving for nearly three years; he is almost blind. I am entitled to vote, yet I have to go to some officer, and explain this, and ask him whether I can vote."" Even had he-been going to vote upon our side, I would not have asked him to appeal to this officer to be allowed to vote. In another case, the right to vote of a married man with five children, and whose only brother had been killed at the Front, was challenged. His father was born in Germany, but came to Australia as a child. As a matter of fact, he had volunteered for military service himself. Yet he was denied -a vote merely because his father was a German. Similarly, a lady in Adelaide, who has sent five sons to the Front, two or three of whom have been killed, was refused the right to vote. Mr ""WATT -'Sh e was not rightly refused. MT. TUDOR I am not saying that she was, but persons were denied the right to vote merely because some of the electoral officers did not know as much about the electoral law as did others. comes very well from the Minister for Works and Railways. MT . HEITMANN -That sort of thing might happen at any election. MT. TUDOR -But it was more likely to happen, consequent upon the introduction of this system, on the occasion of the recent referendum than it is at ordinary elections. People did not know whether they were entitled to vote or not. Indeed, many persons, whose parents had been born in .Sohleswig-JJjolstein or one of the border provinces, perhaps, of Germany or Austria, or in the Trentino, outside of Italy, consulted me as to whether they were qualified to vote. They were eligible to vote if they could prove that their parents had been born in 'these provinces before a certain time. Now, I submit that it is a very difficult matter for many persons to prove where their -parents were born. to prove that they were born ait all. cumstance for granted. But while some I pointed people may be able to say that their ..parents were bora in certain places, owing to the entries contained in the family Bibles or in other books Which they have in their possession, it is extremely difficult for others to prove where their -parents were born. As a matter of fact, honourable members know that there are -many applicants for old-age pensions who cannot prove either the date or the place of their birth. I say that it was absolutely unfair to impose such a prohibition on a certain section of -the community at the last moment. I can cite still another case in which a man whose name is apparently as British as is my own, was allowed to vote, whereas his wife was denied that right. This man writesThe facts are as follow:-""Sh e was born in Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, and has never left the Commonwealth. Her mother was born in Sydney, and her ancestors, as far back as can be traced; are all English. Her father was born at sea on the way to Australia, and his parents are all English.

Upon attending at the polling booth his wife's vote was challenged, and her ballot-paper was set aside. Yet her maiden name was Jones, and her parents were born in Wales. Case after case of this description might be mentioned. Only yester< ay I read the following in the Age news-5'per : THE "" GERMAN ORIGIN "" QUESTION. i.mong the large number of people of German pxtraetion in this district through the operalion of fhe provision in the late referendum disfranchising people whose fathers were born .n Germany. The matter was brought up on Wednesday at the meeting of the Hume Shire Council, some of the members of which are effected by sec. 25. There is no doubt about the loyalty of these people, and yet they were disfranchised. The Minister for the Navy desires to know what I said during the referendum campaign upon the question of the disfranchisement of aliens in our midst. I made a pronouncement upon that question from several platforms, but the newspapers did not publish it. I said that if any doubt existed as to the loyalty of any alien in the community such alien should be interned. It was the duty of the Government to act thus, but they had no right to disfranchise persons against whom there was not a whisper of suspicion. That was the statement which 1 made, and the fact that the newspapers did. not publish it was not my fault. I come now to the action of the Prime Minister which was, apparently, prompted by his visit to QueenslandI refer to the establishment of a Commonwealth police force there. To my mind, the right honourable gentleman's action in that connection was one of his worse during the campaign. I know that disturbances did occur at political meetings which he addressed there. But they were not of such a character as to warrant the establishment of a Commonwealth police force, and I hope that, though we now have the same Government in office again-the Out-again-in-again Government-the y will say that if Commonwealth police are necessary in Queensland, they are equally necessary in other States, irrespective of whether there is a Labour Government in power there or not. Not only did the press as a whole keep our speeches out of its columns, but we were also subject to a censorship. I have here the proofs of the reports of speeches which I delivered in Adelaide-on e at the Trades Hall in the afternoon, and the other at the Exhibition Building in the evening of the same day. To show the absurdity of the censorship, let me inf OTm the House that things which I said in both speeches were Icut out of the report of the afternoon's speech and allowed to appear in the report of the evening's speech, and vice versa. The proofs of the speech had to be furnished to the censor by the Labour daily paper, which had to wait until it had received them back from him before it could publish the reports. Apparently, the object of honourable members opposite wai to put every difficulty in the way of the Labour newspapers. talking rubbish. What had we to do with that? of' the Government. I do not know whether the honourable member, when the vote on this motion is taken, will cross the floor, or whether he will remain a humble follower of the Government, endorsing its action in the breaking of its pledges, and its conduct of the referendum campaign. He is one of those on whom 1 have my eye. The officials of a Department run that Department much as the Minister at the head wants it to be run; they take their cue from him. With a keen Minister, the officials will be keen; with a slack Minister, slackness will develop. When officials tliink that the Minister wishes things to be cut out of a newspaper report, they will see that that is done. That great paper, which was afraid to publish our addresses-the Argus-sai d that my attack on Major Smeaton, the Adelaide censor, was unfair; but tliat gentleman, who is the chief censor for South Australia, was photographed with the Prime Minister, as one of his principal supporters. free country. should not be a political partisan.

It would not be fair if those who supplied them to me were victimized. We have a right to' know what is taking plaice. I have here three passages which were not allowed to appear in the report of the evening speech, but were allowed to appear in the report of the afternoon speech, and another passage which was allowed to appear in the report of the evening speech and not in the report of the afternoon speech. Perhaps the two reports were censored by different persons, though the initials on the proofs look to be the same. In Canada, iabout six months ago a Bill was introduced f to amend the Chinese Immigration Act, and Mr Roche was asked in the Canadian House of Commons, by Mr ing at such and such a word, and finishMcDonald;-no t a very German namewhether requests had been received from coal-mine proprietors in British Columbia to be allowed to bring in Chinese labour. Mr Roche replied that there had been several requests for the importation of Chinese labour by employers in British Columbia, in the central provinces, and in the eastern provinces. The question and answer were published in the Canadian Hansard, a publication which is accessible in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library-it has not yet been seized. I quoted that passage in my speeches, but the censor cut it out of the report of the afternoon speech, though allowing it to appear in the report of the evening speech. Let me refer to another instance of the way in which the censorship was exercised. About a week before the referendum was taken, I had possession of a cablegram, which was sent from Great Britain, to say that Warrant Officer McGrath had distributed the statement that I had made, advising soldiers and I'have munition workers, nurses, and others, to Vote against conscription.

Sitting suspended from 12.88 to 2.15 p.m. ister and Attorney-General) [2.15] I wish I were able to offer to the Leader of the Opposition those formal congratulations which are quite common in circumstances such as these, but I feel myself quite unable to do so. The speech of the honourable gentleman ha.s disappointed me. Had a turn of the wheel of destiny placed me where the honourable member is to-day, and had I succeeded no better than he has done, I should then consider myself to be gibbeted for ever by public opinion, and to have lost all claim to be regarded as a leader of men in this country. For the honourable member's own speech furnishes conclusive evidence why his motion should be rejected, and of his own unfitness to lead the Commonwealth in this critical hour. good enough to review with me the actual situation as it now confronts us; I ask them to turn their eyes from those comparatively petty and insignificant details of the recent campaign to which the honourable gentleman devoted his whole attention, and regard that tremendous and tragic spectacle upon which the civilized world has been compelled to gaze, those awful agonies it has been compelled to endure for over three and a half years. Of this, the greatest tragedy in the world's history, the honourable member has said not one word. He has made no reference whatever to the fact that a great war is in progress, that it has now reached its supremest crisis, that our liberties and our existence as a free people hang literally by a hair. from the honourable member's speech that by some hocus pocus, or by the vote of the people, we had abolished war and its consequences, whereas in reality we stand now on the very brink of a precipice over which to-morrow we may topple headlong. Sir, the honourable member by his motion invites this House to declare, in effect, that it has no confidence in the Government, and he and those who are associated with him should govern the country. Yet he avoids all mention of those things that fill the minds of all thinking men... Not only has he passed over without a word' the war and deadly peril in which we stand, but he has made no reference whatever to the effects of the vote of the people upon the Commonwealth-; not a word has he said of the referendum as a means whereby Democracy expresses itself, and proves its competence and fitness as a means of government. Yet there is something about the result of the referendum and the situation with which we are now confronted at once tragic and sad beyond the power of words to express. When we contemplate the circumstances in which the referendum,, that supreme achievement of Democracy-governmen t of the people for the people directly by the people-to which we of the Labour party had pinned our faith, called upon to just if y itself, has failed, and failed abjectly, who amongst us can doubt that this, is a blow at the very foundation of democratic government ? The Leader of the Opposition has said nothing at all about the consequences of the referendum, vote to DeI ask honourable members to be mocracy, to Australia, to the world, to civilization, and to the cause of peace. He has made no reference whatever to the present position of the war, the Italian situation, the darkening shadow on the Western front; no reference to Germany's attitude towards the Russian peace proposals. Every man must admit, extremist though he be, that the Bolshevik peace proposals did not err on the side of demanding too much from Germany. Yet to-day we see Germany contemptuoitsly evading these proposals of a Democracy run mad, a great nation now dismembered and in a state of anarchy, awaiting the hour when Russia, incapable of further resistance, will be at her mercy. He has made not one word of reference to the fact of 'the mask having been torn One would have imagined from the face of Germany, her hypocritical peace proposals exposed, her war aims clearly revealed. Instead of proving the fitness of his party to govern by dealing with a great situation in a great way, he has regaled us with statements about Mr So-and-so having said something and his remarks not appearing in the press; that a number of persons of German extraction were not allowed to vote, and so on; but not one word of the fact that Germany intends, if by any means she can accomplish it,' to Prussianize the world,, and retain her hold on all that territory of which she is now in occupation, and that she intends to dismember the British",34,Protestations Of Loyalty Albury Bitternes S Has Been Engendered
137,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime MinEmpire-the greatest guarantee of the world's security and peace that history has ever known. titanic struggle in which the civilized world is engaged is ignored, and we have been obliged to follow the honourable gentleman through a maze of the infinitely little and petty. We have heard nothing of the great and tragic situation that prethe situation in which the country finds sents itself to us and the world to-day. What is the present position of Australia ? Who shall say that Democracy has emerged triumphant from its trial? History will write its verdict on what Australia has done. whether we, who declared that in no way can Liberty be retained by a people who were not prepared to fight for it, were right or wrong. I have no doubt what that verdict will be. We have not failed. The honourable member did not even say that the Government had failed. He was concerned more with the question of who shall sit on the Ministerial benches rather than with the fact of what the referendum vote means to Australia. He has not even done that which he might legitimately have done, holding the views he does, namely, acclaimed the fact that Australia has escaped from conscription. All he is concerned with is as to who shall sit here, and who there, that Mr So-and-so said something and ' was prosecuted, while Mr So-and-so said something else and was not prosecuted, and that The Antis' Creed hurt the tender feelings of some persons and no prosecution followed. I ask the House and the country to look at the existing war situation and to consider what the referendum vote means to Australia, and -what the war means to us. To-day we stand within a hair's breadth of a precipice. Armageddon is at hand. The legions of the enemy are massing for the great attack; forty-one German divisions have been detached from the Eastern frontier and concentrated at Cambrai. What is to happen on the battle-fields of Europe is to us the great thing that matters. the honourable member has spoken affect this fact? How do they lessen our danger? How do they help us to meet it? How would they avail if the Germans broke through the line at Cambrai? Will any man tell us that we have a right to ignore a situation which may involve the nation in destruction? I had hoped that the honourable member would have let us Every phase of the and the world know that he realizes his responsibility towards the people of this country, and that he has some solution to offer of these tremendous problems which confront us. By not a word did he suggest to the House that he recognises itself to-day. We heard not one word, either by way of approval or condemnation, of Mr Lloyd George's declaration of the principles for which Great Britain drew the sword, and upon which she Posterity will judge stands to-day. The Prime Minister of Great Britain and President Wilson have set out clearly the terms upon which the Allies are prepared to make peace. He uttered not one word of commendation of those great pronouncements, consistent as they are with the cause for which Britain and the Allies drew the sword, and with a most sincere and earnest desire to bring lasting peace to the world. The most ardent lover of peace must surely commend these plain and definite declarations of the Allies' war aims, and of the terms upon which they are prepared to make peace; yet by not even a word have honourable members been privileged to learn the honourable gentleman's mind on 'this vital matter. May I be permitted to remind the House and the country of the circumstances that led up to the referendum? Let me recall to honourable members the circumstances in which this House was elected, and the pledges by which every honourable member on this side, and on the Opposition side also, is bound. Much has been said about pledges, and I say here and now that I am one of the men who, in 1914, subscribed to the manifesto upon whicli the Labour party was given a majority by the electors, without which we N would never have been returned to Parliament. It was this manifesto; setting out as it did clearly the war policy of the How do those things of which Labour party, that induced the electors to say, "" This is the party we want."" That manifesto was redolent of patriotic determination to wage this war to a victorious finish for those great principles which Mr Lloyd George and President Wilson but yesterday reiterated again to the world. It pledged every member of the party to a definite policy. Those pledges were given by honourable members oppesite, but they did not keep them. Yet they talk about honouring pledges. Every man on the Opposition side was elected upon the pledge that we would stand behind the Empire to the last man and the last shilling, subordinating all things in any and every circumstance to the carrying on of the war. Sir, .they did not. They were not allowed to do so by the outside organizations; but honourable members, at the behest of persons outside this Parliament, repudiated the pledges upon which they were elected. I was elected, together with the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) and every one of those honourable members who were returned to Parliament in 1914, upon the pledge to fight, this war to a victorious finish. Labour party in 1914; what is its policy to-day? If we contrast the elections of 1914, when the Labour, party, then united, went to the country upon that manifesto which secured our triumph, with the fate that overtook them on the 5th May last, when, at the behest of men outside, they set aside their former pledges for a mean and narrow creed which brought them deservedly to destructionthen we shall see by what means they have fallen from grace, and how richly they deserve the fate that has overtaken them. The party which was given an overwhelming majority in 1914 received in 1917 the greatest defeat in the history of the Commonwealth. It was victorious because it put country before party; it was defeated because it put party before the country. It is true that honourable members speak now as though they were to-day the representatives of the majority; but they are not so. The Nationalist party has failed, if you a time when I was Leader of the United like to put it so, to arouse the democracy of this country to a sense of its duty, but it Is not we who have failed, but the people of Australia. We have failed to make disloyal men loyal; we have failed to make cowards brave men; we have failed to make lip-servers of loyalty loyal in their hearts; we have failed to make selfish men forget their selfishness. There are tens of thousands who urged us on, yet went to the ballot-box and, for the sake of their pockets, voted "" No."" would infinitely rather stand with men Mr Hughes. . . . . -. i . : 1 I have denounced-wit h the Sinn Feiners, who have an ideal although it is one with which I cannot agree; which I think indeed is calculated to hinder rather than promote the object they have in viewthan with these men who sold their country to put money in their pockets. I can understand a man giving a vote Did they do so? to save his life, although I cannot applaud his action. I cannot forgive it , but I can understand it. I can understand men who are attajched to an organization following that organization out of a mistaken sense of party loyalty. I can understand all these things although I cannot applaud them. But I cannot forgive those men who, grown fat on this war, pretended that they desired Australia to do her duty, and went to the ballot-box That was the policy of the and voted against her doing it . Let us review the situation. Honourable members interjecting, May I ask, Mr Speaker, that there may be no interjections. I cannot hear them, and therefore it is not fair to me that should''be made.

In 1916 a referendum was taken on this very question at Labour party. By a majority the people of this country rejected the proposals then submitted. But within six months of their rejection the Nationalist party was returned to office by the largest majority ever accorded to a party in Australia. It was returned to ofiice upon a platform clear and unambiguous, and which set out unmistakably the differences between the two parties. Those differences still divide us. I declared in my Bendigo speech, that it was for the people ""to choose I by what men and what ideals they snould be governed.

141,Mr Hughes,"I come now to the party were set out quite clearly and distinctly. This party was elected on the policy set out in my Bendigo speech prior to the elections of 5th May, 1917. It s attitude towards conscription was set out in the following words: This Government will not enforce nor attempt to enforce conscription either by regulation or statute during the life of the forthcoming Parliament. If, however, national safety demands it, the question will be again referred to the people. That is the policy of the Government on this great question. Speaking at Benalla on 26th April-dur ing the same campaignI saidWe shall not find a ready excuse or pretext for putting this question to the. people. We shall put it only if the tide of battle which now 'flows strongly for tbe Allies turns against them. honour of being hooted in this country In that case we shall put it before the people. That was the policy of the party I have jthe honour to lead on this"" great question. National party were elected. It involved obligation. The one was that we would not introduce conscription behind the backs of the people; the other, that if national safety demanded it-and the test of whether national safety did demand it was that if the tide of battle which then flowed strongly for the Allies turned against them-the n we were in honour bound to submit the question to the people either by way of election or .referendum. It was upon this distinct understanding that the electors ' returned the party to power. Our position on this matter was quite clear. What was the position of the war immediately preceding the date on which the Government decided to launch the second Referendum campaign ? Neveri n the history of the world has there been a change more tragic, more catastrophic than that which overtook the Allied cause in the months of October and November last. Russia, tliat great All y , had completely collapsed. It a l y had been overwhelmingly defeated. In the history of the world there is no defeat that can bear comparison with that of the Izonzo. Two hundred and f if t y thousandI quote, of course, from the newspaper statementsof the' Italian Forces had been taken prisoner, and at least 200,000 casualties had occurred. Great armies no longer continued to exist. That line which seemed to be not only impregnable against the attacks of the Austrians, but on the verge of sweeping down on to the plains of Austria, was in a moment sent reeling over the Tagliamento, u n t i l it was driven back on the Piave to the very gates of Venice. Tha.t was the position. W ill any man dare to say that, in the face of the Bendigo speech, and the circumstances in which we were elected, we as a Government and a party ought not to have consulted the people, ought not to have told them plainly what the position was, and have asked for that power without which it seemed to us we could not fairl y do our duty to the Empire? A t that very time, as honourable members well know, General Birdwood, who has had the by some gentlemen who were very prominent in the "" No"" campaign, but whose name w ill live in the history of Australia It was upon that that the as that of a man who has served the cause of civilization, of the Empire, and Ausa double pledgea double tralia, had declared that one division of the Australian A r m y had to be withdrawn. He set out in plain terms the number of reinforcements required. D o honourable members think that we could in honour have remained silent, that we could have retained office, without going to the people and telling them these f acts ? W ill any man say that w i th any of the means at our disposal we could have hoped to get voluntary recruits to fill u p the gap? There was no l>or>e; at least so it seemed to us. I said at Benallai f the tide of battle turned against the Allies we should again put this question to the people. The tide of battle did turn unmistakably against the Allies, and we put the question to the electors. Upon them rests the responsibility. Time w ill . write its verdict on the decision of the Australian electors on 20th December, and I feel confident that when the verdict is given it w ill not be we who put the question, but the people who rejected it , who will stand condemned. Those were the circumstances under which we took the referendum. My honourable friend, the Leader of the Opposition, after having been my colleague for many years, a n d ' therefore knowing me very well, indeed, has said that the referendum was taken because the honourable member for Elinders( SirW ill i a m I r v in e ) had been campaigning throughout tihe country on this question. I intend to say but one word on this particular point:; I have been a colleague of some of my bonorable friends opposite for many years, and if they pretend to believe that in the Caucus or on the floor of this House, or anywhere else, they know me as a man who can be driven by any man, I will say no'more than that I do not agree with them. view of the responsibility in regard to the referendum, and the honourable member for Flinders quite properly took his own course. For that he is responsible, and can answer. We did what we considered proper and absolutely essential. We felt we could either go to the country on the issue or put it before the people by way of a referendum. We adopted the latter course. collapse of the Russian armies and of the Russian nation, were ample justification, and provide a reason that is so f u l l and complete as to close the mouths of all save those who come, not to be convinced, but to condemn. I come now to the circumstances under which the Government took the referendum. It is said that we sugarcoated the p ill , and that we ought to have asked for more. Indeed, it was freely stated during the campaign that if we got this power we would not stop there. I shall read shortly some of the statements made in the literature of my lionorable friends on the other side, who urged that we would introduce industrial conscription 1 would take the married men. fectly clear that when the B ritish A r m y Council told us that 16,500 recruits per month were necessary, we asked for 16,500. Likewise when we are told that 7,000 were necessary we ask for that number. W ill any honourable member say that we could have done our duty to the Empirei n any other way? must have the responsibility for carrying on the war, and by common consent it was placed in the hands of 'the War Cabinet, in whom the outer Dominions have every confidence. The War Cabinet declare how many men are wanted, and it is for us to say whether we shall grant them or not. per month from Australia, and we stated the conditions under which we hoped to secure that number. W;e exempted married men, and we said also that we would provide the labour necessary for the industries of this country. The proclamation issued by the Government, and containing its proThe Government took their own posals to meet the requirements of the War Cabinet, will stand as a monument of a democratic Government and party, endeavouring, in: the most critical juncture of the country's history, to do their duty as men intrusted by the people of a free country w i th the reins of government in tlie greatest crisis in the world's history-to Australia and the Empire. The Leader of the Opposition has The battle of the Izonzo, the spoken about this pledge or statement made by me at Bendigo, and he has said a lot ahout honour and the obligation cast on men in regard thereto. Now, let me speak plainly. As I understand the statement made at Bendigo-if honourable members like to call it a pledge I shall be glad to do so, too, but I call it a threatI said to the people, "" If you do not do so and so, then, for my part you get some one else to govern the country."" got some one else. distinct understanding Get on with your speech. son) -Order! I ask the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) not to interject. tinct understanding contained in my Bendigo speech of 5th May, and every other I want to make it perGovernment supporter save, I believe, one or two, was elected on that policy also. Those statements bind me, because the people, in consideration of such undertakings, returned me to Parliament an'd this Government to ofiice. When I made that pledge at Bendigo, what did the Government stand to gain? D i d we stand to Some one gain ofiice? No. D i d we stand to gain anything? No. We were in office with a great majority behind us; we had been elected upon a war policy that gave us a free hand to give effect to our policy on all matters except conscription. That was and still is the position. I come now to the pledge or threat. What did it mean? The Cabinet' asked for 7,000 men If my pledge meant anything, it meant that the people must choose whether they",37,Protestations Of Loyalty Albury Bitternes S Has Been Engendered

150,Mr Hughes,"I was elected on a diswould have a National party or an Official Labour party. If it did not mean that, it was a mere idle phrase. It meant, "" You must have either conscription and us or no conscription and the honourable member for Y a r r a and his party."" , The honourable member for Flinders has put the case in ithat way, and that is what it meant, and what the Government put before the people. The loss of a referendum itself has never been regarded in this counthe Nationalist party or no conscription try as a reason why a Government should go out of office. I shall come to the pledge afterwards, but, in itself, the loss of a referendum has never been so regarded. When the referendum was introduced by the Fisher Government . in 1911, and was defeated by an overwhelming majority, I never heard-and I was then in a position to hear a good deal-the faintest whisper of a suggestion from the honourable member theu colleague, that he should give, up office. Indeed, my late right honourable leader, Mr Andrew Fisher, now H i gh Commissioner, said that he would immediately introduce another referendum that would make the people f a l l down w i th f r i g h t ! Mr Ryan, the Premier of Queensland, has said that the present Government ought to leave office and allow the Official Labour party to come in . But the face of it , appear probable that he he has never paid: the slightest attention to an adverse referendum vote. will be remembered that recently Mr Ryan introduced a referendum with a view to abolishing the Upper Housei n the State of Queensland. It was defeated, but he never suggested for one moment that he should vacate office. On two occasions I have had the honour, as leader or lieutenant of the leader of the party opposite to assist in introducing referenda. On each occasion the referendum was defeated, and on neither was there a suggestion that the Government should vacate office. The only reason, then, for the Government vacating office lies in its own delibeopposite! Then His Excellency, unrate statement made to the electors at Bendigo that, if the people did not agree to the proposal made, we would not govern. The declaration at Bendigo was put forward as an inducement to the people to accept tlie. Government proposal. effect, we said this : Grant the power asked for by us, or else my friend the honourable member for Yarra( Mr. Tudor) and his colleagues will govern this country. It would have been no inducement whatever to the people of the country to say that we, the members of the present Government and of the late Government, would go out and allow eleven other men of the National party to come in and govern the Commonwealth -that would not have turned one solitary vote. The issue was-Conscriptio n and and the Official Labour party. Well, the electors rejected the proposal of the late Government, and the other day I tendered to His Excellency the Governor General the unconditional resignation of the Government. H is Excellency sent for my .honourable friend, the Leader of the Opposition. As is set out in the memorandum by the Governor General, His Excellency had no advice whatever for Yarra, my from me. If His Excellency had. chosen to entrust the Leader of the Opposition with a commission, it would have been for this House to determine whether a Government led by the honourable gentleman had the confidence of the House. I do not know whether the honourable gentleman would have accepted a commission, but, whether he would or not, unless he had a promise of a dissolution, it does not, on would have lasted very long. The honorIt able gentleman was not given a commission. H is Excellency, in a way, I think, almost unprecedented, exhausted every effort to obtain information as to the state of the House and the prospects of stable government, and he came back to N me, and asked me to accept a commission. WhatI meant by the pledge was-Tudo r or me. What my colleagues meant was-the Nationalist party or the Official Labour party. There is no way by which the Official Labour party can govern in this House while there are fiftythree men on this side not prepared to support.them, while, at the outside, there are only twenty-two men on the benches trammelled by advice from me, declined to give the Leader of the Opposition a commission, either with or without a dissolution. Therefore, the only way in which that pledge could be carried out in In a way satisfactory to my honourable friends'.was impossible for us. We had done on our part everything that could be done, and I venture to say that if eleven other men of the Nationalist party stood here in office, their position would have been no different. We should have been supporting them instead of them supporting us. Several honourable members interjecting, son) I have two or three times called for party was formed, or before it was order, and I ask the honourable member for Maribyrnong to cease his very audible conversation when I request that order shall be observed. The honourable member is not in order in (conversing and »commenting in audible tones, and thus interfering with the honourable gentleman addressing the Chair. the view of the members of the Nationalist party, and I venture to say that it is the view of the great majority of the people. In view of the fundamental differences of policy, ideal, outlook, and circumstance between the two .parties in this House, there is only one way by which the honourable Leader of the Opposition can secure a majority in this House, namely, by an appeal to the people. But His Excellency, the Governor General, in the exercise of his discresome of the statements made by contion, has, most properly, I think, refused to agree to dissolve a Parliament barely eight months old. If any man will say honestly that it is in the best interests of the country that we should have an appeal to the people-that there should 'be more turmoil and more confusion-well , then, I do not agree with him. Several honourable members interjecting, to a little consideration from honourable members opposite. other people. take a certain course, but several times I have called the House to order, and several times I have warned honourable members of what the consequences may be if my appeals are disregarded. must ask the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) to cease his interjections. No Confidence. months, we have had two referendums, a general election, and the greatest strike in the history of the Commonwealth. It is now, I think, up to us to see if it is not possible for men representing the people of Australia to come together and try' to do some work on behalf of Australia. When the Nationalist formed, the Leader of the Opposition was asked to join the party, and endeavour to create a truly National Government by including all sections of the House. He declined to do so; he would have none of it. If my friend will say to me now that he is prepared to work with this party, I , for one, will be prepared to help him. If I am the man who stands in the way, and he will only work with the National party upon the condition that I am not Prime Minister, I will stand aside if he is prepared to agree to a policy acceptable to the Nationalist party, But I adjure him, as a representative of the people-and I appeal to every man on the opposite side-to find a modus vivendi whereby we can do the work we were sent here to do, and help Australia to perform her duty during the war. Honourable members oppositeresent scriptionists during the campaign. In what better way could they confute all those who Have declared them to be disloyal, to be in favour of turmoil, to be collaborateurs of the Industrial Workers of tlie World, than by declaring that they are willing-to let bygones be bygones, and are prepared to put Australia first.'

159,Mr Hughes,"-In the last sixteenand help us to serve the best interests of Australia and the Empirei n this great National crisis. It u r n now to the second paragraph of my honourable friend's motion -whic h relates to the prosecution of public men. The Leader of the Opposition has endeavoured to persuade this House and the country that the Government has misused its great powers to prosecute individuals because of their opinions, that it has stifled freedom of speech, and that it has prevented honourable members opposite and others who tliink with them from freely putting their views before the public. What are the facts ? the world in which a man may say -what he can say in Australia to-day. In the words of Archbishop Kelly, which I quoted several times during the referendum campaign, I again say-and I say it without reference to the gentleman referred to at all-that "" if he had been in any there was not so much liberty as in Australia he would have been imprisoned long ago. been for a very long time, too. If he had been in Russia, France, or It a l y , there is no doubt he would have been condemned long ago."" There is no country in the world which has been given the opportunity of freely expressing its opinion on peace and war that is afforded in Australia. trenches, the man in the street, our women-al l sorts and conditions of people-hav e been consulted; have been given the fullest opportunity of expressing their views, and determining the policy of the country. have spoken, as I think, most unfortunately. failure is not due to the Government. It is a reflection on Democracy, and a complete condemnation of the referendum as an instrumentality of democratic government. Now let me come to the censorship, about which the honourable member complained The honourable member for Yarra affirmed that his party had not been given a fair chance. I which I issued to the Chief Censor, and which that officer carried out, and the Leader of the Opposition can find cause for complaint w i th them, he is exceedingly difficult to please. On the 24th November, the day on which I reached Sydney, I met the editors of the Sydney press. They put before me certain complaints, and I said that I would rectify them, and issue instructions which they declared would be quite satisfactory. I will read the memorandum which was forwarded to me by the Chief Censori n Sydney, Mr C. G. Nicholson. It is as follows:Enclosed are also the following proofs, showing deletions made in pursuance of instructions from head-quarters :(1) ""Married men, beware! "" (Worker, 20.11.17.) There is not a . country in (2) "" Can you trust this man? "" (Worker, 20.11.17.) (3) 'Hughes' fatal admission."" (Worker, 23.11.17.) \ (4) ""Factory Employees Union's conscription circular."" (25.11.17.) (5) "" I s conscription democratic?"" (No Conscription Council, 23.11.17.) I . understand that you instruct me not to other country where continue to make similar deletions. My record of your instructions is:Tlie Prime Minister instructs me(1) to cease deleting matter contraA n d it would have vening War Precautions Regulations (including matter prejudicial to recruiting) unless it would convey true or false naval or military information te the enemy. (2) to pass false figures and false statements, such as, "" Enougb men have already left these The very soldiers in the shores to keep the five divisions at a strength for over three years ahead."" The Prime Minister rules that the statement quoted is purely political, and defines ""political matter"" as all matter not of naval or military benefit to the enemy."" There is to be no censorship of "" political matter."" All the The people foregoing instructions are to be applied to all newspapers, without discrimination, and to all They have failed; but that leaflets, pamphlets, and other matter submitted for censorship. Willi t not be necessary to advise printers and publishers that the passing of matter by the censorship does hot protect them from liability under the War Precautions Regulations, or any other law? I understand that you do 'not instruct me to pass for publication:I. (1) Disloyal statements; or (2) Matter likely to offend an allied or neutral power. As your instructions contradict the written instructions of tbe Minister for Defence, will propose to read the instructions you please confirm my record by initialing tbe duplicate of this letter. That was minuted by me, and those in I venture to say that if structions were carried out. This memorandum was read at a subsequent meeting at whicli the editors of the Sydney newspapers were present, and those gentlemen were perfectly satisfied with them. All the prosecutions which were instituted were prosecutions for offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, and the majority of these prosecutions were for offences committed before these instructions were issued. say the memorandum I have just read is a complete answer to the charge of political censorship. It leaves no room whatever for hostile criticism, and completely sweeps away the charges thafc have been made by the Leader of the Opposition. Nowf o r another matter. The honourable gentleman has complained very bitterly of statements made by advocates of the "" Yes"" side, and has declared' that I declined to prosecute the persons who made them. I say that, in the face of the instructions which I have read, nobody was prosecuted for statements other than those calculated to mislead the elector in the exercise of his vote, and for reflections upon our Allies. Outside these two restrictions everybody -had a free hand.* The statements which are alleged to have been made by conscriptionists, and which are printed on the anti-conscriptionist leaflets, do not fall within either of these restrictions. They are statements which may be offensive to my honourable friends. When they were brought under my notice, I said that I did not approve them, and that I would give permission to anybody vvho so desired to institute a prosecution of the authors of them. I treated both sides alike. So far from, preventing my honourable friends from saying whafc they desired, I erred on tlie other side, allowing many things to be published Avhich were grossly offensive, f u l l of lying misrepresentations, and statements calculated to affect recruiting to pass unchallenged. I allowed leaflets called "" The Lottery of Death,"" '""The Blood Vote,"" "" Billy's B u l l e t in ,"" "" Conscription and its Attendant Curse,"" and another which is headed "" The Curse of Cairo,"" some excerpts from which I propose to read, to circulate freely. Everybody could say what he wished to say. Tf he made a false statement was the law to punish him. If any one can bring forward the charge that I have not prosecuted any on the "" Yes"" who made false statements, I will prosecute them now, even though they be memifr. Hughes. bers of this Government. Here is one statement made in this "" L o t t e ry of Death,"" a tissue of vile falsehoodsWhen Hughes was reproached last year with ignoring his pledge not under any circumstances to send men out of the country to fight against their will he answered with a thoroughly Prussian disregard of the binding nature of any honourable understanding I venture to "" What does it matter what we thought yesterday?"" I have never sent a man out of this country against his w ill , though I have bad the power to do it . I have not broken that pledge, if it was a pledge. I have never in my-life said, "" What does it matter what we thought yesterday ?"" It is a lie. The whole thing is a lie. But I let it go. The censor brought the pamphlnt to me and said, "" It is f u l l of lies;"" but I said, "" Leti t go."" Here is another statement prejudicial to recruiting and f u l l of lies. It is signed by S. A . Glover, Cairns, and saysWorkers of Queensland, Married Men. Nowhere is there any express exemption of married men. Married men must come forward eventually. Do not fall into the trap laid for you. Vote"" No."" Yet hundreds of thousands of proclamations were circulated throughout the country saying that married men were expressly exempted. That statement was brought to me, but it was allowed to go out. Yet, the Leader of the Opposition says that I did not give the other side f a i r play. Every man knows that, in the north of Queensland, the "" Yes "" side never had a chance to make itself heard. There is now a reign of terror in No r t h Queensland. There is a boycott. In certain districts, no small shopkeeper dare say that he was for ""Yes."" No man on the wharf dare say that he was ^ for the "" Yes "" side. Means were resorted to by the "" No"" side which prevented an expression of opinion. I was denied a hearing several times. I was met at Darlinghurst by a howling mob of men. I venture to say that there was two months' supply of recruits there, but I was not allowed to say one word. Yet there these gentlemen talk about freedom of speech. Do they say that there is no other -way of closing mouths except by side censorship?

I wish now tohas taken place, I assume that f t will be agreeable to the wishes of honourable memN bers that the time occupied by these proceedings should not be deducted from the time during which the Prime Minister is entitled to speak. took place I was dealing with the third point raised by the honourable member for Yarra in his motion, namely, the disfranchisement of Germans and the descendants of Germans. I do not for a moment assert that there are not in Australia many loyal Germans. It is a very obvious thing that we were not defeated by Germans in this campaign. If they had all voted for us their vote would not have altered the result. I entirely agree with the Leader of the Opposition that disloyal persons ought to be interned, but there are various ways of manifesting disloyalty. We were, unfortunately, faced with a situation in which the German propaganda in this country had done its work cunningly and only too well. There being a life and death struggle between Britain and Germany, we had to deal with the situation as we found it, and, while penalizing very many loyal Germans by our action, we thought that it was only right that this vote should be decided by persons of British descent. I make no apology for that. I say, again, that in no country in the world has tliere ever been such an opportunity given to the people to say whether they were for peace or for war as there was in this country, and in no other country is there such freedom of speech and action. I have dealt with the various points raised by the honourable member for Yarra in his motion, and by way of conclusion I shall briefly refer to them again, but I now come to the present situation. I find the Parliament constituted as it was upon the result of the last general election; parties in the House of Representatives stand 53 to 22, and in the Senate 24 to 12, or, as the actual results of the last Senate election showed, 18 to none. Without a fresh appeal to the people there is no possibility of a Government being carried on other than by the party commanding the majority of the Parliament. The late referendum has not and cannot, alter the state of parties in this House. We [108] » are now where we were on the evening of the 5th May. We were elected on the 5th May upon a policy, the particulars of which I shall remind honourable members of by reading an excerpt from a speech of my own on that date. I had already set fprth the position in regard to conscription which we took up at the general election. I said that we accepted the verdict of the people given on 28th October, 1916. We said that we would not introduce conscription behind the backs of the people, and, further, that. if the national safety demanded it we would bring the question before them again. I said that if the tide of battle turned against us we certainly would do so. All these pledges have been faithfully kept. We have not brought in conscription behind the backs of the people. We were , pledged, if and when the tideof battle turned against us, to bring the question of conscription again before the people, and we have done.so. We pledged ourselves to resign if the referendum was carried against us, and we have done so. Nothing will satisfy my honourable friends opposite but that they shall take possession of the Treasury benches. The pledge would have been utterly meaningless if we had said that we as an Eleven would go out and that another Eleven selected from exactly the same party, and having exactly the same policy, would come in. What sense would there have been in making such a pledge as that to the people? It was evident that the pledge as given was intended, as I repeat, to induce the people to realize the gravity of the position, and to choose between the Official Labour party without conscription or the National party with conscription. The people have chosen. The Government has resigned unconditionally. It has done all witliin its power to give effect to its pledges. The government * has to be carried on. I stand here having carried out my part of the pact; it is for this Parliament to carry out its part, and do that which it was returned to do on the 5th May. We are now in exactly the same position as we were then, having been defeated on conscription, yet having been deputed by the people to carry out a war policy. I said, on the 28th March, 1917„ It is our duty to help the Empire in the struggle. Indeed it is imperative to do so, for",47,Protestations Of Loyalty Albury Bitternes S Has Been Engendered
216,Mr Hughes,"When this incidentonly by helping the Empire can we save Australia. As I have said, tliere are many ways in which we can help the Empire-wit h men, .with money, with onr. products. As to men, now that the people have decided against compulsion, the call of duty, of patriotism, of Austhe minds of the people of Australia; but tralia, of Empire, must reach the ears of all our young men. Let them go forth and strike a blow for the land that has bred them. Let them draw the sword in defence of those liberties with which this country has so richly endowed them. Now, let me turn to other means by which Australia can aid the Empire. This war is not as other wars, merely between the armed forces of the belligerents. It is a war between nations. Every man and woman is or ought to be a fighter, struggling for his or her life. Every resource of the Empire, the services of every man' and woman able to do some useful work, are needed in order that we should be victorious. Now the most effective means by which Australia can' help the Empire, apart from sending .men to fight, is to send from her great storehousemetals for munitions and products to feed and clothe the Imperial and Allied armies and the people of Britain.

If Germany is in earnest as the Russians are to-day, endeavouring in desiring peace she can have it.

I say again, if they desire to completely collaborate with this Government let them say so, and I forone w ill 'go more than half way to meet them. For the rest, I say the honourable member's motion is one which ought not to, and will not,"" receive the support of this House. His claims to govern this country are such as not to merit the consideration of the people. He is not supported by a majority in this House or in the country. The only proof ' of his claim to have a majority in the country is that the referendum on conscription has been defeated; but on 28th October, 1916, conscription was defeated, and w it h in five months, by the greatest majorit y in the history of Australia, the National party was returned to power. We are back in the position we were in before.. The Government is in office constitutionally. The honourable member for Yarra has had his opportunity. We freely resigned Avithout any conditions. Now we are again in office, and intend to carry out the policy upon which we were elected. Mr J.' H .

Minister the fact that there had been a failure in the delivery of cornsacks. I remind the honourable gentleman that an undertaking was given to the farmers that a f u l l supply of sacks would be available in time for the harvest. orable members that, while in many'cases the contract has been f a it h f u l l y carried out, there has been wide-spread failure, involving dual purchase of sacks-on e I have purchase of old sacks at even a greater cost than new-and the dumping of wheat on the ground; indeed, in some cases there has been a complete cessation of harvesting operations. I blame no one personally, but the matter cannot be allowed to rest where it is. All sorts of excuses for the failure of the contracts have been made, and there' is, in consequence, great agitation throughout the farming community. I ask the Prime Minister to cause some inquiry to be made; and I suggest that the Prices Commissioner, who is doing his utmost under the tryin g circumstances to adjust supplies, should have within his knowledge most of the facts, and be able to place valuable information at the disposal of any Committee of Inquiry.
