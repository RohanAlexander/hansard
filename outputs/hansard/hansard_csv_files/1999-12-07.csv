The point has been made that somehow Let us deal with cakes first since we have there is a whole range of lamington stalls and heard over the last couple days that the cake stalls out there that are turning over lamington sale, the cakes that are sold at the more than $100,000.

Let me take very simply and very calmly Moreover, the sale of that cake, when it is the second issue that has been raised by the opposition: clothing.

The reality is that this debate is, can understand, is that donations are not once again, the sort of hyped-up, over-the-top subject to the GST.
