The course its available resources, to investigating only report reminds us all of the following: those matters which fall within its charter. There is a tendency in some quarters to view the authority as The National Crime Authority is empowered to an avenue for the investigation of all crime. This is investigate only that criminal activity which is cona role which the authority simply cannot fulfil. sidered 'relevant' in terms of the enabling legislation.
