The Postmaster","General whether his Department proposes to have the new Commonwealth stamp printed during the Christmas season, and that, consequently, those engaged in the work of printing will lose their Christmas holidays. I ask if there is any need for this, except to give effect to the intention of having the stamp issued on the ist January next? have been addressed to the Treasurer. I read the statement in this morning's newspapers. It is true that I have promised to have the new stamp issued on the ist January next, if possible, but it is not proposed to take away from those engaged in the work of printing it the two main holidays of the Christmas season. Personally, I am not very desirous of having the stamp issued on a particular date, and part of the issuewill, in any case, be ready on New Year'sDay. If the Treasurer concurs, I would: say that the men need not work on holidays to which they are entitled. HIGH COMMISSIONER.

It is reported in to-day's Argus that I made the statement last night that the High Commissioner is coming to Australia in March next, but I made no such statement. What happened was this: Yesterday evening a representative of the Sydney Daily Telegraph asked me whether Sir George Reid was coming to Australia in March. I told him that I had received no official intimation of the fact that he .was or that he was not coming, but that Sir George Reid had written tome a private letter stating that, for personal reasons, he would like to visit Australia during the coming year. I said that) I would make-no public statement about the matter, because it was merely a privateaffair, but I told the reporter that I had', ion. replied privately to Sir. George Reid that. I felt sure that if he desired to return to Australia on private business the Government would raise no objection. In his letter there was no statement about his wishing to come in March,.and if he comes. I think it will be considerably later in the-. year. I told the reporter that the message was a private one, and that I had no desire to announce the fact thab Sir George Reid wished to come-that I preferred, as it was a private matter, to allow Sir George to make the announcement himself..",14,Setup

It is considered that a double deduction of this kind was not contemplated, and it is proposed to amend section 34 so that where an annuitant, whose annuity is a charge, is also an owner for land tax purposes, he shall only be entitled to deduct whichever is the greater of the two deductions previously allowed. That is, the deduction in respect of the share as owner under section 38, or the deduction for the annuity charge under section 34. Clause7 amends section 35, under which equitable owners are to be assessed on the same basis as legal are original shares within the meaning of owners.

This concession has been claimed for equitable tenants for life under similar circumstances.

The High Court, in the case of Isles v. The Commissioner of Land Tax, decided that where persons are entitled to a multiple of deductions as being entitled under a will or settlement prior to ist July, 1910, then, if these persons are joint owners of land .with some other persons, these multiple deductions must be allowed in the joint assessment. This was never intended, as all joint ownerships, other than those ""falling wholly within the sections relating to these special wills and settlements, should only be entitled to a single deduction. The clause, therefore, amends sub-section 2 of section 38 to provide for a single deduction in all cases of joint ownership, except where the whole joint ownership falls within the special sections relating to wills and settlements. The clause also amends sub-section 7 of section 38 by limiting the deductions to the persons who, at the time of assessment, hold original shares under the will. This would in practice amount to all persons who hold shares under these wills or settlements, provided their shares sub-section 8 of section 38. Sub-section 7 is also amended by limiting the value of a share to the share in the unimproved value of the land after deducting from the unimproved value the value of any annuity charged on the land, as it is considered the annuity so charged represents portion of the unimproved value which does not belong to the owners. A new proviso is also added to subsection 7 to meet the case where the same persons are entitled under more than one instrument. Under the Act as it stands they are entitled to a multiple of deductions under each instrument. This was never intended to be granted, and the amendments proposed will limit the persons to one set of deductions, as it is considered equitable that a person should only receive one deduction in respect of the land or the interest in land owned by him. Sub-section 8 of this section is also amended by this clause. The amendment was inserted to meet the case of persons taking over immediately after the interest of the settler has ceased, as, for example, where the settler's wife dies in his lifetime-. It is considered equitable that the persons who succeed in remainder after the settler in such a case should be treated as the holders of original shares. Clause9 adds a new section to the Act, which deals with the case of an original will or settlement, and the beneficiaries under the original will or settlement making wills or settlements, all of which came into operation prior to ist July, 1910. Under the Act as it stands there were sets of deductions under each of these wills or settle-",16,Second Reading

It is thought that in such a case the deductions should be limited to persons who hold original shares, solely under and by virtue of the original will or settlement. Clause 10 is proposed to meet the case, of a shareholder in a company holding land where such shareholder is an absentee. At present there is no method of obtaining the tax if the shareholder does not pay, and it is proposed to make the company the agent qf such shareholder, so that the company is responsible for the payment of any tax to the extent of the assets of the shareholder, .such as dividends in the hands of the company, which can be used by the company in payment of the tax. Clause 11 adds a new section to the Act to deal with the control, use, and occupation of land without any lease or agreement for lease by persons who are not owners. It is inserted to meet the following case, which is typical: A person owns a large quantity of land. There is also land in his wife's name, his niece's name, and his secretary's name, but the land is all stocked by the land-owner's sheep, and controlled and managed by him. It is considered that in such a case the landowner is. virtually the owner of all the land, and should be treated as the lessee for land tax purposes.

A man is ostensibly the owner of a large estate, but has a heavy mortgage upon it, and under the existing Act he gets no consideration at all for the amount of the mortgage. In New South Wales, under the old Land Tax Act, provision was made for the exemption from taxation of the amount of a mortgage. I should like the Attorney-General to state whether this Bill interferes with the right of each of several beneficiaries under a will which was executed before the ioth June, 1909, to get an exemption, or whether it alters the Act in such a way that joint owners, although they are beneficiaries under a will, can receive one exemption only of ^5,000. I am inclined to think that it does not The honourable member will see that under . section 43 the liability of primary and secondary taxpayers is set out.

When an amending Bill is being ^passed, consideration should undoubtedly be given to the cases of these persons to whom I am referring. difficulty, I think. hear that, but I hope it will. Bill is to adjust the inequitable incidence of sub-sections 1 and 2 of section 27 ire regard to the exemption permitted under section 43. I cannot fully explain the position while the honourable member is addressing the House. that. If the Attorney-General wishes to speak, I shall not continue my remarks. . Instead of this Bill making the law more simple, it is making it more technical and more difficult to deal with. There can be no more debatable point.than that which arises in connection with the proposal to add at the end of the definition of "" Value of improvements "" the wordsProvided that the added value shall in no case exceed the amount that should reasonably be involved in bringing the unimproved value of the land to its improved value as at the date of assessment. It is well known that there are, in Australia, large areas of land that were cleared -in the old days at much cost. In arriving at its unimproved value one has only to secure the evidence of those who knew it in its natural state, and are familiar-with its condition at the present time. I fail -to understand how the Minister will be able to administer this particular provision. The improvements made on many holdings, especially in my electorate, would cost 50 per cent, more to make to-day than they did originally. This provision will cut both ways, but instead of making the administration of the Act easier I am confident-and I speak as one who .knows a good deal of the land question-that it will lead to still further complications. Another difficult problem remains to be solved in connection with the question of leases. Clause4 provides for the repeal of section 27 of the principal Act, and the insertion in its stead of a new clause dealing with "" the owner of a leasehold estate in land."" The Attorney-General will have to make a little plainer the intentions of the Government. The proposed new clause, as it stands, might include any lease. It speaks of "" the owner of a leasehold estate,"" but there is nothing to show whether the reference is merely to a Crown lease or to leases of all kinds. As it stands the provision might bring within the scope of the principal Act a number of leases to which at present it does not apply. It will be necessary for the Attorney-General to place in the Bill a clear definition of the term "" the owner of a leasehold estate in land."" Difficulties are also likely to arise in regard to the amendment of that part of the Act which relates to joint-owners. It is a great hardship that partners, working two estates as one, and so securing greater economy in management, should have to deal separately with them. This will be an incentive to men to evade the law. The Bill has been in our hands for only half-an-hour, and yet, within that short space of time, we have been able to discover in it several matters that will need to be remedied. Another provision which requires to be closely examined is that contained in proposed new section 42A which declares thatWhere land is occupied, controlled or used by a person who is not the owner, and there is no lease or agreement for a lease for a definite term in respect of the occupancy, control, or user of the land, the person occupying, controlling, or using the land shall be deemed to be the lessee for life of the land Will the provision, as to joint-owners, apply to properties owned by a man and his wife or his children and worked as one? In Australia a married woman is allowed, and rightly so, to hold land in her own right, and very often to secure greater economy, husband and wife work their properties as one.

63,Mr Livingston (Barker) [11.10],"it will be impossible to do so. Joint properties will have to be divided; the stock -of the husband and the wife will have to -be branded differently, and a great deal of -unnecessary expense will be involved. The Attorney-General, instead of assisting the taxpayers of Australia by passing this Bill, will add. to their difficulties, and be guilty -of a very serious blunder. Proposed new -section 42A will certainly lead to trouble -in the country, and anything that will imake trouble should be avoided. VVe were promised a concise amending Bill that would make much clearer the position in regard to the joint ownership of land, and .also as regards the improvements on land. ""That promise has not been fulfilled. It -seems to me that we require an improved -system of dealing with the lands of Australia for taxation purposes. It would be much better for the Government to bring in :a simple measure to deal with the lands as -they are to-day, separating rural from town 'lands, and imposing a very much smaller ;tax on land values. <under the Constitution to do that. -will be found that we have not the power to enact some of these provisions. I am -confident that they will lead to a great -deal of trouble, and I am sure that the bonorable member has no desire that the people of Australia should be unnecessarily harassed. The two clauses to which I have referred, instead of assisting the land-owners, will hamper them, and will -also hamper the operations of the Commissioner and the land tax assessors. At -this stage of the session we cannot devote to the consideration of this Bill the time that we ought to give to it. I know that the Prime Minister desires to be fair, and I think that he should at least postpone the further consideration of this measure until printed copies of the statement made 'by him have been distributed amongst honourable members, <and time Was been given us to carefully study the proposed provisions. I do not pretend to understand the technical portions of this Bill. reason I have not had time to look into them, and it would involve some hours of study to grasp what is intended, and what ""the Bill really provides. matters . in connection with this question that I desire to emphasize. In the first place, we have in this Bill a complete departure from the principle underlying unimproved land value taxation. Roughly speaking, the basis upon which we work in estimating the unimproved value of a property is to imagine it in its unimproved state, and to consider what price it would bring in that state at the time that the assessment was. made. Here, however, we ha.ve a complete departure from that principle. Under clause i it proposed to establish a new basis of valuation, as ihe result of which the effect of the improvements is not to be taken into consideration, only the bare monetary cost. That is most unfair. It will lead to a considerable increment in the taxable value of many holdings, and will work out most unjustly. Take the case of the country in which there are artesian bores. A man might be fortunate enough by sinking once to strike a good supply of artesian water, and the value added to his land by that improvement would be very great. Another man might have to bore four or five times before striking an adequate supply, but while the added value to his property would be only the value of one good bore, he would have been at the expense of putting down four or five bores to secure it. I suppose that, taking things by and large, the added value of the property of land-holders in Australia is about what has been expended in the improvements, but it is clear that in certain cases it may be much less or more. assessment higher than the sale value. ber should know that the basis on which the assessments are made is not the sale value at all, but the unimproved value, and I say that this Bill proposes a complete departure from the principles of unimproved value taxation. The object is to get at the taxpayer to a greater extent than it has been possible to do under the existing law. I take the case of a man who runs the risk of taking up swamp land, which, unimproved, may be valued at ios. For one an acre.

We ought not to have in Australia in time of need the bungles that have characterized many of the wars in which Great Britain has been concerned, where many valuable lives have been lost before things were got into working order. That kind of thing was due to inefficient officers. shortage of rifle ranges. -the difficulty arises in connection with the supply of ammunition and rifles, and from general inattention; in fact, the clubs are humbugged all the time. When a rifle range has been selected locally, an officer inspects, and approves, and it is gazetted, but that is the last heard of the matter. It would appear as though nothing short of dynamite would shift some of the officials. I agree in a great measure with what has been said in regard to the disabilities under which the rifle clubs suffer in the delay in granting facilities, supplying targets ammunition, and so forth and it is cerin tainly a great pity that the Department cannot make more adequate provision for essential training in shooting. At the same time there is something more important even than straight shooting, namely, drill and discipline. My idea is that if a simple cheap uniform were supplied, the members of rifle cluhs would be quite willing to undergo a certain amount of drill. efficiency of a large body of men who would prove a valuable adjunct of our Defence Forces in case of emergency. There are other matters to which I desire to call attention; and one is the system adopted in the purchase of remounts.

96,Mr Ryrie,"The censuring.pf thesecommenced at a camp at Glen Innes, where there was some trouble about the return of a horse, which had been wrongly described as private property or something of that sort. A Board of Inquiry was instituted to inquire into the whole matter of the purchase of remounts, with Colonel Lee as President, but that Board failed to find out anything wrong with the particular horse I have mentioned. It appears that the whole thing arose from a clerical error. As a result of the inquiry, however, the omcers have been censured, though I venture to say that none of them could be held in any way responsible. The blame for the present state of affairs in consponsible at all. I do not wish to men-' nexion with the remount depot lies entirely with the Department, which has absolutely failed in its administration, and pursued a foolish policy in connection with the purchase of horses. No advice was asked from officers who had had experience in connection with horses, but, as is always the case, the militia officers were absolutely the horses were scampering all over the ignored, and men were sent out indiscriminately to buy horses at high prices until something like 900 had been obtained. This gave rise to some difficulty, because they could not all be stable fed, and in New South Wales two depots were provided, one at Chipping Norton, and another at Cunninghame. months the horses became hide-bound, and got, generally, into a bad condition. I went myself to see them at Chipping Norton and Cunninghame, and, in my opinion, it is absolutely wrong that over Jl 10,000 worth of horses should be left in the charge of a sergeant, with one non-commissioned officer and two privates to assist him. No doubt Farrier-Sergeant Kelly is doing his best with the material at his disposal, but the responsibility is.too much for one man. It is absolutely ridiculous to hold the other officers responsible. The whole trouble occurred before-Colonel Wallack took over the position of State Commandant. It occurred during the term of the previous State Commandant, so that to censure Colonel Wallack is absolutely ridiculous. The same remark applies to Major Darvall. Captain Lyons is a very busy officer indeed, and to expect him to be responsible for the conduct of a remount depot at Liverpool is really ridiculous. He is staff officer for supply and transport, and any one who is acquainted with military duties knows that such an officer has very many onerous duties to perform. Captain Lyons Mr Ryrie. is diligent, painstaking, and most conscientious at his work, and it was a cruel act indeed that he should be severely censured by the Minister of Defence, simply because the Department blundered, in rushing wildly into a scheme of purchasing horses. No provision was made for properly looking after the horses, and they got into a bad condition. erected for feeding the horses, but they certainly were not in good condition. Colonel Wallack and Major Darvall were not retion the names of those who were. During the term of other officers a most scandalous state of affairs obtained at the remount depot. A man, called de Lampy, was put on, and it was found that, instead of being a horse-breaker, he was a horse-spoiler. The men at the camp got blind drunk, and place. do that twice? it for a considerable time. The result of the scandalous state of affairs was that, when the horsei were wanted in camp, they 1 In the winter were absolutely unfit to perform the duties required of them. A horse has to be in very good condition, and to have his shoulders seasoned to be able to do the work in connection with the guns. It is very heavy work-wor k which tries the shoulders of even a seasoned horse to a very great extent. When the horses were taken into camp from the remount depot they were not serviceable. Several men were injured in trying to make use of half-broken horses^-som e of them were worse than colts. A half-broken horse is worse than a green horse. I would sooner take a horse that has never been handled than have a half-broken horse. Halfbroken horses were expected to do the work at the Easter camp in Sydney, with the result that men were injured, and the work was not done. The transport people refused to use the horses, and a report was made. That is simply the result of the Department rushing wildly into a policy of purchasing horses before they knew exactly what they were going to do with them. My idea of arranging for the upkeep of remounts and gun-horses for use is that they should be let out to reputable firms of carriers and vanmen, under an agree-",24,Defence Department

The horses of a reputable firm of carriers are generally a credit to them, being always in good condition. the horses. ber mean to tell me that men would not be prepared to take remount horses, subject to the condition of feeding them, and only having to give them up when required for a camp or gun practice? I believe that on those conditions we could let out as manyhorses as we liked. to other carriers who had to buy their horses ? I do not see that any unfairness would come in. terest on the money which other men have laid out. the question. If we can in that way obtain serviceable horses for military purposes without cost, it would be a public benefit. The only other way in which to obtain serviceable horses would be to stable, feed, and work them all the year. Suppose that we had the best remount depot in the world, with grass up to the knees of the horses. At camp time, the horses would be rolling fat, and as regards guns, absolutely useless. If a horse rolling in fat is given a hard day with a gun, his shoulders are wrung to pieces. which to have a horse serviceable for military purposes is to corn-feed him, and keep him in constant work. His shoulders must be seasoned. Chipping Norton. too. There was not very much grass, but they were on the grass, and at the same time they were fed in troughs in paddocks. It is hot satisfactory, I hold, to buy horses without making provision for their proper upkeep. I do not think that we are effecting any saving. I believe that the censure of the officers which has resulted from the adoption of that policy is a very serious matter indeed. Is the Minister prepared; to give the officers an opportunity of clearing themselves before a Board of Inquiry? It is only fair, I think, that such an opportunity should be afforded. Nodoubt, the whole trouble is the fault of the Department. Captain Lyons has been sent, here from New South Wales, presumably through this business, though, of course, he might have been sent over in any caseHowever, he has been sent to this State,, and told Jbhati f he does not display morediligence during the next six months, and attend more carefully to his duties, he will be retired.

123,The Chairman,"The honorableten months. ThenI received a notification that the range was ready for use, and a month later I was notified that it was closed altogether, and that the State Government had resumed it. I asked the Minister to make some arrangements for the members of rifle clubs at Granville and Auburn, who were compelled to go to Randwick for practice, and very frequently were not allowed to use the rifle range there, because the regular forces were in possession. Arrangements were made for the members of those clubs to go to Baulkham Hills, in the Parramatta district, but they found matters there in a worse state than they were at Randwick, and that there was no room for them. The Home Affairs Department tried to get an additional two acres for the range, and the matter was hung up for five months. I was requested to apply to the State authorities. I interviewed the State Minister, and I was informed that they were waiting for one of the State surveyors to deal with the matter, but the remark was made, "" Why do you wait for the State surveyor? Why do you not send your own surveyor? nothing to do with us."" On inquiry I found that there was no need to wait for the State surveyor. RecentlyI was informed that these 2 acres have been resumed, but no arrangements have been made for the members of the Granville and Auburn rifle clubs to practice regularly at a range. The members of the rifle clubs. assert that the Defence Department does not want rifle clubs, and, judging by the action of the Department, I honestly believe that everything is being done to discourage the clubs. We are assured from time to time that additional money is provided on the Estimates, but the rifle clubs do not get the benefit of it. Minister to adopt would be to abolish rifle clubs altogether, rather than continue the present condition of affairs. As regards the remounts at Liverpool, I must say that that Liverpool business is altogether a disgusting one. The area over which they manoeuvre is not our own property, and some inquiry is absolutely necessary into fhe conduct of those officers who deal with the remounts. Although the Department has 500 horses of its own, when the authorities want horses -for convoy purposes they find their own horses useless, and have to appeal to private people for the loan of horses. In one case a man's horse was borrowed and was used for helping these broken-down horses in the remount department. The horse was killed, and when the man applied for compensation the officers disclaimed any responsibility in connection with the matter. The officers simply swept the man on one side, and said that when he went into the service, and his horse was hired, they did not undertake any responsibility.'. The Department is altogether lax in dealing with the action of these military officers who go down into the manceuvreing area and cut people's fences, and use their horses, and do not accept any responsibility. member mean to say that they cut people's fences and use their horses without authority ? and let stock out of the paddocks. For instance, when a troop of cavalry is within 20 or 30 yards of a gateway the members of the troop simply cut the fences and let out the farmer's stock, and if anything is said the officers draw attention to a reI t has gulation which states that all estimates of damage have to be lodged within twenty four hours. I have known cases where farmers have not been able to round up the cattle and horses which have been let out by these military johnnies in less than a week. An inquiry ought to be held, and not only should these officers be summoned, but the people aggrieved ought to be allowed to state their grievances before the authority appointed to inquire.

He has lost his horse, and if the Defence Department is responsible for the loss it ought to pay him. The twisting of words is no satisfaction to this man, who has been deprived in this way of his means of livelihood, and I hope that the Department will see that he is given a fair deal. I listened with regret to the remarks made this morning by the honourable member for North Sydney, whom I regard as an authority on military matters, and who, I feel confident, would not make any statement that he could not substantiate. As to the purchase of horses for military purposes, I can only say that the officer commissioned to make purchases in South Australia did very good work. . He visited Mount Gambier, and made there some excellent purchases. He is a good judge of horseflesh, and I am glad that the Commonwealth has such a man to look after its interests in this respect. If he were sent to Sydney, the honourable member would have no cause to complain of military ""crocks,"" or Liverpool mongrels. horses were inferior. I spoke only of their condition. who have had experience in dealing with horses know that a horse taken from the back country, and yarded or stabled, does very badly for a time, no matter how carefully he is looked after. At the end of a month, however, it will begin to pick up, and, if properly looked after, will soon rewould get more than was paid for it. The gain its condition. A report was presented to the last Government pointing out that it would be well if the horses required for military purposes were leased to butchers, bakers, and other tradesmen, who would keep them in work. In that way, the Government would make a very handsome profit, but care would have to be taken to lease the horses only to men who were known to be careful. Horses which have been turned out for some months are unfit, when brought in, for military work. They get sore backs and shoulders, and are so restive that they would not stand fire. In the South African war, it was clearly proved that London omnibus horses and others that had been in constant work were the best for field artillerv purposes. Horses is to be greatly regretted that the historic need to be exercised. I saw a man running a horse round in a circle the other day, and was told that he was giving it exercise. We could secure exercise for our military horses by leasing them to tradesmen. The charge made by the honourable member for Nepean that military men in New South Wales cut down fences, and allowed stock to wander, is a very serious one. I am sure that the Minister will see that a stop is put to that sort of thing, for its continuance would soon bring our military system into disrepute In South Australia we have had no cause for any complaint of the kind. Our military men are most careful, and we are always pleased to see them. We look to our military officers to set an example to the young men of Australia, whom they are training. We expect them to train them in the way they should go, but they certainly ought not to train them to go through other people's fences. I agree that the Department of Defence has been very dilatory in providing rifle ranges in various districts. The people of Mount Gambier, until recently, had been without a rifle range for over two years. About two years ago, I offered for competition amongst our riflemen a really good three-year-old horse, but, owing to the want of a rifle range, not a shot has yet been fired for it. All there ? that the Minister has just purchased at a', very reasonable price a piece of land eminently suited for the purposes of a rifle range. It is close to the town, and if the Department wished to sell it to-morrow, it Minister and Senator McGregor intend to visit Mount Gambier early next year, and 1 am sure that they will be pleased with the bargain that has been made, and that the Government will never think of parting with it. I wish now to refer to the action of the Department in doing away with the kilts. member will not be in order in discussing that question, since he alreadv has on the business-paper a notice of motion dealing with it. may discuss the question, I should like to move that the item be reduced by £ 1 .

He has on the business-paper a notice of motion dealing with it, and has been promised, an opportunity to discuss it. I shall bow to your ruling. I hope I shall scon have an opportunity to deal with the matter, which, in my opinion, is of great importance to the people of this counthe defence of the Commonwealth as may try. The kilts were done away with in 1715, and I am. satisfied that if they are done away with again in 1912 they will later on be restored. Mr W. J. JOHNSON (Robertson) [12.40] -It is my duty to my electorate to reiterate the statements which have been made by several honourable members with respect to the dilatoriness of the Defence Department in providing rifle ranges for the country districts. As the honourable member for -Nepean has said we are told from time to time by the Minister representing the Minister of Defence that greater provision to meet the requirements of rifle clubs is being made, but I find that whilst a vote of ^17,820 appears upon the Estimates for this year for rifle clubs and rifle ranges the vote submitted last year for the same purpose was ^22,900. This represents a very considerable reduction in this particular vote, though we should perhaps take into consideration the fact that last year only ^11,400 of the amount voted was spent. I fail to understand why money which has been appropriated by Parliament for this purpose and placed at the disposal of the Defence Department is not spent when there is such pressing need for the expenditure. for expenditure in connection with the professional branches of the service and under the control of the tall poppies, who wander round the cities in the gay unidesire opportunities for rifle practice, and forms which the honourable member for North Sydney so much admires, are spent to the last farthing. These people appear to be able to find a way to spend all the money placed at their disposal. My predecessor in the representation of occasion frequently to bring under the notice of the Department the need of providing the residents of Gulgong with a rifle range. For many years the men in that part of the country enjoyed the advantages of a range, which for some reason or other was subsequently condemned. For nearly four years now the matter of providing a new range has been the subject of negotiations between the member representing the district and the Department. I regularly receive communications informing me that the matter is still receiving consideration. The members of rifle clubs have displayed their anxiety to acquire such a measure of efficiency for be acquired by undrilled men, and yet the Department seems to be unable to spend the money made available by Parliament for the establishment of rifle ranges to enable' them to acquire, proficiency in rifle shooting. I should say we have no lack of range inspectors. I believe that the money spent in obtaining reports with regard to the Gulgong rifle range from range inspectors would be more than sufficient to establish the range. Mudgee, which is the centre of the Robertson electorate, is the centre also for a large number of rifle clubs that have been formed into a district association. Each year an annual shoot takes place at Mudgee for a considerable amount of prize money, 75 per cent, of which is contributed by the residents of the district, the funds being supplemented by .subsidies under departmental regulations. During the present year and the year immediately preceding it the departmental contributions have been curtailed in the most cheese-paring manner. The Mudgee District Rifle Association greatly wish to increase the number of competitors at their annual meetings, and have made frequent requests to the Department for the establishment of new ranges in the district. We have urged for three years or more the establishment of I have noticed that votes ranges at Uhlan, Windeyer, and other places in the district, but the applications have been hung up, and matters are entirely unsatisfactory to the people who to myself as representative of the district. I may be allowed to say that, .so far as Gulgong is concerned, the Department may be said to have acted generously towards the local rifle club, because the yearly reports show that during the last four years every member of the club has been the Robertson electorate had recorded as efficient, the subsidy has been regularly paid on behalf of the Government, and regular supplies of ammunition have been .sent for the use of the members,",29,Defence Department

139,Mr Livingston,"Very well, sir;though not a single shot has been fired during the whole of the time. Honourable members will agree that that is a deplorable state of affairs. The honourable member for North Sydney drew attention to the fact that certain high military officials have been censured by the Ministei of Defence. I feel sure that there must have been some grave reason to induce the Minister to take that course. to know that there is a report against them? Mr W. J. JOHNSON -They certainly should. It becomes a serious matter when the Minister of Defence finds himself called upon to severely censure persons holding such high and responsible positions in the service. If such men are guilty of acts which merit censure so severe, we can have little reason to hope for good behaviour and discipline in the lower ranks of the service. I wish at the same time to say that there was no necessity for the honourable member for North Sydney to exaggerate the matter, as I think he did when he informed the Committee, that Colonel Wallack had been censured. It appears to me that whenever the professional soldier requires anything to be done, and money is available for the purpose, that money is readily expended. I trust that the same policy will be applied to rifle ranges and rifle clubs, so that we may have the benefit of the voluntary services of men who are prepared to do something to defend Australia out of pure love for their country. I wish to say a word or two in regard to rifle clubs. ' I know that in this matter each clubs is becoming an annual one. Up to honourable member has his own grievance. Personally I usually endeavour to obtain redress of complaints received in this connection by going direct to the Department. 1 know that some of the difficulties associated with rifle ranges are due to the trouble which is experienced in obtaining suitable sites. opinion which I have heard in ""this Chamber ever since I have been a member of it lead me to believe that the Defence Department does not regard rifle clubs as being of very much importance. general in all electorates. military expert, but I did follow with close interest the memorable campaign in South Africa. The incidents connected with that campaign illustrated that it was the men who could ride and shoot who were able to put up such a good showing. Nobody will suggest that the Boers were pastmasters in the art of drilling. But they could ride and shoot, and we know the performances which they put up against the greatest army which could be placed in the field against them. I think that the Minister has a right to ask why it is that large sums can be expended in other directions, whereas the money provided for rifle clubs is not expended? I do not agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that we should begin by supplying members of rifle clubs with uniforms. I hold that we should commence by supplying them with rifles. Throughout my own district there are bands of young men who are enthusiastic in their desire to become expert marksmen, but who were discouraged from doing so The Defence Department applies a cheese-paring policy to our rifle clubs. 1 hope that the Honorary Minister will impress upon the Minister of Defence the necessity for giving earnest consideration to this matter during the recess. If ever an enemy lands in Australia a guerilla warfare will have to be conducted, and we shall have to depend -no t upon the men who look the nicestbut upon the men who can ride and shoot. I hope that the money we are now voting for rifle clubs will be spent, and that those clubs will be provided with more ammunition and more encouragement to enter competitions with a view to becoming proficient marksmen. -The question of the treatment of our rifle the present they have not received the consideration which they ought to receive, in view of the great fighting force which their members would supply in time of national emergency. It is the men who can find the target under all sorts of conditions But the expressions of whom we want to encourage, and I am sorry to say that hitherto they have received little consideration from the Defence Department. I agree with the honourable member for Corangamite that it is much more essential that the members of our rifle clubs should be supplied with up-to-date complaint is rifles and with ammunition to enable them to become efficient marksmen than that they should be supplied with uniforms.

I am glad to say that the question of defence has always been above party considerations. I hope we shall obtain from the Minister representing the Minister of Defence something much more definite than we have hitherto done. There is a belief that the Military Board and certain of our permanent officers are not favourably disposed towards our rifle clubs. is the slightest justification for that suspicion. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.30 p.m. a long while past, the complaint has been made that the rifle clubs do not receive from the Defence Department the consideration that is their due, and many of their members are of the opinion that there is a feeling on the part of some in authority that the clubs are not required. I do not say that such a feeling exists, but I hope that when we come to vote for rifle clubs the Honorary Minister will state definitely that the clubs are to be treated very differently in the future. The complaint of want of consideration does not come from one club or from one electoral division, but from all parts of the Commonwealth. All the members of these clubs are fair, and the majority of them are good rifle shots, and they deserve more consideration. The Department could have done more in the way of providing rifle ranges, but often the reasons for not acceeding to fair requests have been little better than mere, excuses. It is not in the interest of the Department that things should continue as they are. I hope that by a motion for the reduction of the vote by JQI, action will be taken by the Committee which will impress upon the Minister the. need for treating the clubs better. member for Hindmarsh is so blinded with I protest against the manner in which these Estimates have been put before us. The Defence Department is the greatest spending Department of the Commonwealth. Its expenditure in these Estimates amounts to ^2,500,000. Yet they are put before us without the slightest explanation of many important changes that are being made, and no doubt the effort will be made to push them through in one sitting without affording information to honourable members and to the country. My view is that Estimates should be discussed early in the session, and that members should have the [260] fullest and most complete explanation of proposed changes of policy. The Honorary Minister is always ready to give fair answers to questions, and he knows that there is nothing personal in my suggestion that the Department should be represented in this House by its Minister. Ifc is not right that the head of such an enormous spending Department should hold a seat in the Senate. The Honorary Minister is always ready to afford what information is in his power, but he cannot be held responsible for the administration of the Department. It should be .one of the first duties of the Government, whatever Government may be in power at the beginning of next Parliament, to re-allot portfolios so that the great spending Departments shall all be represented by Ministers in this Chamber, which alone controls the fate of Ministries. I complain that there is a statement in to-day's newspaper of a change of policy about which Parliament has not been informed. Almost always Parliament is informed of the intentions of Ministries only by press statements, about which one member or another asks the Minister responsible if they are correct. In to-day's newspaper it is stated that cadets who have failed to attend drills will be confined in barracks. Compulsory training is essential to our defence system, and we should know what this change means. Is it intended to bring from remote districts, and to imprison in the barracks in the larger centres, boys who have failed to attend the necessary number of drills? The centres in which there are barracks are few. ber knows that what he suggests is not intended, but he thinks that if he puts the worse construction on the action of the Minister he must be doing right. party prejudice that he fails to recognise fair criticism. If only those boys who live in centres where there are barracks are to be punished, three-fourths of the cadets will go unpunished. Either the Government intend to punish only those boys who reside in districts where there are barracks, or boys are to be brought from long distances to be imprisoned in barracks. We should have had a statement from the Minister on this important matter; the press should not be used as a vehicle for conveying information while Parliament is in session. The Minister should have made",31,Defence Department

148,Mr Mcwilliams,"The honorablea statement in his place in the Senate, and rhe Honorary Minister should, at the same time, have made the same statement here. I hope that the latter will inform us of the exact intention of the Minister. If the compulsory system is to be universal, means must be provided for compelling boys to attend the specified drills. At preinterested in rifle shooting, and was the sent the boys are practically volunteers, bemanager of a property held by a Melcause, although they may be fined for nonattendance, no provision is made for recovering the fines. We should be informed whether imprisonment in barracks is to be made a universal punishment, or whether it is to be a punishment inflicted only in the larger centres. Our expenditure on defence amounts to £ 1 per head for every 'man, woman, and child, in Australia, and the country should know what the intentions of the Government are in defence matters. The action of the Government in forcing through the Estimates in the last week of the session will not redound to their credit. We are not being treated fairly in connection with these Estimates. We can only endeavour to obtain information when the Estimates are before us, and now, in the last two or three days of a dying Parliament, we find that our endeavours are in vain. -As the representative of a large country division, -I have much sympathy with the criticism that has been levelled at the 1 Administration, particularly in connection with rifle clubs. In my electorate there are a number of farming centres and towns of varying sizes, where there is a genuine desire to establish such clubs, and where the very best material can be obtained for the ourpose. The young men would willingly devote their spare time to rifle practice, not only with a view to exercise, but with a view to making themselves efficient for the defence of the country. One of the great obstacles is that these clubs cannot carry on their work until sites have been provided for rifle ranges; and there would seem to be almost insurmountable difficulties in this direction. difficulty is in getting the right of occupancy of Crown lands from the State Departments, but exactly where this trouble arises I am not prepared to say. informed that the delay and trouble are so considerable that, as a rule, it is found preferable to deal with private landowners, although the State Governments ought to be as keenly interested in defence as is the Commonwealth. As to private land-owners, the Defence Department very properly requires that the leases shall extend over such a term as will enable the Government to recoup themselves for the necessary expenditure. In the early stages of my experience, a gentleman who was bourne syndicate, agreed, I presume, with the consent of his principals, to make a suitable area available for the purposes of a range. The offer was accepted, and considerable expenditure was incurred by the Department. Some little time afterwards, however, another manager was appointed who did not take the same keen interest in rifle shooting as did his predecessor, and he was of opinion that the company would receive greater benefits by the utilization of the land for grazing purposes. He, therefore, ignored the original arrangement; and it looked as though the expenditure would prove to have been thrown away, when the company agreed to extend the lease, reserving to itself some grazing privileges that had hitherto been enjoyed by the club. This case shows, of course, that there must be a definite agreement with private owners; and it is here that another difficulty arises. Land-owners very often intimate that they are willing to make land available, but when they are presented with an agreement, in full legal phraseology, they become afraid and withdraw from their undertaking. member would not wonder at that if he saw some of the agreements. there is something in that suggestion; the phraseology is not only very legal, but some of the conditions do not seem to be quite necessary in the case of land leased for rifle shooting. At any rate, it often happens that, when all the preliminary negotiations have been completed, the -signatures are withheld. There is considerable ground for complaint, because of the The first fact that the Department adheres much too firmly to red-tapeism. If an officer is sent out to inspect a site, and does not approve of it, ho will not, under existing condiI am tions, consent to inspect any other sites there may be in the neighbourhood, on the ground that these latter are not included in his instructions. That being so, if a site is adversely reported upon, the whole of the business has to be begun de novo..",32,Defence Department
149,Mr Thomas Brown (Calare) [2.45].,,33,Defence Department
150,Mr Mcwiluams,The honourable,33,Defence Department
151,Mr Thomas Brown,"I thinkI f the Department were run on business lines an inspection officer would not limit himself to one particular site, but would turn his attention to any other available areas that there might be in the neighbourhood. In one such case, those interested in the club we're most anxious to have an inspection made of some other site, but the officer absolutely refused to go outside his instructions. That seems to me to be a weak spot in the administration; and it would be better if a little common sense and elasticity were introduced into the business. officers are not to blame-that if they went outside their instructions they might be open to censure at the hands of their superiors -bu t there is no doubt that some latitude should be allowed to men intrusted with such, duties. There are other little troubles and difficulties that arise. For instance, in one case, the site offered had some advantages, but because a track had been made across it by some of the local residents, there was great difficulty in arriving at any finality in the negotiations; and I believe, though I am not quite sure, that that site had to be abandoned. The young men start these clubs with great enthusiasm, but the delays and other troubles have a very damping and depressing influence. Very often by the time the Department is in a position to offer a site the enthusiasm has altogether disappeared, 1 and it would seem as though the Department set out to test the genuineness of the desire of the promoters of the club by delay and worry. rifle clubs in a citizen force cannot be overestimated. It is well known that the more highly-drilled sections of the British Army showed deficiency in shooting in the South African war, and that it was just in shooting that the greater efficiency of the raw Boer soldiers was displayed. That war taught us to some extent a lesson; but, as I say, the delays and difficulties are great dampers on the progress of this branch of our defence system. The Department will be well advised to eliminate a great deal of red-tape, and thus simplify the process of forming rifle clubs. The Australian Light Horse is a very important branch of our Defence Forces; but the policy of the Department in the past has been to limit the corps to the big cities and the coastal districts. communication objections are raised on the par of officers to the encouragement of [260]2 the formation of corps of light horse. It is in the country districts-o n the stations and farms where many of the young men practically live in the saddle-that the best material can be obtained, and not in the cities, where bank clerks and others only devote a small part of their spare time to riding exercise. If this reluctance to permit the formation of corps has anything to do with the somewhat expensive equipment, something might be done in the way of creating a Scout adjunct. Of course, it is likely that the for the equipment. stand that the expense is one ot the objections urged against the establishment of these corps. able member would find that the men themselves pay most of the expense. that the men contribute very liberally, but that the Department has to make certain contributions which are pleaded as an excuse for not extending this arm of the Forces. In back-bush districts, we might allow corps of bushmen to be formed, and these men might become thoroughly efficient for defence purposes without involving the Commonwealth in any large expenditure. The officials of the Department know that several residents of Condobolin went to the South African war, and when they came back formed a light horse corps. For several years they tried in vain to obtain The value of recognition from the Department, and ultimately they enrolled themselves as members of a mounted rifle club. Our regulations should be more elastic, and the Department should be able to look with a more kindly eye upon bodies of men who are willing to give their services to the country under conditions which will involve little or no outlay. In connection with out cadet system, the weak point is that the officers who have been placed in charge of the various divisions are not paid sufficient to enable them to devote the whole of their time to the important work of training cadets. They have to devote the greater part of their time to private business, and give only odds and ends to public business. One of the results is that the cadets have to be trained at inconvenient Even where there is railway times, and, in view of the partial service rendered, the divisions are in many cases too large.

Mr VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) {3.15] -It is with regret that I have to move That the Committee dissent from the Chairman's ruling that it is not permissible, in discussing the Estimates, to refer to a matter which is the subject of a notice of motion on the business-paper and relating to the same subject. I take this step to protect the rights of honourable members, believing that a very serious situation has arisen. I recognise that, in order to expedite business, as well as for personal considerations, it is sometimes just as well to accept a ruling, even if we disagree with it. But the ruling just given by you, sir, affecting, as it does, the right of honourable members to discuss on the Estimates matters of administration affecting the Department to which they relate, raises a very serious question. Under your ruling, sir, the discussion of the administration and expenditure of the various Departments could be absolutely blocked by notices of motion relating to them being placed on the business-paper. That, I am sure, was never intended, and I feel confident that standing order 117 is not capable of the interpretation which you have placed upon it. Its wording is clear and explicit. The honourable member, in dealing with this question, did not attempt to move a motion, or an amendment, anticipating any motion of which notice had been given, so that standing order 117 could not possibly apply. The honourable member was merely following what has been the invariable practice-of discussing, on the first item in these Estimatesj any administrative matter affecting the Department to which they relate. This is the only opportunity that we have to deal with such matters, and I submit that everything relating to the Department of Defence and its administration can be discussed on the Estimates now before us. It is not necessary that an item should be specifically mentioned in the Estimates in order that an honourable member may be allowed to deal with it. If , for instance, the Minister of Defence had, by some administrative act, brought discredit upon his Department, we should be allowed to discuss his a 1 action, although there was not on the Estimates any item relating to it. Standing order 274 deals with the question from another stand-point. It provides thatNo member shall digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion; noi anticipate the discussion of any other subject which appears on the notice-paper. The honourable member was not accused of digressing from the subject-matter under discussion, nor was he guilty of any digression. He was dealing with a question of administration, which is certainly the subject of a notice of motion on the notice paper; but it is not ""another subject"" than that which is actually under consideration. It is the same subject, and, therefore, standing order 274 does not apply. In order to protest against this invasion of the right of honourable members to discuss fully the administration of the Departments before granting Supply, I think I am justified in submitting this motion. I desire to protect the privileges of honourable members which, in this respect, have been honoured from time immemorial. that the honourable member, in his notice of dissent, has set forth a ruling that I did not give. WhatI ruled was that an honourable member could not discuss a motion that was on the notice-paper. wish to discuss it . ference to it would be allowed, but that I would not allow honourable members, under cover of the Estimates, to discuss the motion of which notice had been given by the honourable member for Barker. hear that. I did not propose to discuss the motion of which notice has been given by the honourable member for Barker. I desired simply to express my disapproval of the action of the Defence Department in first adopting the principle in question, and then eliminating it. The reasons given by the Department for its action do not seem to me to be sufficient to justify such a radical departure as is proposed. I trust that the honourable member for Barker will be given an opportunity to discuss his motion, and I shall then be able to discuss in detail the principle involved. In conclusion, I have only to say that I think the Minister will be well-advised in looking into the.",35,Elliot Johnson I Would Of Such A Ruling Would Be To Place Every

Rifle ranges are vital to the very existence of rifle clubs, and by their speedy provision a greater impetus will be given to this side of the defence movement. I also hope that the Department will consider the advisableness of establishing, either companies of the Australian Light Horse, or bush squads in country districts, where the very best material can be obtained. In both these directions, I think that the Department has unexplored possibilities for effective and efficient defence, which, with the exercise of a little common sense, can be developed and made invaluable tor the security of Australia. this late hour of the session, I do not propose to trespass upon the patience of honourable members by entering into anything of the nature of an exhaustive study of the Defence Estimates. It is unfortunate that the Estimates should be so late in coming before us, because, at no time in the history of any section of our race, has it been so urgently necessary as it is today, to earnestly inquire into the basis of our racial security. I have in my hand perhaps one of the most important official documents ever issued by any British Department. I refer to the memorandum published Uy the British Admiralty in connection with the recent Canadian proposals. It is a memorandum which, in its bare recital of facts, shows that the old traditional idea that has guided our counsels and formed the basis of our local defence considerations, is disappearing, and that, in all human probability, unless the problem be earnestly grappled with by every section of our race, it will disappear for all time. I refer to the basis of British Naval supremacy which has so far been accepted as axiomatic in connection with all our defence schemes, both naval and military. I do not propose to canvass this memorandum. of the Committee to one sentence in it. After quoting the extraordinary expansion of German naval strength and the recent phenomenal increase in the readiness for war of the German Navy, the Admiralty, in the second part of that document, saysAt the present time, and in the immediate subject. We all know that in these days future, Great Britain still has the power, by Governments are swayed by public opiniori. making special arrangements and mobilizing st portion of the reserves, to send, without court-: his Department. An attempt ing disaster at home, an effective fleet of battleships and cruisers to unite with the Royal Australian Navy and the British Squadrons in China and the Pacific for the defence of Britisb Columbia, Australia, and New Zealand. That sentence ought to be most earnestly considered by every Australian patriot.: It is only at the present time and in the immediate future ""that Great Britain will have this power. In the past, we have been assured by every British Government and by the Admiralty officials that they would make themselves responsible for the defence of Australia against foreign aggression. But now we have an intimation that owing to the force of naval competition they will not, outside the immediate future, be in a position to guarantee the defence of the oversea Dominions. The position is so serious that, for my part, I regret that these Estimates have been presented so late in the session that they will have to be passed without . adequate consideration being given to the enormous issue with which we are confronted. In my judgment, the naval memorandum to which I have referred shows conclusively that this German Naval Force is being created with one object-to realize the oversea ambitions of Germany, and probably to gain command of the sea. ing the position of the British Empire. more than that. The statement contained in the preamble of the German Act of 1900 readsIn order to protect German trade and commerce under existing conditions, only one thing will suffice, namely, Germany must possess a battle fleet of such a strength that even for the most powerful naval adversary a war would involve such risks as to make that Power's own supremacy doubtful. For this purpose it is not absolutely necessary that the German Fleet should be as strong as that of the greatest Naval Power, for, as a rule, a great Naval Power will not be in a position to concentrate all its forces against us. Thus the German Government are absolutely counting upon the parochial influences which operate in Australia and the other oversea Dominions preventing the combinaI shall simply draw the attention tion for effective action of the naval energies of the British people. mitted that the German authorities repudiate any hostile attitude towards Great Britain.",36,Elliot Johnson I Would Of Such A Ruling Would Be To Place Every

174,Mr Kelly,"Let us inquire into thisWhat steps have recently been taken to sway public opinion in Germany? I have in mind a pamphlet, which was nof only issued broadcast throughout that country, but which was actually bought by the German people. That pamphlet contained two maps. It showed a map of the world on the date of its issue, and a map of the world in 1915In the first map, the British Possessions throughout the world were coloured red, and in the second were shown the countries among which the British Empire had been parcelled up. Australia and New Zealand had apparently been given to Japan, Canada had been absorbed by the United States, and South Africa and Egypt had been taken possession of by Germany. The desire underlying that attempt to form German public opinion was an alliance between Germany and Japan for the destruction of the British Empire. We know that, for reasons which it is not necessary to discuss now, the Anglo-Japanese alliance has been happily renewed', and Germany has answered its renewal by making still greater efforts in the direction of an increase of 35,000 in ' the personnel of the navy during the past year. These facts speak stronger than do the -words of German statesmen. They speak for themselves. And the Australian public must recognise that this country stands to sink or swim with the same Power which gave it birth, and with the same force which alone can maintain it-the sea strength of the British people. the absence of a desire on the part of and it is admitted that she desires territorial aggrandisement-withou t sending a man or a ship nearer to Australia than the English Channel, Germany could bring this country practically to the verge of bankruptcy. Australians are an exportbig people, and half our population depend upon the maintenance of existing markets oversea for their livelihood. be found that about 98 per cent, of the wool we produce is consumed oversea. very good customer of ours. would like to be in a still better position to decide how much of our products we should send her. About 85 or 86 per cent, of our gold and silver production .finds its market oversea, and, roughly speaking, about one-half of our dairying products find their market there. Now, if those who are engaged in these industries failed to find a market for their commodities, they would cease to receive payment for them, and the great cities of this continent, which live on the back country, would be on the verge of financial ruin. That would be the result of any hold-up of our oversea trade. That hold-up might be effected by Germany in the North Sea with less effort than would be involved at any other place this side of Suez. I am afraid that I have been led into dealing more comprehensively with this question than I intended to do. But apart from the naval problem, the admission which has been made by the Admiralty compels us to take count of our land defences. If honourable members will take a common-sense view of our position, they will realize that, should the command of the sea pass from Great Britain, the integrity of our territory could not in any circumstances be guaranteed by the Australian people. Why? For the simple reason that military distance and naval expansion-effort s involving geographical distance are two distinct things. Military distance is assessed by the difficulty that is experienced in traversing it. It is as difficult to send military supplies over 100 miles by land as it is to carry on similar operations over 5,000 miles of sea. Take, for instance, a strategic railway to the Northern Territory. Gauged by the long distance charges levied on our railway systems, the minimum cost Even in of sending a ton of material from Sydney to Port Darwin would be about £ 5 , Germany to occupy Australiawhereas the cost of sending a ton of material by sea fromi Japan to the Northern Territory would be about ios. Which country would have the better chance of winning? A well-organized community of 40,000,000 people, with communication facilities which work out at 10s. per ton, or a scattered population of 4,000,000, with communication facilities which work' It will out at £ 5 per ton? It would, therefore, be impossible for Australia to contest with any foreigner the occupation of any poris a tion of our mainland, with the exception of the south-eastern portion of this continent. As the Admiralty memorandum indicates the possibility of our being cut off from oversea assistance, I want to direct honourable members' attention to the necessity to take stock of our military position, with a",37,Elliot Johnson I Would Of Such A Ruling Would Be To Place Every
175,", Mr Thomus Brown",Germany,38,Elliot Johnson I Would Of Such A Ruling Would Be To Place Every
176,Mr Kelly,"And, no doubt, sheview to deciding whether the material which at present must be imported is adequate for all our possible requirements. Take the most important arm of the military side of our defence, namely, the artillery. Artillery cannot be improvised. An artillery officer must undergo a great deal of training. The gun has to be found. A whole host of things are necessary to an efficient artillery service. It cannot be created on the spur of the moment, or without incurring a great deal of trouble. If , owing to the loss of the command of the sea, which will occur-if it does occur-merel y because the Australian and Canadian people are too intent on their own affairs to take part in any organized effort to maintain the security of the Empire, no furthermilitary stores can reach Australia, the artillery obviously cannot grow beyond the maximum provided under the scheme that will mature in 1920. Under that scheme we shall have about 100,000 men and 220 guns, or about two guns to every 1,000 men. has four or five guns to every 1,000 men, and foundries to keep up the stock, should the war be protracted. country an army corps of 33,000 men has 144 guns, and there are other heavy guns distributed among the various army corps. In Germany, twenty-eight batteries ar allotted to 30,000 men; in Japan, a e division of 18,700 men has thirty-six guns, supplemented with three batteries of Kobi artillery, that is, eighteen additional guns, or, in all, three' guns per 1,000 men. We cannot improvise artillery, and should take stock of our requirements in regard to it in the light of the Admiralty memorandum. Having thought the matter over, I have come to the conclusion that the best way to meet the situation would be to establish gun factories in Australia. The making of a field gun is not phenomenally difficult. If India can make them, I think that Australia could. used for naval service-the wire guns-is more difficult, but even there the task is not insuperable. We must materially increase our gun strength in proportion to personnel, or we must establish factories capable of increasing it should the need arise through the loss of control of sea communication by our race. One other matter Australia would officers and brain of the service. be wise to remember that Germany The most defective link in the chain Mr Kelly. and Austria have a system whereby an enormous reserve of horses is maintained practically without cost. Their Governments, for a nominal charge, let out stallions to the owners of mares likely to throw foals which will be useful later for military work. In return for the services of the stallions, the owners of the mares undertake to sell the progeny at a fixed price, and to hold them subject to the requirements of the military authorities; with the result that horses suitable for military purposes swarm in those countries. Reference was made this morning to the excellent work done by 'bus horses in the South African war. Such animals, no doubt, played an honourable part in their declining years in South Africa; but the organization and operations of the Imperial Forces in the comparatively small campaign there are not a sufficient guide to what must be done when the enemy to be met is not the unorganized manhood of a fighting race, but the organized armies of a great militant people. We must establish in AusNow, France tralia, without undue cost to ourselves, a reserve of horses upon which we can draw at any time, should we have to enormously In that expand our Military Forces. The most practical and cheapest way of doing that is the system I have just described. I see nothing to lead one to think that advantage has been taken by the Government of the great military enthusiasm of our people of a year or two ago, which has not yet begun to wane. Slight changes and improvements have been made, but, compared with foreign Powers, which have been increasing their efficiency and strength during the past twelve months, we are no better off than, if in as good a position as, we were twelve months ago. Our international position must be gauged, not by what we have done, but by what we have done in comparison with what others have done; and in the past year we have not done enough for the increase of our efficiency. The Prime Minister, after The making of the heavy guns seeing the march past of the cadets the other day, said that they were equal to the best troops in the world ! No one was better pleased than I was to witness that excellent display, and I hope that we shall have others of the same kind; but I would remind the Committee that preparation for war involves more than marching. It involves, among other things, the exhaustive and scientific training of the of Australian defence is the system of training officers. We are partly training our boys was. to serve in the rank 'and file, but we are paragraphs of the memorandum seem to not systematically training a sufficient indicate that Great Britain fears somewhat number of officers to be sure that when for her naval supremacy. the time comes we shall have men who, when the command of the seas is being decided, will not only know their own duty, but will be able to train the recruits who every German strategist. will be drawn upon.

192,Mr Joseph Cook,"I have seen a statesaw show a profit of ,£2,000,000. Great Britain £6,000,000 per annum is paid to wealthy land-owners as royalties on the coal mines, and the coal industry returns a profit of £11,000,000 a year; while only £15,000,000 is paid to 300,000 miners, or less than £ 1 a week. Yet,, when there was a desire for cheaper coal, it was the miner who was first asked to submit to a reduction in his wages. From the State coal mines and other enterprises the German Government receive millions of revenue every year, and this enables' them to maintain the navy and the army establishment in a far better fashion than we see in the Motherland. many is borrowing right and left. nificant paragraph columns of our newspapers a little while ago informed us that the German Government reserve to themselves rights over the savings of the people which, if only mentioned in a British community, would cause considerable confusion. The German Government practically reserve the right to take, if necessary, everything in the Savings Banks. we ought to bear in mind, because there is no doubt that, if Great Britain, in the first place, had adopted a proper Tariff, and had socialized some of her great utilities, there would have been flowing into the national coffers millions that now go to -private individuals, who, when they were asked, under the Lloyd-George Budget, to contribute to the Government upkeep and defence, went about howling that they would be ruined. does not solve the problem of how we should participate in defence. to listen to the honourable member; but, as I said before, there are certain portions of this memorandum which, in my opinion, should not have been sent out broadcast. It is safe to say that the very next day after it was read in the Canadian House of Commons its contents were seriously discussed in the inner circles of the leading countries of the world. the inner circles. In there is no need for us to make such admissions. I join issue with the honourable member for Wentworth when he says that Aus-: tralia to-day is in no better position, from the defence point of view, than she was two or three years ago. It seems scarcely possible that any honourable member could make such a statement, when we. a mere handful of people, have an annual defence expenditure of £5,500,000. In the establishment of factories, in the creation of our citizen soldiery, and an Australian Navy, we make a most effective contribution to-' wards the defences of the Empire. All this has evoked almost the admiration of the world ; and, therefore, in my opinion, this criticism goes by the board. It is quite true, as the honourable member says, that an army is not built up by marches past; but if the honourable member goes in the financial into any of our parks or open spaces on a Saturday afternoon, he will see thousands: of our youths being trained in a fashion which will fit them to be good defenders of the nation in the near future. The Government have done splendidly, and, so far from being deserving of adverse criticism, they should be commended. I am surprised at two or three lines in a report which has been circulated relating to the Cordite Factory. We are toldThe Cordite Factory is at present engaged in experimental and proof work, but will shortly, it is expected, be in a position to turn out cordite for the use of the Forces. I do not know the exact date of that report; but I understood some months ago that cordite of our own manufacture was being used at the ammunition factory for the cartridges distributed to the Defence Forces. It is a peculiar commentary on tlie situation to hear the honourable member for Wentworth complaining of what the Government have not done, in face of the fact that, only a little while ago, he and others were criticising the Government for establishing Commonwealth factories. In my opinion, the. Cordite Factory, the Small Arms F'actory, the Harness Factory, the Clothing Factory, and the Woollen Factory are going to prove a very important development in our defence scheme. I am a firm believer in rifle clubs, and I trust that the Honorary Minister will pay serious attention to the comments that have been made by honourable members on both sides.

201,Mr Fenton,"That might be; but?30th June, 1911, there were 55,400 members of rifle clubs, whereas, on 30th June, 1912, they had decreased to 50,615, a difference on the wrong side of nearly 5,000. t h is discloses a very serious position; and I hope that the Government will not only provide the necessary money for ranges and equipment, but will see that that money is spent to the best possible service* One of the best moves that has ever Navy is that to increase the pay of men on the warships. In the past in the Navy, as well as in the mercantile marine, sufficient monetary inducement has not been held out to cause desirable men to take up a life on the sea. In Australia, I notice a disinclination, when we employ men to carry out certain works in the Defence Department, to pay them even the money provided by law. For instance, men temporarily employed in the Stores Bianch of the Ordnance Department are receiving less than they ought to under the Public Service Act and regulations; and, no doubt, similar complaints could be made in regard to other branches. As to the heads of the Military Forces and the Navy, and superior officers generally, an increase in salary has only to be suggested to be granted, whereas men who do some of the most important work lower down the ladder have to make request after request before being listened to, although they, to a large extent, are subject to the Public Service Commissioner, and their rates of remuneration are provided under the Public Service Act. I wish to draw the special attention of the Minister to this complaint. I hope that every possible encouragement will be given to rifle clubs, in the shape of the provision of ranges,and the supply of ammunition and rifles; and that this time twelve months, instead of mourning a decline in the membership, we shall be able to congratulate ourselves on a substantial increase. are only three points to which I desire to direct the attention of the Minister. There is much that is fascinating in these Estimates, but this is not the time to yield to the temptation to make long speeches, even on subjects in which we have taken a special interest. I do not ask the Minister to pay any particular attention to anything I may say, from my point of view, concerning such an intricate and difficult Department, but I should like him to realize that what I am about to lay before him is due to representations that have been fairly made to me. Some feeling has been caused amongst officers and men of the Intellir gence Corps, who have made a special istudy of topography work, by the importation of four men of the Royal Engineers of England into South Australia, for the purpose of making surveys and military maps. These men feel that, while no doubt from been made in the British a military point of view they may have much to learn, as surveyors they could not be taught very much about the work of map-making, and that they might very well have been intrusted with the preparation of a map of their own country. The success of our compulsory system will very largely depend upon our Area Officers, and I consider that, particularly in some of the larger districts, £150 is not sufficient pay for the men who are engaged in the delicate and trying work of inaugurating the system. Possibly some of the Area Officers in the city and suburbs would be well paid a t ^ 5 ° i but where they have to travel I over long distances, I think they should receive some special consideration. A friend of mine has directed special attention to the fact that under the regulations of the Imperial Army and Navy, and also under the Army Regulations of Germany and France, it is obligatory that the members of the Forces shall learn to swim. I think we might very well follow this example, both in regard to our Naval Cadets and the boys who are connected with our Field Forces. These are the only points to which I desire to direct attention. I trust the Minister will take a note of them, and that full regard will be paid to the interests of both officers and men. No Department in the Public Service is more capable of the subject of criticism than the Defence Department; and I , cannot conceive of anything more antagonistic to the Australian's love of freedom than our present compulsory military system, and I offer my strongest objection to some of the acts associated with the administration of the Defence Department. I regard war as the last resort, and cannot but look with^ horror upon the preparations we are making in connection with naval and military matters. I am quite aware that our military system is designed purely for defensive purposes, and that is the only good feature about it. I wish to offer a few observations in the way of friendly criticism. I was a member of a deputation",41,Elliot Johnson I Would Of Such A Ruling Would Be To Place Every
202,Mr Gordon (Boothby) [4.13],There,42,Elliot Johnson I Would Of Such A Ruling Would Be To Place Every
203,Mr Finlayson (Brisbane) [4.19],"which, was recently introduced to the Minister of Defence by the honourable member for Maribyrnong. The deputation asked that the Minister should arrange for instructional lectures by medical experts upon physical diseases, and that these lectures should be delivered to the cadets at the statutory parades. Some strong statements were then made as to the necessity of taking advantage of the opportunities offered by these military parades to make our young men acquainted with some of the real dangers that dog the steps of every army, and I wish to place on record my appreciation of the action of the Minister in consenting to arrange for the delivery of these lectures, so that the boys may be warned against the most insidious and serious diseases that threaten the young manhood of this country. I particularly wish to say a few words in reference to a matter upon which I addressed questions to the Minister of Defence on 6th November last. The questions were as follow : 1. Whether he considers that sumcient provision is being made in the Australian military system for-, efficient treatment and care of the wounded, should we ever, unfortunately, be involved in war? 2. As experience has shown that in all wars an excessive number of deaths result from diseases consequent on lack of suitable hospital and nursing arrangements, will he inform the House as to what provision is being made to effectively care for the sick among the Australian Forces in time of war? 3. Has he considered the matter of compulsorily and sufficiently training the young women of the Commonwealth in first aid and hospital nursing to enable them to render good service to their country in this direction in time of war? And these were the answers :1. Yes. a. The following provision has been made :(a) Light Horse Field Ambulance for each Light Horse Brigade. (b) Field Ambulance for each Infantry Brigade. (Ir) Regimental medical personnel for the respective regiments and corps. War. Crimean-French Army Crimean-British Army War of 1859-French Army Mexican-French Army Franco-German-German Army Russo-Turkish-Russian Army Bosnian Expedition-Austrian Army Sir. Finlayson. (d) Army Medical Corps Reserve. («) Army Nursing Service. (/) Voluntary Aid (scheme of organization under consideration). [g) Hospitals-militar y and civil. 3. Compulsory training of young women for nursing is not considered necessary. I am interested to. notice that an increased amount of ^2,724 is put down to make better provision for the staff instructors who will be required for duty in connection with the Army Medical Corps. I find by the memorandum which has been issued to honourable members that last year there were 900 men on the staff of the Army Medical Corps, and that it is proposed to increase this number to 1,398 during the year. This is a highly satisfactory provision, so far as it goes. But during the last week or two I have been brought face to face with some startling facts and figures with respect to the care of the sick and wounded in time of war, and the fearful ravages made by disease, and I wish to place on record my appreciation of the very pressing necessity for incurring an even larger expenditure in the direction I have indicated. It is well known that behind every army-indeed , with every armythere stalks an unseen foe. The greatest danger to which soldiers are exposed is that which arises, not from the offensive operations of the enemy, but from disease. Whilst it is interesting to hear honourable members expatiate on the arrangements we are making for the destruction of life, it is highly important that we should pay special attention to the saving of life. Sickness seems to be an inevitable attendant on every army that takes the field. In 1889 the celebrated Russian writer, I . S. Bloch, wrote a book entitled Is War now Impossible, and, although I was unable to agree with the deductions of that writer, I was startled by the figures quoted showing the serious ravages of disease in time of war. He gives the following particulars in tabular formD Strength Losses e a ths in 1,000 menof from From Army. wounds. sickness.

The records show that the average loss from sickness is four times greater than the average loss from wounds. I was able also to obtain the statistics in regard to the Boer War, in which we were more immediately concerned. Honourable members will recollect that a Royal Commission was appointed by the Imperial Government to inquire into certain state^ ments with regard to the care of the sick and wounded during that campaign. The Commission, in their report, make some startling statements. The statistics from the commencement of the war 6th October, 1899, until 27th July, 1900, show that, exclusive of in action, the deaths recorded wereofficers 155, men 5,122, or a total of 5,277. The invalided officers numbered 1,016, whilst the men who were invalided numbered 16,127, or a total of 17,143. The total number of men incapacitated for active service during the period wasofficers 1,171, men 21,249, or a total of 22,420. One only needs to look at these figures to realize the disadvantage at which we should be placed in time of war if our medical arrangements were inadequate for the proper care of the sick and wounded. We have to consider, not only the number of men whom we should lose in action, but the number who would be incapacitated by sickness. war, thousands of men died who had never reached the firing line. The records of that war afford some of the most painful and pathetic reading that could be imagined. human inefficiency, and the want of preparation shown in connection with the medical arrangements, were an outrage to our civilization. Here is a further statement in regard to the Boer warSick in hospitals-exclusiv e of Natal :December, 2,380; January, 2,834; February, 3,828; March, 6,107; April, 9,215; May, 10,856; June, 10,757; July, 9,545. Those figures afford another illustration of the fearful havoc wrought by sickness in time of war. That we have not made much progress in this respect is shown by the news of the Balkan war that has recently filtered through. The Sydney Sun of jibe 18th ultimo published a telegram stating thatDisease is decimating the Turkish ranks. It is estimated that last week 10,000 victims were rendered non-combatants as a result of various ills. In the Argus of the 19th inst. it was reported that there were 1,000 victims dying daily from cholera, whilst the Melbourne Herald of 22nd ult. contained the following statementThe Daily Telegraph war correspondent with the Turkish Forces which are defending the Tchataldja lines, paints a horrifying picture of the cholera outbreak at the front. He describes the square at Hademkoi, near Tchataldja, as resembling a fly paper after having been exposed for some time. It is covered with corpses and writhing bodies. Some are sitting or kneeling, while others still alive lie prone. The dead are piled in heaps in some places, and stretcherbearers are constantly bringing fresh victims from the camps and forts. All the tracks leadcasualties ing to the impromptu morgue are dotted with bodies. Is there not another side to the picture? One nationI refer to Japan-ha s given the world an object-lesson in regard to the provision of medical aid for its soldiers. I would commend to honourable members a book entitled The Real Triumph of Japan, by Louis L. Seaman, which is to be found in the Parliamentary Library. The author, who is an American, points out in a very spirited manner that the Japanese, in preparing for war with Russia, made special provision for the treatment of their sick and wounded; and the figures that he supplies in regard to that war show that someDuring the American-Spanish thing can easily be done to remedy the shocking abuses that occurred during the Boer war. Some of the particulars relating to the treatment of the sick and wounded during the Boer war are suffiThe absolutely cruel and incient to bring a blush of shame to the face of fhe reader. I shall quote only one extract from a statement given by a witness who appeared before the Commission to which I have referred. Writing"" from Capetown, the specialteorreispondentof the London Times reportedFrom morning to night the gloomy processions followed each other across the Market Square at slow march with arms reversed, bearing shapeless figures sewed up in blankets to unknown crowded graves in the cemetery on the southern hill, day after day' and week after week in evergrowing numbers. How many of these might to-day be strong men, f u l l of life, rejoicing at their near return to home and friends is a terrible speculation, which must be left to those who consider the conditions attending their sickness and death. Throughout the report of the Commission it is shown that witness after witness attributed the trouble that arose in regard to the treatment of the sick and wounded to the utter inelasticity of the medical arrangements, their failure to allow of prompt attention being given, and the ready acceptance of offers of help for the sick and wounded. Professor Dunlop, in giving evidence, saidI f I were asked what seemed to me to be the defects of the Medical Department of the Army, \ should reply as follows :The Queen's Regulations hamper prompt and /nergetic action in times of difficultv. However suitable they may be in times of peace and in barracks they do not admit of rapid extension in time of war, and in such a war as we have had in Southern Africa. It has to be kept in view that the war was thought to be one that would soon be over, and only a very small provision was made for sick and wounded, and when pressure upon the hospital accommodation and equipment in the way of supply of nurses, doctors, & c , became imminent, some of the heads of the Medical Department at the base not being familiar with the advances of modern surgery, and not gifted with the experience and forethought and judgment necessary for men occupying such important positions, it is not be wondered at if there was inaction, delay, and even blundering in the early administration of the hospital systems of the Army in times of war. The Commission reportedIn this war, at any rate, at its commencement, some members of the Royal Army Medical Corps appear to have had a difficulty in divesting themselves of the old traditions of the service, which are undoubtedly antagonistic to the employment of nurses in military hospitals. For example, we find that when the Langman private hospital arrived in South Africa, its principal medical officer apthat corps in itself is not sumcient. The plied to the authorities for the assistance of nurses, but his application was refused, though ultimately nurses were supplied to it when it arrived at Bloemfontein. This prejudice, however, has long since ceased to operate in the care of the sick and wounded in South Africa. The nurses employed in this war have shown great devotion, and many have lost their lives in the discharge of their duties. Scarcely any complaints have been made during this campaign with regard to the nurses. The soldiers have much appreciated their services, and seem to prefer to be attended by them to being attended to by orderlies. But, bearing in mind the ordinary conditions of a military hospital, we think that it will always be necessary, even in fixed hospitals, and in suitable wards, that .the employment of nurses should be supplemented by that of properly-trained orderlies. This brings me to the point that I wish to emphasize, namely, that whilst we are making preparation for taking life, we ought to be more active in our preparations for saving the lives of our men who may have to go to the front. It is too late to take such action when war has broken out. It would be criminal on our part to repeat the inaction and delay, and the want of elasticity, shown in connection with the medical arrangements for the care of the sick and the wounded during the Boer war, and which lost to the Empire so many brave men. The Japanese say, in regard to their wounded on the hospital shipsWe have the most precious cargo here that the world can imagine. We must hurry home with all speed, so that not one of its parts may suffer the least damage on the way. Give us free road. Here come the nation's greatest treasures, the sick and wounded. I dread the outbreak of war in Australia more because of the dangers of sickness than because of the dangers from battle. Having regard to their mobility and adaptability, Australian' soldiers can be well trusted to take care of themselves and to look after the enemy in time of war. But those of us who have noticed at times the inefficient character of the hospital and sanitary accommodation in our military camps cannot but dread the possibility of our having not only to defend our coasts but to prepare for the attendant danger of sickness to our men. numbers, I do not think there is anything better in the world than our little Army Medical Corps. that the honourable member was present when I referred to the commendable increase in the Army Medical Corps. The point that I wish to make, however, is that report of the Commission which inquired into the South African war proved that, unless supported by some efficient system of voluntary aid, every medical arrangement made for the care of the sick and wounded breaks down. Why was Japan able to show such a splendid record in respect of the treatment of its sick and wounded in connection with its war with Russia? I find that the Japanese in theiT war with China, in 1894, lost three from disease, as against one from bullets, with 45 per cent, suffering from beri-beri. In the war with Russia, from February, 1904, to May, 1903, 52,946 were killed or died from wounds, while the deaths from all diseases totalled only 11,922. There we have a complete reversal of the records of every other war concerning which we have any figures. As is pointed out by Mr Louis Seaman, there were more than four deaths from bullets to one from disease, as",42,Elliot Johnson I Would Of Such A Ruling Would Be To Place Every

205,Mr Finlayson,"I do not thinkagainst the record of centuries of four from disease to one from bullets, or 8,003 better than the average history. Only1 2-ioths per cent, of the entire army died of sickness or disease, and only i per cent, 1 died of gunshot wounds, although 24 per cent, were wounded; 2,000 more men died from wounds than from preventible diseases; and of a total mortality of 64,938 from all causes there were 40,954 more from casualties than from disease. The secret of this success may be readily ascertained. auxiliary societies. Cross Society has branches in every city or town, with a total membership of 1,250,000. It is stated thatOrganized strictly as an auxiliary, it is transI can conceive of nothing which would apferred bodily to the army in time of war. . . . It becomes a part of the army's Medical Department -. . The society had 3,85a nurses, men and women. . . 2,628 of whom were females employed exclusively in hospitals and other home stations where sick and wounded need attention. . . Excellent work was also done by the Nursing Association, which is allied to the Red Cross Society and which the princesses and the wives of the nobles and the diplomatic staffs joined freely. I wish again to impress on the Minister of Defence the urgent necessity for the immediate establishment of an effective system of aid for the sick and wounded secured by voluntary effort, or preferably by the compulsory training of the young women of Australia to act as nurses in time of war. I read in last Thursday's issue of the Herald an interesting article, in which a number of authorities spoke of the beneficial effect which military training was having upon our young men. If compulsory nursing, first-aid, and ambulance training were given to the young women of this country, I am sure that they, too, would be immensely benefited. If compulsory military training has led to the better discipline of our boys, and has raised their moral tone, I am confident that the compulsory training of our young women in firstaid and ambulance work would also be immensely beneficial to them. What an advantage it would be to Australia if our young women were trained in this way. When they married, and became the mothers of our families, spreading all over the Continent of Australia, the knowledge they had thus acquired would be of immense advantage in case of ordinary sickness in time of peace, as Hundreds of lives in Australia might be saved if the women who had passed through first-aid training periods were able to apply the knowledge thus gained to those accidents, diseases, and troubles which arise so frequently and so unexpectedly. The saving of life thus effected would be well worth the expenditure that would be involved, and I believe that the young women of this country are just as anxious to exhibit their patriotism in this direction as our young men are to defend it against foreign aggression. We have not in this country the voluntary military system which obJapan has a number of tains in England and other parts of the The Japanese Red world. But that system in the Army is breaking down, and we have recognised that by placing upon every citizen the responsibility of defending this country; and peal to the higher instincts of the women of Australia more than would an opportunity to stand by their brothers who do the fighting, by nursing thera through the sickness and trouble which inevitably attend marching operations. [4.48] -The honourable member for Brisbane has referred to a very important matter indeed. But may I suggest to him that unless he looks into these cases on their merits, he is very liable to be misled. The honourable member has quoted figures to show the great difference which obtains between the number of deaths that occurred from wounds and sickness in the Japanese war against China, and the number that resulted from similar causes in fhe RussoJapanese war. He ought to know that that difference arises from a very simple fact, namely, that in the former war operations were conducted in a more leisurely way. In the conflict with Russia the Japanese could not afford to wait. They had to hurl their legions against the foe in the quickest possible time. Their resources would not permit them to wait, or to take extra precautions for the preservation of their lives. That is why there are a greater proportion of deaths from wounds and a less proportion of deaths from sickness in the war with Russia than in the war with China. This factor, I am afraid, will operate more and more in modern wars. Those wars are so costly that they must be finished quickly, otherwise they will bankrupt the nations which engage in them. For that reason we shall not see so much finessing in future wars as there has been, although, well as in time of war. of course, there will always be room for strategy and tactics. The same result will probably be found in connection with the",45,Elliot Johnson I Would Of Such A Ruling Would Be To Place Every
206,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"Balkan war. I venture to say that in that struggle there will be a tremendous disproportion between the number of deaths from sickness and the number of deaths from wounds. The results will work out very much in favour of the Balkan allies. But the reason will be that the conflict has been a short, sharp, and fearful one, in which the armies have gone in either to win or lose in the quickest possible time. It is that which leads to the fearful destruction sent there was acknowledged to be as wellof life from wounds and gunshot. It cannot be attributed to extra skill in medical science, and better organization in the Army Medical Corps. The simple fact is that modern armies cannot afford to wait to manceuvre. Very frequently the Japanese hurled their forces headlong at what was practically an impregnable position.' If they had waited, with a view to playing a game of chess, we should have witnessed a very different state of affairs. In no other way could Japan have won that war. fact that she made very elaborate preparations in the organization of her Army Medical Corps. ments were admirable. But the honourable member must not lose sight of the fact which I have mentioned. One cannot compare a short, sharp, decisive war like that with a long-drawn-out war such as we had to conduct in South Africa. In the latter case there was every chance for men to die from deprivation, and from bad sanitary arrangements. It is very difficult to organize sanitary conditions over a wide expanse of country. None the less, it is true that the Japanese are to be commended in every way for the admirable arrangements which they made for the care of their sick and wounded. That is due to the voluntary effort which is prevalent throughout that country. Figures which I obtained some three years ago showed that in Japan alone there were 1,000,000 women in the Red Cross League, and they had subscribed over ,£1,000,000, or £ 1 per head, to that organization. There is nothing like that organization in the world so far as voluntary effort is concerned. The sooner we organize in that way the better But it is quite a mistake to imagine that everybody's arrangements are better than our own. It may be that that idea gives us an added spur to perfect our own arrangements. But I have not the slightest doubt that if other nations could be heard discussing their own arrangements, they would be heard instituting comparisons which were not favorable to themselves. Distant hills always look green. I know that our own arrangements are not perfect. A great deal has to be done before perfection can be reached in the organization of our Army. But I would remind honourable members that in the South African war a little Army Medical Corps which we organized a unit as was to be found there. Lord Kitchener was glad to avail himself of it, and he even wanted it back after its return home. So far as its numbers go, it is about the best organized unit in our Army Forces. We have nothing to complain of in that respect, save that we have not enough of it. But all these cases must be considered in the light of their own surroundings, and in that ^vay we may account for the great increase in the number of deaths resulting from wounds in short, sharp, decisive wars, as compared with the number of deaths from the same cause in long-drawn-out struggles. nowadays is very different from the bullet which was used previously. it was thought that the tremendous range of our modern guns would prevent great loss of life. But it is evident that contending armies cannot afford to stand off each other. They must go in and finish the struggle, and the nation which gets its blow in quickest will, in the future, as in the past, be likely to win. It all comes back to this: That the increased range of our modern arms has not yet ruled out the personal equation. While the range of our guns is longer, we cannot afford to take advantage of it, because of the necessity which exists for finishing the conflict in the quickest possible time. I should like to make just one observation in regard to our land defences. I think that the Minister representing the Minister of Defence ought to tell us exactly how the increased cost of our land defences has been brought about? This year it is proposed to expend £2,900,000 upon our land forces. The figures have been supplied to will it be for all. me by Mr Pethebridge himself. Some time ago I endeavoured to ascertain from the Estimates what our land defences were costing, but I was unable to do so. In despair, I appealed to Mr Pethebridge, and that is the information which he has given me.",46,Elliot Johnson I Would Of Such A Ruling Would Be To Place Every

The total amount which it is proposed to expend upon defence this year Deducting £2,900,000-the amount of the military expenditure-yo u have ,£2,300,000 left for naval defence. I call attention to the disproportion between the two amounts. No doubt a good deal of the extra expenditure on land defence is for material, but we should know the details. Lord Kitchener's scheme, when fully developed, and working at its normal, was to cost ,£1,880,000 a year; but it is not yet fully developed, and, therefore, should cost much less. money is being spent on the purchase of guns of heavy calibre, and other special preparations; but Parliament cannot ask too many questions on these matters, and should be supplied with the fullest details. it is very easy to lay down proposals, it is No one grudges money for defence, but we should know that we are getting full value for our expenditure. Nearly ,£3,000,000 have been spent on. land defence this year; but our scheme when fully equipped is to cost at the normal ,£1,880,000. I have no wish to tie down the Department to the estimate of Lord Kitchener, which may be an economical one, and may have omitted items because of his want of knowledge of our local circumstances, but it was made after consultation with such men as Colonel Legge and the late Mr Thompson. Lord Kitchener had the advantage of consulting any one else in the Department whom he wished to see. derson's report also mean some land expenditure ? There is the expenditure on naval bases. to the Naval Estimates. that a great deal of money is being spent on the establishment of naval bases, but I have been speaking purely on land defence. ,£1,200,000 or ,£1,300,000.

I think rary Minister to give us the necessary parthat she has allies, some of whom will ticulars, which we are entitled to know before agreeing to the expenditure. While I do not think that we are doing too much for land defence, our preparations are lopit seems to me that the totality of the sided. The Navy is, and always must be, our first line of defence, and our land preparations should not be made at the expense of our naval preparations. It is upon the Navy that we must rely for our safety in co-operation with the Navy of Great Britain. This year the naval exis £5,200,000. penditure is to be about ^2,300,000, and we have spent £J 1,000,000 less than Admiral Henderson recommended. No doubt his estimate was only approximate, but reasons should be given for this large departure from it. He began his forecast ot expenditure as from a year and a half ago, so that this is the second year of the working of his scheme, which for the first seven years was to cost ,£3,000,000 per annum, rising to £5,000,000 per annum in twentytwo years' time. If we spend all that is I suppose a good deal of proposed, we shall have spent on the Navy in two years £5,000,000, instead of ,£6,000,000 as estimated by Admiral Henderson. Our naval preparations must be hastened as much as possible, because, while difficult to carry them into effect. Our great difficulty is in obtaining a personnel. Admiral Henderson's scheme was based on the lending of men by the Old Country until our own men could take their places. I do not know to what extent that is going on, but the position is not calculated to make one sleep comfortably. The naval strength of Germany and Austria, taken together, is greater than that of Great Britain. Those countries seem to be bound together indissolubly. In comparing the warlike preparations of Germany and Great Britain, one must not leave out of sight the strength of Austria. The other day, Germany's foreign Minister declared that she was prepared to fight over a very small matter affecting an ally. He»did not speak without the fullest consideration ; and when Germany is willing to fight if certain things should happen to I understand her neighbour, one can see how undivided their interests are, and how we must judge of the strength of both in determining our relative naval strength. ber right in assuming that Great Britain has no allies? stand her in good stead. Still, we must consider, not merely the naval strength, but the strength of both arms of defence; and strength of the allies should make us pause.",47,Elliot Johnson I Would Of Such A Ruling Would Be To Place Every

We have got beyond that stage. I am concerned now with what is ahead, and I take it we all wish to know how we stand in relation to other countries, and must be impressed by the evident intention of some of the nations that there shall be a change in the relative military and naval strength of the Powers. The figures show that Great Britain's naval strength is getting further behind with the passing of the years. In 1915 she will have twenty-five DreadnougJsts, and Germany will have seventeen; and both will have' six battle cruisersI suppose battle cruisers of effective strength. Britain no longer makes a pretence of keeping up the two-Power standard-that she has been forced to abandon. Therefore, the outlying Dominions must do their fair share in defending the Empire, and the trade routes which are its arteries. I am glad to know of the development in Canada, though one cannot help feeling that a great deal is being said there about what, after all, is relatively very little. The spending of £2,300,000 seems to be a matter ot jubilation throughout the Empire; but I hope and believe that this is only the beginning of things. As to the question* of control, and so forth, I fall back on tbe scheme which we are developing, and which was suggested by the Admiralty itself. T do not know whether the Admiralty has suggested any change since, or has even given any hint to the Government that it would be better that the arrangements then made should be modified, but, in the absence of any information, we may assume that the present position of our Naval Forces, relative to the Naval Forces of the Empire, is as determined on at the Imperial Conference. There the matter may be left; but, in the meantime, our duty is to hasten our preparations in every possible way. Whether the best is being done with regard to the construction of our naval bases, and so forth, I do not pretend to know; but there are certain anomalies that strike one in connection with the works. FOT instance, about £600,000, I understand, is estimated for' the Flinders Naval Base, the Admiralty, and £200,000 by the Department of Home Affairs. I believe that the Admiralty is undertaking that part of the work which means the preparation of the base-the removal of rocks and slush, and the putting in of foundations-and that then the Department of Home Affairs will put up the buildings. It is altogether contrary to one's notions of such matters to see the Lord High Admiral of the Fleet doffing his gold lace and going into this work of excavation, while the real construction authority, the Department of Home Affairs, stands by until that is done. member's time has expired. most bitter opponents of the Government will admit that, during their term of office, they have made wonderful improvements so far as the Defence Department is concerned; and much further headway would Great have been made had not the expenditure been curtailed by the House itself. The honourable member for Brisbane made a very important suggestion in regard to the sanitary and medical corps. We all know that in war more lives are lost through insanitary conditions than by the weapons of the enemy, and the Defence Department is not so up-to-date as it should be in this respect. It is very pleasing to notice that the honourable member for Wentworth possesses so much knowledge of defence matters; but it is rather annoying that honourable members should be kept here, with no chance of getting home, while the honourable member makes speeches, which, I fancy, will have very little effect on the Committee. I rise for the purpose of bringing under the notice of the Minister the fact that, while increases in salaries are granted to the central and administrative staff, the rank and file do not share in this advantage. The Estimates show that the Paymaster last year received an increase of £100, and this year he is given another £ 5 5 , while the Chief Clerk and the Senior Clerk are each given £ 2 0 , and Colonel Wallack has his salary raised from £700 to £750. Then there are nine additional appointments, all, I understand, of Imperial officers, whose salaries range from ,£450 to as much as £950 a year.",48,Elliot Johnson I Would Of Such A Ruling Would Be To Place Every

The warrant officers and non-commissioned officers are really the brains of the Department, so far as the training is concerned; and if the reason for the increases in the higher branches is the cost of living, the same reason holds good throughout the Service. It certainly looks as though gence from the general plan. As to the there was a little bit of selfishness on the part of the central staff; and I point out that some of the warrant oflicers and non-commissioned officers, prior to Federation, enjoyed emoluments of a higher standard than those under the Commonwealth.

At one moment we had almost been taken by Japan, and the next moment Germany had completely enveloped the British -Isles, and all was lost. However, I have no doubt that each honourable member considered that the subject he brought before the Committee was of importance, and, under the circumstances, justified the time occupied. Personally, I think the Minister of Defence is to be congratulated on the fact that the criticisms are all of a kindly character rather than adverse; and in the one or two instances where the criticism was, perhaps, a little more keen, there are replies which, I hope, will be satisfactory to those concerned. proper, I think, on my part to interfere in the international relationships of countries, even if any words uttered by honourable members might have that effect. I am confident that the Minister of Defence, with the information at his disposal, is aware of what is taking place in various direction, and that, compatibly with the money at his disposal, he is doing his best to establish a system of defence that will be effective from every point of view. Necessarily, in the establishment of a new system, some anomalies will be discovered and some disagreements will arise. Some persons in the service may find themselves removed from the positions they have hitherto occupied, and they complain, simply because the defence scheme, generally, means to them only their position, and they cannot be expected to, as it were, place themselves at the centre, and realize that the whole of the Commonwealth, and its relationship to the Empire, has to be considered. While every effort will be made to minimize inconveniences, which must necessarily arise in a new scheme of this magnitude, the inconvenience of individuals cannot be regarded as of such importance as to justify any great divercadets, I desire to offer my personal congratulation to the boys of Australia on the magnificent response they have made to the call of their country. There are, of course, a few objectors, and, in addition, a few recalcitrants, but these, I hope, will, ere long, be enthusiasts in so far as the work is concerned. Generally speaking, the compulsory training of the boys has been established with a minimum of inconvenience, and, I am pleased to say, with a minimum of opposition. When we remember that the principle of compulsion is people-that it is entirely novel, and, to some extent, interferes with ordinary vocations and the ordinary methods of spending spare time-w e may congratulate ourselves on the results. As to the proposal of the Minister, made public only a day or two ago, to deal with those lads who have been particularly recalcitrant, honourable members will agree that it would never do to permit those boys to defy the laws of the country. It would not be fair, and it would not be honourable to the tens of thousands of boys who have cheerfully come forward to do their duty, that a few should be permitted to repeatedly place the It would not be law at defiancea law that was placed on the statute-book only after careful consideration on both sides of Parliament, and because of the recognition of the imperative necessity to put ourselves in a position to adequately defend this country. It was, I think, the honourable member for Franklinwho asked whether it would be only lads who lived near barracks that would be subject to the treatment proposed by the Minister; and, in reply, I have to say that unquestionably the policy will be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. There will be no distinction made between lads who reside in the country and lads who reside in the cities. pensed with if the boys are taken to barracks ?",49,Elliot Johnson I Would Of Such A Ruling Would Be To Place Every

227,Mr Roberts,"That is a matter I orable member said lhat Area Officers inor two ago, when the Estimates were under discussion, honourable members exercised their right of debate upon one line of a comparatively unimportant character for fifty odd hours. No doubt they had a perfect right to do so, but, at the same time, it is scarcely fair for them to say that they have not had opportunities for reasonable consideration. The honourable member for North Sydney was concerned principally with the difficulty, happily now overcome, which existed some time ago in connection with the remount depSts in New South Wales, and also with what he termed the censure administered to certain officers by the Minister of Defence. When I tell him that the Minister of Defence has not censured Colonel Wallack, Major Darvall, or Captain Lyons, I hope my statement will be sufficient. The honourable member knows full well that, in the best interests of the Forces, it is often necessary to remove officers from one locality to another. In the interests of the officers themselves it is desirable that their experience should be widened, and that they should have opportunities of familiarizing themselves with methods and conditions with which they have not previously been brought in contact. It is scarcely fair for an honourable member, merely because an oflicer has been removed, to take advantage of his position as a public man to drag in the names of certain individuals and allege that they have been censured and removed by the Minister. siders he was censured. member whether he was speaking at the request of Captain Lyons, and he answered in the negative. I asked that because I knew that the censure spoken of had not been passed, and could scarcely believe that the officer had asked the honourable member to make any public comment on what had taken place. The honourable member's criticism was not justified. There is no need for secrecy in the matteT, and it may be stated at once that there was, at the time, some little oversight in connection with the care of the horses, and an inquiry was made into the subject. matters of this description there will be oversights or dereliction of duty, which it may be necessary to inquire into, and these inquiries may result in officers of high or low rank being brought under censure. In the scheme we are endeavouring to establish, the Minister is entitled to the sympathy and support of honourable members who have had experience in military matters, and it is scarcely compatible with the public duty of such honourable members to make much of every little incident. Where honourable members think that they have reasonable cause of complaint, and go to the.Minister, the papers will be made available to them, and they will be made acquainted with every detail. If , after that, honourable members do not feel satisfied, they may take what action they consider necessary. But until the Minister has been given an opportunity of explaining the situation, it is not in the best interests of the Forces that too much publicity should be given to military matters. The honourable member for North Sydney, and others, also referred to the question of the pay of non-commissioned officers in the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery. On several occasions during the last two or three months, the Minister has said that certain increases have been agreed to, and that these increases will date back to the ist JulyBut they cannot be paid until the Estimates are passed. It is true that some of the non-commissioned officers are not set down for increases this year, but, if I mistake not, some of themthe staff sergeants, for instance-durin g the regime of this Government, have had their pay increased from £138 to £156 per annum. If that increase was made last year, or the year before, it was scarcely to be expected that they would receive an increase this year. Some of the non-commissioned officers-maste r gunners of the first, second, and third classes, as well as regimental sergeant-majors, and others are having their pay increased, while in other directions avenues for promotion are being extended in such a manner that the possi bilities of promotion, with subsequent increases of pay, are greater than they were. I hope that, in the circumstances, we shall not be unduly pressed in this respect. The Minister has given his promise that certain increases will be made, and I have no reason to believe that that promise will not be fulfilled at the earliest possible moment. Necessarily, in for its fulfilment, but I do see in these Estimates provision made for increases in the pay of staff officers. Central Administration Staff are receiving increases which, in the opinion of the Minister, are commensurate with the added responsibility of their position, their wider",51,Elliot Johnson I Would Of Such A Ruling Would Be To Place Every

Some are receiving increases, but a goodly number of them are being left, so to speak, at the post. They are "" non-starters "" this year in the matter of increased salaries. I feel that the Minister must have had.exceptionally good ground for granting each increase much good to the man who is not receiving an increase. honourable member should regard my statement as something in the nature of sophistry. No doubt, the fact that Justices of the High Court receive .£3,000 a year is very little consolation to the man who is working with his pick and shovel for only 8s. a day. I do not wish to bring my illustration nearer home, but doubtless there are many persons in Australia who are not being remunerated, at all events in the shape of a cash equivalent, for their labours to the same degree as appertains to political service. which the Minister has granted have been well considered, and, in the circumstances, are justifiable. called to items in the Estimates suggesting increases in pay, where, in reality, no increase has been made. The fact that in respect of one office £600 or ,£700 is being expended this year, as compared with £550 last year, does not necessarily mean that an increase of salary has been granted. It merely means that the services in question were not continuous, and that the whole of -the salary available for the office was, therenecessary, and I am sure that it would before, not used. There have been increases in the lower grades, and further increases will be paid to many of the non-commissioned officers as soon as these Estimates are passed. year to year, if anomalies as to pay are made plain, the Minister will take the earliest opportunity of rectifying them. I desire now to refer to the complaints of delay in the construction of rifle ranges, and the unfounded allegation that the permanent -officers as a body are not over-sympathetic with our rifle-club men. -statement does not do the honourable member credit. It is based on mere supposition. The honourable member may suppose -what he pleases; but if his supposition takes the form of a reflection upon persons employed in the Federal Servicei t is scarcely fair. officers sympathetic with the rifle clubs? keenly appreciates our Citizen Forces, and who believes that they must be our defenders in the future, the small Permanent Force simply discharging administrative and instructional duties, I do not hesitate to say that in my opinion there is no feeling against the Militia on the part of the permanent officers. I have the very greatest admiration for our riflemen, and for the services which they freely and cheerfully render in perfecting themselves in a branch of defence that will be most useful should we be called upon to protect ourselves. After careful investigation, I do not believe that there exists on the part of our permanent officers any want of sympathy with the rifle club movement. Let me say at once that if it came under my notice that a permanent officer, no matter what I am confident that the increases his rank, displayed a want of sympathy in that direction, I should use to the very utmost whatever influence I possessed to My attention has been secure his removal from office. The establishment of rifle clubs, and the encouragement of riflemen to perfect themselves as marksmen, is part of the policy of Australia, and it would not do for any permanent officer to set himself in opposition to it. As a citizen, he may vote as he pleases; but if , as a permanent officer, he set himself against the established policy of the country, drastic action would be taken by the Minister. Much difficulty unfortunately exists in increasing the number of our rifle ranges. In the first place, the great increase in our Forces has necesI feel confident that from sitated a great increase in the number of targets and ranges. Rifle ranges are called into use more frequently than was previously the case, and riflemen have undoubtedly had to submit to some little inconvenience. In securing ranges and erecting targets many difficulties are experienced, and these are just as annoying and as disconcerting to the Minister and the Department as they are to honourable members generally. I wish to'assure the Committee that neither the Minister nor his Department has been guilty of any intentional delay.

The next question is where that range shall be secured, and the difficulty is to find a convenient piece of ground for the purpose. been found, difficulties often occur in acquiring it. In New South Wales, for instance, we have to appeal to the Minister of Lands, who, perhaps, finds himself helpless in the matter. He in turn has to appeal to some such body as the Pastoral Board, which in turn may have to appeal to some such institution as the Rabbit Destruction League, and so forth. These difficulties having been surmounted, we have to obtain the permission of the local council to fire over a particular area. frankly admit that at times a difference of opinion occurs between the Department and the owners of land thought to be suitable for rifle range purposes. That difficulty has to be surmounted before the range can be established. fair to expect that because a man believing that he has the Government in the hollow of his hand, asks £ 1 0 0 for a block worth only £ 5 0 , the Department should say, "" Very well, take what you want."" However anxious we may be to establish rifle ranges, we must have regard for the responsibility attaching to the expenditure of public moneys. I am confident that the Minister and his department are anxious to facilitate the work of the rifle clubs by providing rifle ranges and targets with the utmost speed; and whilst annoying delays have occurred, I am hopeful that there will be less friction in the future.

In the centre of a magnificent harbour there is a landlocked bay, in which, for a very small expenditure, a dock could be constructed to accommodate any ship coming to Australia, and especially our war-ships. I think that this matter was brought forward last year by the honourable member for Denison. Anybody who is familiar with the ABC of naval matters will recognise that there ought to be some kind of dock here in which our war-ships can be repaired.

On reference to page 147 of the Estimates it will be seen that the net increase in the cost of the Department for the current financial year over the actual cost for the year 1911-12 is .£11,738. Included in that sum are increments to salaries, both automatic and those provided on the recommendation of the Public Service Commissioner, £1,753, leaving a balance of only ,£9,983 of increase. The amount proposed to be expended before the 30th June next on works and buildings, acquisition of land, and other services under the control of the Department, exclusive of the construction of the trans-Australian railway. is .£2.188,316. The actual expenditure during the financial year 1911-12 was .£921,220, the expenditure now proposed showing an increase of ,£1,267,096. So that while there is an increase in the estimated expenditure upon works, land, and other services of ,£1,267,096, the extra net cost of the Department is only .£9,983, exclusive of increments to salaries. The net increased cost, namely, .£9,983, is accounted for principally by the provision in these Estimates for permanent positions in the Lands and Survey Branch.

I do so because, having commented on the singular fact that in a batch of testimonials submitted in Mr Chinn's favour there was not one of a technical character, some four months later the deficiency was supplied, or professed to be supplied, by certain testimonials that were published to the country and certain statements were made in connection with them. I shall briefly discuss the position thus created. Any one who looks carefully at those testimonials will agree that they have much in common. No doubt all testimonials have family features, but in those to which I refer these features are very much more pronounced than was to be expected in productions by different people, written at different times. monials are all characterized by the same extravagant adjectives, the same ponderous sentences, and the same exaggerated tone of praise. This is somewhat singular, as they are alleged to have been written by level-headed, practical, business men, some of whom possess only the ordinary educational acquirements, and would disclaim ability to write any remarkable literary production. The information that I am about to put before the Committee was not sought by me in any special sense, but, to a large extent, has been supplied. AfterI criticised Mr Chinn's appointment, a considerable number of communications were sent to me which I could not make public until I had verified, to my own satisfaction, the statements that they contained, but having made the necessary inquiries, I propose to give the result to the Committee. My observations will be specially directed to those testimonials upon which particular emphasis has been laid as giving that force to the application of Mr Chinn which it previously lacked. The first which I wish to read is from' Messrs. Garnsworthy and Smith, contractors. It is dated "" Collinsstreet west, Melbourne, 14th August, 1898,"" and is as followsDEAR SIR,At your request, we have much pleasure in committing to paper our appreciation of the valuable services rendered by you as our engineer in connection with various contracts carried out by us under the Public Works and Railway Departments and Melbourne Harbor Trust. The construction of the new entrance to the Gippsland Lakes was a work that necessitated more than the ordinary amount of foresight and skill, and we are confident the successful issue was only brought about by the untiring energy and exceptional ability displayed by you. So much' were we impressed with you on the above works that we determined to engage you on all future contracts, and, in every instance, for a period of about eleven years, your professional knowledge on all classes of works proved invaluable to us. It would be hard to single out any particular branch of engineering to eulogize you on, for you are equally familiar with harbour and river works, sewerage, and railway construction, and as the sewerage works of Melbourne were some of the most dimcult ever carried out in Australia, the successful issue you brought our contracts to demands the highest praise from us.

But I was not altogether satisfied of the correctness of the statements in the testimonial, and, having had some indication of the direction in which to investigate, I made a few inquiries. For instance, I asked the Government of Victoria what was the nature of the work carried out by Messrs. Garnsworthy and Smith in connection with the making of the Gippsland Lakes Entrance; whether they had been, as we are given to understand in the testimonial, the contractors for practically the whole of that work; and whether, under them, Mr the Minister that that applies with a great Chinn carried it to a successful issue. This is the letter which I received from the Secretary to the Department of Public Works, Victoria, in reply to my inquiries20th November, 1012. SIR, With reference to your further inquiries in the matter, I beg to inform you that the amount expended to date at the Gippsland Lakes Entrance is ^136,000. The plans and specifications were prepared, and the work supervised by the Public Works Department. I wish the Committee to take notice of that. of pretty well all Government work. had better not speak too quickly, lest he be sorry afterwardsMessrs.

Yet, in the testimonial, we are given to understand that they were responsible for practically the whole work, and that Mr Chinn was the man who brought operations to a successful issue.

Having read it, he expressed the utmost surprise at it ; and when I asked whether Mr Chinn was responsible for carrying out their little bit of a contract, he assured me that the If we had full extent of Mr Chinn's connection with it was that they had'referred to him a few times in regard to certain minor features of the work.

It has been stated that Messrs. Garnsworthy and Smith had, amongst other large contracts, the construction of a railway line from Kelly Basin, on the west coast of Tasmania, to Mount Lyell field. Mr Smith states to me that his firm did not construct the railway from Kelly Basin to Mount Lyell field. They had a contract in conStrahan to the Mount Lyell district; but I am informed that Mr Chinn had nothing whatever to do with that contract. Seeing that Mr Chinn has been given a great amount of credit for overcoming engineering difficulties in connection with the line from Kelly Basin to the Mount Lyell field, I prosecuted my inquiries still further, thinking that, perhaps, a mistake had been made in confusing the two lines.

Evidently Chinn must then have studied the Australian patents granted to Dr. Goldschmidt, and finding that a certain patent did not apply to South Australia, he, in company with another Adelaide gentleman, manufactured by the well-known Thermit formula a welding compound, which he called "" Kalipsite,"" and for which he applied for a Commonwealth patent. Dr. Goldschmidt, the inventor of the ""Thermi t "" Welding System, opposed Chinn's patent application.

Ever since M.r. Chinn has been in office he has -carried out our orders, and has conducted cur business in an economical way. Until some specific charges are made against him I am not going to listen to slanderous rumours. I wonder how many of us would be here if we had to do as the old Roman candidates were required to do. Having enveloped themselves in white shrouds, they had to walk the streets of Rome, and if any one pelted stones or dirt at them they had to retire. How many of us could pass through such an ordeal? Where are all these pure people? It is all very well to drag up a man's past and to show where he may have been unfortunate, but the fact remains that only two out of every hundred men in the world succeed. All the rest are failures. They fail in regard to everything they touch, because they do not operate on systematic business methods. They can talk well. member is one of the two? plain what I do, although I am not a great talker. The honourable member for Perth says that Mr Falkingham, junior, feels confident that his father did not give Mr Chinn the certificate to which reference has been made. Wouldi t not be fairer for the honourable member to make these statements outside, and to give Mr Chinn a chance to make him prove them in the Supreme Court? I have never said io this House what I would not be prepared to say outside. I have declared from the housetops that I shall never sack a man because of statements made about him by any one else. I like to prove a man's I ability.

My honourable friend says that the address ""Brighton"" appears at the top of the certificate alleged to have been given by Mr Falkingham, although that gentleman had left Brighton three years before the date in question. As to that, I have only to say that I issued an order that the officers of my Department were not in future to commence their official letters with the words "" I have the honour,"" & c , or to conclude with, "" I am your humble, obedient servant."" Such a thing is humiliating; but because some of these old humiliating forms, that had come down from the early ages, happened to be in my Department one of my officers recently used a few of them. When I inquired why he had done so, he said, "" The paper was in the office, and we thought that we might as well use it up."" Does my honourable friend say that, although Mr Falkingham had left Brighton before the date given on the certificate, he could not have used paper bearing his old address ?

IRVINE -It is not a matter of "" putting out"" the honourable member. The question is rather whether some inquiry should not be made. It will be remembered that when Mr Chinn was appointed to the very responsible position of supervising engineer of a section of the great trans-Australian railway, the strongest dress which he had relinquished three years doubts were expressed in the House as to whether his qualifications warranted his apmonial. I think that the House should pointment. It was pointed out that there was no evidence that he had ever been engaged in a responsible position on any large engineering work. We were then told by the Minister that he did not require testimonials, that he did not want evidence of experience, because he himself knew that Mr Chinn was capable of carrying out this very responsible work. We are now told by the Minister that, since his appointment, Mr Chinn has ""made good."" With very great humility, I venture to express some doubt as to whether the Minister is a sufficient judge of the technical ability of Mr Chinn. subordinate officer. The engineer in charge is responsible for the work, and not Mr ber were to bring forward a perfectly Chinn. Mr W. H . IRVINE Mr Chinn is the engineer in charge of the construction of that portion of the line. Earlier in the session, grave doubts were expressed as to whether his qualifications were sufficient to reasons why a prudent Minister should say, fit him for this very important position. When the matter was debated here, the same kind of answer was given to the criticism in which honourable members indulged as the Minister has favoured us with tonight. It was very amusing and very interesting from his point of view, but he merely turned all the arguments which had been advanced into a burlesque. Shortly afterwards, the matter was debated in deny another place, and, at a very late stage, the testimonials which should have been brought forward at the beginning as a justihe worked for him under such conditions asfication for Mr Chinn's appointment were rendered it impossible for Mr Falkingham produced. These are the testimonials upon senior to give a testimonial in such terms. dilated. I must say that there are one or son made a statutory declaration? Why two statements made in. the letters which does not the honourable member call upon have been read which demand the attention him to do that ? of the Government. In the first place, unless each of these persons whose evidence pel him to do that? has been read by the honourable member for Perth is deliberately lying, Mr Chinn never could have obtained these testimonials. Regarding the one from Mr Falkingham, the statement is made that it was impossible for Mr Chinn to get it, inasmuch as the former had left the house from which it is alleged to have been addressed three years previously. Of course, it is possibleham may have preserved some letter-paper with his former address upon it-a n adbefore-and upon which he wrote that testihave an opportunity of seeing the originals . of these testimonials. Moreover, the least the Minister can do is to cause an inquiry to be made into these allegations. But, instead ot doing thai, he has adopted the easy course of challenging the honourable member ior Perth to say outside of this Chamber what he has said inside of it. That is the last refuge of a man who has no other argument to bring forward. To challenge the honourable member to make his statements outside this House is an unwarrantable thing. It is a challenge to the honourable member to throw aside the protection which Parliament extends to us all. We are not to say whether the statements contained in these letters are true or untrue. Of course, if an honourable memscandalous statement, and one without any tittle of foundation, he would be abusing his parliamentary privilege. But where statements are produced which are not of that character, I submit that they constitute "" This is a matter which ought to be investigated."" But we have statements made not merely in regard to Mr Falkingham's testimonials. If it can be proved that that testimonial is probably not genuine, the whole fabric raised in support of Mr Chinn's appointment falls to the ground. that Mr Chinn worked for his father. Mr W. H .

They use the term "" untiring energy and exceptional ability."" proceedsTo hear of his further success will give not only me great pleasure, but the great body of contractors, with whom he is deservedly popular, and it is due to him to state that he is an encharge. gineer of exceptional ability, and that no more competent and popular gentleman in his profession is known to me.

He writes as follows:was employed by my father as engineer in charge of construction on almost all the contracts my father carried out. Mr Chinn was contract in New South Wales for about six months, the other a sewerage contract in Picklesstreet, South Melbourne, for about three months.

Mr W. H. IRVINE -There i not s merely this one case, which alone would demand the fullest inquiry, but there are the other cases, in which the claim has been brought forward that Mr Chinn [261] Estimates. 7289 did great work, and men who know about the thing swear that he did not, and had April, 1903, my fathei no responsibility for the work. A stronger case for inquiry has never been made out, and the matter cannot be left to rest where it is. It is no answer to say that the honourable member should go outside, and assume the responsibility of proving things which are not capable of proof by him. It is the duty of an honourable member to whom statements of this kind come, to put them before Parliament, in train for inquiry by a Committee of the House, or by.the Minister, in order that the truth of the allegations on one side or the other may be established. This case having been made out, matters cannot remain as they are. With the doubts that have been raised, backed up by these independent letters and information which will appear in Hansard, how is it possible for the matWhy should ter to be allowed to rest where it is? I do not believe that honourable members on either side will think of that. The case requires investigation. If a Committee or a Commission be appointed, it will have power to compel all these persons to come before it, and to swear to what is written. It they cannot, Mr Chinn will be relieved of all the aspersions or implications thrown on him by their letters. If they can prove their statements, they will have made a case which he will have to disprove. One or the other must be done. under the standing order. I have the right to make another speech, I take up the challenge of honourable members of the Labour party, and give chapter iii. of this case, and as soon as I get the proof copy of the report of my speech, I shall repeat what T have said outside, word for word, at the earliest possible opportunity. that. shall do it. This man Chinn is a worthless scoundrel and imposter, and members of the Government are aware of it. At the time when he was alleged to be carrying on a highly lucrative business in Melbourne, his motherless children were being left in such a state of neglect that they had to be taken charge of and brought up by relatives. Let me tell the Committee the circumstances under which Mr Chinn left Victoria in a hurry.

319,O'malley,"He was apMr FOWLER I have said it, and Ia certain-person holding a very high position in this State, in connection with certain moneys which they wished to lend out to farmers at low rates of interest. The business man was asked if he could put the lenders in communication with farmers needing loans of money. He took the trouble to communicate with a friend, then in business in the northern parts of Victoria, who at present holds a responsible position in the Government of this State. This gentleman on being communicated with arranged to drive the individual who had alleged that he had money to lend, to see some farmers. This individual made a pretence of inspecting some farms, said that the security was good, and that the money would be lent. He then levied the inspection fees, and that was the last that was heard of the matter, so far as he was concerned. The gentleman who worked that swindle was Mr Henry Chinn, the man who was appointed by this Government to superintend the construction of a portion of the Western Australian railway, who has been championed and defended by this Government right through until now. The business man, finding that Mr Chinn had disappeared, went to his alleged cotrustee, and asked him about the affair. The alleged co-trustee said that Mr Chinn had no money to lend in connection with him,, and probably none at all, and that, as a matter of fact, the business man had been ""got at."" That is a good many years ago. I come now to a later episode. About six years since there was a great outcry in Western Australia about goldstealing at the Kalgoorlie mines. It was pretty well known that large quantities of gold were disappearing in a mysterious fashion, and the difficulty was to find, not only who was stealing the gold, but who was getting away with it and disposing of it. An inquiry was set afoot, and although the results of the inquiry were never published, I believe that some very interesting evidence was forthcoming. I aro in a position to prove that during this period when there was so much -anxiety stealing, Mr Henry Chinn was trying to dispose of a parcel of gold in Perth, not at the Mint, but to a private buyer, if he could find one, at £2 an ounce-about half its value. first acts, after being appointed to his present position, was to get into communication with a firm which has a certain Mr Fowler. patent process from which it naturally desires to get some advantage. He informed the Melbourne manager of the firm of his appointment, and said that in all probability he would be able to throw some big business in his way, but. that there should be a commission on it. The words he used in connection with this suggestion of a commission were that the manager would have to talk to him, not in hundreds, but in thousands, of pounds. This is the gentleman whom the Minister of Home Affairs has stood up on the floor of the Chamber to-night to defend, and whose appointment the Government has endeavoured to justify. Ministers areprepared to stick to Mr Henry Chinn through thick and thin. Are they goingto do it now? I challenge them to take up the gauntlet at the earliest opportunity that I have thrown down. Mr W. H . IRVINE What was the firm ?

But I ask the Minister whether the Government does not, under the circumstances, propose to take the necessary steps for a full and fair inquiry into these charges. sides will agree that, having regard to the allegations, made apparently on excellent authority, the employ^ of the Government who has been mentioned, and against whom the charges have been levelled, has as much interest in the early holding of an inquiry of the fullest and frankest kind as have those who have made the charges. Under the circumstances, I ask the Minister whether he will make a statement now, or whether he will undertake to consult his colleagues on this subject. to rest as it stands. and serious injustice is being done to an innocent man, or there is an officer in a Ministerial Department who has no title to hold any office of trust. In view of the statements that have been made this evening, I say at once I think it necessary and due to the country that some inquiry should be made into the position of Mr Chinn. ments which have been made are true, Mr the Government to make investigation. Chinn is not a suitable man for his position. vernment, there should be an inquiry to ascertain whether they are true. not one of those who contend that an honourable member is bound, to make such statements as these outside the House. Mr W. H .

The honourable member for Perth has made very grave charges against Mr Chinn. I say frankly that I never heard a stronger case yet stated against any man in my life. If this man has been ""guilty of selling gold at £ 2 an ounce in Perth it. gold at that price, the matter ought to be sifted to the very bottom. I know that, ten years ago or so, gold stealing was common in Kalgoorlie and the Boulder. I happened to be there at the time, and I know that in some cases the charges were proved, Honourable members on both though in other cases the offenders were not found out. If gold is offered at £ 2 an ounce, there is something wrong, for gold can be sold at its full value at any time. Of course, I do not say that the charges made are true, but no honourable member would make charges of the kind unless he had evidence to support them; and there ought to be an inquiry. If these charges, or any one of them, can be proved, this officer should not hold his position one moment longer. On the other hand, if the charges are incorrect, then an inquiry will only do justice to Mr Chinn himself; at The matter cannot .be allowed any rate, he cannot rest under the stigma Either a very grave that has been placed upon him.

Of course, if what the honourable member for Perth says about Mr is going to repeat his speech outside. AlChinn is true, Mr Chinn cannot hold such a position-that is all. generally like to be on the side of the ""under dog."" I can carry my mind back to a time when in the Victorian State Parliament I endeavoured to have an inquiry into the scamping of the contract for this Parliament House. The present Leader of the Opposition here was a member of that Parliament; and the man who would not accept a bribe, but refused to pass the plastering, that is a disgrace to the Queen's Hall, and the man who refused to pass the stone used to build the Law Courts in this State, were sacked. O'Loghlen also endeavoured to have an inquiry made, but the power of the contractors in the House was sufficient to prevent it. If any one looks at the stone in the Melbourne Law Courts, from the second story upwards, he will find every single stone spotted like the Dalmatian dogs that follow carriages. Every stone had to be tested by a model stone, but that model stone disappeared, and a reward by the Government, supplemented with a reward of £ 1 0 0 from the contractors, failed to secure its return. Every single stone in the second story of the Law Courts is a disgrace and a dishonour to the contractors for the building. Again, I tried to get justice when Sir Henry Wrixon was Attorney-General in the State Parliament, by means of an inquiry in the case of Silas Harding, who was proved to have committed wilful and corrupt perjury, and yet he was allowed to die in his bed as an innocent man. I am glad that the Minister of Home Affairs is prepared to have an inquiry, because I do not believe that Mr to decorate their heads, and very dirty wigs Chinn is as bad as he is painted. I believe that he is able to do his work, and I have yet to know that the head of his Department has contradicted the fact that he has line. correct. correct; and, at any rate, it has nothing to do with the charges that have been made. track was made by another man altogether. ber for Perth has the courage to say that he though I do not desire thai, he should do so, I know of nothing more courageous. challenged me to do so. honourable member for Flinders, who represents a minority that sent him into this House. I was somewhat amused with the legal twist that that honourable member put on the matter when he said that the wording of the letters was somewhat similar. We naturally ask for testimonials of persons whom we do not know; and, after all, sons do not know all their fathers do. As for the testimonial being taken from an address Sir Bryan occupied by the writer three years before, I last week received a letter that had been sent to my address of twenty years ago, and that letter was from a scientific society. Of course, we know that equity barrister style that the honourable member for Flinders always displays, and his tones are so ponderous that we should be really impressed if we did not know him. I hope that, for Mr Chinn's sake, an inquiry will be held; but it should be arranged that Mr Chinn should not be mulcted in law costs, for his salary is not big enough to bear them. It is only right that the Government should bear the cost of such an inquiry regarding one of their officers. I had three afternoon experiences in the High Court, and I should not wish a Newfoundland dog to be tried in that way. In that case there were 150 sworn declarations, and it would have cost £2,000 to try to get justice. Sometimes when we read judgments we wonder where the Judges get their sense. We know that they go to the tail of the horse in order they have sometimes. A Judge occupies the very highest position, but some of them sit silent when the most terrible perjury is being committed.

The honourable member will correct me if I am wrong; but I understand that one of the documents read in relation to that employ^ purports to be a forgery. That document, I am told, represents Mr Chinn as a man of competency in his profession, and speaks highly of him in other respects, and it is said that that document is not true, and that the fact that it is not true is known to ably involve an expenditure of over Mr Chinn himself. If that be so, of course a state of affairs is created that makes it due to the Government, the House, and only fair to Mr Chinn himself, that early and ample opportunity should be afforded him to defend himself against those charges. Mr J. H .

I should like to direct attention to the item ""storage and seasoning of timber,"" under which head ,£4,320 was voted last year, and £1,549 spent. I understood that some two years ago the Minister of Home Affairs announced that it was his intention to erect in some centres in Australia depots where the various wood and timbers of the States could be seasoned and made available for the use of the Government as they were required. We are now undertaking works of great magnitude in connection with which enormous quantities of timber will be required. By way of illustration, I would point out that the sleepers required on the railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, and for the projected line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, will prob£4,000,000. Surely the Minister, having regard to his business capacity, does not propose that we should make no effort to secure the best timbers available for the purpose. I have, on many occasions during the session, impressed upon the Minister the desirableness of attending to this matter ber allow me to interrupt him for a moment ? ister and Treasurer) [9.17] I have asked the honourable member for Perth privately whether he will be good enough to lay on the table the papers which he has used, and which I presume are original documents, so that they will be in the possession of the House, and can be dealt with in a formal manner. If he will intimate his willingness to do so, a difficulty will be removed. In connection with the construction of the Federal Capital,"" vast quantities of timber will also be used, and we can obtain the best value for our money only by taking steps to secure seasoned woods. There are different processes of seasoning. The Minister has mentioned two or three, and we all know that by up-ending timber in stacks beneficial results are naturally secured.

Regarding one instance,, Government make a definite statement bein which only about £ 8 0 was involved, F fore the Public Woiks Committee of New had about six letters. It is very unbusibe adopted in the matter of linking up the Federal Capital by rail with the port of Jervis Bay. Ministers keep their promises. The Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence, and the Minister of Home Affairs recognise the necessity for an extension of the line from Bomaderry to Jervis Bay. But the Minister knows perfectly well that that extension cannot be carried out until a definite statement of the policy of the Commonwealth Government is put before the New South Wales Public Works Committee. Surveys of the line from Yass-Canberra to Jervis Bay have already been ""made. The Minister sent one officer, in the person of Captain Chambers, to give evidence before the New South Wiales Public Works Committee, but he was unable to give that body any real information. I desire that the Minister should see that the policy of the Government in connection with linking up the Federal Capital with the port of Jervis. 'Bay by means of a railway is put before that Committee. If the Government do not intend to undertake the construction of that line, it will mean saying good-bye to an extension from Bomaderry to the Naval College. In all probability the Committee, which is now favorable to the extension, subject to the policy of the Federation being put before, it, will, before long, go out of existence. Therefore, the Government should deal with the matter quickly. It has beenbefore them for the last twelve months. I ask the Minister to see that the Committee is informed of the Government's policy, so that the works may be carried out.

A condition of success and efficiency is concentration, and it is high time that the Home Affairs Department was revolutionized. Affairs is carrying out the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, and the Minister of External Affairs is constructing a railway in the Northern Territory. It is a serious matter to have several authorities constructing railways without suitable plant or a properly organized Department.

The business of the Home Affairs Department has been added to until things there are in a chaotic state We also need something in the nature of a Public Works Committee. Each of the State Governments, whose expenditure is considerable, informs its Parliament what it intends to do, what plans it is proceeding on, what are the purposes in view, and all other details concerning proposals for which money is asked. however, have to vote money without knowing how it is to be spent. We need a Public Works Committee, or an expert Board of Inquiry, and the sooner we have one, the better.

Certainly, there must be inquiries. The At present the Minister of Home State Governments, who spend only a tithe of what we spend on public works, provide for this investigation. The Commonwealth, however, makes no investigation. Parliament votes the money, and has then done with the whole concern.

Victorian members ought to understand that the Federal Capital is not going to be the great incubus that they imagine on the Commonwealth. is a paying concern. sand pounds have been spent in the Federal Territory, but already a good income is being derived by the Commonwealth; so that the net loss is very small indeed. In my judgment, the Federal Territory ultimately ought not to cost Australia one penny, and it will not if the business is gone about in The Commonwealth Parliament, the right way. The growth and development of the city itself will pay for its building and construction; and the sooner we begin in a sensible business-like way to put the whole Territory under Commission, the better it will be.

When my time expired this afternoon, I was pointing out that, at the Flinders naval base, the Defence Department is undertaking the excavating work, while the Home Affairs Department will follow on with the building, and a similar Btate of divided authority can be found in the Northern Territory. I presume that the Minister of External Affairs is going to construct the railways in the Northern Territory, so that I suppose the two Departments will be competing in order to show which can do the best and cheapest jobs. The Minister of External Affairs has quite enough to do with his Land Ordinances, the employment of niggers at 3s. a day, and the milking of the cows of the Administrator, without also undertaking the work of constructing railways. With the rapid acquisition of ""powers taken over from the States, the conditions are now very different from what they were originally; and the time is ripe for re-adjustment and reconstruction, particularly in the case of the Home Affairs Department, which should be put on a more scientific up-to-date basis, with a clear distinction drawn between its constructive and its administrative work. I do not say that all the work ought to be done by this Department, but the scientific training necessary for the efficient performance of the work ought to reside in the Department, and all public works of prime importance ought to be under the supervision of the expert staff. duplication of work. not done? We shall never have efficiency and economy in the construction of public works until we have concentration and Minister has been very unfortunate in the special ability. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [10.10] I am quite amazed to hear from the honourable member for Nepean that the question of the Liverpool manceuvre area has not been settled. For two years or more negotiations of one kind and another have been in progress, and the time has arrived when there ought to be some detailed statement showing exactly in what Department or branch the delay is occurring. It is nothing short ber for Nepean has to rise in his placeI suppose I have heard him at least one hundred times-to ask why this work has receive more attention and experience less delay in the Department of Home Affairs than in any other Department, and I am very sorry to have to refer to it in anything that appears like adverse criticism. But all these promises about completing the work next week, or in February, are not good enough for me, and I do not see why there should not be formed a party of New South Wales members on both sides of the House to hold up the business until this matter has been finally dealt with. This manoeuvre area is not in my electorate, but, as a representative of New South Wales, I must enter my protest against what can only be described as humbug; and certainly we ought to be given day and date as to the cause of the delay. If the honourable member for Nepean cannot get any notice taken of him as an individual member, I am quite prepared to join with him in seeing whether any more attention will be paid to an organized effort.

The land-owners concerned are really poor people; but, although the amounts involved are not large, the whole question is of great importance to them. The only other matter to which I desire to refer is that of the allowances made to Electoral Registrars and officers associated with the Electoral Branch, who have cast upon them a large volume of electoral work. public servants connected with post-offices. The allowance made to them is wholly inadequate. An immense amount of valuable work is done by these officers, and I would ask the Minister to give the matter his attention, and to increase the amount of remuneration that is paid to these officers. I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to the slow progress that is being made in preparing plans for the Federal Capital buildings.

Some honourable members are very anxious to know how matters are proceeding in that connection. AlthoughI am a military man, I am not altogether in favour of the acquisition of that manceuvre area. I think it is a bad thing to have a fixed area in which to carry out manoeuvres every year, for the reason that officers who attend those manoeuvres become thoroughly familiar with every physical feature of the country. They know where the positions of vantage are. They know where there are unfordable creeks, and fences which they must not break through, and this knowledge reduces the manoeuvres practically to a farce. It is all very well to set apart a portion of the Liverpool area for big-gun practice, because in the future it will be difficult to secure sufficient land in the vicinity of Sydney to enable big-gun practice to be carried out. But, for a manceuvre area, I do not altogether approve of a fixed site. However, matters have proceeded so far that I suppose the Liverpool area will be taken over by the Commonwealth. We have a magnificent manceuvre area in the Federal Territory-ther e is no better in the world. I am very pleased to know that a Light Horse encampment is to be held there next Easter. That, in a sense, obviates the necessity for resuming the Liverpool area. One of the reasons why I am opposed to the acquisition of that area is that the country is not at all suitable for the manoeuvring of troops. Half of it is very scrubby, and in a wet season it is almost impossible to get about it. The finest manceuvre area in Australia is in the Federal Territory. In regard to the Federal Capital, my own opinion is that if the city is built in accordance with the plan which is displayed' in the Queen's Hal] there will be no cause for complaint by posterity. I think that' that plan is a very excellent one. I have examined it carefully, and, although I am not an expert in town planning, I think that the officers of the Department of Home Affairs who have manufactured it out of the four premiated planB must know something about the business. I know that they are capable men. Colonel Miller is a very capable officer, and Colonel Owen is a capable engineer. Mr Scrivener, too, is a surveyor of high repute. I think we should be absolutely safe in leaving the preparation of the plan of the Federal City to the judgment of these officers. There is just one other matter connected with this subject to which I should like to refer. I presume that the magnificent stretch of water which is shown in the plan in front of the City is to be created by damming the Molonglo and Queanbeyan Rivers. Now, the stream which flows down those rivers, although it is better than it is represented to be by some honourable members, is not suflicient to fill that lake. Has any provision been made for constructing weirs and reservoirs in order that that lake may be kept full ? sufficient. On the whole, matters are proceeding in a satisfactory manner in connection with the Federal Capital. One honourable member has complained because the plans for the Parliament House there are not yet available. with them. to get those plans. The first work which should be proceeded with is that of providing a scheme of city drainage and water supply. on that work now. sewerage system yet. system or a septic-tank system before we can have a large body of men employed in erecting the necessary buildings at the Federal Capital. I believe that tenders will scon be returnable in connection with the building of the power-house there. That -is the first essential. The electrical power will be used for boring under the Murrumbidgee River, and for conducting the waters of the Cotter River to a reservoir, from which they will be conveyed to the city. I do not think that honourable members need worry because the plans for the parliamentary buildings at Yass-Canberra are not yet ready. A lot of work has to be done before those buildings are proceeded with, although I wish that this Parliament was located there now, because I live within 30 miles of it.

453,Mr Ryrie,"We must have a drainageFederal Capital, I strongly object to the circular which he issued in which he ordered the granting of absolute preference to unionists. That was a fatal mistake. He should realize that all Australians have the right to be employed in the service of their country. The Public Service should not be a close borough for any set of men. There should not be a distinction between men who join unions and those who choose not to do so. Is the union label to be the badge of citizenship? Whatever may be done industrially by unions, there should be no distinction in the Public Service. A man should be allowed to work in the Public Service whether he is a unionist or not. The only preference to unionists that we can countenance is that given by a Court after taking into consideration the circumstances of the case. If a Court chooses to give preference to unionists, that is another matter. It is a wrong thing for the Minister to say that absolute preference must be given to unionists in his Department.

To-night, he has told the Minister to go slowly, that there is no need pays taxes is in the Government union, and to spend money on the Capital. Does it all have a right to equal treatment by the relieve him of responsibility that some^ Government.

The honourable members for Indi and Melbourne Ports have made themselves ridiculous with their statements about the water supply of the Capital. My suggestion is that the construction of the Capital should be put under commission at the earliest moment possible, and that Commission should start to work with a will. This should relieve the nervous tension of the honourable members. I have mentioned. I wish now to refer to another matter. The honourable member for Corio is writing stuff about me, and I take the opportunity to correct some of his statements. He is quoting something I said in this Chamber seven or eight years ago about preference to unionists. The unionism of which I was speaking has never, so far as I know, asked a man whether he was a unionist before allowing him to get a job. In my time the miners of Lithgow did not ask a man to join a union before allowing him to take a job; but after he had been at work a fortnight and had had his coal weighed, and other things done for him by the check weighman arranged The between citizens in the expenditure of ister of Home Affairs) [10.55] i w th r e Government of New South Wales, some time ago, agreed to resume the land, the charged for it ; but, in the end, we could not come to an understanding over some",78,Department Of Home Affairs

When I go out to buy for King O'Malley, I say, "" How much?"" The other party says so much, and I say, "" I will take her,"" or I leave her. But in public matters I have the Crown Solicitor to consult, and the laws under which compulsory acquisition is carried out. brought to bear, or what may be said about rae, I cannot move faster than the snail's pace which is set.

As to the Capital design, it is now hanging in the Queen's Hall. The honourable member for Parramatta made some remarks about public works, and the Prime Minister himself put forward a similar suggestion some time ago. However, we are not ready yet to inaugurate a general Works Department, but we shall, I think, be able to do so at the commencement of next session.
