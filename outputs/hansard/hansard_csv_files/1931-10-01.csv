The answers supplied to questions on the 17th and 28th July contained further in accuracies. Estimates for the Department of Home Affairs, the Minister said, in effect, that in Canberra only the travelling unemployed were receiving the dole That, however, is not the case. August a letter written by P. Kestel appeared in the Canberra Times coin cerning a statement previously made by the Minister that only the travelling unemployed received the dole. A portion of the letter readsTlie crowning effort, however, is contained in the statement reported to have been made when the House was discussing the Estimates, "" That in the Federal Capital Territory we have been able to avoid paying the dole to residents"", and the further statement "" Only to the travelling unemployed is the dole paid "". The facts are that hundreds of ration orders have been issued by the Home Affairs Department to bona fide residents in Canberra, who have been in the past regular employees of the Administration. Orders are still being issued to such residents. The department some time a.go deputed an officer to spend the whole of his time in examining the applications for relief of such resident unemployed, and none other. It is well known that travelling unemployed who are not bona fide residents receive their orders direct from the police. The ears of the Minister would surely have burned could he have "" listened in "" to the laughter and derision with which his statement was received and discussed by gangs of workers and unemployed all over , the territory, many of whom, unfortunately, have had occasion to apply and accept ration orders from the Acton branch of the department. Tlie writer also asked how long Parliament and the community must suffer such palpable misrepresentation. The statements contained in that letter are in accord with the official report supplied by the department on the 28th August, I withdraw them. covering the week ended the 21st August, 1931. Kations were issued by the Department ""of Home Affairs, Federal Capital Territory, last week, to 120 itinerant unemployed, and 124 local single men, and 10 married residents. This statement amounts to a direct contradiction of the declaration of the M in ister that rations had been issued only to travelling unemployed. Whom are we to believe, the Minister, or the officials of the department he is supposed to represent. Again, on the 10th September, the following statement was published by the department:I withdraw them. The Federal Capital Territory Branch of the Department of Home Affairs issued food relief rations costing £76 4s. 8d. to 129 single men, and 2.3 married meu resident iu the During the' debate on the Federal Capital Territory during the week ended Saturday last. There we have another instance in which the published returns issued by the DeOn the 6th partment of Home Affairs contradict what the Minister stated in this House. Some explanation is due from the Minister. On the 10th September the Minister made the following statement:Until recently, single unemployed meu have been receiving three days' work at the rate of £1 a day every six weeks, and, in addition, they were given three rations valued at 8s. each during the same period, the total value of rations for each m;ui being £4 4s. in six weeks. That system was supposed to have taken the place of the dole or ration relief cards for residents of the Territory. Actually, however, that was not the case, because in spite of the Minister's statement tha; only travelling unemployed receive relief, it is clear that relief has been granted by his department to others also. On the last Estimates t h ; sum of £8,000 was set down for work on. the new road between Canberra and Goulburn. The Minister stated that this money was to be expended on completing work which had been begun by the last Government.

26,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper) [3.24],"I do this for a double reason. First, the flat rate charged ou these articles completely removes the British preference of 15 per cent, that previously obtained. That alteration should be explained. The second reason why I move my amendment is that if these rates are brought into operation they w ill grossly overtax the community generally, especially the productive section.

There are two conditions that are absolutely essential to the production of cheap power. The first is to have cheap generating plant, and the second is to have cheap transforming plant to enable the electrical power to be converted into the We are deplortrical industry is placing a heavy burden .Last year the In about. 4,870 workers, mostly girls, are in their manufacture. Honourable members will see, therefore, that each employee engaged ir. the manufacture of electrical plant in Australia costs the users of that class of goods £160 per annum-the difference between tbe £460 and the £300 I have mentioned. order to maintain, approximately, 5,000 workers, industry generally has to meet an annual charge of £800,000, which capitalized at 5 per cent., represents about in electrical goods, we should place 70 £16,000,000. What benefit does Australia derive from all this expenditure? Before the imposition of these higher duties Messrs. Noyes Brothers charged £54 for one type of motor; after the schedule had been tabled, their price for the same article rose to £66 15s. price quoted to the Sydney Water and Sewerage Board for four transformers, before the tabling of the schedule, was £234 12s.; the imposition of the duties raised the price to £364 2s. quote for the local article? motor, which before the schedule was tabled, was sold at £54, afterwards eost £66 15s. These duties impose an unfair burden on industry generally. Something must be done to reduce thai burden. That can .best be done, perhaps, by altering the duties insofar as they affect British preference. Particularly at this time, when Britain is financially embarrassed, there is good reason for our taking action in . that direction. During the past two years our importation of electrical goods from Britain has steadily declined. we imported from Britain electrical machinery to the value of £667,000. Last year that trade declined to £512,000, whereas our trade with the United States of America in electrical machinery remained steady during that period. emphasize the fact that these heavy duties have been imposed notwithstanding that Australia still has to import four-fifths of that these dynamos are used exher requirements of electrical machinery. The imposition of a flat rate of £5 per machine, with 15s. per horse-power in addition, will cause a further decline in our trade with Britain in these articles. Britain's production of electrical goods is valued at £84,000,000 per annum, of which 22 per cent, is exported, whereas tha United States of America exports only 5 J per cent, of that country's production of similar goods. Yet Australia's purchases from each country are practically the same. In this directiou, In there is an opportunity for us to give Britain a helping hand at this critical period. Instead of giving the Motherland only about 30 per cent, of our trade per cent, or 80 per cent, of our orders there. That result would be obtained if Ave maintained, or increased, the previously existing preference. I trust that the amendment will be accepted by the committee. The {Quorum formed.] ringah) [3.44] I support the amendment moved by the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page). The Government's proposal means that the prices of electrical goods to Australian users will be increased by from 100 per cent, to 150 per cent. I refuse to be associated with a proposal of that kind. Since the first duties of 20 per cent, and 27 per cent, ad valorem, British, and 40 per cent, ad valorem foreign, were placed on these goods, there have been several increases in the duties, coincident with which the prices of electrical goods have been raised. ber merely makes a statement; he does not substantiate it with facts. letter which I received from a manufacTwo years ago turing firm in Australia showing that the price of one article was raised from £54 to £66 15s. within four months, because of the higher duties. I Minister did not attempt to dispute those figures. Proof has been furnished by the right honourable member for Cowper tensively in both our secondary and primary industries, so this is merely another instance of the Government's determination to pay no regard to the requirements of industry generally, so long as the interests of a small group of persons are conserved.

The difficulty of the importers is set out in a communication from the firm of Philip Frankel and Company, one paragraph of which saysThe Ford coil is a single high tension spark eoil and it takes four coils to operate the four cylinders, while the high tension universal coil used iu most of the other American cars i a multiple spark coil and will operate four, six, or eight cylinders. This coil cannot he used on Ford ears or Fordson tractors, as the design of the electric system wiil not permit it. I hope that the Minister, who knows the whole of the circumstances, has already honoured his promise, and will suggest some modification of the paragraph, or at least explain why it appears in its present form. The communication from Philip Frankel and Company certainly suggests the need for some modification, it seems absurd that the duty payable ou coils for one type of motor car should be 24s. and for other makes 6s., 7s., or Ss. for Trade and Customs) [3.55] -It is true that Mr Frankel, of the firm of Philip Frankel and Company, interviewed me on the point raised by the honourable member, and that I arranged to bave inquiries made into his complaint. Those inquiries have been instituted, but the result is not yet to hand. If they bear out Mr Frankel's statement, I shall arrange for the Minister representing the Government in the Senate to move an amendment to this paragraph. In the meantime, I stand by the duties as proposed. Again we have the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) endeavouring to sneak a great section of this schedule through without a single word in support of it. The duties imposed by this item cover important machinery and accessories, and are designed to aid the establishment of a new industry in Australia in a field of enterprise which has not yet been investigated by the Tariff Board. Yet the Minister expects the committee to swallow the whole of these duties without a word of explanation. This is not tariff-making; it is the sheer prostitution attempt such a thing in this committee is an outrage. The imposition of prohibitive rate3 of duties on a very wide range of mechanism, and the establishment of a series of monopolies are things bad enough in thcmselves but how much 3 worse is it when the Minister has not the courtesy to support his proposals with any explanation? Realizing, however, that the Minister can depend on the so called representatives of Labour to vote with him if a division is called for, all that I can do is to register my protest against his silence. Dr EARLE PAGE (Cowper) [4.0] It is a scandal that an item of this uature should be passed without some explanation being given by the Minister. This item-Coils, high-tension ignition, each 6s., 7s., and 8s., or, ad valorem, 45 per cent., 55 per cent., and 65 per cent., whichever rate returns the higher dutyseems to be new. I 'wish to know something about these particular coils. What coils are they? Are they high-tension X-ray coils, which have not yet been satisfactorily produced iu this country? When I was Minister for Repatriation in the last Government, the department, in an endeavour to encourage Australian manufactures, secured for the Tubercular Soldiers Home, at Wahroonga, an X-ray coil for chest examination, and so forth, but it did not give us the results desired. It did not show details which were necessary to ascertain exactly how these tubercular patients were progressing, and how they should be treated. In such circumstances, it is necessary to import machines containing some specialized and patented apparatus, which can be produced only in certain places, and, as a rule, in one place throughout the world. Yet in respect of this item the Government is saying that, we. shall not permit special apparatus to enter this country except under a prohibitive duty. Surely we are entitled to some information from the Minister. I have already spoken of the need for protecting Australian industry, and I now appeal to the Government to protect the national health of this country. for Trade and Customs) [4.3] -In normal times at least £50,000 worth of these coils would be required annually in the of tariff-making To Commonwealth.

This increased duty forms part of the Government's plan to have manufactured in Australia component parts of motor cars. The Government considers that where it is found that such component parts can be economically manufactured within the Commonwealth, protective duties should be imposed with a view to bringing about ultimately the manufacture of complete motor cars within the Commonwealth. That day has not yet arrived, but we hope that it soon will. coils, and I feel sure that the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr of 6s. compares with the ad valorem Hughes), as a motorist, knows all about them. These duties have been operating for a considerable time. I assure the Mackay), that careful investigation is being made into the complaint of the Brisbane firm regarding high tension coils required in Ford motor cars. endeavouring, to meet that complaint. Within a few weeks this item will be before the Senate, and if the Government can meet the wishes of the honourable member, the Minister representing the Government in that chamber will move the necessary amendment. all know, I suppose, that a high tension ignition coil is something that at times causes trouble in a motor car. That is my owu experience. I had expected the Minister to give us some information relevant to this item. He says that it is the desire of the Government eventually to have established in Australia the manufacture of motor car3. Well and good. the parts. I wish to learn from the Minister is this: The old duty on high tension ignition coils was 35 per cent. British preferential. It is proposed, to alter that rate to 45 per cent, ad valorem, or 6s. each, whichever rate returns the higher duty. What is the relation of the rate of 6s. to that of 45 per cent.? I suggest that if honourable members are to cast an intelligent vote, they should be told what these coils are worth. In the past I have deferred to the great knowledge and experience of the Minister; but I must admit that my faith in him has been badly shaken, because, although he at times talks at high tension, with an effect resembling ignition, the general result of his statements is an all-round discharge of electricity without any useful purpose being served. The Minister speaks nicely and smoothly, and sometimes volubly and loudly; but, when we ask for details, we hear nothing from him that is likely to affect the mind of any reasonable citizen or of a member of Parliament. That may be a severe statement, but it is justified. It would be interesting to have an honest answer to my question. How many honourable members know how the rate rate of 45 per cent, ou an ordinary high tension ignition coil? Is it more or less? member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley) says is probably true, because the general intention of the Government is to increase I am the duties to the point of prohibition. Generally speaking, I object to prohibition. I believe in protection, but not in prohibition. If this is a prohibitive dttty, I require very special reasons to be given by the Minister before I am prepared to support it. UnlessI receive some definite and precise information, I must vote against this proposal, which has not been justified by the general observations of the Minister.

Paragraph 6 relates to parts of alternating current motors of from 1 to 125 horse-power, upon which aid valorem duties of 45 per cent., 55 per cent., and 60 per cent, are proposed. These parts are in the same category as the motors in regard to which the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) moved an amendment, and the duties on them are a definite charge on industry. Electrical power is used, not only in factories and municipal areas, but, particularly in Victoria, throughout the State. Because of the unreliability of the coal supply, electrical power, which is cleaner aud cheaper, is becoming more popular. No inquiry by the Tariff Board preceded the imposition of these duties. Prior to December, 1929) the duties on electric motors were 35 per cent. British and 50 -per cent, general. Local manufacturers have turned out quantities without applying for any increase of the duty, but suddenly the Government decided to increase the obstacles to the importaKeane, R.

Meanwhile, trade has been disorganized. As it seems impossible for any discussion of the tariff in this chamber to be effective, I suggest that it would be wise if we abandoned this debate and proceeded with more urgent business. The Government's attitude reminds one of Nero fiddling while Rome was burning. Australia is on the brink of a financial crisis, and we are wasting days in the discussion of technical matters; I venture to say that on no item can any two members speak with knowledge and authority. When it suits him the Minister delivers a statement that has been supplied to him. If the Tariff Board's report helps his purpose, he quotes from it ; if it does not, he withholds it. Instead of continuing this debate, we should ask the Tariff Board to report on the complete schedule in the light of the circumstances now obtaining.

Scarcely any commercial enterprises are making profits, and only those with substantial reserves will be able to carry on during the period of depression; yet the Minister blithely continues to increase duties, doubtless in the sincere belief that he is creating employment. Having regard to the fact that unemployment has increased from 12 per cent, since the Government assumed office to nearly 25 per cent, now, I am amazed that the Minister has not had the courage to ask Cabinet to reconsider its tariff policy. knows that the increase of unemployment are made in Australia. is not due to the policy of protection, the economic depression has decreased the Secondhand! purchasing power of the people. tariff is entirely to blame, but it has Federal Capital Commission al £7 10s. helped to promote unemployment.

There is no attempt to justify the proposals, and the Government simply relies on the voting power that it has in this chamber. It makes no appeal to reason, and listens to no such appeal. Should we go on with a debate in which there is no endeavour to arrive at an intelligent appreciation on the part of the Government of the real significance of the duties which the committee is asked to adopt?

60,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper) [4.33],"On the 14th May, 1930, a 35 horse-power .squirrel cage motor, developing 1,440 revolutions per minute, and without slide rails, pulley or starter, was quoted .by the local makers at £54, and in September, 3930, a similar motor was quoted by the same manufacturer at £66 15s. ""When I wrote to the late Minister for Trade and Customs, the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr mean an increase in maintenance costs. Fenton), in connection with this matter, I received a reply to the effect that the case had been investigated, and the Government was satisfied that the company was not making an undue profit. The Government declared that it would be sure that the tariff was not used as a means of exploiting the public, and yet, when a company charged £12 15s. more than it had previously been doing for an engine quoted at £54, it was declared that the company was not making an undue profit. Was inquiry made as to whether the raw material used in the manufacture of the Australian engine had been purchased at a reasonable rate? The heavy duty imposed, ostensibly for the purpose of protecting an Australian industry, is, apparently, due to the high original cost of the materials used. stances, surely it would be only fair and just to have an examination made of the causes that have contributed to such a position. We are trying to provide a remedy,; and that cannot be done without an examination of those causes. That applies to the whole of this tariff schedule. Basic materials have been increased in price because of the high duties imposed on them, and that increase has beeti reflected to a progressive extent in the costs of other items. down to bedrock in. connection with our basic industries, we should now be in a position comparable with that of Canada, which exports annually £16,500,000 worth of iron and steel products in addition to supplying her own requirements. That position has beeu brought, about by means of a duty of only 3.5 to 20 per cent. Why cannot we achieve a similar result? The Minister should tell us why so many firms overseas have gone and are it is not possible to give Great Britain preference in this case, and why it is considered that Is. 3d. per lb. is properly guarantee of being able to replace any applicable to this particular item. (Quorum formed.] rir»i surely must have occurred to the Minister that, as high duties on motors mean a definite increase in the production costs of both primary and secondary industries, in that the price of the motor is part of the capital cost involved in the establishment of any new factory, so in the same way prohibitive prices for parts He should not be blind to the fact that high costs of production have the effect of throwing out of employment, not only unskilled workers, but also trained artisans.

The invoice price of these fuses is from 2s. to 2s. 6d. each, and, therefore, the ad valorem duty will be approximately 350 per cent. I have repeatedly protested agniii3t the imposition of such excessive duties, and contend that, unless the flat rate is removed, a special sub-item is desirable. superior to all others, are to be penalized, and users of these goods will either be compelled to purchase fuses of an inferior quality or pay an unnecessarily high price. much higher than those of local manufacture, but while the British product retains its superior quality, users will prefer to purchase the superior article. A duty of Ss. is absurd. The imposition of. a duty of 8s. on an article the cost of which ranges from Is. 4d. to 2s., is an absurdity which demands some explanation from the Minister.

That is so. I put it to you, Mr Crouch, who have seen so many tariffs put through, that even you could hardly favour the passage of an item of this kind without any answer having been given by the Minister to the criticism levelled against it. Before these duties were imposed, 250-volt fuses of British make sold in ""Australia for 2s. 2d. each, including a duty of 7d. Similar articles of Australian manufacture were sold at Is. 9:$d. each. Where, then, is the need for imposing a duty of 8s. each on such fuses. Under the old duties, 10 amp. 500 volt double-pole switches of British manuApparently honourable members facture sold at 8s. 3d., whereas similar Australian switches sold at 4s. 3fd. On the British switches a duty of 2s. Id. each was paid. That, one would imagine, was sufficient on an article selling at 8s. 3d. Under the new tariff, a duty of 8s. has been imposed on this article. I put it to the Minister that this is obviously not an item on which there should be a flat rate of duty, because the value of t,he goods varies so greatly. If , in the drawing up of the tariff schedule, there had been the slightest attempt at disBritish fuses, which are crimination or proper classification, if anything like judgment had been exercised, these glaring anomalies could never have crept in. The Minister is apparently determined to put the tariff The prices of British fuses are through, with all its anomalies and inconsistencies. Nothing seems to matter to him so long as he gets it through. Why doe's he not try to justify these duties? Is the Minister under some occult influence which drives him to force these items tlirough, demanding from the members of his party their support irrespective of the merits of the proposals?

There is a crying need in Australia for the reduction of production costs. I lhave said that over and over again in 4ho course of this debate, and yet I have said it no more often than have other honourable members in this chamber. Nevertheless, when the opportunity arises to reduce production cost3 without inflicting injustice on any section of the community, the Government refuses to accept it . I move That the sub-item be amended by adding the following:""And on and after 2nd October, 1931-(r ) Ironclad or moulded fuses, ironclad or maulded switches, ironclad or moulded airbreak switches and fuses combined, ad val., British, Go per cent.; intermediate, 70 per cent.; general, 75 per cent. -The ad valorem duty on this item is 65 per cent., 70 per cent., and 75 per "" cent., which appears high enough; but what would be the astonishment of honourable members if a nought were added to each of those numbers, and the duties read 650 per cent., 700 per cent., and 750 per cent.? If there is to be any relation between the ad valorem duties and the fixed duties, the equivalent of the fixed duties of 8s., 9s., and 10s. would, on these small household fuses, amount to approximately 650 per cent., 700 per cent., and 750 per cent. The proper fixed duties to correspond with the present ad valorem duties would be, approximately, 9d., 10d., and l i d . , instead of 8s., 9s. and rate of 8s. each under the British pre10s. The figures which I have here, and which I have no reason to doubt, show that the honourable member for Warringah ( MrP a r k h ill) has rather understated than overstated the position. Under the old duties, the small household fuses of 5 amperes were landed from Britain, duty paid, at Is. l i d . each, the actual landed cost being Is. 4d. Therefore, on an article costing Is. 4d., there is now imposed a duty of 8s., which represents 600 per cent. tariff is 10s.. which represents 750 per cent., but as the European article usually costs even less than the British article, the general rate would represent more than 750 per cent. That is nothing more nor less than a joke, and I should like to know what excuse the Minister can offer for this absurd proposal. Under the old duty of 35 per cent., 45 per cent., aiid 50 per cent., the Australian made fuses used to undersell 7 the imported British fuses by 6d. each, being sold at Is. 10d., as against 2s. 4d. If the Australian article couldundersell, the British article by 6d. at the old rate of duty, what is the need for imposing a duty amounting to 600 per cent.? I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Warringah, although I think that it would have been better to revert to the old duties of 35 per cent., 45 per cent., and 50 per cent., instead of, as he proposes, 65 per cent., 70 per cent., and 75 per cent. ' This is a proposal to increase the duty on certain fuses and switches from 35 per -cent, to 8s.} or 65 per cent, ad valorem. This item includes the ordinary, domestic household switch. Last night, I was speaking on item 179 B, which included electric fittings consisting wholly or partly of metal, on which the ad valorem duty was 65 per cent. Everybody knows that there is some metal in electric switches employed for ordinary domestic purposes, and I assumed that, for that reason, they were included under item 179 B. and were dutiable at 65 per cent. That, I thought, was bad enough. I never dreamt for a moment that the ordinary ""domestic switch was covered by item 179 F, and was dutiable at the ferential section, while the general tariff ; was 10s. each. The Minister does not deny that this item includes the ordinary Is. 6d. switches. Such a proposal is, in my opinion, beyond all possibility of justification.

Why should there be this discrimination when previously it did not exist? In this instance the British preferential rate is prohibitory. Is that the explanation-the exclusion of British goods? This is an increase from 35 per cent, to 800 per cent. We have heard many times in this chamber that the previous British preferential duty of 35 per cent, enabled local manufacturers to competesuccessf u l l y with the imported article, and materially to reduce the prices of their switches.

This article is something which is used in motor cars, and any motor car owner can examine it for himself. Distributor arms of six sizes are being manufactured in Australia,and I am assured that the price has been reduced since the imposition of this duty. Some thousands of these articles are distributed throughout Australia. them ? in a box, comprising two of each type, and are sold much cheaper than they were previously when distributor arms were imported. approximately 13s. a box of twelve distributor arms, which is retailed to garages at £1 Is. The public are charged approximately 23. 6d. for each distributor arm. This duty is being imposed in accordance with the policy of the Government in encouraging the manufacture of motor car parts in Australia. We are not yet able to manufacture a complete car, but that may be possible as time goes on. In the meantime, the parts are being manufactured separately. Quite a number of men are employed in the manufacture of these distributor arms. In view of these considerations, I ask the committee to pass this sub-item. Minister has given us the illuminating information that these distributor arms are something used in motor cars. He also said that they are packed twelve in a box, and, when the right honourable member for Cowper( D r . Earle Page) asked at what price they were being sold, he replied that they were much cheaper now than hitherto. On that scant information we are asked to endorse this duty, which has been increased from 35 per cent., 4:5 per cent., and 50 per cent, to a specific prohibitive duty of 9d., Is., and Anstey, F. Is., or alternatively, 05 per cent., 70 per Culley, (J. E. cent., and 75 per cent. The Minister Cunningham, L. L. persists in treating this committee with utter contempt. When he was asked for information as to the effect of this duty negatived. on employment in this country, he said that quite a number of men were being employed in this industry. That probably means, as in most manufacturing industries in Australia, that fewer men are being employed as the result of the imposition of these prohibitive duties. The Minister has also said that he is assured that the price has been reduced. He has given no evidence of that; he has practically told us nothing. I object to this sub-item, because it imposes a prohibitive duty, which, with the f u l l approval of the members of this alleged Labour party, is aimed at settiag up a monopoly in this country. support tlie remarks of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett).

Yesterday the Sydney Morning Herald published a statement to the effect that at the end of 1930, there were 919 more factories in New South Wales than at the end of 1929, yet at the same time there were 29,559 fewer people working in them. depression. this prohibitive tariff has doubled the price of manufactured articles and reduced the consumption. those factories would have been three times as great had it not been for the procreasing the price of that commodity. tective duties imposed by this Government. Board holds the opposite opinion. says definitely that there is no doubt that the increase in prices brought about by the prohibitive tariff, is one of the prime factors in unemployment, and that the only way to bring about employment is to increase the purchasing power of money. The Tariff Board considers that the output of these factories would increase if the cost of the manufactured , products were lowered. Yet this Government has imposed a. duty which, with exchange and other charges, gives a protection of 122 per cent, on an article the production of which is ture of another article referred to in this schedule, one man is employed. whole of his time? but he is the only person carrying on the industry. Another sub-item, which has just disappeared from the schedule, relates to carburettors. That industry employs three men and two boys. In view of the perilous state of our great exporting primary industries, which employ many thousands of men, why should we increase their costs in this way, and make it harder for them to carry on About 8,000 disand less possible for them to employ other men in reproductive occupations? We should encourge those industries, instead of bringing into being abortions of this sort, which are really of no value to Australia.

This Government has put more and more people out of work. The only State that is holding its own is Queensland, which has the good fortune to be controlled by a non-Labour government Apparently the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) would have been delighted if even the £400 worth of distributor arms which were manufactured in Australia had been imported from America. He suggested that the acute unemployment is the result of the tariff. No one knows better than he that the tariff was not even a contributing factor. During the Bruce-Page regime the imports ranged from £145,000,000 to £160,000,000; the estimate for this year is only £45,000,000. Obviously, if those who are out of work were engaged in industry the market for our manufactures would be very much greater than it was when we were buying heavily goods from overseas. The attitude of the right honourable member is inconsistent. The best market for the primary producers is provided by the secondary industries, and members of the Labour party offer no excuse for supporting a policy designed to develop Australian production. Because of the previous Government's policy Australia was flooded with imports, but when the depression lifts and trade improves the industries which are being fostered by this tariff will develop and the money previously sent abroad for the purchase of goods will remain in the country. The Government's tariff policy has done much to keep people in employment. futile for honourable members opposite to accuse the Minister for Trade and Customs of not knowing what a distributor arm is. Ho is not an engineer or a mechanic, but he understands his job as head of the Trade and Customs Department.

This senseless interference with trade is directly responsible for throwing people out of work. Customs duties were never intended to protect an industry so insignificant that it produces only £400 worth of goods in fifteen months. The prosperity of Australia will not be developed by encouraging the production of arms for distributors, minor parts in motor equipment. Tho effect whicli this tarilf is having on industry is indicated by the fact that the number of factories has decreased by 216; the number of factory workers by 31,228; and the value of factory products by £1S,000,000.

They are bound to have the opposite effect, by reducing production. This hot-house protection is all right for those engaged in the sheltered industries; they continue to receive high wages, but the primary producer, who might be able to employ labour if given fair conditions, and thousands of other persons, are robbed of their livelihood. I shall oppose this absurd item. I object strongly to the imposition of fixed duties, some of which represent a protection of up to 1,000 per cent. Australia would be better off without industries which must have protection equal to ten times the import value of the articles they produce. We have heard much of the efficiency of the Australian workman. I agree that he could do well if he were given a chance. Arbitration Courts prevent him from doing, his job efficiently. Such conditions have been imposed on the Australian workman that he cannot do his job as he would like. The honourable member must confine his remarks'to the sub-item under consideration. facturers were given a chance to compete on an equitable basis with overseas manufacturers, considerably lower rates of duty would suffice. Flat rates amounting to several hundreds per cent, give the labour unions an opportunity of saying to the manufacturers, "" We ask for so much. You can go to the Minister, and he will give you any duty you require"".

Of course, the Minister and the Government promised that they would see that the Australian manufacturer did not take advantage of the tariff to impose excessively high charges upon the public. The only consolation that my client has with respect to the charge of 5s. 3d. for a Is. plug is that on and after the 1st October, the article will cost 3s. 4d. Even that price is too great an increase on Is. I hope that even at the eleventh hour the Government will reconsider its tariff proposals, and realize that the inevitable result of passing the present schedule will be increased unemployment and decreased production.

The effect of the amendment is that the rates of duty on gas cooking and heating appliances, including gas ranges, w ill revert to those operative under the 1921-1930 tariff. In taking this step, the Government has f u l l y considered the matter, and it is of the opinion that effect should be given to the Tariff Board's recommendation. This shows that those who say that the Government never adopts the board's recommendations are wrong. The Government desire3 to retain the proposed duties on electroliers, gasaliers, &c., aiid on wall, stand, or table lamps. Representations were made by the manufacturers that the existing rates were"" insufficient to allow 'them to compete with certain imported and 40 per cent, goods. The Government was of the opinion that the rates should not be less than those allotted to manufacturers of metals, and these are the rates proposed. The principal local manufacturer is. well able to meet competition in the large electric light fittings, and he has equipped the majority of the leading picture theatres in Australia as well as those in New Zealand The Government has examples of this firm's work, but if they were brought into the chamber they would fill the table. Some note should be made of the fact that this is the first time during the whole of this debate that the Minister has been compelled to admit that the duties which lie was suggesting are too high.

The Tariff Board recommended 2s. and 4s. respectively, which in its opinion ought to place the local manufacturers on a competitive basis with overseas suppliers. The quality of the lamps produced locally is in keeping with the standard attained by the parent company. This, combined with the cost of inland transport, and the fact that the eompany finds it desirable to import about 90 per cent, of its raw materials, precludes the marketing of its lamp at a price below that at which the parent company's lamps could be retailed. This price is somewhat in advance of that at which the lamps of other overseas manafacturers are retailed. The Government has come to the same conclusion as that which was arrived at by the Tariff Baord, that the granting of the full protection sought by the local manufacturers would force the cheaper lamps off the market, and thereby compel the public to buy the high quality article, which, although having much to commend it, is priced at too high a figure for some members of the community. The duties proposed will not eliminate competition, but will assist the local manufacturer to a slight extent, and at the same time add considerably to the revenue without materially increasing the price of the cheaper lamps. In introducing the resolution of the 29th July last, which included the duties now proposed, I mentioned that, although the Government had adopted the report of the Tariff Board, representations had been made to it by the industry, and those who desired that the whole of the lamps required in Australia should be manufactured locally, and that it would have further inquiries made. Since then, the tariff officers of the Customs Department have made additional inquiries into the industry, and have found that there is no case for the alteration of the duties as represent Governmeut made a great boast quested. If the percentage of Australian materials used in tbe manufacture of these lamps is increased to any considerable extent, further consideration will be given to the question of what rates are necessary to protect the industry. At the present time, only 10 per cent, of the raw materials used are of Australian origin, and the Government considers that the rates proposed aro as high as the circumstances warrant. This company's establishment is one of the best equipped in Australia, and I sincerely hope that before very long it will be manufacturing the whole of Australia's requirements. If we were to grant the whole of the protection asked for, the revenue would suffer to the extent of £100,000. Mr ""WATKIKS -The Minister has not. made such a statement in connection with other items. for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) naturally is deeply interested in this matter. The Cabinet has gone carefully into it, and in the light of the reports of the Tariff Board, and of investigation officers of the department, it is not prepared to go beyond the recommendation of tbe former body.

If such duties are necessary now they must have been a year ago when the Government was boasting of its fiscal policy, and its benefits to new industries. What is the position with respect to this particular industry? If honourable members opposite read the Tariff Board's report, [ do not think that they would support the Goverument in this instance.

I venture to suggest that that is more than has been invested by the company in the establishment of the industry. The Tariff Board conducted an exhaustive examination with respect to the lamps produced by the associated and non-associated companies and foreign products. The board stated that the associated companies' lamps were retailed at 2s. 6d. each, whereas the product of the non-associated companies was sold at from 10-Jd. to Is. 9d. each. What is being done to enable the people of this country to obtain cheaper lamps which are quite as good as those produced in Australia? The Tariff Board carried out a series of tests, and on page 1 of its report gives the following results:(i) Length of life. (The standard life of a lamp accepted hy the British Engineering Standards Association is 1,000 hours). ( i i ) Lumen maintenance.

These parts comprise by far the greater bulk of the material used in the manufacture of the complete lamps, and the tariff concessions granted are, therefore, a very material assistance to the manufacturing company. The Minister, who has said that be is adopting the recommendations of the Tariff Board, did not accept the board's advice in connection w i th galvanized iron and many other commodities upon which heavy duties have been imposed. He is adopting the board's recommendations, in this instance because it favours the i m position of higher duties than those previously in operatiou.

The attitude of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), and other members of the Country party, seems to be that when the Tariff Board recommends a reduction of duty they applaud mending further protection for any Australian industry, they cannot find a good word to say for it . When we analyse the import figures for electric lamps, we find that GreatB rita in does not get a very large share of the trade. For the quarter ended the 30th June, 1,246,788 lamps, valued at £44,345, were admitted to Australia. Of this total, 271,984 came from the United Kingdom, the balance coming from such countries as Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, &c. From Czechoslovakia we imported during that period 54,131 lamps; from France, 300,000; and from Germany, 42,000. The 271,000 lamps which we imported from the United Kingdom were valued at £26,043, while from Japan we imported 550,000 lamps, valued at only £4,235. From the Netherlands, we im ported 123,094 lamps, valued at £4,500, and from the United States of America, there came 68,356 lamps. It w ill be seen, therefore, that, omitting the United States of America and Great Britain, most of these cheap lamps came from the cheap labour countries of the world. Most of the imported lamps belong to two cheap classes, while the Australian manufacturers are making almost every line required. Compared w i th some of amendment the rates of duty about which honourable members have complained, the proposed duty on these articles is very moderate. In the schedule This is a high class industry in which good working conditions obtain, and in which the latest scientific improvements have been availed of to promote efficiency. If after these duties become operative the formed.] present rate of imports of cheap lamps continues, I trust that the Minister will have the matter reviewed, and w ill obtain another report on the industry also hope that the Minister w ill review his decision regarding this item. I was surprised to hear the honourable member I have visited many Ausfor Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) refer disparagingly to those countries from which we import filament lamps.

It is obvious that Australia is trying to do too much when it endeavours to develop industries which require as much as 1,000 per cent, protection. Protection then becomes a burden upon the community. The honourable member for Newcastle referred to low-wage countries, but lie seems to overlook the fact that in Australia there are nearly 400,000 people who receive no wages at all, because they have no work. This foolish tariff policy which we have been pursuing has contributed largely to unemployment. In order to employ a few persons in some unprofitable industry, we impose a burden on the rest of the community, and increaseoverhead costs all round. It would pay us to buy these articles in a spirit of reciprocity from those countries whicli are such large purchasers of our primary produce.

There should be a thriving trade between Australia and other countries in both directions, trade which would provide employment for everybody.

The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) seems to be obsessed Avith the idea that he is going to develop all sorts of Australian manufactures. In the face of all his preA'ious failures, he persists in trying to build up exotic industries at the expense of certain sections of the community.

A better class of lamp, which sold at 5s. 6d., went up to 6s. 3d.

Judging by the dates which these price lists bear, it appears that the increased prices were due to the alteration made in the tariff in November, 1930. If the increased duty imposed at that time had such an important effect upon prices, it seems likely that there will be a further large increase as a result of the duties now sought to be imposed. Evidently the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) is opposed to any sort of protection for any industry other than a primary industry.

The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) asked why we should not buy filament lamps from Japan. In 1927-28 we imported a total of 5,388,764 lamps, valued at £299,563; in 192S-29, the value of the lamps imported was £296,396, while in 1929-30, the value was £339,378. Most of the imported lamps came from Austria, the Netherlands and the .United States of America. The importations from other countries of the world amounted to £26,367. The company concerned made a request to the Tariff Board for a protective duty of 8s. per lb. British preferential, and 12s. per lb. intermediate and general. The Tariff Board thought those rates excessive, and recommended 2s. per lb. British preferential, and 4s. per lb. intermediate and general. The Minister has accepted that recommendation. On other occasions, the cry of certain members opposite has been that the Minister will not abide by the recommendation of it, those honourable members are. still dissatisfied. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) has complained about the resultant cost of these duties to the man in tlie country. I ask what additional cost does the community have to bear as a result of the operation of the Paterson butter scheme, and of the sugar agreement.

He is not prepared to pay the price for the development of the nation along really White Australia lines, but evidently desires that we should retrogress to the coolie labour standard. When this Government endeavoured to help the wheat farmers by granting a guarantee of 4s. per bushel on their product, the honourable member's friends in another place rejected the scheme. No doubt, when that other place has this tariff schedule before it for consideration it will endeavour to nullify the Government's attempts to grant protection to Australian industry. In this case, the exorbitant request of the company has been rejected, and the recommendation of the Tariff Board approved.

Throughout the tariff debate I have made it quite clear that my objection to the large number of items to which I found myself opposed was iu uo sense the conventional objection of an opposition. I have objected to item after item ou the ground that the duties proposed were absolutely prohibitive, and were encouraging the establishment of monopolies in Australia. In that I have been quite consistent. There have been other grounds of objection, for instance, the extent to which the Minister has acted arbitrarily ancl without reference -to the Tariff Board. Under the Customs Tariff 1921-1928, these lamps were free British preferential, and 2s. per lb. intermediate and general. By tariff proposals introduced into Parliament on the 5th November, 1930, the rates of duty were amended to Is., 3s., and 3s. The Australian manufacturers requested that a specific duty should be imposed on each bulb amounting to 9d. on bulbs not exceeding S watts, is. Gd. on those exceeding 8 watts, but not exceeding 65 watts, and 2s. on each bulb exceeding 65 watts. I understand rhai: since making that request the company has had the impudence to ask for a duly of 4s., 8s., and 8s. per lb. The recommendation of the Tariff Board halves that by 50 per cent. 1 am always pleased, when I can, to ' support the Tariff Board, which was set up to make recommendations for the guidance of Parliament. It does not follow that the Government or Parliament should necessarily accept those recommendations, but I am pleased when I am able to approve them, as in this case. There are one or two features of this industry that do not particularly commend themselves to me. There is the fact that the industry is importing the great bulk of its 'raw material. It is, in a sense, the Ford works over again; mainly an assembly works. One can only hope that it will develop into positive manufacture from Australian raw material at a comparatively early date. feature is that we are setting up a single protected company that is to supply the whole requirements of the Australian market. Had the duties recommended by the Tariff Board been prohibitive I should, on that ground, have opposed them. However, in the opinion of the board, the duties are not prohibitive, and will not exclude all competition. I am, therefore, pleased that as the Minister has, for once in a while, brought down a duty based upon the recommendation of. the Tariff Board, I shall be able to associate myself with him and vote for the item. [Quorum formed.] ringah) [9.40] -I , like other honourable members who have spoken to this item, am not averse to the establishment of Australian, industries. But I have always held that another section, the general public, the great body of consumers, have also to be considered. Before this item is passed, this committee should consider whether the interests of the consumer are being conserved. This morning I received a communication, together with a specimen lamp that is made in Belgium and sold in Australia at Is. I produce it, together with an Australian lamp of similar' capacity, whicli is sold for 2s. 6d. Honourable members should realize that in. imposing these duties, in an endeavour to establish the industry iii Australia, they are mulcting the general public of an additional Is. 6d. for each electric light bulb that is purchased. The Tariff Board has pointed out that if the industry is successfully established, and is able to capture the total Australian market, it will employ 267 female adults, 50 male adults, and 3 male juniors. To provide work for those 320 persons, of whom 267 are females, the Government proposes to impose upon the members of the general public an additional Is. 6d. for each electric, light bulb that they buy. The Tariff Board points out that "" all the materials, except alcohol, solder and the gas for gasfilled lamps will be imported, and that of the materials for a vacuum lamp, approximately 95 per cent, will be imported "". That is the type of industry that the public is being asked to pay so much to establish. This Parliament has Another no right to impose such a heavy disability upon the general community in",51,Pairs

This imposition is a monstrous outrage upon the general public. is quite clear that the committee is going to approve of the Minister's amendment to impose a duty of 2s. per lb. British preferential and 4s. intermediate and general, on these lamps. A perusal of the Tariff Board's report in this matter makes it evident that the recommendation of the board is based upon an intense investigation. A considerable volume of evidence was taken, and the board rejected the request of the company for a much higher rate of duty than that recommended. The report of the Tariff Board shows that that body desired to protect the public. It points out that large numbers of the people were buying lamps at Is. each, and obtaining satisfaction from them. off the retail prices proposed to be given It also shows clearly that the distributing costs of the Australian companies are f a r too high. That is a matter which Australian manufacturers will have to consider in the future if thoy are to receive assistance from this Parliament. paragraph 3 of page 10 of its report, the Tariff Board statesThe board can see no justification for the maintenance of such prices either under existing conditions or if the lamps are made in Australia. Paragraph 6 readsThe board is of the opinion that no duty should be imposed that will assist in maintaining such a costly system of distribution with resultant selling prices. It would appear that the costs of distribution, rather than the duties, are the principal reason for the high prices charged for these articles. perfect its organization. ciated companies are sold at the same prices throughout Australia, and that probably has something to do with the high cost of distribution. Nevertheless, the company would do well to heed the hint given by the Tariff Board in its report. I am pleased that the Minister has adopted the board's report in this instance. other occasions I have protested against the f u t i l it y of this tariff debate. Knowing that it has a majority in favour of its proposals, the Government pays little or no heed to what is said in opposition to them. However, I feel disposed to support the duties in this instance, as I have supported other duties which I have thought to be fair. On the other hand, I have not hesitated to oppose duties which I have regarded as prohibition masquerading as protection. In this instance, the Government has followed the report of the Tariff Board, and, partly for that reason, I feel that I can support the duties; but I should like the Minister to say how many hands the company employs or will employ as a result of these duties, the estimated loss to the Commonwealth in customs duties because of the establishment and growth of the Australian industry, the amount of discount to public and semi-public bodies, and whether the £450,000 capital of the company is its paid-up capital, or only its nominal capital.

The amendment proposes to make alterations to paragraphs 12, 17 and 26. The amendment to paragraph .12, dealing with fixed resistances, is made.solely for departmental convenience. It does not affect the rates, and is made'merely w i th the object of making the-in ten tion of the paragraph ""-clear. The paragraph in the resolution of 26th March, 1931, read, "" Grid leaks."" Grid leaks are fixed resistances used in wireless receiving sets and placed in the grid circuit of a valve. Although their resistance values vary, they are generally of 2 megohms or larger, although in some instances they may go as low as one-tenth megohm. The department has been classifying all -fixed resistances of 2 megohms and over as grid leaks under this paragraph, and resistances of less than 2 megohms under paragraph 24 as wireless parts n.e.i. This amendment confirms the departmental practice, and places the classification on a more secure ground. Paragraph 17 deals with loud speakers valorem rates on the combined wireless and parts thereof. being manufactured least two firms-Amalgamated (Australasia) Proprietary prevent the importation parts and their assembly into loud speakers in Australia it is necesfixed rate duties on wireless receiving sets. sary to impose fixed rate duties on the Importers at present cannot take advanprincipal parts of loud speakers. result of inquiries made into the f.o.b. both wireless receiving sets and combined prices of comparable loud .speakers from wireless receiving sets and gramophones the United States of America, it is found is prohibited; but there is no doubt that that-the rate of 12s. 6d. per loud speaker immediately the prohibitions were lifted approximates of 90 per cent, at the highest. portations were almost solely from the tions have been increased to make the United States of America. sity for such high rates becomes apparent tion to which their value bears to the Mr Forde. . when it is known that the commencement of the wireless season in Australia coincides with the completion of the American season. As models in wireless change from year to year, the surplus stock at the end of the season is disposed of at less than manufacturing cost. It. is the usual practice for the American manufacturers, to sell such surplus wireless goods at list price less 80 per cent. Sales are made on the local market as well as to overseas buyers, and consequently no action can be taken under the Industries Preservation Act to apply the dumping duties. It , therefore, becomes necessary to impose substantial duties on all wireless receivers and parts thereof in order to conserve the Australian market for local manufacturers. This principle was recognized by the Tariff Board in recommending increased duties oh other wireless receiving set parts.

B r it is h ; 55 per cent, intermediate; 65 per cent, general; to 35 per cent., 50 per cent., and 55 per cent, respectively, which are the alternative ad valorem rates ou all other wireless parts.

This subject has been carefully inquired into by the Tariff Board, whose recommendations have, in the main, been accepted. There is a prohibition against the importation of wireless sets, practically all of which come from the United States of America. remove that prohibition? being altered to comply with the recommendation of the Tariff Board. Since the prohibition was imposed some hundreds of workers have been employed in making wireless sets in Australia. The prohibition was necessary in order to rectify our adverse trade balance with the United States of America. The proposals which the Government placed before Parliament prior to the amendment outlined by the Minister were submitted on the 19th June last. Notwithstanding that since that date the Government has had ample opportunities to submit amendments in time to enable honourable members to consider them, the committee is asked this evening to accept this item, subject to an amendment now moved by the Minister, the significance and effect of which, I feel sure, few members understand. The Government's action in this instance is only in keeping with its attitude throughout this debate. I do not propose to discuss this item, because any discussion of the tariff in this chamber is useless. The Government does not give members a fair opportunity of understanding the significance of its proposals; in many cases the Ministhree sitting weeks, including the present ter has not condescended to submit either facts or argument in support of his proposal. The supporters of the Government take so little interest in the debate that few of them are to' be seen in the chamber. The Government has submitted a programme for the completion of the debate on the tariff which makes adequate discussion absolutely impossible. half of the Opposition, I uow make it clear that we on this side consider it futile to continue this general debate. The tariff will go to another place, where there will be an opportunity to change some of the Government's prop.osals. There is absolutely no prospect of altering them in this chamber, because in tariff matters this is not a deliberative assembly. Accordingly, the Opposition does not propose to waste time and effort in a useless discussion. A number of honourable members on this side who desire to express the strong opinions which they hold upon certain items, will express those opinions, but will reserve their The duty is protests to the balance of the tariff. Subject to those expressions of opinion we intend not to do anything to prevent the Senate from dealing with the tariff as soon as possible. We realize that although liberty of action is supposed to be allowed on both sides in this tariff debate, government supporters are not permitted to exercise that privilege. Many honourable members on this side regard the Government's proposals as prohibitive instead of protective in their incidence, but the tariff is the responsibility of the Government, and, subject to the limitations which I have indicated, the Opposition does not propose to take part in prolonging what has become a parliamentary farce. I desire also to say a few words with regard to the conduct of this debate and the attitude of the party which I have the honour to lead in relation to it. Last night the Ministei' was good enough to state in a letter to me what he thought should be the programme for this and the next two or three weeks. The honourable gentleman advised me that it was proposed to finish the tariff debate within week. I have carefully considered the matter, and after examining the schedule, I find that if we are to complete the business within the time allotted by the Minister it will be necessary each day to dispose of at the very least seventeen items, many of which are of great importance. I honestly believe that it is physically impossible for honourable memOn bebers to accomplish that task in a thorough and satisfactory manner. Consequently, especially after to-day, when the Minister, without previously informing the committee, introduced two fresh proposals foT higher duties and another to amend existing duties, I feel that it",53,Pairs

We may assume that government supporters, like honourable members on this side, were then free to exercise their own judgment in relation to its tariff proposals, but since I respectfully submit that it is not in then the Labour party has been regimented and severely disciplined with the result that the Government has not again been in a minority. In the circumstances, I. contend that the right thing to do is to send this tariff to another place where it will be dealt with. We shall then he able to see what items are worthy of discussion, and whether we in this Parliament have any practical chance of alterations in this tariff, leaving the main issue to the next Parliament after an aj>peal to the people. To indicate how cavalierly the Government is treating this debate, I have only to remind the committee that, at one stage to-night, it was impossible to obtain a quorum from tlie Governmeut side of the House, and tlie chairman was obliged to report to t he House, when a quorum was obtained. ber of the Opposition present when the bells were rung to form a quorum. cause we wished to test the sincerity of ihe Government and its supporters.

Apparently, we are to listen to a lecture upon the sin3 and shortcomings of the Government and its supporters. I submit that what the right honourable gentleman has said is not relevant to the item under discussion. I have allowed the leaders of responsible parties to make what is undoubtedly an important announcement with regard to the debate on the tariff, but I cannot permit a general discussion upon this aspect of the. question.

Honourable members of the party which I lead in this chamber, have endeavoured to keep to the Minister's schedule for the tariff debate. There has been no unnecessary discussion upon any subject, and even upon those items concerning which we might have said a good deal, we allowed a vote to be taken with as little delay as possible. I am prepared to assist the Minister, in every way possible, to get the schedule to the Senate, where alone effective action can be taken and early redress secured for the people. There are still a few items upon which some honourable members of the Country party wish to speak; but we will give all reasonable assistance to the Minister to-night, and tomorrow, I trust, we shall dispose of the entire schedule so that the Minister may make the necessary arrangements for its presentation to the Senate.",56,Pairs

Prom what has been said by those lionorable gentlemen, some people may be led to believe that honourable members have not had reasonable time for the discussion of the tariff. As a matter of fact, this is the eleventh sitting week during which the schedule has been debated, and there will be three full weeks after this week, or a total of fourteen weeks set apart for the consideration of the tariff. No attempt has been made to curtail debate up to the present time. I do not think that the gag has been moved upon any item. remind honourable members opposite that the leaders of their party in another place asked the Government to give a guarantee that the tariff would be sent to the Senate before the 1st November. They expressed the fear that they might not have an opportunity to discuss it until some time next year. The same request was made by the Opposition leaders in this House, and now, when the Government is doing everything possible to expedite the debate in this chamber so as to honour the promise given by the Prime Minister, that it would be sent to. the Senate not later than the 1st November, we are being charged with endeavouring to rush it through. Honourable members must admit that there has been ample time for the discussion of the various items, and that frequently considerable time has been patient. occupied in useless discussion upon some items of not very great importance.

I may break that rule, however, iu regard to two or three items. I decline to proceed any further with this general debate, because the Minister, since he has assumed the office that he now holds, has broken every recognized rule on tariff presentation; He has built up this tariff without proper consideration by himself or by the officers of the Trade and Customs Department, and without consultation with the Tariff Board.

On the contrary, it has enabled it to grow and become valuable to the country without any imposition on those who use the protected product of the agricultural implement factories. here who agree with that. Of what use is ir to make that observation? ing that there should be reasonable consideration of all the main items of the tariff from that point of view. There are some unreasonable critics who denounce every item in the schedule simply because it comes before the committee. In the case of agricultural implements, although there has been keen competition from overseas in that class of machinery, Australian manufacturers have turned out almost every description and kind of implement required on the farms at a price which compares well with the price paid by farmers even in free trade countries.

That attitude on the part of the Opposition is not justified. The responsibility is upon this committee to give detailed consideration to the tariff items, and honourable members opposite are not warranted in making statements amounting to misrepresentation about the attitude and policy of the Government on the ground that all their suggestions have not been accepted. them has been accepted. but even if it were so, on that ground alone the Opposition would not be warranted insurrendering the fort. Honourable members opposite are certainly not proceeding in a democratic way when they say, in effect, "" the interests of our constituents can go hang; we shall depend upon another place to get in our assassin's work on the tariff"". . should the Treasurer grieve because we do not intend to discuss these items? but I do not intend to allow this cunning and pernicious propaganda to goout to the people unanswered. The Government is endeavouring to establish a tariff which will effectively protect Australian industries. We do not wish to bolster up uneconomic industries, or to shelter industries which have no proper place in Australia; but we invite honourable members to bend their minds to this tariff problem and to make reasonable suggestions. It is of no use the Opposition saying that this Government ignores the reports of the Tariff Board, because the reports of that body are always considered by a sub-committee of Cabinet. The board was not set .up,. nor was it recognized by our predecessors in office, as the final authority in regard to duties. It was set up as an investigating and recommending body, and its recommendations have always been respected, but not always acted upon either by this or any previous Government. I should like to devote some time to the item before the Chair, but I find that an impossibility. Through the courtesy of the Government in sending, the members of all parties in this chamber a list of the items which have to be dealt with to-night, I find that there are nine items still to be discussed.

Opposition generally effect to that policy. The Minister has read a long statement, which he did not understand, setting out further alterations to this item, and in fairness to the committee he should make a copy of it available so that, honourable members may understand the extent and effect of the amendment. The objection which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Latham) and the Leader of the Country party ( D r .

The reason for the amendment is to permit of the incorporation in the present proposals'of this item as set out in the tariff resolution of the 29th July, 1931. That resolution provided for an increase in the duty, and in order ' to make t i e legal position secure with regard to any duties which may have been collected under the resolution, its incorporation with the present proposal is necessary. The amendment makes no difference to the rates proposed under the July resolution. As I explained in July, the specifio rate of Is. British preferential, and 2s. general', each on wireless valves was proposed for the purpose of giving a decided preference to British valve makers. The rates under the 1921-30 tariff were of no advantage whatever to the British manufacturers as the ad valorem preferential rate of 10 per cent, returned the same amount of duty as 25 per cent, on Dutch valves under the general tariff, because of the fact that the f.o.b. price of the latter was considerably below that of the British article. The amended rates should ensure the collection of an additional £20,000 in revenue. The Government has carefully investigated the prices at which wireless valves are sold in Australia, and is satisfied that considerable disparity exists between the landed cost and the selling price to the public, parflOl ticularly in respect of foreign valves. In these circumstances there is no reason -why the Government should not levy a revenue duty, particularly as importers, by virtue of the exorbitant profits they are making, are well able to absorb the impost.
