Thursday, 24 June 2010 ----Calare Electorate: Gumnut House heard it all from the government: trade training centres, an apparent education revolution, an end to double drop-offs, laptops for every student and 260 new childcare centres. The problem is the Labor Party and the Minister for Education delivered so very little. But whilst the Labor Party have been focusing on other things, their failures have been affecting real people in the community. One such a real person is Tracie Arkley-Smith, who has a son who attends Gumnut House in Lithgow, which will soon be part of my electorate of Calare. Gumnut House is facing closure, and Tracie Arkley-Smith is facing life without child care, all because of another mistake under Labor’s watch. Gumnut House has recently been told it was overpaid by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations and will now have to pay back $800 per week. It simply cannot do that. The company has lost its rural grant because there is now more than one childcare facility in Lithgow. The staff at Gumnut House are paying the price of a department’s failure under Julia Gillard’s watch. Tracie Arkley-Smith will struggle because the minister’s department got it wrong. Ms Arkley-Smith’s small business and her three employees will suffer because of this failure. Their families will suffer, other students’ families will suffer and the community will suffer because Labor could not get it right. This government has spent its way into trouble and is now scrounging to get back any scrap of economic credibility it had. Instead of demanding back the billions it wasted on the BER, Labor has gone after a small business in Lithgow. Why can the government afford $38 million for advertising but not $38,000 for Gumnut House, or at least allow a longer period of time than just 51 weeks for this money to be paid back? Child care is a necessity for families in regional Australia and should be a priority for this government. I call on Julia Gillard to fix this mess. She has the power to do so, and the company’s future is in her hands. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women) (10.34 am)-I want to talk today about an issue that has been very important in my electorate of Sydney. Many of my constituents have a great deal of interest in, and support and concern for, the issue and have joined the campaign to free Aung San Suu Kyi from detention in Burma, particularly now, in the lead-up to the elections that are scheduled to take place later this year. Since 1989 Aung San Suu Kyi has spent almost 15 years under house arrest. We know that for most of that time she has been separated from her family; she has been separated from her supporters and her friends. She has had incredibly difficult restrictions placed on her and has been held responsible when other people have broken the ban on making contact with her. Burma also has more than 2,000 other political prisoners currently in detention with numbers increasing as the election comes closer. MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Healthcare Identifiers Healthcare Profession

151,Mr John Cobb (Calare) (10.31 Am),"When it comes to education I guess we haveI am privileged to be an ambassador for Aung San Suu Kyi for one of the groups supporting democracy in Burma. Her fight for freedom in her country is an example of true heroism in the face of injustice. In support for the campaign to have Daw Aung San Suu Kyi released, I sent this message to a recent meeting: I extend my strong support in respect for Aung San Suu Kyi’s pursuit of human rights and democracy in Burma. Her long and unrelenting struggle is a symbol of her personal courage and resilience in the face of injustice. The Australian Government consistently calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi, and the release of more than 2000 other political prisoners in Burma. I add my voice to this call for meaningful change in Burma and the immediate and unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi. I remain inspired by Aung San Suu Kyi’s unfaltering commitment to bring democracy and human rights to the people of Burma and hope that she celebrates her next birthday in freedom. Democracy in Burma can only happen when the people there are free to express their political opinions and their political will in terms of their government. The Australian government, with the international community, will be watching the upcoming elections in Burma with great interest. We will not forget the struggle when elections occur later this year and we will continue to be committed to peace, genuine democracy and human rights in Burma. Canning Electorate: Infrastructure Canning that will benefit the community for years to come. They are two projects that I have long supported and fought to deliver for the region: the Pinjarra pool and the Sarich paediatric ward at the Peel Health Campus. I have mentioned these projects on several occasions in this parliament. Why? Because they are projects that the Rudd-Gillard government willingly cast aside. For a government that once labelled these very projects ‘regional rorts’, they have quickly changed their tune now as the next election rolls around. No-one can feign surprise at another complete turnaround by the Labor government but I welcome their $1.2 million backflip on the Pinjarra pool because it delivers a long lasting benefit for Pinjarra. If the Rudd Gillard government was really serious about delivering community infrastructure this pool would have been built two years ago. In 2007 the coalition delivered $1.1 million for the pool but it was ripped up by Labor along with a $10 million commitment to the Pinjarra bypass and $650,000 for the Pinjarra bowling club. For almost three years my calls on the Rudd-Gillard government, including direct appeals to Minister Albanese, to honour these projects have fallen on deaf ears. Lack of interest by the Labor government until now means the hydrotherapy pool was withdrawn from the initial build to save money. A sudden change of heart and sweeping into town grandstanding about the investment in infrastructure will not hide the fact that the funding being delivered is the same funding that was taken away two years ago. The government even knocked back the project again as recently as last year. Why now? The answer is clear but it is unfortunate that the elderly and the ill in Pinjarra have been left waiting with bated breath about the future of a vital community facility and health treatment options for cynical reasons and political point scoring. While the government has eventually come good on the pool it was the community that rallied to ensure the paediatric wing of the Peel Health Campus became a reality when the Labor MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Constituency Statements
152,Mr Randall (Canning) (10.37 Am),"I rise today to mention two significant projects ingovernment cruelly reneged on the coalition’s funding agreement. In fact, they reneged twice. Special mention must go to the state government, who made up the shortfall when the Rudd Gillard government withdrew its commitment, contributing almost $1 million to the total. The $3.4 million Ralph and Patricia Sarich paediatric wing was built from the ground up, predominantly with funds raised by the Peel Health Campus Foundation led by Arthur Marshall. They are true heroes. It took five years of funding and contributions from more than 1,500 local groups. The 12-bed purpose-built facility with family room and playroom was built by the community for the community after lots of cake stalls, dances, raffles, sausage sizzles and old-fashioned money-can shaking in the local streets. I was proud to attend the official opening of the ward by health minister Kim Hames last week. It was clear that this true community effort will benefit health care through the region for years to come, offering real comfort to families during some of the most difficult times of their lives. Bennelong Electorate: Disability Services Ms McKEW (Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (10.40 am)-I rise today to acknowledge a wonderful result for some extraordinary people in my electorate of Bennelong. After a long period of advocacy on my part, the Karonga School in Epping, which provides education for over 50 intellectually and physically disabled children, will be able to substantially rebuild its ageing and inadequate learning areas. In the recent New South Wales state budget $3½ million was allocated for new classrooms and other therapy facilities. I want to thank the New South Wales Minister for Education and Training, Verity Firth, for making Karonga a priority. When I saw her last year she was entirely sympathetic and fully briefed on this but at that stage unsure whether a budget allocation could be made. But, as we know, persistence pays off. Principal Sue Dennett, P&C President Helen Hukins and Vice President Kath McLean have never stopped pushing for what the children, teachers and parents at Karonga deserve-that is, a modern learning environment. Many of the children at Karonga are wheelchair bound. Others have no verbal communication and others need to be tube fed and changed regularly. Teachers have to deal with children with severe challenging behaviours that require specific environments and management. Karonga’s extraordinary teaching and support staff have an exceptional vocational commitment to what they do. For instance, the last time. I was there, a few weeks back, one teacher, Sharon, spoke of how the latest in ICT and better diagnosis can unlock what is inside a child who otherwise struggles to communicate in any way we would recognise. I am confident that the new century holds out great promise that those living with a disability can be empowered by advances in both medical science and technology. I am also acutely conscious that there are other deficits. I hear over and over from stressed and often exhausted parents of disabled children that the system is simply too hard to navigate: it is fragmented, incoherent and inadequate. When you talk to mums about this, as I have done over the last couple of years, you hear different stories of how they access services, of time delays, of huge out-of-pocket expenses and particularly of how uncoordinated the care is. An acute area that needs to be addressed is better after-hours care for children because so many mums I talked to have qualifications but are unable to participate fully in the workforce, as is their right and as they wish to. This is an area we need to rethink and redesign so that we MAIN COMMITTEE can have greater equity and fuller participation of parents who are caring for children with disabilities. Higgins Electorate: Planning Ms O’DWYER (Higgins) (10.43 am)-One of the critical issues in my electorate of Higgins is planning, whether it be in Windsor, Prahran, Armadale, South Yarra, Malvern, Malvern East, Glen Iris, Ashburton, Camberwell, Carnegie, Murrumbeena or Hughesdale. It is an issue that concerns all residents. The Victorian government has this week introduced new planning amendments through the state parliament that will permanently redefine the built environment and demographics of our local area. These changes will affect all suburban areas of Melbourne, with effects being particularly acute in my electorate. The Brumby government’s aim is to create a smaller, denser city with a higher population concentration in urban areas. This is the government’s multistorey solution to Melbourne’s growth. They want to change the character of inner-city Melbourne. The government’s changes to the Victorian planning provisions reflect this new strategic direction and come after earlier changes to the planning laws that have the effect of bypassing local council and residents and automatically green lighting planning projects according to set criteria. There is also an exponential increase in the minister calling in planning projects and green-lighting them. Transport corridors, including train and tram lines and bus routes, have been earmarked for new multistorey development nearby, yet these key parts of our transport and social infrastructure have been neglected for 11 years. It used to be the case that residents could have their voices heard on any new plans for development in their area. Now it seems that the state government has decided that creating a sensible and sustainable growth strategy is too difficult and that it is easier to ignore the concerns of suburban residents to try to squeeze more and more apartment blocks into areas that are already struggling. Under the Brumby government, local residents have been told that their views do not matter. I have joined with local residents to fight against their voice being silenced. I have joined with local residents to campaign for the restoration of local councils making decisions with residents about local planning issues. Together with my state colleagues Andrea Coote, member for the Southern Metropolitan Region; Georgie Crozier, candidate for the Southern Metropolitan Region; Michael O’Brien, member for Malvern; and Clem Newton-Brown, candidate for Prahran, I will stand up for residents and their rights. I urge those who care about their local area to stop inappropriate development and restore residents’ rights.

On another matter, on Tuesday night the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine, in conjunction with Australians for Palestine and the Australian Friends of Palestine Association, hosted a dinner for visiting international guest Ms Diana Buttu. It was a highly successful evening that was attended by MPs and senators from all sides of politics, by many Arab ambassadors and by representatives of the church community. Diana Buttu is a lawyer, political analyst, advocate and former negotiator and spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation’s Negotiation Support Unit, and she has assisted in the litigation brought to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which resulted in the landmark opinion against Israel’s wall in occupied Palestine. During her speech Diana talked about the history of the peace process and negotiations between Israel and Palestine, which despite efforts have failed to achieve any real progress. It is Diana’s view, and increasingly the view of many, including me, that the international community must now adopt measures to begin holding Israel accountable for its actions-actions that have largely thwarted any real progress. Such accountability must involve accountability for Israel’s continued settlement expansions in occupied Palestine; for the continued occupation of Palestine; for the wall which has turned the West Bank into tiny cantons or open-air prisons; for the stranglehold placed on freedom of movement for the Palestinian people; for Israel’s collective punishment of the Palestinians in Gaza through its ongoing embargo; for the recent attack on the freedom flotilla; for its policy on the acquisition of Palestinian water supplies; for its lack of genuine commitment to seeking a just and viable peace in accordance with international law, a policy which fails to deliver for its own citizens the peace and security that they so desperately want; and finally for the inflammatory doctrine of its own foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, which calls for: … a populated land swap rather than … land for peace. The international community now needs to do more than just encourage this peace process; it must begin to hold Israel accountable for policies and actions that violate the human rights of the Palestinian people. It is time to put international law at the heart of these peace talks. Petition: Child Care Ms MARINO (Forrest) (10.48 am)-I rise to table a petition on behalf of Lisa Fuda of the Harvey Occasional Child Care Centre and the many families in south-western, wheat-belt and regional Western Australia who will be very badly affected by the Labor government’s decision to cease the funding the Neighbourhood Model Occasional Child Care Program from MAIN COMMITTEE July this year. There were 1,704 signatures collected in just a few days in very small communities. Many thanks to everyone who helped achieve this. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the Federal Government’s decision to cease funding the Neighbourhood Model Occasional Childcare Program as at July 15th 2010. Ultimately this could mean the closure of 28 centres Western Australia wide, including Harvey and Binningup. We therefore ask the House to reinstate the funding to the Neighbourhood Model Occasional Childcare Program that provides 52% of the funds required for operational costs to 28 childcare centres Western Australian wide. from 1,704 citizens Western Australia, including those in Harvey and Binningup. In rural and regional areas, many centres simply do not have the numbers to sustain themselves on a full-time basis. This comes as a major blow to the many rural and regional centres which simply do not have the numbers to sustain themselves on a full-time basis. Here we have groups of young mothers who do not simply sit back and expect a handout from government. They take responsibility for their community based centres. They fundraise. They manage their own centres and finances. They play a direct role in their children’s day care. But they cannot afford the increased fees caused by the loss of federal funding. Yet the government has withdrawn its 52 per cent funding share, a total of $420,000, from 28 centres in Western Australia, centres that have provided sustainable, affordable and necessary day care for many years. Lisa Fuda, the principal petitioner and Chairperson of the Harvey Occasional Child Care Centre Harvey said: The closure of the Centre will affect many workplaces within Harvey, right now our services are retained by Teachers, Financial Assistants, Healthcare Professionals, Hairdressers, small business operators working from home, just to mention a few. The flow-on effects of the possible closure of this centre will more than likely be felt throughout the whole town on many different facets. Other patrons utilise the service as a respite opportunity as they may not have the luxury of family support locally, some of these children include those with special needs which we cater for and have specially allocated resources and staff. The funding cut will have dire effects on both of these centres in my electorate and on many communities in Western Australia. Unfortunately, this is another glaring example of how this Labor government has no understanding of, or willingness to understand, regional and rural communities and their day-to-day issues. But at the same time it is prepared to waste and mismanage billions and billions of taxpayers’ dollars in funds for things such as school buildings and the insulation program, whilst ripping away funding from occasional child care throughout Western Australia. have presented will be forwarded to the Petitions Committee for its consideration and will be accepted subject to confirmation by the committee that it conforms with standing orders.

154,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ds Vale),"Member for Forrest, the document that youMillennium Development Goals Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.52 am)-On TuesdayI was visited by four young people from my electorate and surrounding electorates who were representing Micah Challenge. They visited me with the goal of improving the situation in global poverty. They pointed out to me that it was one of the most significant challenges facing our world today and that since 2000 there has been an international effort to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. They were placing particular emphasis on Millennium Development Goal 4. They also lobbied me very strongly to increase the aid budget in the area of 2.7. I am very supportive of that increase and I think there are many members of this House who are also supportive of it. When these young people came to visit me they asked me to make the Millennium Development Goals central to my policies and what I stand for. I am happy to do that. They asked me to sign the Micah Call giant scroll. I did that, as did many of the other members of this House. They also asked me if I would be prepared to make a speech in parliament, and that is what I am doing today. One of the churches in my electorate held a birthday party for Survive Past Five, which concentrates on Millennium Development Goal 4. At that birthday party they put together a card, which they delivered to me. The card emphasises that every child around the world should be able to enjoy a fifth birthday, which I think is something that all members of this House would agree with. The card points out how important Millennium Development Goal4 is and that it aims to reduce child mortality by two-thirds from the 1990 levels by 2015. The young people went on to say that it saddens them that so many children in the 18 of the 29 developing countries in our region are not achieving this record. Last year I visited PNG with the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, with the specific goal of looking at health issues. PNG has the second worse outcomes in the areas of Millennium Development Goal4 and Millennium Development Goal 5. I hope that we can work to help them achieve those goals. I seek leave to table birthday cards from young people in my electorate expressing their thoughts and sentiments in this area. Leave granted. Petition: Wandering Trad House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions, regarding wandering trad, with my constituent Mr Todd Coleman being the principal petitioner. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives We, the undersigned citizens of Australia wish to draw the attention of the House to the Rudd Governments decision to cut funding for the eradication of the noxious weed, wandering Trad in the Dandenong Ranges. This noxious weed has a devastating effect on native flora and fauna nationwide. We therefore ask the House to: Restore the $450,000 in funding promised by the previous Government Implement an Australian wide strategy to combat Wandering Trad from 136 citizens Petition received. MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Constituency Statements
155,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (10.55 Am),"I rise to present a petition recently approved by thetion. Wandering trad is a South American weed which is sadly throughout the Dandenong Ranges, mainly in the creeks. Wandering trad pretty much sucks up all the water in the creeks. Residents would know that their pets sometimes go out and get some sort of rash. Wandering trad is the No. 1 cause of rashes for pets in the Dandenong Ranges. This weed is also in the electorate of the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, Peter Garrett, in the suburb of Randwick. The previous government, with the then environment minister, Malcolm Turnbull, made a commitment of $450,000 to find a biological control. This would help not only the Dandenong Ranges tackle this problem but would help right across the country. The most disgraceful thing happened. This announcement was made before the election campaign and, after the election, Minister Garrett cut the funding. That is an absolute disgrace. The Gillard government should be absolutely shamed and condemned on this decision. The application was put together by Dr Andrew Sheppard of the CSIRO, and he was going to work on this for a period of three years with a PhD student from the University of Melbourne. The effort had gone into this. The research had gone into this. More importantly, the commitment had been made. This Rudd-Gillard government has no interest in protecting the environment in the Dandenong Ranges. During the last election, we made a $3 million commitment for weed management in the Dandenong Ranges. Sadly, although Minister Peter Garrett promised to do something, the only thing he has done is cut the funding already budgeted for wandering trad. This is an absolute disgrace, and the government should immediately reverse this decision. Shortland Electorate: Surf-Lifesaving Clubs Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.58 am)-I am very pleased to stand in this House today and share with the members just how lucky I am to represent the most beautiful electorate in this country, a coastal electorate with some fantastic surf-lifesaving clubs. I notice the member for Paterson is in the chamber, and he might contest the fact that I have the absolute best surf clubs within the Hunter region. Like other members who have surf clubs in their electorates, I have been attending the presentation nights of my local surf clubs. In Shortland electorate I have Redhead Surf Lifesaving Club, which has one of the best beaches, I think, in the country and definitely in the Hunter. It has quite challenging surf, and you need to have a very strong surf club on the beach all the time watching what is happening. We then go to the Swansea Belmont surf club which has hosted the state titles for the last three years. It has a very proud record in both competition and patrolling the beaches. It is the centre of the Blacksmiths’ community. It is a focal point for the residents in that area and the people of the Blacksmiths area strongly support their surf club. There is Caves Beach surf club which is a strong family club and also has a very proud record of looking after the beaches. Caves Beach was the last presentation I went to and I was overwhelmed by the number of people that attended. It is my understanding that they had so many people wanting to attend that they could not accommodate them all at the presentation. It gives you an idea of the feeling and the support of the community. A number of these surf clubs have patrols that have 100 per cent attendance, which shows the dedication. I cannot miss out on Catherine Hill Bay which is another surf club that patrols an area in the southern part of Lake Macquarie. There MAIN COMMITTEE",192,Constituency Statements

Private Timothy Aplin Private Benjamin Chuck Private Scott Palmer Debate resumed from 23 June, on motion by Mr Rudd: That the House record its deep regret at the deaths on 21 June 2010, of Private Timothy Aplin, Private Benjamin Chuck and Private Scott Palmer, while on combat operations in Afghanistan, and place on record its appreciation of their service to our country and tenders its profound sympathy to their families in their bereavement speak on this condolence motion. It was, as I am sure this chamber remembers only too well, but two days ago that I stood here and spoke on the condolence motion for Sapper Moerland and Sapper Smith who were tragically killed by an IED in Afghanistan on 7 June only a little over two weeks ago. To speak so soon after that tragedy is in fact extremely difficult for me as I am sure it will be for many in this chamber. Unfortunately, there will be some dark moments before we again emerge into the light, particularly of course for the families of those soldiers that were killed and those soldiers who were wounded. Private Timothy James Aplin, Private Benjamin Adam Chuck and Private Scott Travis Palmer were tragically killed after their International Security Assistance Force helicopter crashed during the early hours of Monday morning. They were performing the duties they were asked to do-eradicating the heart of terrorism in Afghanistan so that people may live freer from oppression and the acts of terrorism. It was Thucydides, a Greek historian, who said: The bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet not withstanding go out to meet it. That is what they did-clear of mind, determined in purpose. People often say that they remember where they were when the Berlin Wall was brought down or when the Twin Towers in New York were attacked. I will forever remember being in my office in this place gazing at the television and listening to the Chief of the Defence Force, calmly and respectfully delivering the terribly sad news to the Australian people that we had just lost another three fine Australian troops in Afghanistan. This news came as a shock, because not two weeks prior we as a nation mourned the loss of Sapper Moerland and Sapper Smith. It also came as a personal shock because at that moment I knew exactly how the families of these fine young soldiers would be feeling. I knew it because not a week had passed since I witnessed the grief and absolute sense of loss that enveloped the families of Sapper Moerland and Sapper Smith. I stood with those families at the ramp ceremony; I stood with them at the respective funerals. They are still very fresh in my memory and I am sure in the public’s consciousness.

157,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ds Vale),Order! In accordance with standing order,194,Condolences
158,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (11.01 Am),"It is with an incredibly heavy heart that I rise toThe English philosopher John Stuart Mill said: War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself. These men were fine men. They were sons of ANZAC, who were willing to fight and who did it so well. Recent captures of weapons caches showed they were effective. They were well trained and highly disciplined individuals who became an integral part of a team at 2nd Commando Regiment, a very tightly banded brotherhood, fighting for freedom from terrorism and oppression. Private Timothy James Aplin was from the Sydney based 2nd Commando Regiment. He joined the Army Reserves on 4 February 1992 and transferred to the Regular Army on 20 September 1995 where he reached the rank of sergeant. In 2008 Private Aplin completed the Commando Selection and Training Course, a very notable achievement by the most demanding of measures. In January 2009 he was posted to the then 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (Commando) after completing the Commando Reinforcement Cycle. As a part of the process that Private Aplin undertook to become a commando in the Royal Australian Army he was required to give up his rank of sergeant. He did this willingly, as many before him had done. In doing so Private Aplin joined with those who went before him. He revealed his unconditional commitment to the Australian Army and to the 2nd Commando Regiment. By all accounts, Private Aplin was an outstanding commando, highly respected and dedicated to his job. He had been deployed as part of Operation Tanager in East Timor, in 2000; Operation Bastille in the Middle East, in 2003; and Operation Slipper in Afghanistan, in 2009 and then again in 2010. This, his second tour of Afghanistan, where he was serving as a member of the Australian Special Operations Task Group as a team demolition specialist, was unfortunately to be his last. But I am sure that, if asked, he would have gone around again. Like so many of his colleagues will attest, they were most happy when they were on the ground plying their trade for which they had trained so well and so hard. Private Aplin has been awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with East Timor, Iraq and ICAT Clasps. He has been honoured with the Infantry Combat Badge; the Iraq Campaign Medal; the United Nations Medal with Ribbon UNTAET; the Australian Defence Medal; the Defence Long Service Medal; and the Afghan Campaign Medal. Private Aplin has also been awarded the Return from Active Service Badge from a prior deployment. The following statement was released on behalf of Private Aplin’s wife and family. I am honoured to read it to the House: Timothy Aplin is a man who represented many things to many people. He was first, foremost and most importantly, an adored husband to his beloved Natasha, and a loving, guiding light as father and stepfather to their children Ty, Shinae, Josie and Daniel. Tim was a much loved, valued and loyal friend to so many. He was a highly trained and highly regarded soldier, who as a senior non-commissioned officer decided to pursue his dream of becoming a Special Forces soldier, and ultimately, a Commando. Private Aplin’s parents, Mrs Margaret Gunnell and Mr Richard Gunnell, also released a moving tribute: MAIN COMMITTEE We are all very proud of Tim. Tim was very fit and active with a real sense of adventure. He loved life, loved his family and was a devoted friend, father, uncle, son, brother and nephew. Tim was a proud Australian who followed his dream to join the army. He loved military life and enjoyed his job. He was a confident and highly capable soldier and his loss will be deeply felt. On behalf of Tim’s very large and extended family, we would like to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers and we would now like the opportunity to grieve with our family and friends in private. Private Aplin will be sorely missed by all those who knew him, particularly his family, colleagues and friends. I especially convey to his family my sincere condolences at this very difficult time. Private Scott Travis Palmer was also from the Sydney based 2nd Commando Regiment. He joined the Army in 2001 and, after successfully completing the Commando Selection and Training Course in 2006, he joined the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (Commando). Serving his country through overseas deployment was not something that Private Palmer shied away from. At just 27 he had seen operational service in East Timor, Iraq and twice in Afghanistan prior to this tour where he would tragically never return home from. Private Palmer clearly understood the importance of his role to his country but also demonstrated a brave dedication to the safety of overseas nations and to the colleagues with whom he fought side by side. His lasting legacy to his colleagues will be one of professionalism, despite the demanding, dangerous, difficult work he was asked to do. Not only did he love his job but he was good at it. Having his mates to work alongside only made it better. Private Palmer was awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with Iraq, East Timor and ICAT Clasps. He was awarded the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Australian Defence Medal, the Australian Service Medal with the Timor-Leste Clasp, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the NATO ISAF Medal and the Returned from Active Service Badge from a previous deployment. I believe one of the greatest honours in this world is to serve one’s country. Private Palmer did that many times over, and Australia is blessed to have been served by such a dedicated and talented commando. It is also with deep sadness that we say farewell to Private Benjamin Adam Chuck from the Sydney based 2nd Commando Regiment. Born in Atherton Queensland, Private Chuck joined the Army in May 2004 as part of the Special Forces Direct Recruiting Scheme at just 21 years of age. After completing commando selection and training, he was posted to the then 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (Commando) and served as the patrol medic with his sniper team. Colleagues of Private Chuck have described him as an outstanding, passionate, caring, highly trained commando who excelled at everything he attempted. I have no doubt his talents served his team immeasurably during these three tours of Afghanistan. He was awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with the ICAT Clasp, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the NATO ISAF Medal, the Infantry Combat Badge, the Australian Defence Medal and the Returned from Active Service Badge from his first deployment in Afghanistan. Of course, Private Chuck’s passion extended beyond work and into his life at home with his family. As his mother, Susan, told the Australian: MAIN COMMITTEE “He loved what he did … He was focused on what he was doing. Even though he knew it was dangerous, he did it with the utmost pride. “He was a passionate family man. He wasn’t married, but he was in a lovely relationship. We were a very close family, my husband, his siblings and I. What happened to him was just a tragic accident.” His father, Gordon, has told of a young man who loved life and all that he could pack into it. I would like to read from an article in the Cairns Post written by Stephanie Harrington, whose words go some small way to describe the man that Private Chuck was to his family and to his team. BEN Adam Chuck was a man among men. He handled crocodiles and venomous snakes at a local zoo. He flew helicopters and was a “beautiful kickboxer” who never lost a fight. It was this thirst for adventure that spurred the former Atherton State High School student to train as a commando and become part of the Australian forces in Afghanistan in May 2007. Pte Chuck was due to return home from his third mission in a fortnight, but for his devastated Tableland family, he will never walk through their door. Pte Chuck was one of the three Australian commandos who died when their Black Hawk helicopter crashed in Kandahar Province in southern Afghanistan early on Monday morning. It was the biggest loss of life in any incident during Australia’s near-decade long involvement in Afghanistan. Pte Chuck was a passenger in the helicopter, along with Pte Tim Aplin and Pte Scott Palmer, who also died in the accident. Yesterday, Pte Chuck’s heartbroken family spoke of their pride for their “courageous and kind” son who celebrated his 27th birthday on Friday. Dad Gordon, 61, mum Susan, 58, brother Jason, 29, and his wife Gemma gathered at their Yungaburra home yesterday supported by a family friend. “Ben believed very much in what he was doing and so did we. We knew the risks and so did he,” Mr Chuck said. “I guess we will just live with the thought that when you believe in something strongly enough, there’s always the possibility the ending may be like this. “But he loved his country. I guess he paid the ultimate price and so have we.” Mrs Chuck said her son, who is also survived by his sister Tiffany, 23, and his partner of 18 months Tess Crane, had followed in the footsteps of his grandfathers, both decorated soldiers who served in World War II. “He was an amazing solider and loved it,” Mrs Chuck said. Pte Chuck was among fewer than 20 of 250 applicants who made the Special Forces during a recruitment drive in 2004, when he was given the most outstanding soldier award. He went on to earn four medals and two badges during his six years of service. A Department of Defence spokesperson described him as an outstanding and highly-trained commando whose “affectionate and caring nature drove his passion for helping his mates”. Pte Chuck was based at Sydney’s Holsworthy Barracks. Jason Chuck, who spoke to his brother on Saturday, said Pte Chuck’s goal was to fly a helicopter in search and rescue missions when he returned to Australia on July 8. “He was a very strong leader. He just naturally commanded a lot of respect,” Jason Chuck said. “Joining the army was probably the best thing he ever did, regardless of the outcome. It gave him such a sense of purpose and direction he didn’t have before.” MAIN COMMITTEE As I noted, before joining the army as a commando, Private Chuck worked at Hartley’s Crocodile Adventures in Queensland from 1 July 2003 to 14 January 2004. It seemed somewhat natural that an enthusiastic crocodile handler would make the transition to the army’s elite commandos. Through the former member for Leichhardt Warren Ench, a known crocodile farmer, I made contact with Ms Angela Freeman, Private Chuck’s previous supervisor at Hartley’s Crocodile Adventures. She spoke of a highly respected and well liked young man. She spoke of his gentle and polite nature. She said: He was an outstanding person, an outstanding human being. There’s no way you can take away from his bravery and remarkable nature. He enjoyed things which involved some risk-taking so understandably he got a great deal of joy working with crocodiles. His colleagues were very impressed with how quickly Ben progressed and learned the trade of croc. handling where in a very short time he became a very highly valued employee. In fact every time he came back to visit us I tried to get him back working for us. Ben was always willing to take on new tasks and challenges, including working with venomous snakes and appearing on ABC television promos which many people would’ve seen him on. Ben had a very cheeky sense of humour and thoroughly enjoyed his work. We were sorry to see him go, but we understood he was training very hard to join the army and the army was his passion. The last time. I saw Ben he was on his way back to Afghanistan. He came in for a visit and he said he was very happy working in the army. He was well aware of the danger, but believed he was part of something very important and proud of the work that he was doing. I have the deepest regard for his parents who gave their wholehearted support for Ben in his pursuits and I have the deepest sympathy for them now during this very difficult time. I’m sure Ben would have moved up the ranks and gone on to become a very successful soldier. I sincerely hope that Private Chuck’s family can take some small comfort in knowing that he died performing a job he loved, supported by people he loved and who loved him. Many people never find either of these great blessings despite their long lives. As I said at the beginning, it has been a rather emotional week for everybody in this parliament. At the ramp ceremony just 12 days ago, the arrival of Sapper Jacob Moerland and Sapper Darren Smith, I spoke to Sandy Moerland, Jacob’s mother. She gave me one message to sum it all up. She said: ‘Don’t let Jacob’s death be in vain.’ The work that our men and women do in Afghanistan and in other theatres of operation, where they place themselves in harm’s way for the benefit of others, should never be underestimated or undervalued, and we must make sure that the deaths of these fine Australians are not in vain. I have not yet spoken to the families of Private Timothy James Aplin, Private Benjamin Adam Chuck or Private Scott Travis Palmer but I am sure they share that same sentiment: they do not want the deaths of these fine sons of ANZAC to be in vain. In all of this, I think of the quote by Joaquin Miller: The bravest battle that ever was fought! ShallI tell you where and when? On the maps of the world you will find it not; ‘Twas fought by the mothers of men. Shortly, Australia will welcome home another three sons. We will respect them, we will thank them and we will bless them. As John 15:13 says: Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. MAIN COMMITTEE This they did, and for that their nation will be forever truly grateful. We will always remember them. We will remember their contribution, we will remember their mates and we will persevere-because the job is not yet finished, and to pull out before the job is finished would be to discredit these fine Australians who gave their all. moving contribution. The question is that the motion be agreed to. appropriate that you be in the chair at this time, given your previous roles in this place, your deep-seated interest in our military history and of course your support for the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. I know that you feel very keenly these very emotional debates. The member for Paterson, at some length and in some detail, provided us with information about the three soldiers we pay tribute to this morning, so I will not go over that again. I apologise in advance, though, if I am a little bit repetitive, because, sadly and tragically, we were in this chamber only two days ago paying tribute to Sappers Moerland and Smith, and in many ways the issues we confront today are much the same. I begin by extending my sympathy to the families of Private Tim Aplin, Private Ben Chuck and Private Scott Palmer. To all of their family members, to all of their friends, to all of their ADF colleagues, I say how sorry I am, as I am sure we all are, that they are no longer with us. They are no longer with us because they, like many who have gone before them, were prepared to give their lives in service to their nation. I knew none of these three fine soldiers, but there is an extraordinary level of consistency in these matters, and I do not need to have known them to know that they were highly skilled, courageous and dedicated. Just as importantly, they knew what they were doing, they knew the risks and they believed in what they were doing. As I said two days ago, I hope that their family and friends draw some strength from that fact-that they really believed in what they were doing. As a former defence minister I have been to many repatriations and funerals for soldiers who have fallen in operations, and again it is very consistent that the family members do draw strength, I have found, from the fact that their boys knew the risks and believed in what they were doing. That is absolutely the case with respect to the three soldiers we pay tribute to and whom we thank this morning. We have now lost 16 fine Australians in Afghanistan-17, if you include Rifleman Nash, a western suburbs boy who was serving with the UK force in Afghanistan. I think we should include him in that list. He was fighting for the same cause, albeit in a different uniform, and with the same dedication and the same courageous approach. I want to read their names into the record again, because I think we should do that regularly to ensure that these people are not forgotten. They are: Sergeant Andrew Russell, Trooper David ‘Poppy’ Pearce, Sergeant Matthew ‘Matty’ Locke, Private Luke Worsely, Lance Corporal Jason Marks, Signaller Shaun McCarthy, Lieutenant Michael Fussell, Private Gregory Sher, Corporal Matthew Hopkins, Sergeant Brett Till, Private Benjamin Ranaudo, Sapper Jacob Moerland, Sapper Darren Smith and, of course, again today, Private Aplin, Private Chuck and Private Palmer. Afghanistan is a very, very dangerous place. The campaign we are part of there is a very challenging one. I said two days ago that, unfortunately, the longer we are there, the more MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Condolences
159,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ds Vale),I thank the member for Paterson for his very,199,Condolences
160,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (11.21 Am),"Madam Deputy Speaker Vale, I think it is verypeople we lose and the more people who are injured-and I also refer to those who were injured in the same helicopter crash that took out these three fine soldiers-the harder it will be to maintain the support of the Australian electorate for this campaign. Again, I make an appeal to the broader Australian electorate to understand, first of all, that we are there for good reason. We are there to stabilise a country which previously provided a safe haven, a breeding ground and a launching pad for terrorists prepared to perpetrate their acts of terror right around the globe, including on our doorstep and even on our own homeland. It is a very, very important thing to play our role in ensuring that people are able to travel freely around the globe and enjoy a safe lifestyle in their own homeland without threat or any question about their freedom. That is why we are there. How do we achieve that? We achieve that by ensuring that the democratically elected government of Afghanistan has the capacity to take care of its own security and therefore deny groups like al-Qaeda the opportunity to once again use their own country to launch those vicious terrorist attacks around the globe. We do so by building up their security forces-both their defence force and their police forces-helping them build an economy, helping them build a system of governance and assisting them in establishing a justice system. These are important initiatives. We are only a relatively small part of the global effort to achieve those aims but we play an important part. It is important that we continue to make a contribution, not just because of what our contribution provides on the ground-and it is a significant one; we are certainly punching above our weight-but also because it is important to send a signal that the international community is working together in a common cause against a common foe and that it is not a conflict between the United States of America and one particular fundamentalist group, or one particular country, even. It is an international effort, and we are standing together and cooperating together to achieve those aims. That is a very, very important message to both those who we confront in Afghanistan and the global community more generally. Of course, there are other implications. Afghanistan has implications for countries like Pakistan in particular, a nuclear capable state, a state so critical to maintaining stability in that part of the region. But there is another point. Imagine a precipitate withdrawal from Afghanistan now, after nine years of operations. Can you imagine the humanitarian disaster which would flow from that precipitate withdrawal, as retribution was sought against all those who have sided with the international security forces? It would probably be a humanitarian disaster on a scale we have not seen before. Again, of course, that has implications for countries like Pakistan, which was the destination for so many refugees who fled war-torn Afghanistan in the early to mid-eighties, and countries like Australia, which will undoubtedly be a destination for those who again flee the acts of terror perpetrated by fundamentalist groups like the Taliban and indeed others. These are very, very good reasons to stay the course. Today we saw a momentous event in Parliament House. We saw a change of Prime Minister. We will be reading about it for some days, weeks and indeed months ahead. I cannot speak on behalf of the new Prime Minister. She will speak for herself. I speak merely as a humble backbencher, but I am confident that the government’s policy will not change on Afghanistan. I am confident that our commitment to Afghanistan will remain in place. Indeed, I would urge the new Prime Minister to ensure that we continue to maintain our commitment. It is not an open-ended commitment. The government have made it clear that we have a clearly MAIN COMMITTEE defined mission, and that is to train the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army in Oruzgan province up to a capacity where it is able to play its important role in enforcing and maintaining local peace and security. While our Mentoring Task Force is doing so, our Special Forces soldiers continue to clear and deny the worse of the enemy. But we do have an end goal, and that is it. I remind the Australian people that the government under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has clearly defined the mission now and has provided an end point for the mission, and I ask them to be very, very patient with us. I remind that House that the three brave Australian soldiers we pay tribute to today were not conscripts; they were volunteers, highly professional soldiers, highly trained, highly skilled, highly committed and highly determined to do their bit for their country. They believed in what they were doing, and we as an international community should also believe in what they were doing and what those who are still serving in Afghanistan and other operations are doing. I will say it again: the most effective way in which we can express our appreciation to them and indeed support their families-I should be careful not to generalise on that, but I believe it would be a general view amongst the families and friends-is to stay the course and finish the job. Their families and friends would not want their sacrifice to have been in vain. I know it is hard because from time to time decisions come out of Brussels and Kabul which leave us somewhat bewildered. There are countries in the partnership that from time to time do not seem to be pulling their weight, but that is no reason not to continue on that very important mission. Having said that, it is incumbent on the government to continually reassess the mission to ensure that success is achievable and of course to ensure that in those global councils, whether they be in Washington, Brussels or Kabul, the right decisions are being made and a strategy is in place to deliver the key objectives we seek to achieve. Again, I pay tribute to Privates Tim Aplin, Ben Chuck and Scott Palmer and extend my sympathies to their families and friends. Having made a contribution now to two of these condolence motions in one week, I dearly hope that this will be my last. want to know about bravery, look at the mothers. In my own family, my great-great grandmother suffered this and then my great-grandmother suffered it as well-Bert Henley, my great-grandfather’s brother, died at Gallipoli. His namesake, Bert Henley, died soon after coming home from Changi Prison. I think the most moving scene I have ever seen in a movie was the first one in Saving Private Ryan. In that movie, the camera is behind the mother at the door. The black limousine pulls up and the telegram is brought telling the mother that her three sons are dead. Everything that was in that woman’s body that held her upright simply crumpled as she collapsed to the floor. Tommy McIver, the famous rough rider and country music singer, wrote in the song 21 Guns: ‘The angel of death with his knock at the door, the crumpled up telegram falls to the floor. Her reason for livin’ is livin’ no more as she cries for the pride of Australia.’ That is the story of Susan Chuck, the mother of the soldier we are commemorating here in the House. I sincerely congratulate the Cairns Post on the really wonderful treatment and effort they have made to honour one of our North Queensland sons. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you do in Tasmania, we live in a very small community where everybody knows everybody. WhilstI do not know the Chucks personally, Gordon Chuck went on the walk at Kokoda with MAIN COMMITTEE",199,Condolences
161,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (11.35 Am),"The previous speakers referred to bravery. If youIan Hosey, and I know Ian very well. My chief of staff and right hand director comes from Malanda, which is just 15 or 20 kilometres down the road, and her mother knows the family well. You can see the sort of people that they are, with Gordon Chuck doing the Kokoda Track. They established Eden House, which is a wonderful tourist attraction and enriches the tourist basket we can offer visitors from outside Far North Queensland. They have made a very great contribution to the Far North Queensland industry. I am drawing a picture for you of what these people are like. Private Chuck’s home town of Yungaburra must be one of the most beautiful places on earth. It has a magnificent lake and behind it is the dense high-elevation jungle of North Queensland. Every night of the year you use one blanket, and there is no night of the year when you need to use two blankets. It truly is a beautiful place with beautiful buildings and people that are very, very civilised. Private Chuck, because he was a man who clearly loved challenges, took himself off to become a crocodile handler. I hold up for the benefit of the House a picture of Private Chuck contending with a crocodile, all but wrestling with it. He was also a handler of dangerous snakes at the zoo. He was a man that loved life, loved excitement, loved adventure and was making his contribution, like his parents, to a wonderful industry in Far North Queensland. I quote from the very wonderful treatment by the Cairns Post commemorating one of our sons: THE brother of fallen soldier Pte Ben Chuck yesterday cautioned against using the commando’s death as a reason to pull Australian troops out of Afghanistan. As support for the war wanes and is likely to continue to fall after the death of three Australian commandos on Monday, Jason Chuck said his brother was committed to Australia’s role in Afghanistan. “I don’t want this used as some sort of political justification for bringing troops home. That wouldn’t have been something Ben would have endorsed. He was so proud of what he did,” Mr Chuck said. A very moving editorial by the paper says: … on Monday, one of our own sons, Ben Chuck of Yungaburra, was among three experienced Special Forces soldiers killed in a helicopter crash. Now it is very real, very raw and very painful. The war is now very much part of our community and we all share the grief of his family and friends in the close-knit Tableland village. Ben’s death and that of his two colleagues are the worse suffered by the Australian army on operations since Vietnam. … The Chuck family blames no one for the death of their 27-year-old son. They knew the risks he faced and he did too. Ben was among the elite in the Special Forces and received a most outstanding soldier award. He was dedicated to the war on terrorism and determined to play his part in removing these killers who spare no one in their misguided quest of murder. The family supports Australia’s involvement in the war and do not, for one moment, want the Defence Force to withdraw, despite current debate … We grieve for the family but we know, as they know, he died bravely and courageously fighting to rid the world of the terror which has changed the face of this planet forever. Another article in the Cairns Post reads: BEN Adam Chuck was a man among men. He handled crocodiles and venomous snakes at a local zoo. He flew helicopters and was a “beautiful kickboxer” who never lost a fight. MAIN COMMITTEE It was this thirst for adventure that spurred the former Atherton State High School studentI might add, for those that follow the great game of rugby league, that just up the road is the home of Dallas Johnson and just down the road, at Gordonvale, is the home of Nate Myles. We pride ourselves on the boys coming out of the Atherton Tableland, like Mickey Nasser’s mob. They have always been tough people who love excitement and adventure. The article goes on: It was this thirst for adventure that spurred the former Atherton State High School student to train as a commando and become part of the Australian forces in Afghanistan in May 2007. Pte Chuck was due to return home from his third mission in a fortnight, but for his devastated Tableland family, he will never walk through their door. Yesterday, Pte Chuck’s heartbroken family spoke of their pride for their “courageous and kind” son who celebrated his 27th birthday on Friday. Dad Gordon, … mum Susan, … brother Jason, … and his wife Gemma gathered at their Yungaburra home yesterday supported by a family friend. “Ben believed very much in what he was doing and so did we. We knew the risks and so did he,” Mr Chuck said. “I guess we will just live with the thought that when you believe in something strongly enough, there’s always the possibility the ending may be like this. “But he loved his country. I guess he paid the ultimate price and so have we.” Mrs Chuck said her son … followed in the footsteps of his grandfathers, both decorated soldiers who served in World War II. “He was an amazing solider and loved it,” Mrs Chuck said. Pte Chuck was among fewer than 20 of 250 applicants who made the Special Forces… Remember that those 250 applicants are only the people who thought they would have some chance. If you asked how many people wanted to be a commando, it might be 2,000 or 3,000, but only those 250 thought they were good enough to apply. Of that 250, only 20 became commandos. So this man was an elite of the elite. The article goes on: He went on to earn four medals and two badges during his six years of service. A Department of Defence spokesperson described him as an outstanding and highly-trained commando whose “affectionate and caring nature drove his passion for helping his mates”. As a person who spent eight years in uniform in the militia on 24-hour call-up to fight in Indonesia and later in Vietnam, I do not think you really go out there with a burning love for your country. In the back of your mind, you know that that is what it is all about, but really in the Army you do what your country requires of you and you do it because you do not want to let your mates down. That probably is one of the strongest forces operating inside a military unit. The article goes on to quote Private Chuck’s brother Jason: “Joining the army was probably the best thing he ever did, regardless of the outcome. It gave him such a sense of purpose and direction he didn’t have before.” The Australian flag at the family’s business Eden House Retreat and Mountain Spa at Yungaburra was flying at half mast yesterday as the Tableland community started to grieve for their fallen son. Staff at Atherton State High School, from where Pte Chuck graduated a decade ago, remembered him as a well-liked and personable student. MAIN COMMITTEE “He’s from a very respected family and was well thought of within the school,” acting principal Stuart Edwards said. “It’s terrible.” Pte Chuck worked as a wildlife keeper and crocodile handler at Hartley’s Crocodile Adventures, north of Cairns, for six months before joining the army. He earlier worked at the Cairns Crocodile Farm. At Hartley’s, Pte Chuck learned to handle venomous snakes and thrilled tourists as a performer in the crocodile attack show. Zoo co-owner Peter Freeman said Pte Chuck had left a lasting impression and would drop by Hartley’s to catch up with staff when he visited his family. “He was an extremely good employee,” Mr Freeman said. “Everyone who worked with Ben has remembered him and remembered him as a great person and a great colleague.” … … … “He loved life and all of the adventure he could pack into it,” Mr Chuck said. “He was a man amongst men.” Another article says: “We will be bring him home,” his mother Susan Chuck told The Cairns Post yesterday. … … … The decorated soldier, 27, described as a “man among men”, died in a Black Hawk helicopter crash in Kandahar Province early on Monday morning. Pte Chuck’s brother, Jason, said the news had hit the family hard but there was some comfort in knowing he died doing what he loved. “He was a passionate soldier and he, and his unit, were always so excited leading into a deployment,” he said. “He had pride in serving his country and deeply believed in what they were doing. “It helps us knowing he died doing what he loved and we are sure this is the way he would have wanted to go.” It is worth mentioning that Private Chuck received commendation as an outstanding soldier on one occasion. We are a small community up on the Atherton Tableland. Particularly in this area we take very great pride in the achievements of our sons like Dallas Johnson and Nate Myles, but we take infinitely greater pride in someone of this nature who died serving his country. The article goes on: Mrs Chuck said Pte Chuck would be brought home shortly. “He loved north Queensland,” she said. “It’s where he would want to be.” (11.50 am)-I would like to express my sorrow at the passing of three Australian Defence Force members who were killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan on Monday. Privates Tim Aplin, Ben Chuck and Scott Palmer were all members of the Sydney based 2nd Commando Regiment and were serving with the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan when they lost their lives in the service of their nation. MAIN COMMITTEE",201,Condolences
162,Mr Griffin (Bruce,"Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel)Private Tim Aplin was serving as a demolitions specialist and was on his second tour of duty in Afghanistan. He has been described as an outstanding and dedicated commando who was highly respected. Private Ben Chuck was the patrol medic within his sniper team and was on his third tour in Afghanistan. He has been described as an outstanding commando who excelled at all he attempted. His affectionate and caring nature drove his passion for helping his mates. Private Scott Palmer was also on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan. He has been described as having professionalism of the highest order and excelling at everything he did. I extend my sincere condolences to the family and friends of these men and to the members of the Australian Defence Force, who also feel this great loss. In particular, I offer my deep condolences to: Private Tim Aplin’s wife Natasha; his children Ty, Shinae, Josie and Daniel; and his mother Margaret; Private Ben Chuck’s mother Susan, father Gordon, brother Jason, sister Tiffany and partner Tess; and Private Scott Palmer’s mother Pam, father Ray and brother Adam. To the members of the 2nd Commando Regiment, my thoughts are with you as you mourn the loss of three of your members and the wounding of another seven. I offer my prayers to the family and friends of Private Tim Aplin, Private Ben Chuck and Private Scott Palmer and also for the safe homecoming of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen who continue to serve in operations all around the world. Privates Aplin, Chuck and Palmer have made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of their nation and this will not be forgotten. I mourn their loss. today to the three soldiers who lost their lives in Afghanistan on 21 June, 2010. This is one of those moments where we are reminded of the seriousness of our actions here in the parliament and the potential consequences on our soldiers and of course their families. War is a serious business with serious consequences. I would, firstly, like to pay tribute to Timothy James Aplin, who was 38 years old. When I read that Private Aplin was 38 years old, I thought that 38 was quite old for a private and that there must be a story behind it. Indeed, there is a story behind Private Aplin. Having joined the Army Reserve in 1992 and having transferred to the Regular Army in 1995 Private Aplin had progressed to the rank of sergeant. But his goal was to pursue a career in Special Forces. He undertook the commando selection course and then the commando training course in 2008. But of course to enter Special Forces as an OR-other rank-normally you cannot, under any circumstances, go in taking that more senior rank such as sergeant or even corporal. Sergeant Aplin was presented with a choice: did he want to proceed with a posting to the 4th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment (Commando) or did he want to retain his sergeant rank? Pursuing the goal that he had always sought, he put aside his rank, reverted to private and went in as a commando. I think we need to remember that the rank of sergeant is very highly regarded by the soldiers of the Australian Army. It is not achieved lightly. There are subject courses to be passed for the rank of corporal and then sergeant. Recommendations by commanders need to be made. It is not something that is just achieved. It is no handout in the lolly packet, the cereal packet or anything like that. He worked hard to achieve his rank of MAIN COMMITTEE",204,Condolences
163,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (11.52 Am),"I would like to take the opportunity to pay tributesergeant, but his goal was Special Forces. His goal was the commandos, and he set aside his rank of sergeant to achieve his goal and join the commandos. I think that the way he did that was certainly a testament to great character: someone who wanted to serve his nation, someone who wanted to serve in a particular area as a commando, someone who had dedication to service. Private Aplin strikes me as the sort of man who was every commander’s dream, someone who just wanted to be there, just wanted to serve, just wanted to do the job, who was not wrapped up with the trappings of rank or anything like that but just wanted to get on and do his duty, and I imagine that he enjoyed doing his duty as well. Indeed, he was already something of a veteran, having had operational service in East Timor in 2000, the Middle East in 2003 and Afghanistan already in 2009. His second tour of Afghanistan was where he lost his life in the helicopter accident. I guess it is not that easy to replace people like that, who have that sort of unique and driven dedication to their profession. I think his loss in the 2nd Commando Regiment will be felt greatly, as indeed the loss of any of our soldiers is felt greatly within Defence. SoI pay tribute to Private Aplin today. I would also like to speak of Private Benjamin Adam Chuck, also a member of the 2nd Commando Regiment. The service of 27-year-old Private Chuck is also a story of its own. Some years ago, it was determined that there could be direct recruitment into the Special Forces, where people off the street, you might say, or maybe from the police could apply with the specific intent of entering the Special Forces. As I think all of us here know, and some of us who have served in the Army as well maybe know just a little bit better-and I am not Special Forces myself by any means-it is serious business out there. The weapons, the explosives and the training can be pretty dangerous stuff. Some may call them supersoldiers, as the SAS are often referred to, but there is no doubt that they are a highly trained organisation and highly effective. For someone like Private Chuck to have come from civilian life, to have specifically joined and to have just gone straight through those courses to become a commando is again a testament to an excellent character. He has been described as a person who excelled at everything he attempted. Clearly he was a very tough and determined young man. As we have heard from other speakers, he was fulfilling the role of patrol medic within his sniper team. It has also been said that he was devoted to his mates, as I am sure that all members of the 2nd Commando Regiment certainly are. I also take this opportunity to pay my respects regarding Private Palmer, the third soldier who unfortunately died in this helicopter crash. Private Palmer joined the Army in 2001. By the end of 2006, he had completed his commando selection course, his commando training course, and was then posted to the 4th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment (Commando) as it was then called, now the 2nd Commando Regiment. He certainly had plenty of operational experience. This was his third tour to Afghanistan, and he had also served at other times in East Timor and Iraq. He was also notable-as indeed, as I have said before, are all members of the 2nd Commando Regiment and members of the Australian Army in general-for his professionalism and dedication to excellence. A lot has been said about why we are in Afghanistan. Questions have been asked. Some people still ask why we are there. What possible influence can that place have on us here in Australia? The reality is that there are evil people in the world. The Taliban wish to increase fundamentalist Islamic rule across the region and beyond. Of course, they need a base. They need somewhere to train, somewhere to gather, somewhere to launch their wider operations MAIN COMMITTEE from, and that place is Afghanistan-but only if we let it be Afghanistan. We remember, not too long ago, the Taliban’s operations in the Swat Valley, in Pakistan, and I commend the Pakistani army and services for driving them back out of the Swat Valley and re-establishing legitimate government control over the Swat Valley. The Taliban continue to pursue a re-establishment of their bases in Afghanistan and their control in Afghanistan, and they intend to use that place to launch their forms of terrorism. We know that they are suppressors of women and the rights of women. They are controllers of education. They are soldiers of totalitarianism. I would just add one other thing to that. Who can forget those famous views of where the Taliban destroyed the image of Buddha carved into a cliff face in Afghanistan? These are, without doubt, evil people. We have no choice, and we have an obligation, to continue that fight against them. Certainly the Taliban provide no value in the world. They are enemies of democracy. The point is that, if we do not stay in Afghanistan until the Afghan government can ensure their own security, this nation and our neighbours may be subject to terrorism that originates from Afghanistan. That is my view about our national cause. But, down from such heights, I will bring it back home. There are the families who will forever have to live with the loss of their loved ones-in this case, the families of Private Aplin, Private Chuck and Private Palmer. It can be a struggle to find the words to say to those who have lost their loved ones in this cause. To the parents, brothers and sisters, partners and friends of these lost loved ones: my thoughts, my deepest sympathy and my heartfelt condolences are with them. These men died in defence of democracy and for liberation. Australia never wants to have to send soldiers abroad, but we have. Australians did not ask for violence, but we have answered it. Australia did not start this war, but we will move on with the coalition to win it. To all the Australian Defence Force personnel still engaged in the conflict in Afghanistan: take a moment to honour your fallen comrades, but maintain your vigilance, your confidence, your courage and your commitment to carry on with the mission. I thank them for their service. I thank the families of these fallen soldiers for the sacrifice. again, as I have previously in this chamber, about the deaths of Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, particularly Private Timothy James Aplin, Private Benjamin Adam Chuck and Private Scott Travis Palmer, all special operations soldiers in 2nd Commando Regiment. They were killed in action just days ago. The three soldiers we are mourning today died in what seems to have been an accidental helicopter crash of one of our US ally’s military helicopters. These are deaths in active service, and we honour them as we have honoured the other 13 Australians who have died in active service over the past eight years, including Sappers Moerland and Smith, for whom we had a condolence motion just the other day. I join with all the political leaders and other parliamentarians who have spoken before me in sending my deepest condolences to the families of those who have died. I think of the families of those who have been wounded and, like all members of this House, pray for their rapid and complete recovery. I also think of our American, British and Afghan allies and the losses they have sustained. Wars, particularly prolonged wars, are very difficult for democracies. It is easy to say, ‘We shall stay the course,’ but when we have months like this, with five deaths in rapid succession, we begin to realise what that means in practice. Questions begin to rise and pressure begins to mount on elected governments to find the best way to end the sacrifice of our best and bravMAIN COMMITTEE",205,Condolences
164,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (12.04 Pm),"It is with great sadness that I rise to speakest. We need to resist those calls. This is not a war that Australia or the democratic world as a whole can afford to lose. We need to win this war not for its own sake and not just to protect ourselves against terrorism. We also need to win it for the sake of the people of Afghanistan. I thought that point was made very strongly by the member for Paterson, on the other side of the chamber, who talked about having attended the ramp ceremonies and funerals of soldiers killed in Afghanistan very recently. I can echo that experience, having represented the government on the death of a soldier from Melbourne from 2nd Commando Company, 1st Commando Regiment, Private Greg Sher. Private Sher was our first reservist to be killed in action since Vietnam, and I am in contact with his father, Felix Sher, and family. All parliamentarians from the various electorates of the families of these brave people who are killed should remain in contact with them as part of our continuing service to them. I think Felix was quoted in the papers just in the last few days saying very clearly that these three boys died in the service of Australia and would want our leadership, military including our arguing not to be dissuaded. He spoke as the father of a very precious son who died in Afghanistan, saying that we should not give up the struggle and the fight there. The 28 million people in Afghanistan have suffered a great deal over the past 30 years: revolution, civil war, dictatorship, foreign invasion, political and religious fanaticism and savage repression. Millions have had to flee the country and spend years in refugee camps. At one stage, four million people had fled from the Taliban to Pakistan. Anyone who has seen the films of refugee camps teeming with millions of people can only have sympathy for those who have had to live under that dreadful regime. Thanks to Australia and its allies, the lives of most people in Afghanistan have been improved, and that is particularly true for Afghan women and children. That is something of which we should be proud, and we should be particularly proud of the role that the young women and men of our defence forces have played in bringing security and safety to so many people. I think of the huge numbers of young girls in Kabul who can now attend education, who were barred from it literally under the threat of death-as some of them still are in regional areas in Afghanistan-by the Taliban regime. The members for Cowan and Kennedy spoke very movingly about the nature of these servicemen-devoted to their mates, not over there with grand theories or ideological obsessions but representing Australia quietly and efficiently with their comrades in 2nd Commando Regiment and killed in action with their friends. They were fully devoted to each other and representing Australia, as Australian servicemen have been in recent conflicts, and we are so very proud of them. Things are very far from perfect in Afghanistan. You only need to read some Kipling to realise the dreadful terrain and the long standing nature of recriminations and interfactional fighting there. It goes back a long way. The British experienced it. The Soviets did as well. I hope and I pray that we are fighting in a different cause-for the people of Afghanistan, not against the people of Afghanistan. In some ways things have deteriorated in recent times. No-one ever supposed that rescuing such a country from the depths to which it had sunk under the Taliban regime was going to be easy. I remember seeing a dreadful film of a public execution of a woman in Afghanistan who was stoned to death in a public stadium. The reporter-for a British television program, I think-asked the Taliban minister, outside the country, ‘How can you spend the money of the MAIN COMMITTEE international community on a sports stadium where you kill people by public stoning?’ His contemptuous response was ‘Give us the money for another sports ground and we’ll play soccer there.’ This is the nature of the people that we are fighting against, in which cause these three brave men have laid down their lives. The rehabilitation of Afghanistan is a massive task and many mistakes have been made. We have been too tolerant of corruption and warlordism there. I am pleased to see our friends in the American congress are getting very tough with some of the contractors and some of the transport convoys about the bribes being paid to some of the gunmen for the warlords. Frankly, the recent presidential election was a disgrace. YetI remain optimistic. The United States troops surge has shown the strong commitment of the leading country in the coalition to give Afghanistan the help it needs to create a stable and defensible government and to give security to its population. That is, after all, the aim of Australia, the international force and the United States-to train the Afghan army into a position where eventually the allies can withdraw and leave the population of Afghanistan in some kind of security and safety. I think we have an obligation to assist in doing that, despite the price we are asking our men and women in uniform to pay. The consequences of failure for the people of Afghanistan, for us and for all those who look to the democratic world for help would be very grave. Just the other day in New Yorkto connect all the dots-the would be terrorist who left the huge bomb in Times Square boasted in confessing to the court that he was trained and paid by the Taliban. If we do not understand from that incident that the consequences of not confronting these people over there, rather than letting them have a secure base there, are that we will have them come to us, then we do not understand anything. We cannot ask our defence forces and their families to make sacrifices like this unless we strongly believe in the justice of the cause for which we are fighting. I believe that the cause of helping the Afghan people to defeat those who want to return them to slavery is a just one. The member for Cowan had a very insightful comment when he talked about the nature of a regime that would take the ancient and beautiful statues carved into the stone hills of Bamiyan by another civilisation thousands of years earlier, those famous buddhas, and blow up them up in their total contempt and hatred for other people’s religions. That is an insight into the nature of the people that we are confronting there. That is why, despite our grief over these deaths, I believe it is right to maintain our commitment. To the parents, the partners, the children and the friends of these three incredibly brave servicemen who died in the helicopter accident, I say that I believe we are right to maintain that commitment. It is the best way can honour the last full measure of devotion to our country that these three brave commandos made for Australia. pressing my condolence to the families of the three very brave young Australian soldiers who were lost in the recent helicopter accident in Afghanistan, Private Timothy Aplin, Private Benjamin Chuck and Private Scott Palmer, all of whom lost their lives on 21 June 2010. They were accompanied by seven other Australians, one of whom is from my electorate. Obviously the name of this very brave young man from my electorate, for reasons of both family privacy and national security, remains confidential, but I note that I have spoken with the partner and the father of this brave young soldier. MAIN COMMITTEE",207,Condolences
165,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (12.15 Pm),"I wish to join with all members of the House in exOn behalf of the family, I say to the government: we thank you for your help. The partner will be transported to Germany. There has been some confusion. The family was of the belief that the mother would also be transported. That was confirmed by the government and then that hope was taken away late last night. The family is not in a position to make these travel arrangements without assistance from the government. I realise that there are other issues concerning the government at the moment, but I respectfully ask that all care and immediate action be taken to assist the mother to travel to Germany. There is great distress in the family. There is particularly not just a concern about the son but a double emotion, having been offered the prospect of travel and having had that withdrawn in the last few hours. I have been in contact with the office of the Minister for Defence to this effect and the staff have been very helpful, but we do need a resolution, and I ask that a resolution be put in place today. More broadly, to the families of these three very brave young men who have been lost: they could not have given a greater sacrifice for Australia and, more significantly still, for the people of Australia and their long-term security. It is a tragic outcome. These are the finest of young people. They have extraordinary training, skill, intelligence and compassion and such a high-functioning nature that their deaths are doubly tragic. I want to talk briefly about the broader context: the foe. The challenge which is underway in Afghanistan is part of a broader global challenge to deal with a stream, a strand, of extremism which, irrespective of its religion, is aimed at destabilising the modern way of life. It is nihilist in many respects in that it is indiscriminate in its target. It seeks to destroy progress. It seeks to destroy the very freedoms that people on all sides of this House believe in, whether it is freedom of religion, freedom of action, gender freedom, in particular-all of the noble virtues which give people the ability to live their lives in full. These are under attack. What we see at the moment is the Wahhabi stream of Islamic extremism attempting in its own way to bring down governments. Whether it is the government of Pakistan, the government of Indonesia, the government of Saudi Arabia or the government of Egypt, it wants to destabilise these major Islamic countries and ensure that there is either a fragmentation or a takeover-those are the long-term, millennial objectives-and, in so doing, create and craft a very different world from that in which we live. That is a profound global challenge. It is real, it is important and it manifests itself in forms of terrorism, in acts of violence, first and foremost, within and against the Islamic world itself. The four countries that I have mentioned are all targets of extremist Islamic violence. Secondly, it manifests itself in acts of violence such as those that we saw so tragically close to home in Australia, in Bali, with both Bali bombings, with the attack on our embassy in Jakarta and on the Marriott Hotel and, most prominently, the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Centre, the Pentagon and the four flights. This insidious strand of terrorism has a strategic goal: to take as a base one of the four large states with a strong Islamic heritage and in so doing bring about a transition through internal destabilisation and violence. That is why it is not just an internal issue in Afghanistan. Afghanistan was the base for the Taliban, Afghanistan has been the hiding place for the senior leadership of al-Qaeda and Afghanistan was a centre for the activity which occurred on September 11 and throughout much of South-East Asia. So it is real and profound and of significance to Australia. The cause could not be greater in terms of our global responsibilities. The cause for which these Australian soldiers lost their lives could not be greater. Having said that, we have a duty MAIN COMMITTEE to do everything in our power to ensure that, where our forces are deployed, they are deployed in a way that protects them and their mission and does not in any way lead to them being needlessly exposed. There is a bipartisan commitment to this broader cause. We believe in it because it is profound and important. I recognise, though, that the costs are extraordinary and that it is ever so easy for those of us in this place to make easy gestures which are borne by others. We must never, ever forget the risk and the price and the commitment of those on the front line. The association I have had with the family of this very brave young soldier from my electorate over the last few days reminds me all too clearly that it is the brave young sons and daughters of Australia who are on the front line. We thank them for their commitment. I offer my profound thanks and condolences to the families of these three brave young Australian men: Private Timothy Aplin, Private Benjamin Chuck and Private Scott Palmer. Dr KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (12.23 pm)-I thank all members for their words today, as we gather again to farewell favourite sons lost in the cause in which they were engaged and offer our condolences to the families of Private Ben Chuck, Private Timothy Aplin and Private Scott Palmer. I echo of course all the comments about the importance of this conflict in which we have been engaged, and which I have previously commented on, in fighting this Islamic extremism. Australians have always steeled themselves in the cause of freedom and peace and have steeled themselves to endure costs in pursuing those aims. Australia lost 60,000 killed in the First World War and 48,000 in the Second World War. Our allies are alongside us in Afghanistan, where the Americans have lost over 1,100 troops, the British, 300, and the Dutch, our partners in Oruzgan, have lost 24 killed. We remained steeled to this task. It is extremely heartening and I think should be heartening to the families, to the colleagues of these soldiers and to the Australian people that the major parties of this parliament are united in continuing to support our troops and continuing to support this operation. It is particularly of note that these soldiers were reservists of the 2nd Commando Regiment. It is my privilege to have as part of my portfolio responsibilities the administration of the reserves-and what wonderful and special people they are. They devote aspects of their lives that would normally be reserved for leisure time or time with their families and make that extra commitment to train themselves, to serve and to offer their lives and limbs in the defence of this country above their ordinary commitments in their daytime job. In terms of the 2nd Commando Regiment, that goes to another level altogether. We know these are special operations or special forces soldiers who must train to an extremely high degree of proficiency, so the courses and training that they undertake are in addition to that which would normally be undertaken by a reservist. And, of course, in order to be deployed in Afghanistan they have to go to another level yet again in their proficiency and the excellence of their skills at arms. So we should very specially salute the commitment that they make, above and beyond their daytime jobs, to attain those skills and to serve in this cause. As the member for Melbourne Ports mentioned, we have had experience with losses in the regiment, dealing in particular with the family of Greg Sher. Felix and Yvonne Sher have been typical of the stoic families who have endured these losses, and in their commitment to supporting the troops and the mission. We attended various ceremonies associated with the Sher family in their loss, met many members of the 2nd Commando Regiment and know well their MAIN COMMITTEE commitment to this operation and to each other and their ongoing determination to confront this Islamist threat. The nature of these situations is terribly traumatic for everyone, of course. I would ask people to think of those who have to bring the news of these losses to the families. I have been in the position of being the duty officer who has to go and visit a family and be first person to advise them of their loss. This is a very difficult job to perform. We should spare a thought for those who serve that purpose in our Defence Force as well. I have seen the consequences of what happens on the ground to our men and women and to our allies, and know what trauma it causes to the colleagues of these soldiers and how they will be grieving and drawing together to deal with that grief. We should spare a thought for their colleagues who remain and of course for the injured as well, who will have long periods of recovery to contend with. We should provide them with all the support we can. The other aspect that is worth noting is the nature of service in the Australian Defence Force that is highlighted by this incident. People focus, of course, on some of the combat casualties that we experience. But, on a daily basis, men and women of this Defence Force risk their lives in hazardous training to achieve their states of professional proficiency. We do lose people in accidents in training. The nature of that service is why we salute so much the men and women in the Australian Defence Force, because they assume those risks just to be in a position to deploy in the first place. There are quite often casualties in conflict zones relating to these types of transport or other situations. Before you even confront the threat of the enemy, the hazards of the environment are great to begin with, in relation to the diseases, the extremes of weather conditions, the hazardous nature of the terrain and the circumstances of having to move around in an operational context following operational procedures where the normal standards of the air traffic control or occupational health and safety will not apply. So we ask our personnel to assume that risk in the context of their training, in the context of deploying, in the context of conducting these operations. One of the most heart breaking experiences of my service was a previous helicopter accident we experienced here in Australia where we lost 18 of our personnel in the crash of the Black Hawk helicopters in northern Queensland. That was incredibly traumatic for the defence family at the time. Once again, they were training for the difficult circumstances of night operations, albeit not in an operational zone. So we should bear in mind that the entirety of service life encompasses these risks. That is why it is so special. That is why we pay such tribute to these personnel in the first place. We are here today to recognise the further addition of names to the list of those which we honour in the service of this nation in the context of this conflict and the cause against Islamic extremism and the cause of peace and freedom. Their names will be added to that glorious history of the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Army. It will be an enduring memory. Our thoughts and our prayers go out to the families, the survivors and the colleagues of these members. We will bear them in our hearts forever and we will continue to support our troops in every way possible. members to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places.

Kalgoorlie Electorate the fact that the original Federation division of Kalgoorlie, created of course in 1901, will at the proroguing of this parliament disappear from the list of electoral divisions across Australia. Back in 1901 the electorate of Kalgoorlie was one of just five Western Australian seats that were part of the 75 seats across Australia. Since 1901 there have been a number of outstanding members representing the seat of Kalgoorlie. From 1901 to 1903 there was Mr JW Kirwan for the Free Trade Party. He was followed by Mr CE Frazer of the ALP, who was followed in 1913 by MrH Mahon for the ALP. In 1917 there was MrE Heitmann for the National Party. In 1919 MrH Mahon was back again. In 1920 there was MrG Foley and in 1922 there was Mr AE Green for the ALP. From 1940 for a period of 18 years there was MrH Johnson for the ALP. In 1958 he was replaced by MrP Browne for the Liberal Party-for the first time there was a Liberal member for Kalgoorlie. In 1961 there was MrF Collard. From 1975 till 1980 MrJ Cotter, who was know as Mick Cotter, served for the Liberal Party. Then Mr Graeme Campbell served for 18 years, firstly, as an ALP member and, secondly, as an Independent. Of course, I took the seat in 1998, 12 years ago. Kalgoorlie is an electorate that is enormous. Its area today is some 2.3 million square kilometres. It was a fraction of that size when it was first formed in 1901. It has the auspicious title of being the largest electorate in the world today. To give an idea of comparative size to those who have no idea of the vastness of Australia, it occupies approximately a third of the Australian landmass. It is in contrast to the smallest electorate of Australia, which is Wentworth. Wentworth would fit into the seat of Kalgoorlie some 88,472 times. Of course, because that is the case, as member for Kalgoorlie I have one more staff member just to do the job. We are all incredibly capable. One of the outstanding representatives for the seat of Kalgoorlie was, of course, Mr Mahon, who became the Postmaster-General at one stage of his career. Another thing about the seat of Kalgoorlie, and more specifically the location of Kalgoorlie, is that it was the population of Kalgoorlie in 1901 that justified the formation of the Federation. Federation was looking a little shaky there for a while because Western Australia, of course, was not particularly interested in giving up its direct connection to the UK, but it was the overwhelming vote of the population of Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie and Boulder that swayed that final decision. So, for the education of the House, it is reasonable to suggest that it was because of the population of Kalgoorlie-Boulder that the Federation was formed in the first place. I remind the House again that as of the proroguing of this parliament, whenever that may occur, the name Kalgoorlie will forever leave the list of Federation seats. That is indeed a sad day. We are moving on, and the area will in the future be represented by the seat of O’Connor MAIN COMMITTEE",212,Condolences

Disability ServicesA happy life consists not in the absence, but in the mastery of hardships. I admire this sentiment, and I believe that it is one that can apply to everyone, not just people with a disability. During my five years in parliament, I have spoken on many occasions on disability and the need for governments of all persuasions and at all levels to provide adequate support to services for people with disabilities, their families and the carers. About one in 10 Australians has a disability, and about one in five has a family member with a disability. In Werriwa there are some 5,000 people who receive a disability support pension to help them meet the cost of living. There is a growing awareness that we can do better when it comes to programs to support people with disabilities. Currently, too many people fall through the cracks. The level of support available is not adequate. Occasionally it is the red tape that gets in the way of people with disabilities and their families getting proper and efficient access to the services they need. What is needed is for disability issues to move from the ‘important’ basket into the ‘urgent’ basket-from problems that should be dealt with in the future to those that should be tackled now. There are many worthwhile organisations in my electorate in the south-west of Sydney that are trying to change the way decision makers determine the way in which the services provided to their clients are administered. Every day they fight for recognition that all disabilities are different and require different approaches. Organisations such as Junction Works, Macarthur Disability Services, Macarthur District Temporary Family Care, Hoxton Industries and Northcott Disability Services, just to name a few, advocate for their clients so that the needs of people with disabilities are better taken care of. In many cases, staff from these organisations are also family members of people with disability. Unfortunately, the needs of carers who provide a service to family members with a disability sometimes go unrecognised. A shining example of the involvement of family members is provided by Grace Fava and Fiona Zammit, both from the Autism Advisory and Support Service in Liverpool. Both Grace and Fiona are mothers of children who have autism. They have joined forces with other local parents to empower children with autism and their families through knowledge and support. I found it quite shocking to find out that 57 per cent of children in New South Wales aged five and under whose parents are in receipt of carers allowance for autism spectrum disorder live within a 40-kilometre radius of Liverpool in the south-west of Sydney. That is why I recently moved a notice of motion in this House to congratulate the Rudd Labor government on the decision to establish a groundbreaking autism early learning centre in Liverpool. It is my strong desire that this House and this government reaffirm their recognition that a combination of special education, speech therapy, occupational therapy and behavioural intervention has proved to be successful in helping people with autism disorders. We need to recognise that early diagnosis and intervention are essential to ensure that families and carers have the appropriate professional support that they need. We also need to acknowledge that, MAIN COMMITTEE",213,Adjournment
171,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (12.37 Pm),"Helen Keller once said:with early intervention and appropriate support, children with autism have a much greater chance of fulfilling their potential and participation more fully in the community. It is a sad fact that right now 1.5 million Australians with serious disabilities, and their 500,000 full-time carers, do not have the resources they need to represent themselves. Over the next 40 years, we will see a steady growth in the number of people with disabilities. It is predicted that it will continue to grow, from 1.4 million to 2.9 million. It is now time to heed the words of Helen Keller, and I repeat her sentiments: a happy life consists not in the absence but in the mastery of hardships. We need to ensure that we have a thoroughly thought out plan to respond to this trend. We must not fail in our responsibility to provide adequate support and efficient services to people with a disability, their families and their carers. Labor Leadership rescuing a government that had lost its way, but I remind Australians that what we have in Prime Minister elect Gillard is a minister who has walked out on a ministry that lost its way years ago. We know about the Building the Education Revolution-we know about the $5 billion that disappeared into the pockets of state governments, project managers and assorted spivs. We know about the $1.7 billion that was sold by Prime Minister elect Gillard as an expansion of the program but was just another blow-out. We know that only 30 per cent of those school laptops have been delivered, and that so many of the children waiting on that election promise of 2007 are yet to touch and feel a laptop. We know that only 13 of the 2,650 trades training centres have even been built. Parents, promised so much more, have seen so little from this Prime Minister elect. And, finally, only 38 of the 260 promised childcare centres have actually been delivered, and that means that every childcare centre in the area of Redlands secretly fears a ‘Julia Gillard memorial childcare centre’ right next to their own. It is a dreadful predicament we are left in with education-and this is a Prime Minister who promises a fairer go. But don’t just believe me. Once again, I have asked anyone who is not a party member who wishes to communicate with me on Facebook to have their say, and here they are. Glenn Irvine from Capalaba says: There is a name for someone who one day categorically denies leadership intentions, and the next, stages a coup for that leadership… it is called “Raw Ambition” … From Gabby Lewis: Rudd was not bad! he was doing fine! Gillard is bad! just because she is a woman people think she will do better i strongly disagree Kerry Stewart-Haynes says: Not isolated to one person or party … A whole lot of snivelling and backstabbing, it seems to me. Andrew Darvall of Thorneside says: I believe Australians are switched on enough to see this for what it is. A blatant re-establishment of the time-honoured tradition of unions manipulating the strings of Australian parliament and government as a whole. I vote no to Puppet Julia.

They can’t just decide to change it with only 100 odd people voting. She says that Rudd was doing just fine. From Capalaba, Michelle Welch writes: I agree with Amy on this, and as Rudd said everyone learns from there mistakes, he does too, and other pass ones just ignore there mistakes they make. From Gabby Lewis: We don’t want ms gillard in charge … Tatia Power from Alexandra Hills says: Pleased to see a woman PM, but ready for an election to let the public vote From Brad McElhinney: stick with Rudd hes doing a great job From Bianca Stubbs: I’ve always voted Liberal but I think this could shake things up … From Ed Burnett, in Cleveland: Good luck getting re-elected with Gillard in charge! From Stacey Fels, in Thornlands: i agree with gabby, we need rudd back, and as for MR SWAN we wont start on that. From Lauren Doyle in Capalaba: Gillard is a smart woman, Let her have a chance to show Australia what she can do From Julia Filkorn: Rudd was bad, Gillards worse, just because she is a woman doesn’t mean she is any better, can’t wait for the next election … We have Rebecca Budge from Alexandra Hills: Love Kevin rudd, he was doing a wounderful job From Hannah Riall: having a female pm should have been a momentous event but gillard wasnt elected, should have stuck with kevin rudd From Peter Marer: Who inspires our kids today? Union factions are not a great example of what kids need to aspire to Matt Aubrey: … many professionals are worried about the amount of muscle that has been shown by the AWU. Many support the decision to oust the duddster however are scared and shocked that the unions had so much power over the situation … just a thought to chew on. There you see a very clear message from my local people. Many are concerned that we are returning to a period of ‘bash of the boss’, a Robin Hood period where anything that is good for Labor is automatically fairer. Ordinary people in my electorate have not been well served in the last two years. They are tired of those promises and they know you could not slide a piece of paper between Prime Minister elect Gillard and Kevin Rudd. She is behind all of MAIN COMMITTEE those same mistakes. For her to foist them on the previous Prime Minister is disappointing to the electors in my area. To see her again mouth the mantra of toughness on borders without a clue as to how to deliver it shows that she is just another potential Labor leader who walks down one side of the street trying to keep her Labor members happy and then down the other side trying to talk tough to the general population. What she is doing is leaving Education behind, in a mess, to take up the reins of the country. I suspect that the people of Redlands will not forget that. Whether you send your kids to child care but you have had your indexation frozen, or you have had the rebates capped or cut and the prices for child care go up, you will not forget the previous responsibilities of Prime Minister elect Gillard. If you are going to school and you have not seen laptop computers or you have them but they are not insured or there is no broadband on which to run them, you know to blame Prime Minister elect Julia Gillard. And, if you are waiting for a trades training centre but there is not even a lathe in your school, then you know you need to blame this Prime Minister elect, Julia Gillard. Learn. Earn. Legend! Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (12.47 pm)-I rise today to talk about a very important program-under the education portfolio, interestingly enough and auspiced by Minister Arbib. I would say to the member for Bowman that I think the speech delivered by the former Deputy Prime Minister and now Prime Minister elect will go down in the history books, but I doubt his will be noticed today. On Monday and Tuesday this week I took part in the government’s inaugural Learn. Earn. Legend! work experience in government program, where members and senators hosted 100 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander secondary students in their offices in Canberra. Dzella Sullivan from Atherton came to my Parliament House office for two days work experience. During his time in my office, he wrote a speech which I indicated to him I would read into the Hansard record for this place, and so I will. These are his words: I’m Dzella Sullivan from Atherton, a town about 45 minutes drive from Cairns, and I’m in grade 11 in Atherton state high school. I was born in Atherton and I’m both Aboriginal and Islander. I have both a younger sister and a younger brother. I’ve been in Atherton for about 12 years my mum took me away from Atherton not long after I was born, we had came back in 1998 when I was 4 to live with my nanna and grandad and eventually got our own place to live and stayed there since then. Atherton is pretty good place for me, it’s a nice tropical area it has hot days and cold days. We do get a lot of rain during summer but it is usually pretty warm. It’s not like Canberra, I find Canberra is just too cold. When I first came to CanberraI didn’t believe how different it was to Atherton, mainly it was the cold but also how dry Canberra place is. Like most people I don’t really like school, but I still go because I want to do something in life. I have an interest in art and hospitality even though I’m probably not the best at them. I would really like to get a good job somewhere in hospitality. When I do leave school I would probably move to cairns to try and get a chef apprenticeship somewhere there and hopefully it will go on from there. I to study hospitality and art in school. I started to study it in grade 8 I do pretty well in hospitality and I’m about average in art. I do well in school, well better than my friends. I’ve probably done more school work then them ever so far in school. They would usually talk about whatever came in to there mind, not listen to the teacher and then get in trouble and then wonder why they got in trouble in the first place. I had about 4 good friends in primary school and my best friend left in grade 6, but I eventually made lots of new friends MAIN COMMITTEE when I got to high school. The school that I go to does give a good variety of different classes and sometimes good opportunities to help students become what they want to be in the future, but I usually see that most students there don’t take school seriously. About a month I was asked if I wanted to come to Canberra to do some work experience, at first I was unsure if I did want to go. Over time my family had convinced me to go, mainly because it was a once in a life experience. Now that I’m here I’ve thought to myself that I had made the right decision. I had to wake up at 2:00 in the morning to catch a flight in Cairns to go to Brisbane, then straight to Canberra, it took about 5 hours to get here from Cairns. When I got to Canberra we were taken to the Rex Hotel. I explored it for a while, not much to do but it was a pretty nice place to stay. My roommate didn’t arrive until about 11:00 at night, I don’t mind him. I made friends pretty fast, mainly with the people in my little group. The thing I found weird is the food we were eating at lunch, that they like eating ham with jam. I got a sandwich that had lettuces, zucchini, ham, and cranberry jam. On the first day we got a trip down to the history museum which is a great place, a bit different to other museums I’ve gone to. … … … The next day we had breakfast and went to the Parliament House. We got a few speeches and went to have lunch and were picked up by our parliamentarians for the work experience. It did feel weird when I was picked up because I didn’t know what it would be like. I found it wasn’t that bad, I found that I enjoyed it. The rest of the day was kinda boring, we did end up having a BBQ that night which made it better … On TuesdayI got to get a tour of Parliament House with a few more people, one of them was my roommate we got to go see places were most people would never see. I got another tour after that with the rest of the students, but it wasn’t really as good as the first one I got. I had another weird sandwich it had avocado, chicken and lettuces. On Tuesday morning Dzella, Kiah Bobongie from Kerry Rea’s office, Keeden Collins from Joel Fitzgibbon’s office and Britannie Miles from Chris Hayes’s office had the opportunity to visit and tour the office of the Minister for Ageing, the Hon. Justine Elliot MP, with her Chief of Staff Paul Scully, led by my very good staffer Alison Byrnes. The group met with all of Justine’s staff and found out about their roles and duties. They also went down to the basement, toured the press gallery and went on to the roof of Parliament House. Debra Biggs also gave Dzella a private tour of the Speaker’s office, where he got to see the parliamentary mace. The group ran into the lovely Barb Pini, from the Treasurer’s office, who took them into his office. Do not tell the Treasurer, but I understand that they all got to sit in his chair! Kiah, who attends St Saviour’s College in Toowoomba, said that she found it a tremendous experience as well. I want to thank all of those people around this place, including my own staff, who went out of their way to give these wonderful young people a tremendous experience on the day. (Time expired) Canning Electorate: Sewerage Systems faced by the residents of Golf View Estate in Serpentine, in my electorate, that has homeowners at their wits’ end. In accordance with the recommendations by the Shire of SerpentineJarrahdale and the Department of Health, in 2006 Adam and Natalie Moss purchased an Ecomax 375 septic system for their new home at 108 Downs Court. Its installation on April 2006 marked the beginning of a distressing, costly and uphill battle for the Moss family that conMAIN COMMITTEE",215,Adjournment
173,Mr Randall (Canning) (12.52 Pm),"TodayI want to raise an outrageous situationtinues today. For a raft of reasons, predominantly a lack of drainage, the Ecomax system has consistently failed. The Moss’ backyard at times is swimming in sewage, ridden with algae, pungent with the stench of raw sewage and posing grave health risks to the family. If you think this is a burden, just add in that the shire is imposing huge fines for beaches of the Health Act. What was meant to be an idyllic country lifestyle for the Moss family has turned out to be an absolute nightmare. Natalie sought my intervention when the Shire of SerpentineJarrahdale issued her with a health notice. Subsequently, the shire sought to impose an alternative septic system on the property and send Natalie the bill. Natalie hit a dead end with the Wallis Group, the providers of the Ecomax system, and was running out of options. The Moss family have spent a sizable sum, which they can ill afford, repairing the system, sealing the tank, purchasing sand and all the while facing $250 daily fines from the shire. Following my representations, the Wallis Group have shown a willingness-I am pleased to say-to work through the issues with Natalie, agreeing to honour the terms of the warranty on the septic system and to relocate and replace the system. The replacement was to be in accordance with the advice for an independent engineer’s report that I organised to make sure that the tank could cope with the high watertable and limited drainage. A sand pad of 1.8 metres was recommended to support the cells and pads and to put as much space between the groundwater and the sewage as possible. This required a delivery of 20 truck loads of sand at very short notice, for which I wholeheartedly thank the company, WA Limestone. However, this week’s scheduled replacement has not gone according to plan. Yesterday, Simon Wallis informed me that it would be impossible for the contractors to complete the job in the immediate future because, in his words: The lack of drainage from the site means that machinery is unable to move on the site, let alone excavate. Continuing to try to complete this process without having adequate drainage will destroy Natalie’s yard and I believe prove unsuccessful. Despite questions about the appropriateness of the equipment brought on site to complete the job, trying to build the sand pad proved impossible. A huge amount of sand was needed to simply build a running mat for the bobcat, and the bobcat got repeatedly bogged. This was not solely the result of huge downpours in Perth but because the water is so close to the surface that if there is any pressure on the ground it just subsides into sludge. Where does this leave Natalie and Adam? Wallis Group said they had every intention of ‘completing this installation once the drainage issues have been addressed and the site is able to support movement of machinery and general excavation’. But obviously this requires some serious action by the shire to address the drainage issues in the subdivision. Mr and Mrs Moss’s experience is not isolated. Homes throughout the subdivision have reported failing Ecomax systems. Another constituent contacted my office for assistance as recently as yesterday. The reality is that the septic systems are struggling to cope with the water table of the Golf View Estate. Obvious tension between the Serpentine Jarrahdale Shire and the Wallis Group is unhelpful and counterproductive to a resolution. As Ecomax is a septic system recommended by the Department of Health, Wallis Group and the shire are required to have dealings, but my constituents are caught in the middle of a Mexican stand-off and an old-fashioned blame game over the effectiveness of the system and the shire’s drainage liability. MAIN COMMITTEE Having been on site, I have seen the demarcation line first hand. The drainage channel on the golf course runs along the Moss’s southern fence line. Overflow has nowhere to go except onto the Moss’s property. The high-level water means the sewage has no room to evaporate; it mixes with the groundwater and rises to the surface. The Moss’s backyard is constantly damp, the ground is soft and the Mosses have trouble growing plants because the roots get too damp. If the core problem is the adequacy of the drainage infrastructure throughout the estate, the shire must take its share of the responsibility. Its reluctance to do so is not surprising. The question is whether the original drainage plans, or lack thereof, should have been approved by the shire in the first place. Were they properly considered in light of the rising groundwater? Were they independently assessed considering the shire was profiting from the sales after taking over this development themselves? These are legitimate questions. The independent report that I mentioned earlier reinforces the problem. It says: … During periods of prolonged rainfall the area may be inundated for up to several days … The problem is exacerbated by additional flow of the drainage from the adjacent Golf Course to the south into the property. There exists a drain along the common boundary of Lot 108 and the Golf Course which if deepened and upgraded would do a great deal to resolve the poor drainage situation. It is within the power of the local authorities to do this as the land is under their control and at least part of the problem appears to be caused by flows of water from that land. (Time expired) Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 12.58 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Whaling (Question No. 1119) Mr Hunt asked the Minister for the Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, in writing, on 23 November 2009: What sum of money has the Government spent on whale research papers, what are the titles and dates of the papers, and what sum of money was spent on producing these papers. The Australian Government primarily funds whale research through the Australian Marine Mammal Centre (AMMC), based at the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD). These funds are primarily administered through a research grants program. Under this program, proposals are sought that deliver the highest quality science outcomes to address the most pressing marine mammal management needs. To accommodate Australia’s national and international obligations, and to reflect the large-scale movements of many marine mammal species, the funding priorities of this program focus on the whales, dolphins, seals, sea lions and dugongs of the Australasian region, including the waters of the Indian, Southern and South Pacific Oceans. The priorities of the program have been developed to incorporate scientific and management priorities identified from or through: Australia’s obligations under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999; national recovery plans for listed threatened species; Australian science in Antarctica; relevant international treaties; broad-scale consultation with the marine-user stakeholders and the scientific community; and the national Strandings Sampling Protocol. The AMMC Grants Program is open to both public and private bodies and individuals. The Program is open to state government departments. Commonwealth bodies are eligible to apply for funding, however, under the 2009 Commonwealth Grant Guidelines, only Commonwealth bodies under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (CAC) Act 1997 are eligible to receive grant funds. Applications are assessed for their scientific merit by the National Marine Mammal Scientific Committee (NMMSC) and for their relevance, utility and priority for management and conservation needs by the National Marine Mammal Advisory Committee (NMMAC). All recipients of funding under this program are required to sign a Funding Agreement with the Australian Government through the AAD that outlines Commonwealth oversight of the research projects. This agreement covers rights and responsibilities including the project budget, financial and performance reporting and acquittal, intellectual property, assets and data requirements. Between the 2008-09 AMMC funding rounds, the Australian Government has provided $2,715,765.62 in marine mammal research grant funding. These include projects conducting research on whales, dolphins, seals, sea lions, dugongs, or combinations of these species. Approximately 57 per cent of these funds ($1,547,986.30) have been spent on projects conducting cetacean research. A list of all projects funded is below.

This list may not contain all papers published on cetacean research arising from AMMC grant funding. Some grants that have already resulted in publications may yet produce more publications; some grants will never produce papers because the research did not proceed as hoped.

(2) Were other ships under Japanese command conveying Australian prisoners of war sunk between 1941 to 1945; if so, do lists of prisoners on board these ships exist; if so, from where are they available? (1) There is no absolutely confirmed roll. As soon as possible following the cessation of hostilities the Australian Army deployed personnel from the PW Contact and Enquiry Unit to Tokyo to seek information about Australian prisoners of war. The Japanese Navy provided a roll of those embarked",221,Questions In Writing
175,Mr Griffin,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:on the Montevideo Maru which was translated and a list sent to Australia, covered by a letter signed by Major H.S. Williams on 3 October 1945. Further work was required to compare the names which had been written by sound in Japanese then transliterated back into English with lists of people known to have been in Rabaul when it fell. This process produced the most complete roll possible of those thought to have been embarked on the Montevideo Maru. There have been challenges to the accuracy of this roll with suggestions that some people shown on the roll were killed in Rabaul and did not embark. These challenges are based on survivors of captivity in Rabaul who were interviewed after the war. Obviously, these witnesses were not on the Montevideo Maru. Copies of the original list sent by Major Williams in 1945 are held by Defence and National Archives. The other records, many developed from the roll sent by Williams can be found in National Archives (NAA) and the Australian War Memorial (AWM). (2) Other Japanese ships transporting Australian POW were sunk between 1942 and 1945. Defence is not aware of any Australian POW being transported on Japanese ships in 1941. The exact number may never be known. Numbers of prisoners died on Japanese ships of disease, malnutrition and bad treatment on ships that were not sunk. On one trip by Maros Maru from Ambon to Surabaya only 325 of 650 British and Dutch POW survived the voyage, despite the ship arriving at its destination. The Japanese did not mark ships carrying POW and on occasion transported Japanese soldiers additional to the POW escort, and/or military stores, which made the ship a legitimate military target. On at least one occasion Japanese civilians were transported on the same ship as POW. Hatches were battened down during storms, to protect the cargo, and sometimes during submarine attack. This inevitably resulted in poor ventilation for overcrowded prisoners as well as trapping them if the ship sank. It is known that the Junyo Maru was sunk by HMS Tradewind off Moako Moakao on 16 September 1944 while carrying 1,377 Dutch, 64 British, Australians and United States and 4,200 Javanese slave labourers. Of the 6,520 prisoners 5,620 were lost, including three Australians. The names of the three Australians are known. Most of the survivors of Junyo Maru picked up by the Japanese died slaving on the Sumatra railway line. The two most costly losses are described below: The most serious Australian loss after the Montevideo Maru was the Rokyu (or Rakuyo) Maru. No Japanese roll has ever been found so it is not known who exactly was on board. The Australian Official History gives 649 Australians and 599 British, the History of the Directorate of Prisoners of War and Internees (DPOWI) suggests 718 Australians and 599 British. The Australians included Army personnel from Blackforce in Java and survivors of HMAS Perth. On 12 September 1944 it was sunk by US Sealion off Hainan. All or most of the POW seem to have got off the ship. Subsequently US submarines found and picked up some survivors (80 Australians according to the OH, 92 Australians according to the DPOWI). These men provided the first evidence of conditions in Japanese POW camps and POW ships. They provided information on other POW on the ship as well as news of some men still in, or who had died in, other camps in Thailand, the Netherlands East Indies, Malaya and Singapore. Following requests from the Allies, the Japanese provided lists of survivors picked up by Japanese ships, given in the Australian Official History as 80 Australians and 56 British. This suggests that between 489 and 558 Australians died, depending on how many were on board. There is evidence that some allied survivors were shot in the water by the Japanese. The Japanese ship Tamahoko Maru was sunk by US Tang off Nagasaki on the night of 18 June 1944 while carrying 772 Australian, British and United States POW of whom 560 were lost. Of the 267 Australians on board only 72 survived. The survivors were picked up by a Japanese whale chaser and transferred to a POW camp ashore. Records are held by the AWM and NAA. Hawker Britton (Question Nos 1238, 1257, 1261 and 1263) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 24 February 2010: (1) Have you and/or your departmental officials met with representatives of Hawker Britton this Parliament; if so, (a) on what dates and at what addresses, and (b) who attended each meeting. (2) Has Hawker Britton arranged meetings with other organisations and you and/or your departmental officials this Parliament; if so, (a) on what dates and at what addresses, and (b) who attended each meeting. Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Responding to this question would require Departmental officials to review calendar and diary entries since December 2007 to identify information about meetings with, or arranged by Hawker Britton. This would require the manual examination of a large number of diary and meeting records, which is an unreasonable diversion of government resources. Hawker Britton (Question No. 1247) Mr Briggs asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, in writing, on 24 February 2010: (1) Have you and/or your departmental officials met with representatives of Hawker Britton this Parliament; if so, (a) on what dates and at what addresses, and (b) who attended each meeting. (2) Has Hawker Britton arranged meetings with other organisations and you and/or your departmental officials this Parliament; if so, (a) on what dates and at what addresses, and (b) who attended each meeting. (1) As at 24 February 2010, the Special Minister of State, Senator the Hon Joseph Ludwig, had not met with representatives of Hawker Britton. Senator Ludwig attended a session at the ALP National Conference on 30 July 2009 at the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre, Darling Harbour, NSW, 2000. The conference session was cochaired by Mr Bruce Hawker from Hawker Britton. (2) Hawker Britton has arranged no meetings between Senator Ludwig and other organisations during the term of the current Parliament.

Australian Taxation Office: e-Record (Question No. 1273) Mr Oakeshott asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 25 February 2010 Is the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) discontinuing the free program for small businesses known as e-Record; if so, (a) why, (b) how many e-record users will it affect, and (c) what will the ATO do to assist them with alternative tax reporting methods?",226,Questions In Writing
176,Mr Tanner,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The ATO is discontinuing e-Record from 1 July 2010. (a) Since March 2000, e-Record has been available to small businesses from the ATO for free. eRecord was designed as a product to help small businesses move from paper-based record keeping to commercial electronic record-keeping systems. The decision to discontinue e-Record followed a review recently undertaken by the ATO. The review found: e-Record would have required redevelopment to keep up with changes in technology, including new operating systems and software e-Record was not able to interact with the electronic services being developed as part of the Standard Business Reporting initiative, and a lack of compatibility between e-Record and current commercial record-keeping systems. (b) The number of e-record registered users fluctuates with 48,700 users currently registered (registration is voluntary). (c) Small business taxpayers can meet their tax reporting obligations through a number of channels including the business portal and paper. There is also a range of free online tools available on the ATO website to support business such as self-help calculators and information products. Taxpayers will still be able to download the final version, e-Record v6.2, from the ATO website until 30 June 2010. User support will continue to be available until 30 September 2010. This will allow users to complete their reporting obligations for the 2009-10 financial year and allow time to transition to alternative record keeping systems. A comprehensive communication process has advised users of e-Record of the decision to withdraw the product and the support arrangements in place. In developing the communication plan, consultation was undertaken with a number of existing e-Record users to ensure that issues were identified and concerns addressed. As part of the ATO’s communication plan the ATO has recommended that taxpayers consider purchasing alternative commercial software by 30 June 2010. Information regarding available software has been made available on the ATO website. Superclinics (Question No. 1281) Mr Dutton asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 25 February 2010: (1) What incentives are available for General Practitioners to relocate to GP Super Clinics. (2) As at 25 February 2010, how many: (a) General Practitioners had claimed incentives to relocate to GP Super Clinics; (b) overseas trained doctors were working at GP Super Clinics that were not in a recognised District of Workforce Shortage; and (c) doctors working in GP Super Clinics not in Districts of Workforce Shortage had been granted an exemption to the Health Insurance Act 1973, section 19AB. (3) What were the reason(s) for the exemptions in part (2)(c), and how many other doctors during the same period and in the same Australian Standard Geographic Classification area had been granted an exemption to the Health Insurance Act 1973 section 19AB for the same reason(s).",228,Questions In Writing
177,Mr Swan,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The GP Super Clinics Program provides for relocation incentive payments under certain circumstances for specified health professionals relocating during the first 12 months of the GP Super Clinic’s operation. The GP Super Clinics National Program Guide 2008 provides details of the amounts available. Applicants seeking funding to establish a GP Super Clinic were required to identify within their proposals if they intended to use part of the available funding to offer relocation incentives. Where a funding recipient chooses to use part of their grant funding for relocation incentives, they are responsible for offering the incentives and making the payments to the health professional. Depending on where General Practitioners are moving from to take up employment in a GP Super Clinic, they may be eligible for a financial incentive under the Outer Metropolitan Relocation Incentive Grant (OMRIG) program. Moving to a GP Super Clinic does not influence eligibility for the OMRIG program. (2) (a) As at 25 February 2010, no funding recipient has used GP Super Clinics program funding for relocation incentives. (b) Three. (c) Three. (3) A Preliminary Assessment of District of Workforce Shortage (PADWS) approval can be granted to medical practices that are not located in district of work force shortage (DWS) areas to address special circumstances. In the instance of the three exemptions identified above, a PADWS approval was granted as the clinic involved has a high percentage of patients of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders, a substantial proportion of patients from lower socio-economic groups, and which draws patients from surrounding locations that have a DWS classification. A practice that is funded by the Australian Government as a GP Super Clinic is not considered to be a special circumstance in lieu of DWS. As the transition to the Australian Standard Geographical Classification System– Remoteness Areas will not occur until 1 July 2010, data related to the number of exemptions that have been granted according to remoteness area classification is not available. Broadband (Question No. 1302) Ms Marino asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 11 March 2010: By what date will the National Broadband Network be rolled out in the electoral division of Forrest, and what are the names of the towns that will be excluded. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: The Government’s commitment in establishing the National Broadband Network is to provide all Australians with affordable high speed broadband, no matter where they live. No towns will be excluded. The Government’s objective is to connect at least 90 per cent of premises with fibre to the premises technology providing speeds up to 100 megabits per second, with the remaining premises being connected via next generation wireless and satellite technologies delivering 12 megabits per second or more.",229,Questions In Writing
178,Mr Albanese,"The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital EconomyDetailed modeling undertaken as part of the NBN Implementation Study shows fibre can be extended to 93 per cent of all premises and recommends it also cover the 1.3 million new premises expected to be build by 2017-18, within the total capital cost estimate of $43 billion. This would extend the fibre coverage to an additional 1.6 million premises. The Implementation Study also shows that next generation wireless services will be a vast improvement on current services. They will deliver peak speeds of at least 12 Mbps, and much higher for many wireless users. Satellite services will deliver average data rates which are more than 20 times higher than most users of these technologies experience today and much higher than average DSL usage today. The Government is currently considering the Study and its recommendations. It is not yet possible to provide details of when the electorate of Forrest will be connected to the National Broadband Network, or which technology will provide such access. Detailed rollout plans are the responsibility of NBN Co as part of its network design and roll out and announcements will be made in due course. The rollout in Tasmania, the rollout of the first release sites on the mainland and the construction of optical fibre backbone links are already underway and will feed into the schedule. Given the scale and complexity of a project like this, the rollout will be meticulous and comprehensive. It is crucial that we get it right and that’s why learning from the rollout in Tasmania, and with the First Release sites, will be so important. Asylum Seekers (Question No. 1310) Mr Morrison asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 17 March 2010: (1) In respect of the statement made by the Prime Minister on 25 February 2010 during a radio interview on 2GB with Ray Hadley, that 141 detainees have been removed from Christmas Island: (a) what countries were they sent to; (b) how many were (i) failed asylum seekers, and (ii) crew members of unauthorised entry vessels; and (c) how many people in part (b)(ii) were charged with people smuggling offences. (2) In respect of the statement made by the Prime Minister during the same interview that in October 2009, 62 Indonesian detainees had involuntarily returned, 21 detainees had voluntarily returned, and six were being finalised for return, to their home country: how many of these were (a) foreign fishers, and (b) crew members of unauthorised entry vessels. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: Between October 2008 and 25 February 2010, 141 Irregular Maritime Arrival (IMA) passengers were removed from Australia to the following countries: (1) (a) Sri Lanka 74 Indonesia 62 Iran2 PNG 2 India1 (b) (i) Of the 141 individuals removed, 65 were failed asylum seekers. (ii) None of the 141 individuals were crew members on unauthorised entry vessels. (c) Not applicable. (2) In the interview of 25 February with Mr Ray Hadley, there is no record of the Prime Minister referring to the removal of Indonesians or to removals during the month of October 2009.",230,Questions In Writing
179,Mr Mcclelland,"The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has provided the followAir Safety (Question No. 1327) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in writing, on 11 May 2010: In respect of the fatal crash of an Embraer 120 Brasilia twin engine turboprop aircraft in Darwin on 22 March 2010 during a dangerous manoeuvre requiring an enforced engine failure: (a) what has necessitated the need for an annual mandatory test of this manoeuvre; (b) could flight simulator facilities be used to practise and test such dangerous manoeuvres; and (c) is it a fact that when a designated flight simulator operator is on annual leave the facility has to be closed because of insufficient staffing. (a) The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has advised that civil aviation safety regulations require a number of actions from operators in order to ensure flight crew retain and periodically demonstrate ongoing competency and proficiency. In particular, Civil Aviation Orders require the holder of an air transport pilot licence shall not act as pilot in command of an aeroplane in regular public transport operations unless he or she has satisfactorily completed, in that type of aeroplane within the preceding 15 months, a flight proficiency test including proficiency in emergency manoeuvres including a simulated failure of one engine. This emergency manoeuvre is one of the most critical competencies needed to ensure the safety of aeroplane operations. (b) Yes. (c) Civil Aviation Regulation 217 requires operators of regular public transport services, operators of any aircraft which exceeds 5,700 kilograms in maximum take-off weight and any other operators specified by CASA, to provide a training and checking organisation so as to ensure that operator’s crews maintain and periodically demonstrate competency. The staffing of flight simulator equipment is a matter for individual operators to manage. Afghanistan Medal (Question No. 1328) Mr Robert asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 11 May 2010: Has the Government updated the Conditions of Service for Operation SLIPPER, to enable servicemen and women involved in the maritime operation to receive the ‘Afghan Campaign Medal’, also known as the ‘Afghanistan Medal’; if not, when will they be reviewed. able member’s question: Yes. The Instrument of declaration and determination for the Afghanistan Medal has been updated, to reflect a change in the geographical boundaries of Operation SLIPPER, and was signed by the Governor General on 26 March 2010. This was published in the Special Gazette No. S 46 published 7 April 2010. The updated determination provides for all personnel assigned to Operation SLIPPER, including those involved in maritime operations, to qualify for the Afghanistan Medal providing they meet the qualifying criteria.",231,Questions In Writing

181,Mr Combet,"The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourHealth: Interpreter Services (Question No. 1331) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 12 May 2010: (1) Can she indicate what interpreter services are available in the public and private health sectors, and which of these services are funded by the Government. (2) Are specialists and general practitioners provided with the same access to, and Government support for, the use of interpreter services; if not, why not. Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) A range of interpreter services is available in the public and private health sectors depending on local need but it is not feasible to identify and list all available interpreter services. A key service funded by the Government is Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS) National, provided through the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Free interpreting services are provided to non-English speaking Australian citizens or permanent residents communicating with private medical practitioners providing Medicare-rebateable services and their reception staff to arrange appointments and provide results of medical tests; and non-profit, non-government, communitybased organisations for case work and emergency services where the organisation does not receive funding to provide these services. (2) Yes. Family Relationships Services Program (Question No. 1333) Mr Andrews asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 24 May 2010: In respect of a recent media report ‘Cuts to send family battles back to court’ by Patricia Karvelas (The Australian, 13 May 2010, pages 1, 6): (a) why has the Government reduced funding by $43.9 million to Family Relationship Centres under the Family Relationship Services Program, and (b) has he considered the impact of this decision on (i) separating families, and (ii) the Family Court. (a) The Government provides over $200 million per annum to the Family Relationships Services Program to support families. The Government has identified savings within the program of $48.4 million over four years. The majority of the savings have been found by reducing activities to be undertaken by or on behalf of my Department. The savings offset which will directly affect Family Relationship Centres is the introduction of fees for the second and third hour of dispute resolution at Family Relationship Centres-a saving of $3 million per year. These changes will not come into effect until 1 July 2011. Importantly Family Relationship Centres will be able to recoup these savings through the introduction of new fees of $30 per hour for the second and third hour of family dispute resolution when a client earns over $50,000 per year. The first hour will continue to be free for all clients. Those earning under $50,000 per annum or who fall under one of the waivers will continue to receive up to 3 hours of free FDR. (b) Yes. Importantly while the Government has reallocated funding from the Family Relationship Services Program, the Government is actually reinvesting $154 million for legal assistance services across Australia, a significant proportion of which will be used to specifically to help families resolve disputes through targeted legal assistance. These changes now mean more funds are being provided to frontline services to help the most vulnerable Australian families. For example, additional funding will mean more families utilising Family Relationship Centres will be able to access legal information and advice.",232,Questions In Writing
182,Mr Mcclelland,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The Attorney-General’s Department will work with the Family Relationship Services sector on details of implementation of these changes to minimise the impact on the delivery of services, including an analysis of the ability of individual Family Relationship Centres to recoup fees. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Regional Air Services (Question No. 1336) Mrs Hull asked the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in writing, on 25 May 2010: (1) Is the Government aware of the intent of Sydney Airport Corporation Limited to impose punitive aircraft parking charges from 1 July 2010 on regional airlines, freight, charter and general aviation operators using the general aviation parking area. (2) Is the Government aware that the expiry of the current regulatory safety-net means that the proposed price increases, which would severely impact the viability of regional air services at Sydney Airport, will no longer be subject to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) assessment, nor to a Consumer Price Index (CPI) cap. (3) Is the Government planning to extend Declaration 91 and Direction No. 30 under Division4 of Part VIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974, due to expire on 1 July 2010, requiring proposed price increases in relation to regional air services to be assessed by the ACCC. (4) Does the Government stand by its commitment: ‘the Government will also ensure regional airlines’ continued access to capital city airports, particularly Sydney where capacity is constrained, by retaining regional airlines’ existing access slots and their current pricing arrangements.’ (Australian Government, Flight Path to the Future, National Aviation Policy, White Paper, December 2009, page 8). (5) Does the Government stand by statements in the paper referred to in part (3) that commit to maintaining ring-fencing of regional slots, including during peak periods, at levels available in the year 2000 prior to privatisation, and continuing with the current regulatory regime, that caps pricing for regional airline aeronautical charges at Sydney Airport to CPI levels. The Government has extended the price capping arrangements for regional air services from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2013. Declaration No.92 and Direction No.32 extending the price capping arrangements for aeronautical services and facilities provided to regional air services were signed by the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, the Hon Dr Craig Emerson MP, on 28 May 2010.

Fusion Energy Research (Question No. 1404) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister representing the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, in writing, on 16 June 2010: Why has there been a delay in Australia becoming a participant in ITER’s magnetic confinement fusion project, and what is the status of the Minister’s negotiation with ITER on this matter. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: Membership of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project requires a significant financial investment to which Australia is currently unable to commit. As a result, Australia is not pursuing membership of ITER at this time. However, Australian participation in the ITER project is progressing on a project by project basis through Australian researchers and institutions. Of particular relevance is the collaboration between ITER and the Australian Plasma Fusion Research Facility at the Australian National University which was established through a Government funded Major National Research Facilities Program grant of $8.7 million. This facility is currently being upgraded through a $7 million grant provided under the Government’s Super Science Initiative. Funding for this upgrade was provided, in part, to ensure that information and resources from the facility continue to contribute to the ITER project.",235,Questions In Writing
