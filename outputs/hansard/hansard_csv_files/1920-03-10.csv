That expresses the Treasury view, which, of course, takes into account only cash inwards and outwards, as .a 'banker does.

It is perfectly plain that the outgoings from both loan and revenue tills will exceed the amount which' was estimated in the earlier part of the financial year as necessary for repatriation purposes. If this were ordinary .Departmental expenditure, I should feel disposed, and I think the Committee would probably be desirous of insisting, that f u l l particulars of the excess be given; but I take leave to make no apology for this expenditure. So far as I , as Treasurer, am able to judge, it is being wisely administered'. that the expenditure is not sufficiently generous, but the fact that we are likely to exceed the expenditure from both sources that we previously thought necessary is clear proof that the repatriation machinery is working swiftly and is dealing with a large number of cases. one who believes that our repatriation system is at least as generous as any devised amongst the belligerent nations, I regard this expenditure as a matter for congratulation. liament has raised through taxation or can raise from the pockets of the people by loan should be, if wisely expended, cheerfully expended to repatriate and restore to civil life the men who fought on land' and sea; and I say quite plainly that the expenditure from both revenue and loan sources will have to be exceeded at the end of the financial year. both homes on broad acres and war service homes? both provided for out of the loan moneys bonded debt, repayable to the British Goauthorized by Parliament to be expended vernment at various dates, ranging from by the Government.

I remind honourable members that we raised that £25,000,000 with considerable difficulty, in respect, particularly, to the last £5,000,000. Even after an extension of dates, after as vigorous a campaign as the Government could devise or its organization carry out, and after definite statements by the head of the Government and the Finance Minister, that unless the amount was raised compulsion by Statute would follow, we were still about £3,000,000 short after the, extension of time had' closed; whereupon the associated trading banks of Australia, including the Commonwealth Bank, undertook to take The complaint, if any, is their share, and thus we were able to find the £25,000,000.

Our shipbuilding requirements have hitherto, in. quite a natural way during the war, been included in Loan Bills under the general heading of War Expenditure, as they were, I understand, in Great Britain and in the United States of America when they undertook a big maritime programme, but in future the amounts required for this particular class of work will have to be shown separately in the schedule of a Loan Bill for the consideration of a Committee of the House. The Supply granted by the last Parliament has sufficed for all payments up to the 5th March last, and, while on some votes there are small balances, other votes are exhausted. The amcarn-ts in the present Supply BiU are sufficient to cover the needs of the Treasury to 31st May next. If this Supply is granted by the Committee, Parliament will then have authorized the expenditure for eleven out of the twelve mom'ths of the fianncial year terminatingon 30-th June next, leaving one month unprovided for, and for which 1 special provision will need to be asked later in the ordinary way. I should like to outline to the. Committee the chief reasons which have induced the Government to request the Supply for this period; and for this amount. Tlie first is that the Addressin-Reply to the Speech from the Throne has not yet been adopted, and we are unable to say how long the debate upon it is likely to occupy. Furthermore, there are two definite promises made by the Government in the enunciation of their programme for the consideration of tlie people, which must be redeemed. first promise was that the original, measure to be introduced for the consideratiora of this Parliament would be a War Gratuity Bill. promise if permitted to remain in office. ITr. Watt. promise I 'hope. perhaps in different ways, but still we will all honour it. The Bill is now ready, Honourable members and when honourable members see it they will conclude that it has been a difficult measure to frame, providing as it does for all cases and all classes of cases; and that it should appropriately receive very careful, even if leisurely, consideration at the hands of Parliament. The amount involved, as will be explained by the Prime Minister or Acting Treasurer when the measure is introduced, is a large sum, and for that reason and' another, namely that of doing decent justiceto the recipients of the gratuity, I am sure honourable members will desire to give extensive consideration to themeasure. The second promise which must be honoured with equal facility is that the next measure to be brought down for the consideration of the House would be the Tariff"", and although it is not conceivable that Parliament will, as soon as the Tariff proposals are laid on the table,, proceed to the consideration of them-it is likely to require some little time to review the scheduleswhile they are operating-ye t it would be idle to .place before honoraiblemembers a reconstructive measvire of that kind, and leave it for any considerable time without giving it attention. We cannot shut OUT eyes to two. orther facts transcending importance. The Easter holidays will oceur at the end of 1 1 this month and! the beginning of April. I have had no opportunity of con suiting the wishes of honorable members as to how long an adjournment those who come from the more distant States are likely to ask for or wish for. those long distances pretty suddenly. come back who should worry, the men for whom the resurrectionstill waits. The honourable member need not worry, his resurrection came, swiftly. This, is likely to be a long session. If all the important The measures in the Government's programme are tobeseriously tackled! by Parliament, I can well conceive the session stretching nearly to the end. of the year.

69,Mr Watt,"-It is those who did notparent to the Throne, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, and I say plainly that the spirit of welcome which I believe the people of Australia will extend to him will be shared by every honourable member irrespective of party, and that it is inevitable there will be a natural desire that Parliament should adjourn to enable sufficient honour to be shown to him. It would be most inconvenient if Parliament had to meet during that particular time to vote Supply and was unable to join in the festivities of welcome which every part of the Empire the Prinee has visited has so freely offered him.

Omitting war services, Treasurer's Advance, refunds of revenue and special appropriations, the sums included in the ordinary estimates total £10,930,981. amount for eleven months is £10,020,066. The amount in this Bill, together with Supply previously granted in this financial year by the late Parliament, is -£9,450,052, which is £570,014 less than the eleven months' proportion. Therefore, we are not asking the Conirnittee to overvote the proportion of eleventwelfths of the total Supply. In concluding, I desire to refer to one. other matter which I think it my duty to introduce voluntarily, because of the controversial history surrounding the whole question. I refer to the question of munition making, or a munition plant or arsenal for Australia. I hope honourable members will realize that Supply is not asked for in this financial year under this heading, but a commitment has been made which will extend itself into the finances of next year, and, therefore, a Committee of Supply, although not voting anything by this Bill-, should be in possession of all the facts. Arrangements have been made to take over from the British Government certain munition-making machinery at a price of £150,000. If this plant were purchased froin the makers of such machinery, it would cost £600,000-. British authorities estimate the disposal value at £300,000, which is half the cost value, and decided to offer it to Australia at half its disposal Talue, or one-quarter of the cost value. This offer, after careful consideration and advice from the best experts, was deemed to be too advantageous to miss, and the Government have accepted it, because it eould not be held open indefinitely when £ so many similar plants are being scrapped. .. 1,9S4,635 This plant will enable the 'Commonwealth, with the plant we already have, to manufacture munitions for field guns, and will .. .. 41,000 make it possible to furnish our Defence .. 450,000 Forces with the requisite equipment. The .. .. . . 5,727,180 necessary provision will be made on next year's Estimates. I ean readily .understand that there may be a difference of opinion, irrespective of party politics, on this transaction. The Government take ful l responsibility, because they consider it a prudent and necessary action. To those honourable -members who may consider it otherwise, I may say that no The proportion of this Government could occupy the Treasury bencfb. of the Commonwealth Parliament under present conditions and have no defence policy. I do not think it practicable for a Government to retain the confidence of this House, or of the electors, without such a policy. Whatever the policy may be, it is plain to every man, as the sun is at high noon, that we must have the plant jand material ito equip our field forces, without which they would be of no use in defending the country. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has intimated that at the proper time the defence policy of the Government, which is now being prepared by the Council of Defence and its expert officers, will be submitted to Parliament for consideration, and, I hope, decision. Whatever defence policy is evolved, we must have plant of this nature, and I trust the House, after due consideration, will approve the precautionary measure of obtaining these essential pre-requisites for the protection of our country.",30,General And Governors Condition S

I should take this early opportunity-the first real opportunity that I have had-to inform the Government, their supporters, and the members of the Opposition of the exact position of members occupying the cross benches, and who constitute the Australian Country party, which has done me the great honour of electing me as its Leader. that the Country party is an independent body quite separate fro m the Nationalists or the Labour party. I think it my duty to let honourable members of this House and the country generally know exactly the position in which we stand. occupy our own party rooms, we have appointed our own Leader and other officers.. We take no part in the deliberations! of Ministerialists or of the Opposition. of which we approve, and hold ourselves absolutely free to criticise or reject any proposals with which we do not agree. Having put our hands to the wheel, we set It w ill be many months the course ' of our voyage. There has been no collusion, we crave no alliance, 'we spurn no support; we have no desire to harass the Government, nor do we wish to humiliate the Opposition. We have not entered upon this course without giving the matter the most grave consideration. It is no. light matter for men who, for two decades, occupied seats on this side of the House, and who, prior to the last election, sat behind present Ministers, to have deliberately taken this course. We have recognised-as have other honourable members and a considerable number of electors-that drastic action was necessary to secure closer attention to the requirements of the primary producers of Australia than they have hitherto received. The primary producer is determined that he shall now take his proper place. We have no quarrel with the consumers in the cities. We regard them, in part, as our best customers. I desire to take this opportunity of stating that members of the Country party, as the direct representatives of the primary producers, have declared war against those Trusts and Combines whose prosperity has been gained alike at the expense of the farmer and of the consumer. We have entered deliberately upon a campaign against unnecessary intermediaries. We seek to bring the I think it is desirable that consumer and the producer into closer touch, so that the farmer may obtain a fair return for his products, and the consumer be able to purchase at f a i r and reasonable prices. Hitherto the man in the middle has waxed f a t at the expense of the two extremities. In pre-war days the people of the cities had cheap bread, cheap meat, cheap milk, and I may say at the outset cheap butter. But at whose expense ? Go into the dairying portions of Australia, ask the children of the dairy farmer, who are up at daylight in the morning to handle cows in the slush and cold of winter, in order that the We people of the cities may get mil k at 4d. and 5d. a quart.

We are out to secure a fair deal for the man on the land. know this will not please all my honourable friends, but this is the course we have set ourselves, and we shall steer straight ahead without hesitation, accepting any and every responsibility that may accrue from our actions as a party. Honourable members know that a declaration of war against Trusts and Combines is no new conversion on my part. p r years I have warned them of the operations of Combines that were gripping the people of Australia by the throat. have made no secret of the position as I saw it , but, unfortunately, I did not receive that support which I had a right to expect in regard to the shipping Rings that were crucifying my State. My firm conviction is that the only weapon that can pierce the armour of Trusts and Combines is co-operation, and I here pledge the Country party to fight them to the last ditch. There are other planks in our platform which I shall briefly outline. We stand for economy in public administration. For the last ten years the Commonwealth has indulged in a veritable carnival of financial largely j we have spent unwisely. We have issued paper money until we have almost submerged the Plimsoll mark of financial safety. our minds tliat the time has come to cry a halt, and put our house in order by a reduction in Departments which have become unwieldy and expensive to a degree that would be ludicrous were the matter not so serious. The overlapping of Federal and State administration must receive immediate consideration. above all, there must be a return to parliamentary control of the public purse. The war, thank God, is over, and the earlier this Parliament returns to the traditions of responsible government the better it will be for the country and the easier for the Ministry. All expenditure of any magnitude should be authorized by this House, and reasonable opportunity should be afforded for its proper consideration. Parliament must immediately resume the absolute control of the As a public purse. In trying to put before the Committee the opinions of members with whom I am associated, I have studiously avoided saying anything that could be fairly construed as a threat. I have deemed it I proper, in fairness* to the Government, to myself, to members of my party, and our constituents that I should take this early opportunity of defining the attitude and aspirations of the Country party. We ask no favours, and we shall submit to no indignities. We seek no quarrel with the. Government or with the Opposition. I trust that we shall f u l l y recognise our re0 sponsibilities, and so conduct ourselves in this House as to win the respect of all parties, and of the electors of Australia. I We shall do all that is possible to advance the interests o.f all classes of the community. I have deemed it advisable, so that there may be no misunderstanding of our attitude, to put our position clearly before the Committee. I ami satisfied that the course we have adopted in submitting the amendment is the correct one. Werei t dealt with on its merits, probably one-half of those honourable members, representing country districts, and now sitting behind Ministers, would be found following us into the lobby; but I have been informed that the amendment will be regarded as a vote of want folly. We have borrowed of confidence. In that case, the party whip will crack, and probably by scouring the highways and byways of this House, the Government will obAs a party, we have, made up tain a majority against my amendment.

J'li-. JAMES PAGE -My word,, the honourable member, is a statesman. say of tbe shipbuilding: fiasco ? I have on a former occasion, stated, in this House that, shortly after the war broke out, an offer was made by a responsible man and a first-class shipbuilder to construct of Tasmanian bluegum two fore and aft schooners of from 1,000 to 1,500. tons, to equip them with Deisel engines, and, under a heavy penalty,, to hand them over to the Government within a periodof. nine tlie cabins and other internal fittings, ot months for a total cost of £25' per ton. The life of those ships would be, bar accidents, at least fifty years.. That offer was made to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for the Navy. jected it. ber's vote last week approved of their action. been accepted,, those ships would have paid for themselves long ago. They would have relieved the whole of the congested traffic between Tasmania and the mainland, an.d they would have brought into the market thousands and thousands of tons of primary produce, some of which has since rotted irretrievably on the wharfs of that State, and some of which is still rotting on the farms there. But, having turned down the Australian ships, which could have done the work, two years later the Government entered into contracts for the construction of Yankee schooners, which were .to. be built of Oregon pine, and the life of which cannot 1 possibly exceed eight or ten years. It is a well-known fact that there are vessels built of Tasmanian bluegum running round our coast which are seventy or eighty years of age. I desire to know a little more about the contracts for the building of these Yankee schooners. We know too well their rotten condition. We know that the pumps had to be kept going incessantly on. their maiden voyages, that they had: to be docked and recaulked on their arrival here, and that at least one of them had to be partially replanked. .We should be informed who checked the specifications for these ships -thes e fraudulently built sea-sieves-for that is what they are. We should be told who superintended their construction, and who accepted delivery of them. Honourable members interjecting, peal to honourable members to allow the honourable member for Eranklin to proceed without interruptions. the report of the Auditor-General that the Yankee wooden schooners have cost 8,900,000 dollars,, notwithstanding that their original price was 5,300,000 dollars. I learn from good authority that the contracts were so faultily drawnthat even the most ordinary nature were charged, and paid for, as extras. This is a very serious charge. MT.

We have, therefore, at least .a right to expect that our > legal work will be performed with ordinary skill and care. Of the cancelled Australian ship-building contracts we shall probably hear more in the future. Buti n passing, I would like to have proof of some inquiry of the ability of the contracting parties, prior to the contracts having been entered into, to credibly informed that in one case' the contracting party had not even a ship-building yard. Other statements of an equally serious character have been made. It will be sufficient for me to say that for the cancellation of theseunfortunate contracts, the Government have to pay to the Wallace Power Boat Company Hughes, Limited about £ 7 0 , 0 0 0; and to Messrs.

Whati t w ill cost to get out of tlie contract for the construction of the balance of the Yankee ships is necessarily mere guesswork. will amount to £500,000-and the whole of these contracts were entered into without the authority of this Parliament. The Treasurer is always so interesting and so pleasant when he delivers a speech that one scarcely cares tocriticise him. But what is his proposal for getting out of that stupendous blunder, the present management of the Post Office? creation of another Board. The Government appointed the [Economies Commissioner to investigate the administration of some of our public Departments.

In the same five years there was a profit in Adelaide of £41,500, in Brisbane of £73,500, and in Hobart of £3,000. This country has been standing behind the wealthy cities of Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth to the extent of £640,000 odd in five years, while the wretched policy of this Department is that a few people out in the back blocks of any State in Australia have to put down their hard cash to guarantee that there will be no loss on a telephone line which they need to make their conI Chanter) -Order!

If we are to stand a loss of £150,000 to £200,000 a year on the telephone networks of our big cities, the Department which has been squandering money in this way can no longer have the effrontery to ask the men who go out into the back country all over Australia to guarantee, out of their poverty, a few pounds before they can be given one of the necessary adjuncts of civilization in the shape of a telephone. I am one of those who are confident that profiteering does exist in Australia. The one thing I know about law is that I know nothing about it ; but even to the layman it is quite clear that this Parliament has the plenary power of taxation, and recent investigations have disclosed that some of the great business firms of this city have deliberately evaded the express determination of this Parliament that they should pay at least their fair share of taxation.

95,Mr Mcwilliams,"If no eithercharged. This Committee should be informed, before a division, of the steps that the Government intend to take to give effect to the intention of Parliament in this matter. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan), an acknowledged constitutional authority, has declared that this Parliament has power to legislate in respect of the cost of Hying, and has offered to draft a Bill in exercise of , that power, which, he pledges his reputation, will stand the scrutiny of the High Court. .The Government would not injure its dignity by accepting that offer, and I , on my part, am prepared to make a further undertaking. The Prime Minister expressed the opinion at a conference of Federal and State authorities held two years ago, that any individual State can voluntarily surrender to the Commonwealth any of the powers reserved to it by the Constitution. The doubt was raised whether the differential provisions of the Constitution would permit of the transference of powers to the Commonwealth by one or more States, it being thought to be necessary for all the States to take common action on specific matters. But the Prime Minister at the Conference combated that idea. I can, I think, guarantee that if the necessary ' legislation be prepared, it will be agreed to in Tasmania at least, and I have before declared that if the Commonwealth, instead of presenting the pistol at the head of the State Governments by submitting referenda, had sought their individual co-operation, we would have saved a great deal of money, would have avoided several futile elections, and would have obtained much more satisfactory results. to surrender powers, and declined to do so. _, am correctly informed-ther e was the. implied stipulation that they must all agree in the matter. they all agreed, the Commonwealth could not act, because, under our Constitution, the laws of this Parliament must be ixniform. ence to which I have referred, the Prime Minister successfully argued in favour of the contrary opinion. We cannot now discuss the Estimates for this year, but there is an item there which I hope the Government will not ask us to pass, and the Committee, if necessary, will strike out. During the last financial year, £6,421 was voted for the Commonwealth police, and £3,666 of that amount was expended. It is now proposed to expend £7,102 on an ""Investigation Department,"" which is a new name for the Commonwealth police, and, if my information be correct, other new appointments are to follow. If the ambition of the Crown Law Department eventuates we shall find ourselves 'within two or three years saddled with another costly Department engaged in duplicating work which is now being satisfactorily performed by State Departments. This is a Cabinet usurpation of the rights of this Parliament, and I warn the Government not to enter into further commitments in regard tq_this embryo body, because Parliament will not agree to its perpetuation. I have no wish to pose as a pessimist, but it would be wrong to avert one's eyes .from the financial situation. The figures setting forth our national debt, which have been given by the Treasurer, are sufficient to make us pause. We have one cause for thankfulness in regard to the debt, and that is that we do not owe money to foreign countries. ' Great Britain herself has, during the war, for the first time for centuries, borrowed abroad, and she is straining every nerve to get rid of the obligations she has thus incurred, because her foreign indebtedness is proving injurious to her trade and commerce. Her position should be a warning to us. Whatever finanical obligations we enter into should be under the British flag. Stars and Stripes. not. Creditors occasionally act with great harshness towards their debtors. After four awful years of warfare, with its terrible expenditure and destruction, Australia has fallen upon troublous times.

In the House of Commons, a most jealous mistress of her privileges and rights, a condition of things was, perforce, adopted, not essentially differing from that which existed here. One other point having direct relation to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Franklin needs very special emphasis. vernment has done or failed to do in regard to affording Parliament an opport u n it y of discussing the Estimates was done in former Parliaments and not this. We must not forget that we live under a democratic form of government, and that the supreme authority is the people. We have been to the people, before whom the issues were quite clearly put. The honourable members sitting in the Government corner, and honourable members sitting The (.opposite, put their views, as we did, before the people. I neither censure nor attempt to explain, or even comment on those views, though I could say much in regard to them if I chose. But I say that the people, having the choice of one of the three parties, chose the party which I have the honour to lead. The results of the election speak for themselves. A great majority of the electors p supported the Government and its policy. It cannot be said! that the people were not informed as to the very many shortcomings of the present Government in former Parliaments. Whatever charge may be laid against honourable members opposite, it cannot be said that they did not tell the people how far the Government fell short of perfection; I am not going to and that can be said of some, if not all, of the members in the Government corner. But the people deliberately chose tlie party I have the honour to lead, and, this being a democratic community, the But1 Government comes here with the imprimatur of the people; and has an absolute right to an opportunity to carry out its policy. The honourable member riiade his charge against us in relation to a previous Parliament. I am not going to defend, or even comment upon what was done in previous Parliaments in this matter. All that is past. The people In every country it was found, by knew of it , and, knowing all the facts, they phose this party and this Government to govern the country. As to the future , and in so far as the honourable member's criticism is directed at the procedure to be followed in this Parliament, I range myself alongside him, and I say to h i m and to this Committee, as I said when speaking last week, that ample opportunity w ill be given to every honourable member to express his opinions and criticise every act of the Government, and the expenditure of every penny of money. Further, I promise that a f u l l opportunity w ill be given Whatever this Gothis House to discuss the Estimates before wo again ask for Supply. That opportunity has not been given to honourable members for the last five years, so far as I know, to say nothing of the preceding years. So far, then, as the honourable member's criticism relates to ParliaT ments tliat have gone, I say nothing. I simply take my stand on the fact that a majority of the people have returned us, and we have a right, since the people have deliberately intrusted to us the onerous duty of attempting to govern this country, to be given an opportunity to give effect to our policy. But the houorable member refuses to give us this. The honourable member for Franklin has moved an amendment to reduce the amount of Supply by one half. He has. said that he has no intention of taking the business out of the hands of the Government. The honourable member did not come into Parliament yesterday; he knows that there is no more effective and direct way of taking the business out of the hands of the Government than the method be has chosen. able member will not be surprised when I tell him that the Government cannot accept his amendment. Buti f he desires to effect a great reform in this Parliament, he will. I hope, join with me, or I will join with him, in giving the House (in opportunity of discussing the Estimates. That, I have promised, shall be done. given an opportunity to discuss the Estimates? realizesthat it was elected not to talk, but to work, that opportunity will be given.. This Parliament was elected to carry out the policy of the Government, which is, firstly, to pass the Soldiers' Gratuity Bill and the Repatriation B ill ; and thesoonerwe get through that work the sooner we shall reach the Estimates. This is. the third week in which the House has been silting, and we have done nothing but talk. So long, as the Government have the honour of holding the Treasury bench wb shall endeavour to get work done in this ""House, and if any honourable member in. the Ministerial Corner or elsewhere in the House desires an early opportunity to discuss the Estimates,, they must agree to do more work aud less talk. I was asked when effect will be given to the report of the Economies Commission. policy does not differ from that which the Leader of the Country party has indicated to the Committee. Indeed, I have never known a party or Government that was not in favour of economy. I have yet tohear of a Government that deliberately branded, itself as extravagant. I have never heard of an Opposition that did not do everything in its power to cut down the Estimates. The cry we have heard to-day is nothing new; it is as old as parliamentary government. But I believe that the Public Service of this country is in urgent need of reform; it is a cumbrous, costly, and ill-managed instrumentality of government. The Government propose to introduce a Bill for the amendment of the Public Service Act which will enable us to give effect to a great many-the major portion, perhaps-of the recommendations of the Economies Commission. I shall not say one word now by Therefore, the honorway of further criticism of the Public Service, except to declare that we must have twenty shillings' worth of value for every pound we expend. We expect that from the Public Service, and we must have it. On the other hand, it is only fair to say to them that if they give us twenty shillings' worth of value they shall receive £ 1 in return. We ask no man to work for less than a fair reward for his labour. On the other hand, we have a right to expect that he shall give us full value for the money he receives. I cannot conceive of any suggestion that might be put' forward by any honourable member on another side of the House in the direction of bond fide economy which the Government will not be glad to adopt. We are now considering to what extent we can put the recommendation of the Economies Commission in force, and legislation will be introduced where necessary to assist us to do so. The -. mover of the amendment said something about the shipbuilding, policy of the Government. I do not know that there is any necessity for me to dwell at length on the subject at this stage. Last week I explained, as well as I was able, the circumstances in which we were when the American shipbuilding contract was entered into. No doubt, as I "" said then, it has not been a good husiness for the Commonwealth. I declare, howI n essentials the Government's ever, that if I were thrown into the same circumstances again,, not being able to see any further forward, than I saw then, which was as far forward as anybody else could see, I woulddo as T did. In this connexion the honourable member has not dealt quite fairly with the Government.. When one is criticising a balance-sheet"" he.",40,Lamond Tha T Arises Ditions Endurable

118,Mr Hughes,"When the HonseJoes not merely point out the losses, hut strikes a fair balance. memberdid. not do that.. He pointed to oneitem in the balance-sheet, but did not say a word about the fact that we had made profits ten times as -great as the loss to which he referred. He stated that we had incurred that expenditure without the authority of Parliament. That is quite true. But it is also quite true that we. bought all the Commonwealth Fleet, and earned an immenseprofit without the authority of Parliament. the honourable gentleman might have pointed that out, because, as he said, he is not a hostile critic of the Government, but wishes mei'ely to. point out in what respects, we have fallen short. The honourable membersaid that, had we followed his advice,, the shipping shortage would have practically disapipeared. I do not recall all the circumstances to which the honourable gentleman refers.. As far as I remeiruber, however, the honourable' member made a suggestion that two ketches, or schooners, of about 1,000 or 1,500 tons, should! bebuilt in Tasmania. They were to be of shallow draught, and were to go up the rivers. That was the honourable member's remedy for the acute shortage of shipping from which the Commonwealth, in common with all belligerent countries, was suffering. I do not wish to labour this matter; but will any honourable member say that, if I had authorized the building of these little schooners, the shipping problem would have been solved? It would have been a drop in the ocean, and a very insignificant drop .at that. The honourable gentleman said, further, that the shipbuilders in Tasmania were prepared to construct those two schooners with hardwood for £2:5 per ton, instead of agreeing to which) the Government had gone to America,, and paid, more than £25. for vessels made of oregon. As it happens,, at the very same time that we placed those orders in America for ships to be built of. Oregon, we placed orders in Australia for eighteen vessels of 2:„600 tons to be constructed of Australian hardwood, and also for twenty vesselsof 5,500 tons to be built of Australian steel. So' that we did incomparably more for shipbuilding, in Australia than the honourable member suggested. As 'honourable members have been told, the Americans, despite their reputation, turned out to be very dilatory The honourable andl unsatisfactory workmen. The Australian workman is sometimes said to be one who is always on strike. I have stated over and over again that the Australian workman is one of the best -in -the world; and I invite honourable members to contrast what he did with the performance of his American fellow workman. As I have said, we not only placed orders in America, but also in Australia, for wooden ships. STow six of the steel I think ships which were placed on order here are in the water, and very good ships they are, too. We could make £50,000 profit on each to-morrow by selling them for coastal or for deep-sea trade. The honourable member for Franklin did not say anything about these facts,, but he might 'have done so, because, after all, they were the product of Australian, labour and Australian material.. As for the wooden ships, the ordersfor building which were placed 4 here-,, they were to cost £26 a. ton -abou t the price,. by the way, which the honourable member for Franklin, quoted to me in relation to the construction of the two schooners. They were to be propelled by Diesel engines. We gave orders to three companies-the Wallace Power Boat Company, thefirm. of Hughes, Martin, and Washington, and Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh. That wasbefore I went to England, nearly two years ago.. The honourable member said that the two schooners he spoke of would have been built in nine months. Whether they would or not I cannot say. AllI know is that none of the Australian companies with whom we placed our orders for wooden ships carried out theircontract on schedule time. Up to date, only two vesselsof the eighteen have been completed',, and they are without any engines in them. Now, the honourable member said, that if I had placed an order with this firm in Tasmania, it would have put its two schooners into the water in nine months. As I say, whether they could or not, I do not know; but I know that I gave an order to a Tasmanian. firm, and that it is the only firm which has produced nothing, at all-absolutel y nothing.. The Wallace Power Boat Company did not produce much.",42,Lamond Tha T Arises Ditions Endurable
119,Mr Mahony,"You are quite wrong..shipbuilders are the only Australian firm which you have not bought out. got to sell? We offered to finance them, we did everything; and all we asked in return was that they should give us some ships. member may say that that is business; but I do not. I do not know whether he is prepared to stand up in this chamber and compliment that Tasmanian firm upon its activities. leave the matter at that. We shall have an opportunity, when the Estimates are brought down, to show that this Government's record in relation to shipping and shipbuilding w ill stand comparison w i th that of any Government in the world throughout the period of the war. We have done very well for the people of Australia. have done very well for the primary producer in keeping freights down, and we are the only steam-ship line who have done so. The honourable gentleman might have said that also, but he did not. Now, It u r n to the matter of country telephonic and telegraphic communication and of postal facilities. I agree with the honourable member for Franklin( Mr. McWilliams). our utmost to make life in the country attractive. phones. I would be prepared to lose half a million sterling a year if it were demonstrated that by making available cheap ing postal facilities, people could be induced to leave the cities and go upon the land. but a thousand times, that it is poor policy to starve the country for the advantage of the city. And I w ill say this, further, in behalf of the Government, and for my colleague, the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise): that the policy of the Government is to give every facility-tele phonic, telegraphic and postal-to the man on the land. I think it only proper to say that the honourable member for Franklin was a littl e unfair to criticise my honourable colleague, the Postmaster-General, seeing that he took possession of the Department only a few weeks ago, and that during that time he has met two deputations and has, I think, satisfied them that he intends to follow out the policy which I have just indicated. Speakingf or the Government, I assert that we are going to pursue that policy to an extent which, I feel sure, will meet with the approval of the 1 honourable member for Franklin and his colleagues. They did not. The honourable Then the honourable member said something also with respect to profiteering. This word has become something like "" Mesopotamia."" It is a blessed word, signifying, I will not say,' nothing, b u t However, I w ill having in different minds different meanings. Certain honourable members on the other side w ill say that the man on the land is profiteering; others rail against Trusts and Combines. And of remedies there are no lack. The honourable member says he would be prepared to take advantage of the offer of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr. We Ryan) to d r a f t a B i ll by which we may capture the profiteer: and he advises the Government to accept that offer. I am a simple-minded sort of person. I do accept the offer, and will be very glad to see the measure. As a matter of fact, I have been looking for such an offer ever since I came here. the Bill? first; but I will say this, that if it is any We should have cheap telegood I w ill put it through. But if it is a B ill to abolish profiteering by cutting off the people's telephone and telegraphic facilities, I shall not commit myself to its telephones, and by extendacceptance. I am in favour of more telephones. I could not agree to cutting off telephones because some one alleged' I have said, not once, the parties using them were guilty of profiteering. The honourable member for Franklin said it would have been better had we proceeded, not by way of a referendum, but by arrangement with the States. He overlooks the fact that we did do the very thing, he advocates in 1916. We made an arrangement w it h all the States, and nob one of them, except New South Wales, honoured its promise; although I understand that in the honourable mem -ber's State of Tasmania the necessary legislation passed the Lower House, b u t failed to pass the Legislative Council.

123,We Should Certainly Do,"Mr HUGHES I would have to see i tI do uot propose to enter into any detailed argument about profiteering and the powers of the Constitution in relation to it . J content myself by saying this: at tbe best, there is a very great difference of opinion as to what are our powers under the present Constitution in this regard; but no man will deny, that if the powers asked for by me at the last referendum had been given, then we should have had power to deal with profiteering. Yet, the honourable member was one of those who went about advising the people of Tasmania to vote against the referendum. I am°very sorry he did so. However, he did it , and that is the end of it . Extension , I have done. The honourable member for Franklin claims that the moratorium is useful legislation, and that it is undesirable it should expire because it protects a large number of men who, from the effects of the drought or other vicissitudes of fortune, are in straitened circumstances. power the Constitution gives in' relation to the moratorium, other than the Defence power. I would not like to say offhand that we have or have not the requisite power independent of the War Precautions Act, but as long as the W a r Precautions Act is in force-the honourable member knows the conditions under which it expiresI w ill take steps, if no insuperable difficulty presents itself, to continue the moratorium in force, and see, if that Act expires, say, before a period of six' months, if it is possible to extend the moratorium under the Constitution for the remaining portion of that time. I have nothing further to say, except honourable friends on the Ministerial to suggest to the honourable member for bench. I have given them a f a i r extract Franklin that he should not insist on his from that part of his speech. amendment, seeing that the object for which he moved it has been gained by my tract. plain declaration of the intention of the Government to give ample opportunity to the honourable member is that I have great honourable members to discuss this year's pleasure in differing from him.

Mir. JOWETT. I gave the honourable member for West Sydney credit for more judgment than is implied by his interjection, because if he were Leader of a Government when a similar amendment had been .moved, I do not think he would act in the direction he has indicated. He would have given some assurance as to the time when the Estimates would be brought forward. This is what the PrimeM i nister has not done.

Surely that is sufficient justification for moving the amendment.

He informed us that in the very first Parliament in which he sat hevoted as he was directed, and had he been crucified he could not have told the subject on which he voted, but he feltconvinced that he had helped to save his country.

It is not an attempt to reduce the amount of Supply, although the amendment, according to parliamentary practice, may make it appear in that form. liament and asking for Supply, it would have been more advantageous if the Treasurer had come forward with the Estimates. We are simply asking for the restoration of parliamentary control over expenditure. Upon a Supply Bill, such as the present one, we might discuss this matter till doomsday if the forms of the House permitted, which, thank God, they do not. .We could rend the air with our cries, and invoke the anger of the gods there will be no more enthusiastic on the Ministry, on account of this or any other of their proposals. But on a motion for Supply, such as"" the present one, we could not exercise one iota of control over expenditure. duce? ber for West Sydney knows perfectly well that the only way in which this Committee can exercise control is to oblige the Treasurer to come down with his Estimates* and ask Parliament for their approval before the expenditure has been incurred. I am glad to be supported in this view by such a distinguished authority on parliamentary procedure as the honourable member for what item you would reduce that the object of the amendment is not fo reduce the expenditure on any item, but to limit the period for which the Government are asking for Supply. pose to effect economy? which economy can be effected is. by enabling Parliament to have an opportunity to discuss and revise the expenditure before the last penny has been disbursed The proposal of the Ministry is that Supply be granted for twelve weeks from 5th March, and the amendment seeks to reduce the period by six weeks. War matters be dealt with in the limited time ? matter to draw a red herring across the track. If this Committee were lying prostrate at the feet of some Government Instead of coming to Parmajority, and rejected all overtures to discuss and control finances, I can well imagine the honourable member for Illawarra if he were on the earth twenty or thirty years hence asking some such. question. It is a futile argument to bring against the amendment. We do not propose to postpone the passage of any of these measures to which he has referred. If the war gratuity and the repatriation proposals prove good ones, supporters of them than my friends of the Country party. I say this without reflecting upon any member of this Committee. We are anxious to discharge our obligations to the people who sent us here, and I feel satisfied that every'member on the Ministerial benches recognises that we are right in asking for some control over parliamentary expenditure. Our wishes should be met in some way other than by the statement made by the Prime Minister. cavalierly. and I have no reproach to make against anybody. I believe every member here has an honest intention of doing his duty. That is what we are sent here for. the flag this afternoon. ber's remark is quite irrelevant at this moment and in this chamber. I was about to remark that the Prime Minister said, in effect, that he could not defend the present practice; that he really agrees with everything we have done, but that, for the moment, it is not convenient for him to endorse our action. That is the only conclusion I could draw from his remarks. I am not here now to raise any issues of the past. The question for the Committee is not whether the Prime Minister defends this lack of parliamentary control so much as whether he is prepared to take this opportunity to amend it and restore to Parliament this Gratuity Bill and repatriation much-needed control over expenditure.",46,Lamond Tha T Arises Ditions Endurable

169,Mr Blakeley (Darling ) [ 6 . 5 ],"Iband, and tbe Prime Minister on the other, to make themselves intelligible to one another. The Leader of the Country party, with a carefully prepared manifesto, has cried aloud to the heavens that he has not the slightest intention of hurtCountry party that it l s not the intention ing the Government.. He would not give them one minute's cause for uneasiness, and he has assured them that the last thing he and his colleagues desire is that this country should lose their services. He told them that his party desired that the amount required by them for carrying on the public services of the Commonwealth should be reduced by one-half, but that he had not the slightest wish to harass them by forcibly taking tbe control of the public business out, nf their hands. After this carefully prepared manifesto had been delivered, in which the Country party affirmed their desire not to take from the hands of Ministers the control of tliefinances,the Prime Minister rose to reply. In a very diplomatic. speech he sought to learn just what they wanted. He said that he would afford the House an opportunity _ of considering the Estimates as soon as possible-as soon as honourable members stopped talking, and began to work. I have yet to learn how a Parliament can work without talking. Of course, the Prime Minister and the Government may constitute themselves judges of the line *of demarcadeal more than that. We want a comtion between talking and working. But I am not competent to say where talking ends and working begins. Probably criticism of the Government would be deemed to be talking, whilst adulation of Ministers would presumably be working. I suppose, too, that talking would be regarded as th6 task of the politician and working that of the statesman. Evidently the promise made 'by the Prime Minister was not just that which the Country party desired. Though they did not say so defi-. nitely, they evidently require from the Government a promise that the Estimates will be presented to this House either on the 18th March, 19th March, 20th March, or 21st March, as the case may be. That would be an easy way out of the difficulty. Then why all this talk? The duty of the Government is clear. It has merely to name a date, and so save us from going back to our masters, the electors. I am indeed surprised that there should be so much mystery about the whole thing. It now appears that the bomb which was carefully prepared, primed, and set alight by the Leader of the Country party, means nothing. .We are assured by the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the or the desire of the party to harass the Government in any way whatever. If so, what is the meaning of it all? Many of us on this side of the House have important engagements to help the Labour party in New South Wales, and we are kept here merely to hear the juggling of compliments between the Country party and the National Government. gagements in New South Wales, too. have a yarn with the Prime Minister and decide the date on which the Estimates shall be' brought down? It is only, apparently, that these gentlemen do not understand one another. There is no desire on the part of the Country party to harass the Prime Minister and his Government. If the Prime Minister, even at this stage, said, "" I will give you the Estimates in one month's time,"" the Leader and members of the Country party would be evidently only too pleased to say, ""Very well; we shail withdraw our motion."" plete statement what the honourable member and his Deputy Leader said. Both those gentlemen made it unmistakably clear that if the Prime Minister wouldfixa date on which the Estimates would be brought down, the motion, which we are assured means nothing, would not be pTessed. that. I do not take thie_ slightest interest in discussing Estimates when the money has been practically spent. MT. BLAKELEY -Then what is the honourable member taking this course for? We are, apparently, eliciting a little more information. It appears as though another factor has disappeared or come up, and that it is not so much now a question of the Estimates for the current financial year. Well, what Estimates does it concern?

""When the Labour party moved a motion of no-confidence in the Government for the way in which they had carried out matters appertaining to shipping, the honourable member and the party who f o l low him had an opportunity of protesting in a practical manner by voting with us against the Government. doing so, they voted with the Government. opportunity of voicing their objections to the way in which the shipping of this country has been managed, and now at a later stage their Leader, evidently with the concurrence and approval of his followers, attacks the same Government for the way in which the shipping business has been handled. In the circumstances, we are justified in questioning their earnestness. I Supply BiU [ REPRESENTATIVES . ] (No. 4) 19.TSM20. about parliamentary procedure, 'because I have been here quite a short time, but to me it is astounding that the Leader and Deputy Leader of a party, and the party itself, should on one occasion vote with the Government They when a no-confidence motion dealing with a specific case had been launched against them, and then at a later stage bring up exactly the same thing as one of the reasons why the House should have no confidence im the same I have heard the Government. A f t e r all, why should there be any anxiety? I do not think the Prime Minister or his followers are much perturbed. The Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) never looked more complacent than he does at present. He is not at all worried, nor are his f o llowers worried about this motion. W h y should they be? They know perfectly well that it means nothing. Only last week the Leader of the Country party said that it would be no f a u l t of the Country party if the Government were not defeated. He has cooled off considerably since that time. He has no desire to defeat the Government to-day. Eveni f the whole of the Country party voted against the Government, the Government would not be in danger. If the Government were subject to the slightest danger, if there was the slightest cause for uneasiness, I venture to say that some of the Country party would either stay conveniently away or become sick. true. frankly to the Country party as a friend. I am supporting them. I wish they were more in earnest on this matter. I could wish that they were as much in earnest as I am. The Government apparently will be saved by a successful coalition Instead of with one man, who was w i th us. but who.has now departed. I can see the Prime They refused to take a practical Minister and the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) peering into those pools around which frogs disport, and looking eagerly for what is going to happen to the Government. I can see the Prime Minister at last leading the gentleman from Capricornia into the promised land, and no doubt he will be far better there. I have no doubt that an arrangement will be come to whereby What does it all mean? the consciences of both will be, to a cerdo not pretend to know much tain extent, salved.

I do not object to the honourable gentleman taking a holiday at the expense of the people of Australia, but I do objectto tbe unnecessary camouflage in connection with his proposed trip. The financial crisis which was announced last week, as though it had struck the country suddenly, has been known to the Government and most honourable members to be approaching for quite a long time, yet the Prime Minister has seen fit to announce that there is only one man in this country who can save the Commonwealth from financial perdition; that MrW a t t alone possesses ibe suavity and other qualifications essential to dealing successfully with British financiers, and. that h "" must proceed to London at once to prevent the Imperial. Government from putting in the bailiffs upon us. The Treasurer this afternoon stated that it is the intention of the Government to appoint a Commission to deal with the ad ministration of the Post and Telegraph Department. I desire an elaboration of that, statement, so that we may know exactly what is to be done. Is the dream ster) coming true, and is he to be the Chief Commissioner, or one of the Postal Commissioners ? A re we going to place the Post and Telegraph Department under business control, which he said should be done? Personally, I do not think that those living in country districts would get better treatment from a Postal Commission than they got from the late Postmaster-General. Telegraphic and telephonic communications have been reduced, mail services have been diminished, country post-offices have been starved or done away with, official post-offices have been degraded to the rank of non-official 0 post-offices, so that those who li\je in the country and those who represent country but condemnation for the administration of the Department of the Postmaster General. City constituencies have not suffered in the same way, because of the I am great political pull that they possess. The remedy for the present state of things is easy, at least in this Parliament. TheI have no objection to Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) has told a deputation that his policy in regard to telegraph and telephone services will differ from that of his predecessor, but he will have practically to revolutionize his De partment if he is going to improve tlie position pf those who live in the country. According to the latest report of the Postmaster-General'sDepartment, which was ordered to be printed on the 23rd July last, there was, in 1917-18, in New South Wales, one official post-office opened, and seven were closed, the total number of official offices in the State thus being reduced that year by six. No semi-official offices were opened, but eight were closed; forty-three allowance offices were opened, aud. thirty-eight were closed. Those figures show the extent to which retrenchment has been carried in the Department, although there should have been no cutting down of mail services and electric communications. No true economy is made by reducing telephone, telegraph, and mail facilities in country districts. But I question altogether the earnestness of the Country party, and I am very sorry that the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) is to help the party to a way out. I may be wrong, b u t if the action of the honourable member in voting with the Government last week is an indication of what he intends to do in connection with the amendment, my guess will be a correct one. In my opinion, nothing will happen to the Government at the hands of the Country party, and I base that opinion on the conduct of its members last week, when an opportunity was afforded to them of defeating the Government.

PROWSE (Suaii) [7.45] -In rising to speak to the amendment, I desire, at tbe outset, to point out that the object of the Country party in submitting it is not so much to criticise the past deeds of the Government as to insure an immediate return to parliamentary responsibility.

In referring to the Opposition, I used the words "" so-called Labour party"" advisedly.

The war is over. Certain things had to be done during the war, and undoubtedly, mistakes were made. would, indeed, have been marvellous if mistakes had not been made during the war in the administration of the 'affairs of the Commonwealth, having regard to the tremendous volume of additional work with which Ministers had to deal. Even the mistakes made in connection with the shipbuilding contracts might have been made by any one; but it does seem that certain inexcusable neglect was shown in o connection with those contracts. The shipping items in the Commonwealth balance-sheet-thos e relating to credit and. debit-loo k all'right; but the whole business of the country is appalling. We were warned this afternoon by the Treasurer ( Mr Watt) to keep the credit of Australia above suspicion and without tarnish. It is because of such a desireon our part that the amendment has been submitted. The Treasurer's statement revealed the fact that there is an item of £90,000,000 that we owe the British Government. I do not know how much of that has to be added to the £700,000,000which this country has already borrowed. consolation; but not one pound should be spent unnecessarily by thisj orany other Government, while such a tremendous debt lies upon our shoulders. I fail to understand why the Prime Minister is not prepared to accept a reasonable proposition. We are not proposing to reduce Supply by a farthing. It may be said that, in a parliamentary sense, we are proposing that it should be reduced by one half; but what we are really urging is that the period in respect 'of which Supply is sought shall be reduced by one half, in order to give the Estimates, and. so to fulfil the promise made by every one of us to our electors. That is the position in a nutshell. There may be technicalities of parliamentary object in subusage which the learned members of the House may be able to explain; but, with due regard to the interests of the Commonwealth, I do not think that any one should be so thin-skinned as to be unprepared to give the House an opportunity to fulfil its pledges to the people. We refused to vote to turn the Government out of office immediately after the people of Australia had said to them, It ""You go in."" But I am certain that the people did not say to the Government, "" Continue to »spend and to squander a» you have been doing."" That is' the point with which we are concerned. The people did not say to them, "" Continue to squander, as the Economies Commission: says you have been doing."" Our desire is that there shall be no further squandering of public moneys. .

188,Mr Prowse,"That is some littlefor which we are contending, and for which we must contend. The Prime Minister has given certain indications of what is to be done. Two important measures-on e providing for the war gratuity, and the other relating to repatriationare to be passed before we deal with the Estimates, and it seems to me that the consideration of those two measures will extend over the period in respect of which the Estimates have been drawn up. suggestion of the amendment is that six weeks' Supply be granted, and that in the meantime an opportunity be given Parliament to deal with the Estimates. If the House is prepared to go to the country on that issue, then the whole matter rests with the Government, and not with our party. It would appear that the Supply, amounting to over £5,000,000, which we are asked to grant on this occasion, is based on the ratio of previous expenditure. We already have evidence from the Economies Commission that the basis of expenditure was altogether extravagant. We feel, therefore, that some thousands of pounds might be saved by even a consideration of the Estimates at this juncture. We had no definite promise from the Government that they were going to -economize on the lines laid down by the Economies Commission, nor have we any definite date set down for the consideration of the Estimates by this House. If there are .those who think that the members of the Country party are willing to accept ""a pig in a bag ' those who have 5 that estimate of them will find themselves altogether mistaken, because we feel that we, as representing very large sections of the electors of Australia, should have the assurances I have suggested. I do not propose to occupy more time. I merely desire to emphasize the points to which I have referred, and to show the difference between the vote of censure that was before the House some days ago and the amendment now under consideration, one being on a retrospective basis, while the other has in view the future, with which we are the more concerned. with every one in the House, or professedly -so, that' np expenditure of any magnitude should be entered into without the consent of Parliament. not propose to address myself to the question at any great length. The members of the Country party are laying down a very good principle, which should be followed by all Governments, namely, that the Estimates should be laid before the House in reasonable time, so as to afford every member a fair opportunity to discuss generally the financial position of the country. During the last years of the war we have been prone to allow things to drift, and, in view of the great general danger, to allow the Government to exercise practically a free hand, without being too carping in our criticism. But, as rightly pointed out by representatives of the Country party, the war is over; and now is surely the time to start to put our house in order. Surely the Government do not intend to go on with the reckless spending of money, showing an Utter disregard of the opinions of honourable members. Hitherto, after the money has heen spent, the Government have thrown the Estimates on the table, and, in effect, informed honourable members that, although what they complained of was probably wrong, all had been done under stress of circumstances, and matters could not be altered. As I say, I believe the Country party are enunciating a sound principle; and if tlie effect is that the Government are forced to introduce the Estimates in time to afford ample opportunity for their discussion, some good will result to the country generally. The honourable member for Franklin Country party, referred to the wooden shipbuilding contracts; and I am, indeed, pleased that at last he and the members of his party have ""seen the light"" in .this matter. Twelve months ago, from this side of the chamber, I pointed out very much what the honourable member for Franklin has pointed out to-day in reference to these contracts; but no notice was taken of my remarks. I warned the Government, and honourable members generally, of the reckless, wilful waste of public money in persisting with these soWe in this corner realize, 'called contracts; and there is certainly grounds for the most searching inquiry into the whole of the circumstances.

Isherwood type better than others? dozen different firms in Great Britain which advertise that they hold the patent rights of some particular design of construction, and which claim the same advantages for their type as do the Isherwood people for theirs. If the honourable member will look at the Shipping Gazette, ihe w ill see those advertisements for himself. But the British Government, after interviewing the authorities in the shipbuilding world, did hot adopt the Isherwood system. They decided in favour of the ordinary transverse method of standardized ship construction. That fact in itself should be sufficient, or enough, at any rate, to warrant a thorough inquiry. I hope the members of the Country party w ill support my effort to secure the appointment of a Committee to investigate the whole of the particulars surrounding, first, the cancellation of the wooden shipbuilding contracts in Australia and America.; and, secondly, the adoption of the Isherwood principle of steel ship construction in the Commonwealth. W it h regard to the sale of wool overseas, I propose to read an interesting in terview with Brigadier-GeneralH . B . Lassetter, C.B., C.M.G., who has just returned from GreatB r it a in . In the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 9th March he relates that, after a f u l l study of the f acts^ and figures available, he is convinced that the losses suffered by the Australian wool growers, through the (Federal Government's contracts with the British Government, are in the region of £60,000,000. I do not propose to quote the whole of the interview, but desire to emphasize that R o u g h l y calculated, General Lassetter has made public certain views which call for a reply from the Government. The people of Australia should demand a reply. These are his remarksThe position with regard to the contracts T h a t is so. It is a made with the British Government does not seem to be understood by the. wool-growers. In October, 1916, the basis of wool was fixed at l,5id.; it was renewed in the middle of 1917 for another year, then extended in 1918 to cover clips for a year after the war. This has since been interpreted to mean all wool shorn up to June, 1920. For English and Scottish wool the initial .price was in 1914 advanced 55 per cent.; in 1917, 50 per cent.; and in 1919, 60 per cont. But in 1919 the English farmers asked for an 80 per cent, advance. After prolonged consideration, the A r e the ships of the Government decided to abandon the purchase of the Home clip, and the wools have been sold, in the normal pre-war manner, through The r e are about a the country wool fairs. Prices realized showed an advance of from 100 to 200 per cent, on pre-war rates. The English and Scottish farmers were much too shrewd to hand over their wool to the Government. General Lassetter then addsWihatI complain about is that nobody in Australia seemed to protect the interests of the grazier. These are astounding facts to me. I am looking for information. I s it not remarkable that while we in Australia who produce this wool should lose £60,000,000, the English and Scottish farmers who are"" right on the spot and have a free sale for their wool at country fairs, can obtain an increase of 200 per cent, for their wool, without any talk of having to share their profits with the British Government ? If it is good enough for the English and Scottish farmers to get a f u l l return for their product, surely it ought to be' good enough for the Australian pastoralist to do likewise?

Opposition says that he has not made that remark, I do not wish to pin it on to him unfairly, but we hear itsaid constantly by honourable members of the Opposition that the consuiner is paying too much for the articles he purchases, and that the primary producer has been getting more than a fair return. Now, honourable members opposite claim that the primary producer should get the f u l l value for his product. Although, as it were, we have come back to this House with the sins of the past wiped' out, this debate has been merely a recapitulation of what are supposed to have been the misdeeds of the Government during the last Parliament. Considerable attention has been devoted to the question of shipbuilding, but every [12]-2 . -honourable member knows that the contracts for shipbuilding were entered into under the stress of war, and every honourable member also knows, or should know, that every civilized country in the WOTICI entered into contracts during the war of after the war was over. America lost very much more on its shipbuilding contracts than Australia did. Australia no more than any other country could foresee that the war was going to end, and the Government took the wise precaution of preparing for the worse. Had the war continued a year or two we would have heard the ship-building contract and many other tilings now condemned lauded to the skies as the height of statesmanship. The honourable The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has said, very properly, that no man could see through the veil at that t i m e; and whatever Government was in power would have been recreant to its trust and false pastoralist.""

If the people of my electorate decide that it is not satisfactory to them to have a man here to act according to his own conscience, they will find some other representative. We heard a good deal from the Leader of the Country party concerning the condition of the Post Office; but I do not think the honourable member was quite fair in his comments, because, although I doubt whether he meant it , the interpretation one could put on his remarks was that the losses in connection with the Post .and Telegraph Department had occurred in the cities, whereas, as a matter of fact, they have occurred just as much, if not more, in country districts. The loss on the telephones in cities has. certainly been heavy, but the telephonic and postal losses throughout country districts have also been heavy, and every honourable member knows that the new Postmaster General( Mr Wise) is prepared to conduct his Department on a much more liberal scale than that adopted by his predecessor. two deputations to him within a few days, and in both cases he has stated that he proposes to liberalize the position of country people to a great extent. will not do so before it is needed, and many honourable members behind the Government feel as strongly on the matter as do the members of the Country party. ing, too. acting long after many members of the Country party have ceased to be members of this House. There are two good reasons why every honest man AlthoughI had the nomination constituency who is not pledged to the policy of the Opposition should support the present Government. What was it that we pledged ourselves to support before anything else during the recent campaign? Every candidate pledged himself to keep f a it h w it h the promise made to the returned soldiers. There is not a member on this side of the House, whether a supporter of the I have come here, Nationalists or one who occupies a seat on the cross-corner benches, who did not say definitely that the first thing to be done when the new House met would be to pass the Soldiers GratuityB ill . The Government have told us that the very first measure to be submitted is one to give effect to that promise. I know honourable members opposite are not very much concerned as to whether that promise is fulfilled , but the members of the Country party are rendering it difficult for the Government to carry out their pledges. The Government have also undertaken to amend the Repatriation Act. Every honourable member, whether representing a country or city constituency, knows perfectly well that our present repatriation scheme needs recasting, owing to altered conditions. Many returned soldiers are experiencing difficulties in various forms, and the Government intend meeting them by amending the Act. Could anything be fairer? The honourable member for F r a n k l in tion of taxation, and the members of the Country party have definitely stated that the Government should do something to , remove the present difficulties experienced Already there have been by taxpayers who are now compelled to submit returns to both Federal and State authorities.

227,Mr Fleming,"Honorabl e membersthem. Why should the Soldiers Gratuity Bill, the Repatriation Bill, and au amending taxation measure be hampered by the Country party? Why this danger or assumed danger with which the Government are faced? Why not allow them to go on in the even tenor of their way? I do not think there are many honourable members who doubt for one moment that the Government can retain the support of a majority of the House. Many honourable members criticising and opposing the Government would regret their action in the event of an adverse vote being recorded. It is also the intention of the Government to encourage immigration. Is there any member of the Country party, or a reasonable-minded man on the Opposition side of the House, who is opposed to immigration on a satisfactory basis? I think that it is generally recognised that the only way to hold this country for white men is by adopting a sound immigration policy and by, increasing production. Frequent reference has been made during the debate to the Pools controlled by the Government during the war period. Every honourable member knows that the Government entered the commercial arena during the stress of war, and a majority of honourable members supported them in that connection. It has now been definitely stated by the Prime Minister that it is the intention of the Government to allow primary products to flow in their usual channels, and many of us now supporting the Government would withdraw our support if that promise were not fulfilled. The Government have already released control of some commodities, and are doing all that is humanly possible to allow primary products to be handled as in pre-war times. What more can we expect from a Government when they have already commenced honouring the pledges given to the electors? more can the Country party expect? mates; that is all. have offered to deal with the Estimates in a constitutional way. We know that during the war period it was frequently necessary to follow an unusual course, and it is time this wearying criticism, which is being indulged in just as it was twelve months ago, ceased. The same old sins are being resurrected. It is time Australia opened her eyes and commenced to face the changed conditions, as is being done by other countries. The whole world is crying out for our products, and as a producing country we are perhaps more favourably situated than any with the exception of America. The Government have submitted a reasonable programme. tion. tion; but the honourable member, who, I believe, has had experience in the State Parliament before he was elected to this House, must realize that it is a good programme. Every honourable member, whether a supporter of the Nationalists or of the Country party,' knows that the Government pledged themselves to fittingly reward the returned men at the very earliest opportunity, and the very first Bill, of which notice of introduction has been given, is one to give effect to that promise. And then we have all this captious criticism from members of the Country party concerning the Wheat and Wool Pools, which have been administered by men who think just as much as they do of the position of the producer in the country. I admit that mistakes have been made, but now we have a Government, prepared to carry out their pledges, bringing down a programme which, to my mind, wiill und-bubitedly make for the prosperity of the country interests. Notwithstanding this, the first serious challenge that they get comes from those who should support them. It is time Australia woke up to the gravity of her position. We are facing new conditions, and must give the Government a fair chance of settling down to work. I am convinced that the great majority of members have been What sent into this House by their constituents in the belief that they would give this Government a chance. In national . affairs we cannot very well have a purely Country party, because the issues are too great, and the outlook too large. This is not like a State Parliament. We have to regulate our affairs and shape our policy in keeping with the outside world.

If we oannot produce what we require in our own country, we shall have to import at high prices) and so the cost of living must mount still higher. The farmers must get better treatment than they have had during the last three years. The fact that in New South Wale3, the mother State of the Commonwealth, the representation of Labour in country districts has been increased to fourteen in twenty-seven, points to the necessity of wiping out the Government which is responsible for the bad condition of affairs that exists here to-day. Unless we can obtain. redress I very much fear that the bailiff with whom we are threatened from Great Britain, and whom the Treasurer ( Mr Watt) is being sent to London to placate, will make hasappearance in Australia, with disastrous results to all concerned. Whether we can weather the financial storm is a matter for the future consideration of the Ministry. I hope that they will do all that they can to insure that the primary producers shall get a squarer deal in the future than we have received in the past.' The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has said that our wool-growers are to receive 50 per cent, of the excess profits on the reother words, they have been used to sale of our wool by Great Britain. Upon the other hand, it is alleged that only a series of cables passed between the Commonwealth authorities and the Imperial Government in regard to the so called wool contract, and it is significant that the Government are not prepared to lay that contract upon the table of this Ho.u3e. It is further alleged 'that only 50 per cent, of the excess profits upon the re-sales of wool to countries outside Great Britain and her Allies are to come back to Australia. If that statement be correct, it means that our wool-growers will not receive any excess profits whatsoever, because -no Australian wool has been sold outside of the allied countries. It is unfair to ask our wool-growers to give their wool away for less than it is worth, Honourable members must seeing that it has not been sold to the Governments of allied countries, but to private individuals. Consequently the people of those countries will not reap the advantage of our sacrifices, but private We individuals in the persons of woollen manufacturers there will gain materially. ber's statement about the wool contract is not correct. that contract not laid on the table of 'the House in order that the fullest publicity may be given to it? There are members of the Ministry who have never seen it. Our primary producers are having their goods disposed of under the contract, and in such circumstances why should its provisions be kept dark? Apparently the dictatorship which has existed during the past four years has blinded Ministers to the fact that the wool is not 'theirs, but that of primary producers in Australia who have a right to know the conditions under which it is being disposed ""of. I venture to say that if the terms of the wool contract had been made clear to the people prior to the recent elections the Government would not have been again returned to office. A similar remark is applicable to the sale of our wheat. Concerning the Commonwealth line of steamers, I was under the impression that they had been purchased in order to keep down freights. But I now find that those vessels have charged the same freights as have been charged by privately-owned shipping lines. In bolster up high freights. There are certain other primary products in Tegard to which we have been penalized by the unintelligent action of the Government. Take the case .of rabbit skins as an example. It is common property that in connection with the sale of these skins a policy of "" keep it dark "" has been observed. An embargo had been placed on the export of rabbit skins for the purpose of allowing manufacturers to hoard stocks, and thus make enormous profits when the embargo was lifted. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) has stated that this embargo has now been lifted, but that -the Government intend to reimpose it in May next.

234,Mr Icunmingham,"Then, why isbody of workers in this country very hard indeed, because the latter w ill be prevented from getting the higher prices for the skins that they otherwise would get. crease in Australia, and it costs our primary producers hundreds of thousands of pounds annually, to keep them in check. ""We were getting r i d of them, and large numbers of men were being provided with employment owing to the sales of rabbit skins. But when the Government placed an embargo upon their export, hundreds of men knocked off trapping, because they were not prepared to be crucified by the middle-men here who were being protected. This unintelligent part of the Government has had disastrous effects upon the producers. only mention, in this connection, the Ministerial action in fixing the price of meat. I will give my own experience as an illustration. and a living on a small area of land is a very narrow one indeed. primary that the payment of wages was likely to break me; but I do know that the excessively high prices exacted by the Government have been responsible for placing many producers in a position of financial embarrassment. The action of the Government in fixing the price of meat was responsible for a drop of £2 10s. per head in thecase of store stock that we had purchased for £12 10s. per head; and I know one station owner who lost 1,100 head of stock as the result of the action of the Government in fixing prices at that particular time of the year. As the wage earner has only his labour to sell, and is not able to make provision for a rainy day, discontent amongst the workers, hecause the figures of the Commonwealth that, although we have spent sums upon war activities, the deposits in our banks have increased very considerably during the war period. The Government are not prepared to tax those who have large bank balances, and naturally, with the increased cost of living, and the higher burden of taxation which has to be borne by the small men, discontent is increasing, whilst constant strikes are a source of loss to both sides. The Labour party do not stand for strikes, but for a Mr Cunningham. policy of arbitration. Every day that capital and labour are at strife w it h each other, national loss is incurred which we cannot afford. No small p r i Rabbits are on the in mary producer can ever say that wages are likely to break him, because he does not employ sufficient men to produce that result. I have purchased bags at 18s. per dozen, although those bags had cost the National Government only 9s. 5d. per dozen. They refused to sell to the farmers' representatives, and sold the bags over their heads to the middlemen of Sussex-street, Sydney, and the middlemen of other States. Many other instances of a similar nature could be quoted. Under the National Government the Necessary interference on the Commodities Commission fixed the price of chaff bags at 8s. a dozen, but at the I need same time refused to commandeer supplies, although that is the logical outcome of price-fixing. If you fix prices you must be prepared to commandeer supplies The margin between poverty at that price. We could not get supplies. Stocks were held up, with the reAs a small sult that men had to pay 14s. a dozen for producer I have never found second-hand bags that were net worth 4s. 6d. to put their chaff into to save their stock. Y e t gentlemen in the Corner party endorsed the action of the Government last week by voting for them. Never was there such a right-about-face as has been displayed by that party in their actions during the past two weeks. The outlook for the whole of the people of Australia is not bright. If we on the land are not doing any good, no other section of the community is doing any good. Y o u may continue to do as has been done in the past; mortgage your country year by year in order to provide employment, but an end must come must manifest itself to that sort of thing, as is shown by the insistent demand from Great Britain toStatistician prove day that we shall meet our obligations, enormous whether they amount to £8,000,000, or £48,000,000, or £90,000,000. The man is calling to-day for his money, and we have the spectacle of the Treasurer himself being sent to Englandi n order to placate those who desire to be paid, in spite of the fact that we keep Australia Housei n London at a total cost of £100,000 per year. We have to face tlie position, and we must carry our burden of debt. We do not know what we are going to receive from the Wheat Pools or the Wool Pool. what he is to get for his 1915-16 scrip. One man the other day offered 8,000 bushels of it for £ 5 at Glen Innes, and could not get a buyer. Why do not the Government finalize the Pools so that we may be able to see where we stand and know definitely whether or not it will be possible for us to carry on as we have been doing, or whether we shall have to finance in other directions? urge the Government, if they remain in office, to see at once that liberal advances are made to small primary producers, wherever they are situated in Australia, in order that the millions of pounds of capital which they have invested in land and plant may not be allowed to remain idle, simply and solely because they are not in a position to put it into working order to grow wheat for Australia during the next twelve months. to-day practically 30s. an acre to sow wheat, and nearly 10s. per bushel to land seed wheat on our farms, notwithstanding that millions of bushels have been sold by the Prime Minister at fro m 4s. 4d. to 4s. 6d. in the last (three years. The Government say they have had no power to deal w i th profiteering. Could any greater power be held by any Government than was held by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), who could take my wheat and go to Great Britain and sell it for whatever he thought it was worth ? Yet he could not compel the man who was selling bags, twine, oil, or machinery to me to charge fair and reasonable prices. So when the representatives of the Country party, as they are called, in the Corner, say that they are out to do the fair, thing by the man on the land, I say to them, "" Use your influence and your votes to see that men on the land do not have to pay the excessive prices that are charged to-day."" £ 6 0 for a binder of which the sworn value coming into Australia is £ 1 7 10s. had enough money to buy one for the last twelve months, and for all I know they may he up to £85, or even £100 a poor, miserable little bank clerk-to Whatever the price is, we have received -no protection from the Government in that direction. used to cost 6s. 6d., are now 18s., although there is only 6 lbs. of steel in each ploughshare. In the face of facts like this, can No man can say to-day any one say that there is no profiteering? The reason why Labour gained seats in New South Walesi n the primary-producing districts was the dissatisfaction felt by men' on the land with their treatment at the hands of the National Government. We are here to do a l l we can to see that redress is given to the people in the country districts, in order not only that the country districts themselves may I would particularly be saved, but that the people of Australia may be saved in the years ahead of us, when we shall have to carry this enormous burden of debt. Unless something is done, the confidence of the primary producers that they would receive a f a i r deal w ill not be restored. They had that confidence u n t i l the National Government took over the administration. Unlessi t is restored, all the other legisI t costs us lation that the Government may carry w ill be futile, because they w ill have destroyed the source of wealth, and the only alternative w ill be to continue to borrow. That cannot be done for any extended period, since GreatB r it a in to-day has practically hung up the sign, "" No more money available here,"" and is already demanding that we shall meet our obligations, however great they are. The position is very serious for every man in the community, and requires the earnest and sympathetic consideration of the Government. I hope that the Administration that has proved so disastrous during the past three years w ill be changed, and that the incidence of taxation w ill be placed on the shoulders of those best able to bear it-thos e who have reaped enormous profits through Australia being at war.

I would like to see the report that has been hidden, but the honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) has camouflaged it . I am sorry that he is not here to-night to hear me ask him if he is man enough to put it on t h e table so that honourable members may see it . It was a piece of impertinence to appoint officials of the Department to criticise and vise the findings of a Commissioner. It was like asking the clerk of a Police Court to vise a judgment of the H i g h Court of Australia. I smiled somewhat when the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) went into the prist history of politics. One very fine phrase he uttered was that the House of Commons is a jealous mistress of her rights. never treated as this Parliament was treated during the war. We were 12,000 miles from the scene of conflict, and yet it was thought necessary to close our mouths. not much more necessary to close the Parliament at the Seat of the Empire, which was so near the frontier? During the war, the Government had us called together, and had measures passed, which I am glad to find the Country party letting light into now. What is the use, they say, of criticising the Estimates after the mi:ney has been paid away? T h i r t y years of experience has taught me that a Government with a brutal majorit y ""can force its business through, and this Government is prepared to do that. whip has been cracked. The PrimeM in isted said that the Government had been placed in complete power by the dominance of the, people. Was there ever a more garbled falsehood? The people of . this country can control Parliament on only one day in three years. the creators of Parliament; but once Parliament, has been created, its members can, during three years, do what they like, snapping their fingers at the electors. This country has been ruled by a dictator, who has been supported by the Governor General. has a man in power done what he has done. Tlie idea of giving a man the right to for m a Cabinet when he had only foury 283 teen supporters in a House of seventy-five members! It is known outside that Governor General Den-man would not do the work that this man was sent out here to do. When the real record of the present Governor General is made by a forma l motion in this House, the people of Australia w ill wonder why they stood h k n so long. The Prime Minister spoke of the great Nationalist party. That party faced the electors fifty-two strong, and today has a majority of one only over the other parties in this House when combined. that it has a majority at all. to have any majority. Thirty-eight Nationalists, fourteen ex-Labour men, and twenty-three Labour men faced the electors, but at the poll nine Nationalists lost their seats.

They took more from the so-called The Nationalists than from any other party. Labour came back twenty-six strong. Where, then, is this great victory of which the Prime Minister spoke? Out of the party of fourteen, with which the Governor General allowed h i m originally to constitute his humbugging Cabinet, They are only six remain in the House to-day. Mr. Archibald, Mr Jensen, Mr Spence, and Mr Webster, all members of that M in istry, were defeated at the last general election; as were Mr Lynch, the New South Wales farmer; and Mr Heitmann.

244,Able Member F O R Fremantle ( Mr Bur,"Chanter), the Prime Minister( Mr whereas they are cutting out the wareHughes), the Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr Poynton), and the Honorary Minister( Mr Laird Smith). All these hold salaried offices. There are, in fact, one and a half members to one paid office. On the other hand, the Country party consists of eleven members, not one of whom occupies a salaried position, although some of them might have done had they listened to the voice of the tempter. At the 1917 elections, the Hughes party gained three new supporters. disappeared. I hope he was not defeated because of the wild and woolly statement reported to have been made by him that he did not care whether Australia was white, brown, or brindle. Foolish words of that kind are never forgotten. The honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Lamond), another of the trio, is here to-day, as well as the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Story), who also occupies a paid office. Of the original wonderful fourteen, only six remain. Yet the Treasurer ( Mr Watt) said that, generallv speakinff, the Governshould not be sold direct to the public inment had every reason to he proud of its glorious victory.

As one who has had occasionally to hit the Treasurer ( Mr Watt) fairly hard, I wish to thank him for what he has done on behalf of the returned soldiers engaged in hand-weaving. We should have had 1,000 men so employed, and earning from £4 to £5 per week, but for the action of the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen), who did every thine he could to assist Flinders-lane, and to ruin the returned soldiers engaged in the industry The suit I am wearing is of hand-woven tweed made by returned men. I have worn it for two years, and no one could wish for a better article. The only complaint I now have against the Government in regard to this industry is that, housemen, and relieving the public of their unjust profiteering extortions, a man who wishes to get a suit length of hand-woven tweed must obtain it through his tailor, who will be supplied with it at a cost of 15s. per yard, double width. cost? make the suit for £3 10s.; the honourable member's tailor might charge him £5. The returned soldiers engaged in this inOf these, Mr Heitmann has dustry have been vilely treated, but they are now getting a fair deal. Why, however, should not the public be able to obtain a suit length direct from the weavers? The"" B l i g h t y"" tweeds that are woven in Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh can be purchased in suit or costume lengths direct from the factories by the general public. Why should not the same practice apply here? When I brought the matter before the Treasurer, he asked why the tweed should not be sold at 10s. per yard if it could be made for 7s. 6d. per yard. I fail to see why it stead of the people being robbed. I showed Senator Russell the offer of a reputable firm to start with 500 suits, and supply what are known as half and quarter sizes, at £2 2s. per suit; or, if a tailor-made suit were required, for £3. The infamy of the prices now being charged for suits of clothing may be estihonorable mated when I tell honourable members that -1 lbs. of greasy wool is sufficient to provide for a suit of clothes. The Gowho found their electioneering funds. Men were paid £750, and, in one case, £1,250, to organize the political campaign on behalf of the Government, who, however, came back with their numbers reduced from fifty-two to twenty-nine. Another victory like that, and I daresay the Government will disappear from the Treasury bencha long-wished-for result on my part. Why should we not get rid of uvr six State Governors ? What good are they ? I have had a splendid meal at Government House, but I never met tbere a man or woman whose belly was empty with hunger.

Dr. thought it right that those in humble life might taste that which only the rich can buy.

Compare some of the Governors in Australia with one in Western Australia. He was paid only £600 a year, and he buil t his Government House at his own expense. A t that time butter was 5s. a pound, but he never let any one go past his door who was hungry. James Stirling, who left this life many years ago; but his record is unsurpassed amongst Australian Governors. I think there was some laughter from honourable members opposite when General Lassetter's name was mentioned, but I cannot allow that gentleman's name to he so greeted so far as I am concerned. A t General Lassetter's request in February last year, I went down to the Osterley, and there saw branded in big letters on the steel girders, the words on the men's quarters, "" R o o m for thirty-two seamen."" When the Orient Steam Navigation Company was fighting the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company for twenty-five years it had a friend in me; but there were some for t y men crowded into that accommodation for thirty-two, and the shipping authorities wished to accommodate 100. But against this the men 3track in dock. This is what I said in the Heraldi n reference to that matterDr. Maloney, M.H.R., stated that he had been shown the words "" Licensed for 32 berths,"" stamped on each side of the stewards' quarters, giving a total of 64 berths, and yet between 80 and 00 men were expected to live in the tiny place. The men did not have a table provided for them, and as a result they did not have a single sit-down meal on the whole voyage I asked the Government whether the Board of Trade regulations were to be observed, and they said they were, but nothing was done. The first class single fare was £128, as high as £90 for second class, and £ 4 7 steerage; and the space was wanted for passengers. One of those angel women who act as nursesa sister of General Lassetter-dre w my attention, to the conditions on the ship. I am proud to think that an officer of such high standing as General Lassetter, in order to show me how things were, Avent of the ship where the men were accommodated, and where, as we know, the chief danger lay in case of mines. In tbe event of any mine being struck, not one of the seamen could escape up these ladders; and the children in the steerage ran great risks, and would have fared very badly but for the humanity of the ladies in the saloon who shared their, milk food with them. Yet at the Agents General's offices and the H i g h CommisThat Governor was Sir sioner's offices, it was thousrht that everything requisite was provided. Thef o l lowing is a letter sent to me by Miss Lassetter:Before this voyage the stewards struck for better sleeping accommodation. Ninety men were to be squeezed into an area suitable for about sixty. No one would sign on until some men (about ten) were placed elsewhere to sleep. Hours usually called 4.45, and off duty about 0, on their late evening 9 p.m. No table, no forms for their meals; eating standing; very injurious to their health and digestion. The sleeping quarters, besides being badly ventilated, overcrowded, are so noisy owing to the winch which works Saturdays and week days, that it is a torture for a sick steward ordered, by the doctor to remain in his bunk. Aa the men had not enough uniforms to last out the voyage, they had to wash and iron them in their time off duty or in the night. The stewards get an hour before each meal to get clean and ready to serve the meal. The work is sweated work, owing to the gross selfishness of the passengers, and the carelessness of the line. Many passengers, who are lazy and not ill, have all their meals in their cabins or on deck, so doubling the labour of the stewards and stewardesses. This ought to be stopped, except under doctors' orders. Hence the cabins cannot be cleaned in their proper hours, making it impossible for the stewards to get through their work. The bathroom stewards and stewardesses, who ought to have their bathroms cleaned in the middle of the morning, are still giving and preparing baths. A charge for all passengers who have meals in their cabins, except under doctor's orders, would reduce this labour. It is a well-known fact that many passengers remain in their cabins, and cause extra labour, who would not do it if charged extra if not sick. I personally consider the life and work of a steward to be sweated labour.

249,Mr Jowett,"He gave them 500has been said to-night, and I should like to add a word or two in support of the Government who desire to carry this Supply. Bill as presented. that, as a new member, I have been absolutely disgusted with the way in which -honourable members have deliberately -wasted the time of Parliament since we started our sittings. According to the Governor General's Speech we were sent here to deal with matters of great moment to the country, yet we now find ourselves, after a fortnight, just where we started. A censure motion, submitted by the Opposition, occupied us for a week. We then started to try to get something done; but the Country party, in their desire to carry on the affairs of the country, have decided to hold up Supply still longer. It is absolutely necessary that the Government should get the Supply Bill passed. We do not want to go over past history, and criticise what the Government aid during the last Parliament. Opposition members surely gave enough of that during the election campaign. I certainly heard enough; I . had to answer for the sins of Governments for the last ten years. If honourable members would bring forward something new for the Government to deal with, we ' might get ahead with the business. We are told that one of the reasons for the Country party's proposal for the reduction of Supsuspend the rest of the Parliament. If ply is that it insists upon the Government exercising due economy. We have in this House a combination of the. Opposition and the Country party in an effort to browbeat the Government. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr it. Exception was taken by the honorNicholls), in his speech last week, gave an illustration of what he desired for the economical working of the country. He insisted that the Government were spending too much money; but, at the same time, asked that 200 employees who have been discharged from the Lithgow Small Arms Factory should be continued in their employment, although we do not now want the rifles produced. To-day the honourable member for . Dalley( Mr Mahony) criticised severely the persons who were sent to America by the Commonwealth Government to supervise the construction of wooden ships. dently forgot that it was urgently necessary, when the contracts were made, that we should have more ships, regardless of whether or not they were in a proper condition.. It was moTe important I may say "" that Australia should have ships in some condition, in order to get her produce away, than that the launching of them should be delayed at the shipbuilding yards on technical grounds. I could not help smiling when the honourable membeT said that those supervisors were receiving £500 per annum practically for doing nothing: I started to mentally compare them with some of the politicians, to the great disadvantage of the latter. In regard to the criticism by General Lassetter, the remark made concerning an honourable member in this Chamber might be applied to him, viz., that he is looking at Australian conditions to-day with the eyes of 1914. General Lassetter might be put in the same position, and be absolutely unable to answer' for the opinions of the wheat and wool-growers at the present time. A remark was also made that the British Parliament was not treated during the war period as this Parliament was. I was in England in 1915, and the squeals from the British Parliamentarians were almost as loud as those we have heard from members of the Opposition to-night. The British Government found it necessary to carry on the work of the country and 'to practically we could do the same in Australia, allowing a few strong men to carry on the affairs of the country, instead of having a lot of members talking and wasting time, the country might be the better for able member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) to the remarks of the Prime Minister that this Parliament was elected to uork, and not to talk.
