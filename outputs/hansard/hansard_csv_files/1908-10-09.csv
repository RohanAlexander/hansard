It is not for a layman to recommend a site. ber must not argue the point. skill is required to select a site, and I wish to know whether the Government do not consider that the decision of the House last night throws upon them the responsibility of introducing a new Bill dealing with this question.

Had a definite site been chosen we could have proceeded at once. As it is, do what we will, we are confronted with a prospect of delay. Sir JOHN QUICK the Prime Minister whether it has not been considered by the Government that the proper procedure as contemplated by the [38] The three sites named Constitution is that the Federalterritory as a. whole should be first of all either acquired by the Commonwealth or granted by the State; and that it would be useless, and certainly not within the contemplation of the law, to proceed with the selection of whole had been determined.

That implies a selection as between Canberra, Lake George and Yass, to say nothing of other sites which it is suggested by the honourable member for South Sydney are within the district. All this means delay. What we are anxious to discover is the most expeditious method of dealing with this question. It is desired to settle the matter finally without any further postponement. Minister, in the interests of the promptitude which he expresses a desire to show, to consider another aspect of the matter.

30,Mr Deakin,"As I have alreadysubmitted last night, save the one approved, related to a definite site, and we had prepared an amendment of the existing Act to provide for the inclusion of whichever was selected. We find ourselves, however, confronted with a problem. If we simply amend the existing Act by substituting for the word "" Dalgety"" words covering the district of Yass-Canberra, a question will arise whether we ought not to define, before we send the Bill on to another place, the particular portion of that district on which we propose to establish the Capital. If an Act be passed endorsing the choice of Yass-Canberra, we shall still have before us the selection of the particular portion of that territory to be acquired from New South Wales.

We are, in effect, faced with a situation similar to that with which we were confronted before the decision of yesterday afternoon. In other words, we have to choose a specific site within the area selected. put to the Prime Minister. The vote given yesterday for Yass-Canberra was largely influenced by a statement made by responsible members of the House, that a definite promise had been made by the Premier of New South Wales, that, in the event of its selection, the Government of that State would be prepared to make Jervis Bay a Federal port, and grant the Commonwealth sufficient territory to provide access from the site to that point on the coast.

South Wales has publicly stated that he could not approach this Parliament with any proposition, from which might be in-ferred a desire on his part to give it a lead or a direction. Consequently he proposed to say nothing except that he was prepared to consider very favourably any proposals that might be made by this Parliament. So far as his public utterances are concerned, I am not aware that he has gone further. The obstacle in the way of the course that the honourable member now suggests simply wish to know if the statement on which certain votes were cast for the Yass-Canberra site is to be confirmed. chosen, I do not know whether the promise of which the honourable member has heard would relate to that side of the district as well as to Canberra or Lake George. relation to Jervis Bay' as would the other side. greater distance from that port. the Prime Minister on the spur of the moment to define the attitude of the Government, and all I wish to know is whether he will consider the matter between this and the next sitting of the House'. that assurance.

I did not make the statement which the honourable member attributed to me. WhatI did say to honourable members and reiterate now is that the Government of New South Wales, so far as I was able to ascertain, were prepared, in respect of access to the sea or the question of the area of the Federal territory, to treat the Commonwealth much more liberally in the case of Canberra or a site in the vicinity than in the case of any other site that was not approved of by themselves. Mr Wade, in reply to a question put to him in the New South Wales Parliament, said that if any of the sites approved by the Government of New South Wales were selected by the Commonwealth tbe most liberal terms would be extended by the New South Wales Government to the Commonwealth in respect of the area and facilities generally.

That was the report of the Department's own officer, and it was borne out by further inquiry. Then the honourable member for Parramatta, in whose electorate Katoomba then was, brought the matter under the notice of the Department, and the reply he got was that, at present, nothing could -be clone, but that when the tourists' season -of 1906-7 was commenced further inquiry would be made. The residents of Katoomba, knowing that there was sufficient work for one line without any "" cut in "" lines or outside connexions, again wrote to the Department, through the local council, asking that another line might be erected, on which they were prepared to guarantee ten per cent. That offer was voluntary; and the Department, after, a good deal of correspondence, accepted the offer and consented to erect a line. The Department then sent up officers to make inquiries; and it was found that the existing line was already paying more than 10 per cent, on the estimated outlay on the old line and the new one, so .that a guarantee was absolutely unnecessary. I believe that ten per cent, on the outlay of the two lines represented about £ 3 ° ° ; whereas, taking everything into consideration, the revenue was somewhere between £600 or £700 a year; and, after more delay, the Department informed the municipal council at Katoomba that they were prepared to erect a line without a guarantee. tion which I asked, it was said that no provision had been made on the Estimates of 1906-7 for this line, and that the people would have to wait until the-1907-8 Estimates were considered, but that in the meantime tenders would be was included in the vote on the 1907-8 lieve, a line in the whole of the Commonwealth that would pay so handsomely. with Katoomba, and I never experience any delay. that the Treasurer cloes not consider this line in the least necessary-hi s interjection shows where the shoe pinches. The present Minister of Trade and Customs, when Postmaster-General, paid a visit to Lithgow, and, while passing through Katoomba, promised a deputation that this work should be proceeded with. I understand that second tenders were called for the supply of material, but, instead of being accepted, they were delayed pending a vote of the House. After numerous letters and personal representations, I asked the Postmaster-General in the House whether he anticipated that the promise he had given, that the special trunk line would be supplied for the ensuing tourists' season, would be fulfilled. The Postmaster-General replied:I am unable to s'tate definitely, but this work, with others of a similar character, is being carefully considered in connection with the Estimates now being prepared. The tourist season at Katoomba extends from September to Easter. The resident population of the township is about 2,000, but the visitors number about 6,000, so that its summer population varies from 8,000 to 10,000.

I have presented requests and petitions to the Secretary of the Department, who has always received me courteously, and promised to bring each case before the Postmaster-General, and, if at all possible, to arrange that just requests should be granted.' -Department promised that if certain conditions were carried out, they would erect the Waubra and Lexton to Ballarat line.

I have mentioned these matters to the Postmaster-General, but I do not bother him ' much. I go to the permanent head of the Department and put the case before him. I am certain that in many instances he has recommended that the requests should re-. ceive immediate attention, but we always find that the bone of contention is the want of funds. The-policy of the Department apparently is that the country cannot be considered. The town must be considered first, and everything must be centralized. The residents of the country are neglected, but this House, which largely represents the country, should recognise that the primary producer is the man who, above all I hope that the honourable others, should be encouraged. It is to the interests of manufacturers, and, in fact, of almost every resident of the cities, that the man on the soil should be considered, because they depend on his products for It would be impossible their prosperity. A man in a large way of business at a little place called Natte Yallock, who finds it absolutely necessary to communicate with Ballarat, and from Ballarat on to Melbourne, is no further forward in the matter of getting telephone facilities than he was over twelve months ago. In the case of the line from Waubra and Lexton to Ballarat, I handed to the (Grampians) Department about six weeks ago their own letter of over twelve months before, in which a promise was made that telephone facilities would be given if certain conditions were complied with. Yet, as I said, they now reply that they can go no further because they have no funds. How long is this state of things likely to continue? I hope that the Postal Commission will do some good, and that some of these injusBut over twelve months ago the tices to country residents will be brought to light, in order that the Postmaster-General may be seized of the importance of his duties as head of a great Department.

I am satisfied Instances of the honourable member for Nepean has voiced the opinions of country residents throughout the length and' breadth of the , Commonwealth.

118,Mr Hans Irvine,"The very fact that honourable members feel it necessary to complain of the management of the Post and Telegraph Department now in spite of the fact that a Royal Commission has been appointed shows what a chaotic condition the Department has got into. question is one of money, but there is another side to it . that the House has reduced the charges for the telephonic and telegraphic services, and yet no provision appears to have been made by the Department to meet the increased business that was bound to follow. back the surplus revenue to the States was the cause of the whole trouble. and that this state of things has dated from the beginning of Federation. Yet to-day the Federal Parliament is being kicked for its kindness to the States. But that does' not explain cases such as I have experienced, and I suppose other honourable members have also, where even in a matter of the expenditure of £ 5 or £ 1 0 the Department has replied that the question must stand over until Parliament makes the necessary provision. It is most humiliating that such a big Department should have to send out letters of that description. Another example of lack of good management in the Department is this: If it is proposed to construct a telephone line of about 100 miles or-more in length, an order must be given for the necessary copper wire iri England, and twelve months must elapse before the wire is delivered to the Department, no matter how urgent the work may be. Although the copper is produced in Australia, it has to be sent Home, and then brought back by the Government at greatly increased cost, to say nothing of the delay occasioned thereby. Surely some arrangement might be made by the Government to avoid that state of things, either by keeping up a stock sufficient to carry out works that are found necessary from time to time, or by some other method. The present arrangement shows gross mismanagement. The officers of the Departm e n t say that a work is urgently necessary, but all that they can do is to make an order, knowing f u l l well that it will be twelve months before they can get the material to carry out the work. The same thing applies in an even greater degree to the supply of switchboards. It is time the Government took steps to make ample provision, for carrying out the work of the Department in a proper way. If they bring down Estimates to meet the requirements of this growing service, I do not think the House will be found wanting ini voting the necessary money. rise to emphasize the statements ""made by We must not forget previous speakers with respect to the condition of the Department. I anticipatethat the reply of the Postmaster-General will be that the Postal Commission is now sitting, that when their report is presented' the whole question will have to bethoroughly gone into,, and that after theBudget statement is made next week a further opportunity will be given to honorable members for discussion. But in the meanI believe that is true, time the Postal Department, one of the most important that the Commonwealth has. charge of, is falling into disrepute be-' cause the most necessary services are hungup for want of funds. So far we can find' no sign whatever of any financial schemebeing evolved by the Government to meet the grave and serious exigencies of our great commercial Department. I hope that this discussion will force upon the Postmaster-General and the Government thenecessity of tabling some scheme in connection with the Budget to place the Department on the requisite financial footing, in order that works which are urgently demanded throughout the Commonwealths may be undertaken without further delay. I recognise that it is a question of money. surer be present to hear the debate ? needs of the Commonwealth in connection witli postal, telegraphic, and telephonicfacilities have for several months past been absolutely flouted. We have only to glanceat the evidence that has been tendered to the Postal Commission to see the chaotic condition into which the finances of the Department have fallen. I do not say that the Postmaster-General is not doing"" his very best to meet the rapidly growing requirements of tlie Commonwealth, dueto its general prosperity, and I believe that the responsible officers of the Department are generally doing what they possiblv can to meet these constant demands.

I have only to say that when the Estimates appear the attitude of the Government will not deter me from doing my duty.

We permitted an arrangement, under which the Chinese and East Indian Squadrons and the Australian Squadron are combined, and any part of the seas may be patrolled by the combined) ifleet. Lord Tweedmouth, at the Colonial Conference and since-and I state this as a fact which, I think, should have been mentioned by the right honourable member for East Sydneyhas said that this arrangement under the Naval Agreement is not satisfactoryto the Admiralty-that they do not desire any limitation as to the area over which the Squadron should operate. When we find that that is so, we see that the Prime Minister of Australia, although his ideas are not always acceptable to the Admiralty, is with them' to the extent that both desire an amendment of the Naval Agreement. There is no doubt that the Pacific has been largelv deserted by the British Navy, and that since the British-Japanese treaty the Pacific Ocean has been left, to a certain extent, to Japan. Japan mav be as a commercial friend of England-howeve r much the interests of the Manchester school may still predominate in Imperial politics-Japan is certainly no friend of Australia, nor is the Anglo-Japanese treaty, save as a breathing space for ourselves, to our advantage. As a consequence, we have to see to it that any preparations we make are largely based on the view that there is a possibility, first, of no British fleet being here to defend us, ancl. secondly, of the defeat of that fleet. Uncler either ""circumstances, what are we to clo? Are we to be left purely at the mercy of any invader? ' member for East Sydney does not see any danger of invasion; . but he admits that, if there were clanger of invasion in the next ten years, he would think it right to prepare'some such scheme as that the Government proposes. right honourable member does not contemplate permanent invasion at any time. What would happen if the British Navy, on which the right honourable member seems to plank the whole of his confidence, and the whole of his opposition to the Government scheme, were to be defeated or were to desert the Pacific, as it deserted the West Indies, which formed the principal Colony at the time of the Napoleonic wars'r What would happen if the Imperial authorities were to withdraw the whole of their fighting strength to European waters? Are we a country with a national existence, and 4,000,000 people, whose duty it is to defend our own land-to allow our shores to be invaded ? A possibility to be faced is that the Japanese-thoug h I do not think they would try to interfere with our civilization, which is fixed for all time on the south and east of the continent-may , by forceful penetration, land a large number of people on the north or north-west. What could we do in such event ? We could not drive them out with our present military forces. If we depend on the British Navy, which may or may not be. able to defend us in time of need suppose, require a fleet as big as that of Japan to'keep the Japanese out? dealing solely with the question of land fighting, and"" we should certainly require men equal to the number Japan could land. England shipped 250,000 to South Africa. We now come to .the question whether it is necessary to have compulsion in Now, however great order to obtain an efficient fighting force. I do not speak with the experience of rhe honourable member for Brisbane, who is much my senior, and necessarily carries greater authority; but I have been nearly seventeen years in the militia, and all that time, and longer, I have tried to make a study of defence. In this con' nexion, let me give the House the result of my own experience of militia work. It has been said that compulsory training will k ill enthusiasm; but in Ian Hamilton's book on the Russo-Japanese War-on e of the most interesting of the many I have read on the subject tliere is a storv The honourable which exemplifies that. The writer says that one morning, when watching some' digging being clone by a number of coolies, working apart from the main gang, all of whom had been compulsorily enlisted, he overheard one of them A t the same time, the say, "" If we were working like this at Nagasaki, we should be earning five or six c yen."" The others, who overheard the remark, were intensely annoyed by it , and one of them replied, "" If you loved your country, you would be glad to pay six or seven yen for the privilege of doing thiswork."" The unpatriotic character of theremark provoked' an absolute commotion, and the coolie who made it was led to see that the general feeling was completely against him. In my opinion, compulsory training will not k i ll enthusiasm. Even in the present Act, there is a section under-",32,Defence Bill Second Reading

238,Mr Crouch,"A t present I amwhich, in time of danger, as defined by the interpretation clause, every male member of the community, between the ages of 18 and 60 years, may be called out in defence of his country. But men who have merely enthusiasm and no training are almost useless. It is dangerous to take untrained men into the field. Zola, in The Downfall, shows that even the trained troops in Sedan, when disturbed by the knowledge that desertions were taking place, and suspicious of the treachery of Marshal Bazaine, became a mob, and could not stand, when shrapnel was being poured upon them; while the raw levies of Gambetta and others, though, fired with patriotism by the attacks on Paris and the threatened dismemberment of France, were quite incompetent. stand shrapnel only by actual expeiience in war. Colonel FOXTON -A t the time of which the honourable member speaks, France had a system of compulsory training. refer were almost wholly composed of untrained volunteers; the trained men had already been drawn on. Besides, at that time, training was not so general as it has become since, as the result of the lessons of that war. We have been told that the British Empire, in spite of its enemies and its splendid isolation, has been able to hold in South Africa. How does the honorits own without compulsory military training. But is that so? Are not those who join the British Army virtually compelled to do so? mostly come? .against the British soldier. fought with him in South Africa, as did the honourable member for Adelaide, know that when trained he is a splendid man; but it must not.be forgotten that 60 per cent, of those who enlist are driven to it by poverty and the fear of starvation. That is shown by the physique of the men. Would-be recruits, whom we in Australia would not accept, are wel-comed by the British Army authorities. Consequently, the British Army gets, not fhe flower of the country, as Continental armies do, but men of comparatively poor physique. This is emphasized by the fact that, while in the Franco-German war only 29 per Cent, of the casualties resulted from enteric fever and other illness, in the South African war, 56 per cent, of the British losses was due to those causes. The Japanese loss in their recent war was, I ""believe, only 20 per cent, or 25 per cent. in sanitation account for those results ? orable member for Corio are not fair. ber for Maranoa can make his own deductions from my figures, and his experience in the first Boer War enables him to speak with authority, but I hold to the view which I have expressed. As for accounting for the difference by differences in sanitation, let me point out, first, that the British Army ideals of sanitation and cleanliness, and all the details of camp life, are not excelled by those of any other army. Colonel FOXTON -That is since the Japanese war. out that the Franco-German war took place' twenty-five years before the South African war, and yet, although the sanitary ideas of the time were a quarter of a century behind modern ideas on the subject, the loss, through illness, was only 29 per cent., while our loss was 56 per cent. the two wars took place were entirely dif ferent. as men, died from illness in large numbers able and learned member reconcile that fact with his theory?

I am referring, not to the measure introduced by the right honourable member, but to that introduced by the Reid-McLean Administration in 1904, under which the office of General Officer Commanding was abolished, and provision was made for the appointment of a Military Committee. A great mistake was made in doing away with the office of General Officer Commanding, to which responsibility must necessarily attach, and in substituting for it an irresponsible Board. In reply to a question put vesterdav by the honourable member for Wentworth, the Minister of Defence, according to the newspaper reports, said that the Military Board had no responsibility. such limitation. such a limitation. member's assurance. The Minister says that the Military Board has no responsibility in respect of matters of policy, and I intend to show that it is conducted without any sense of responsibility whatever. When the Defence Bill of 1904 was under consideration in this House, I said in the course of a speech which predicted most clearly all the evil times into which we have fallen, as reported in Hansard, volume XXIV., page 75""Uncler whatever scheme we may adopt, there must be one man who will have the final word to say. In an autocratic body like an army there must be a head man, one supreme control. Otherwise the .whole organization breaks down. If there is an organized body in the world, which is essentially autocratic in its character, it is an army. Therefore, I think, that as this scheme develops itself, we shall come back more or less to the old system, and that there will be some person-whateve r we choose to call him-wh o will develop into a Commander-in-Chief, and virtually take the position which the Commander-in-Chief occupies at the present time. I pointed out that it was impossible to control the affairs of an army by means of Committees, and made the following quotation from an article written by the Hon. J. W. Fortescue, and published in the Nineteenth CenturyAs to the War Office itself, past experience -seems to indicate pretty clearly the broad lines upon which reform should proceed. People talk vaguely of a Board and point to_the Admiralty, -merely adding the words mutatis mutandis. But mutatis mutandis is, in this case, a large order; the army is not the navy; and a Board of tomorrow's creation must be a very different thing from an ancient body with the tradition of more than two centuries of imperious independence. First, then, is a Commander-in-Chief necessary to the army? History teaches most emphatically that he is. Whenever the army has been without such a Commander-in-Chief-when ever, that is, its military government has been in the hands of other than a single military chief-it s discipline has suffered severely; and an army witliout discipline is naught. The present time is no exception. There are too many symptoms of the spread of slack discipline in the army at this moment, symptoms which a student of our military history can trace directly to the degradation of the Commanderin-Chief's position, and to the encroachments upon Ins independence. We are reverting to the state of things to which the Duke of York, with infinite industry and labour, put an end a hundred years ago. Honourable members will find that in that speech I prophesied to a large extent the condition of affairs prevailing to-day in connection with our military forces. I pointed out that the new system would discipline; no man knowing to whom he was to look for his orders, or to whom he would be responsible for mistakes. Those prophesies are being daily fulfilled. a commander-in-chief he was always being interfered with in this House. there was some one whom the Minister could make responsible for the state of chaos that had been brought about. At the present time to whom do we look if there is anything wrong with the forces? Colonel FOXTON -To the Minister. look? Colonel FOXTON -That is the point. thing is wrong, the Minister should be able to say to some person, "" You are responsible, and unless this state of affairs is altered, you will have to give way to some one capable of bringing about better conditions."" Every other Department has a permanent head who is responsible to the Minister; but what is the position in regard to our Defence Forces? At the beginning of the present session, and without any desire to obtain material for this speech., I asked the Minister of. Defence, who, in the absence of the Inspector-General, was the senior officer of the forces. He replied that the senior officer was Colonel Wallack, the chairman of the Military Board.

268,Mr Crouch,"Exactly. When anyday, however, he explained that Colonel Wallack was not the senior officer of the forces, that he was only the senior officer in charge of administration. As a matter of fact, the officer who has to direct the State Commandants, and who may reprove them, as I have known him to do, is their junior in many instances, and less paid than they. addressed by Colonel Wallack to a brigadier-general, reproving him for placing a man under arrest without authority. It was right' that such a reproof should be administered, but was it right that it should come, from a junior officer? We started with a Military Board, consisting of five members. creased to six by the appointment of L t Colonel Legge. very properly I think, that certain militia and volunteer officers should be continuously consulted, and the number of'members of the committee was increased to twelve. All the members of that Board are irresponsible. presumed to be aided by a representative of each branch of the Military Forces. I do not see how that could be: avoided. out to the House the composition of the Board, ancl its unwieldy nature. have already had some three or four directors of ordnance during the short history of this Board. who was director of ordnance, is an artillery man, ancl he was appointed to the Board because he was familiar with artillery work. My contention is that the members of the Board should receive the highest salaries, since they have to administer the affairs of the Department; but because that is not the position today Colonel Stanley, the artillery expert, has found it convenient to be transferred from the position of director of ordnance on the Board to a command which required him to deal almost entirely with infantry of which he knew nothing. He hacl spent most of his life cooped up behind big guns in a garrison, but as a member of the Board he had the power to appoint himself to an infantry position, and he has been made district commandant of Victoria, an office which carries with it a higher salary than does that of a director of ordnance. surely ought to. know something about artillery, but the present occupant of the position, whose engineering qualification I freely admit, would not pretend to know anything about big guns. tillery. Ordnance, which includes Artillery. I have seen a letter tillery under him. reason. Because he knows nothing about ordnance and artillery, he has to have under him somebody to teach him, and so Major Dangar, who does know something about artillery and ordnance, but who is not on the Military Board at all, That number was inis put there to teach the Director of Ordnance and Artillery his duties as Director Theni t was suggested, of Ordnance and Artillery. Could comic opera go further? A little while ago it was discovered that a certain gun had been landed on the wharf at Sydney, and hacl lain there unpacked for twelve months. When we endeavoured to find out who was responsible we were told that it was not the then Director of Artillery, or the previous Director of Artillery. In fact, nobody seemed to know. The previous Director of Artillery had been made Commandant of Western Australia, a position dealing almost I merely want to point entirely with infantry and rifle clubs, and al! sorts of trouble has arisen with the rifle We clubs through his advent there. That officer when rsked also seemed to know nothing about the unpacked gun. It lay idle on Colonel Stanley, the wharf when the Commonwealth Forces were actually wanting glins, and yet nobod v is held responsible; gun have cost? £1,700. vice improve that sort of thing? the question of command and control, and individual control would create responsibility. If the 100,000 or 200,000 men that it is now proposed to enlist in our forces have to go to war, they must be led. The honourable member for East Sydney stated the other day that there was no military officer in the Commonwealth who could lead them, as no Australian officer had undergone the necessary training. If the Minister is asked who is to be the Commander-inChief in time of war, he says it w ill be the A director of artillery Inspector-General.

He has not had the slightest experience in tactics or manoeuvres since his appointment in 1904. Therefore I and the men of my constituency, whom I am to ask to join the new force-and ' I believe they should join it and the men all over Australia whom other honourable members will ask to enlist, are to be led in time of war by a Commanderin-Chief who has not trained or led a man for four years ! rals led their armies froni behind. modern fights have been fought in some cases by men sitting on camp stools three or four miles behind the scene of action. A l though I have the greatest relspect for Major-General Hoad. and believe that he is the best man in the Commonwealth for his present position, he has not directed forces in the field since 1904. He ought to be given a chance in times of peace to learn to lead men. be offered the position of General Officer Commanding. If he shirks the responsibility, let the Minister get somebody else to take it , but there can be no question that the necessity for some one to -do the work exists. I come now to the District Commandants. They are responsible for their own districts, but I know of no District Commandant who has ever led or directed his men in time of peace. What they will do in time of war, only that day of catastrophe will disclose. torian District Commandant is said to be a good artillery officer, an expert in his profession, and one who would do good work behind the guns at the forts, but he has never drilled more than three companies in his life at infantry drill. to the Military Forcesof Victoria to put them under his charge, as happens under the present system of military control, seeing that during the fifteen months that have passed since he was appointed District Commandant he has neither led nor directed any men at all? shows that in addition to getting men to join the ranks, an effective control is required at Head-Quarters, where the spring of the whole of the military action of 'the Commonwealth must lie. Soi f the Minister finds that the Inspector-General will not take the position of General Officer Commanding, he should go down the list until he finds a man who is ready to take the Since he was responsibility. Then let that man prove himself. He may fail at first, and then succeed from the lessons of failure; or he may succeed straight away; but some one should have the opportunity of taking the position of Commander-in-Chief, instead of the Minister going to twelve men only, each of whom tries to pass the responsibility on to a Board which has neither heart, soul, nor body. That state of things should, and could, be cured at once. other Commandants ? The honourable memI thought all modern geneber should criticise the Sydney one. ticise any of the Commandants. I am credibly informed that the Inspector-General, in his unabridged report, strongly urged the Minister to retire one of them. The only reason why I spoke of the Victorian Commandant was that I knew his history as an artilleryman. He should have been retained as an artilleryman by being offered in that position a salary equal to that paid He should him as District Commandant. Under the present system the Government attempt to put square pegs into round holes. For the sake of saving £ 1 0 0 or £ 2 0 0 a year, they lose for the Commonwealth the benefit of a life's experience, by. taking an officer away from work for which he is well fitted, and putting him into a position which he cannot maintain with dignity to himself or with satisfaction to others. Another point which I wish to deal with is the fact that the Defence Department has not yet The Vicbecome a Federal Department, after seven years of Federation. The Minister., in one of his speeches, said that he wanted the Department to become one Federal Department instead of a number of State Departments. Yet, since FederaIs it not cruel tion, the only alterations that have been made in the administration of the Military Forces are that we have one Minister instead of six, while we have six districts, with six District Commandants, and a M i l i tary Board, which has replaced the six military and naval officers commanding. All this That is far from a satisfactory result, after seven years of Federation. One of the'objects of Federation was to bring about a Commonwealth defence system. That has not been achieved, because every district coincides exactly with the State boundaries.

There are many parts of Victoria that might be better controlled from New South Wales, whilst parts of New South Wales, which are connected by rail with Melbourne, and not with Sydney, could be much better administered from Melbourne.

Its necessities cannot be judged or met from Adelaide. We should have unification in the Defence Department, and wipe out the State lines. In distinctly Federal Departments such as this, there should be no grouping according to State boundaries. The present system is anti-Federal, and does a great deal of harm to the Military Forces. Instead of corps being regarded as New South Wailes, Victorian, or South Australian, they should all be Australian. ministered from Adelaide. is going to take one Federal action. some time ago to that effect. taken a most desirable step. In defence matters,I should like to sweep away the State boundaries altogether; and the State Commandants, instead of locally inspecting or administering from an office stool, would be far better concentrated in the Federal Capital, allowing the senior officers on the spot to do all that is necessary. The oniy reason for retaining the District Commandants is that the State Parliaments shall have their'proper display, and that there may be some men through whom communications can go to the Centra] Administration. We sliould have in the Defence Department a complete grip of the military work of the whoie Commonwealth, instead of letting it filter through the States in a way which, so far from assisting, rather retards Federal development. If we are to continue the present system of State divisions, it will, be far better to revert to State control, with centralization in, and absolute control from, the State Capitals. I believe we had a better grip of military work in Victoria under State control than we now have under Federation. The following, in relation to the Military Board was published in a newspaper1. Special efforts for the immediate instruction of officers in the preliminary steps to mobilisation. When I was an officer in the State forces, I knew where I would be stationed if war broke out. laugh at the interjection of the honourable member for Dalley, but that honourable triumphs over ignorance. The greatest feature of modern military work is that advance is by the spade-the spade is equal to the rifle-and if a spade is not available, then the men get behind a log. What the honourable member for Dalley means is that cover, either by throwing up earth or by getting behind a log, is most necessary in warfare. At any rate, I knew my particular "" hollow log "" was at Langwarrin, in order to defend the approach to Melbourne from that direction. The Senior Cadets, the Artillery, the Rangers, the Militia, and Light Horse all knew their stations, so that, if. war broke out, a definite mobilization was known to every man.

It would appear, then, that, since Federation, no scheme of defence has been communicated to a senior officer like the honourable member for Brisbane, who is in command of the Field Force; and that seems most extraordinary after four years of the Military Board. The next demand of the Militia members, and one which, I think, will be supported by the House, is2. The provision of large training grounds within easy distance of the metropolis. Is there anything of the sort now done in Australia? The other demands of the Militia ofiicers are3. The provision of more professional instructors. 4. An increase in the grants to institutions like the United Service Institution. 5. The free g if t or loan of the latest text books to all above the rank of sergeant. 6. The provision of special facilities for study for the benefit of rifle club members who are candidates for commissions. 7.

' I should like here to say that, in my opinion, it is a great mistake to be constantly extending the retiring age of officers in the Permanent Forces. There have always been kind Ministers who have hesitated to act harshly towards men who are entitled to no pensions, and, as a consequence, officers are allowed to remain on -the active list much longer than is the case in any European, army. In Australia, a colonel is called up to retire at sixty-two years of age, in Germany at forty-five, and in Great Britain, I think, at fifty. I know that Major-General Hutton was retired as soon as he was returned to England. the Minister admits that a wrong practice is permitted, simply because the Commonwealth is not prepared to face the situation. Here lieutenant-colonels should be retired at sixty, majors at fifty-five, and captains a.t fifty-three, and they do not receive pensions. In England, the age limit is insisted upon, because the authorities refuse to have an army of old men, mental and physical fitness being an absolute requisite for a soldier. In England, however, the authorities are prepared to face the position, and grant pensions or retiring allowances; and the Commonwealth will have to do the same, if we are to have satisfactory results.",39,Thomson Ther E Was Lead To Lack Of Responsibility And Lack Of

Mr"" CROUCH -When a man has earned the reputation of a Nelson, physical fitness is not so much demanded as his magnificent brain. I have not yet found any Lord Nelson in the-Australian Navy; but, when I do, I shall ask that he be exceptionally treated. As an example of how officers are selected, I may say that a man who was too short to be a gunner, ancl was, therefore, refused enlistment, was received as an officer a month afterwards. Another matter I desire to draw attention to is defective equipment.

323,Mr Crouch,"Yes. If it is providedunnecessary to inspect them as often as those in the other States were inspected, and on his asking me to account for this, I said that it was largely because Sir Frederick Sargood saw that good men were obtained to administer the Act at first. I think, too, that the system of having separate orderly rooms is largely responsible for it. We still have a Militia Force, and although it seems incongruous to have militia men parading with volunteers, I am of opinion that the militia system is a good one, because of the better control and discipline which it allows. When the New Zealand Inspector-General addressed us at Langwarrin last Easter Sunday, he said that he considered militia absolutely necessary, because of the superiority of the militia over the volunteer system. The militia men take home l'itfle or none of the money they receive. There are too many calls upon them-rifle-shootin g and other necessaries. only a reimbursement. fine, which the system gives, enables officers to control the men better. In my company, which has consisted of about n o men, the fines inflicted during the last seventeen pan v. years have not totalled jQi, and in other militia companies the state of affairs would be similar, because I do not feel that I have been particularly lenient. This is accounted for by the fact that the power to fine makes fining unnecessary. I do not know that this power will be absolutely needed with the proposed new system, because other penalties can be exacted. the Bill are ineffective and unjust where they apply to youths. later. In my opinion, they will be sufficient, because an officer can say to a man whose work does not satisfy liim, that he will not pass him as efficient,' in which case that man will have to do another year's work. The Bill seems to make provision for the continuance of the present system of drilling in large centres, and that I think an advantage. In Victoria we have to drill for three whole days, fourteen half days, and on twenty-four nights, which is regarded as the equivalent of sixteen full days. This drilling, thus spread over twelve months, is much more effective than a drill of eighteen consecutive days would be. The Bill provides for eighteen days' drill "" as prescribed,"" and in large centres of population, where there are orderly rooms, and the necessary instructional machinery, it would be a mistake to depart from the present system of training. One of the advantages of the present system is that it enables an officer to get to know the capacity of his men. Furthermore, the constant repetition of drills enables the instruction to sink into the mind of the man, and at each successive drill he advances in his knowledge of military matters. Colonel FOXTON -In between drills, the men have an opportunity to ponder upon what they have been told. tinuous system of drilling, officers would lose touch with their men to a great extent. At present, an officer meets his men frequently throughout the year. He gets to know and respect them and to feel that he can trust them, and the men trust the officer. Buti f I met my company only once a year, probably only one-third of those I drilled this year would present themselves next year, Australians being such a migratory people. Colonel FOXTON -The honourable member might have an altogether different cornmy men frequently, though, unfortunately, the average term of service is too short. On the range at Williamstown, meeting them in plain clothes, I get to know their trades, and learn all about their condition, and if a time of supreme effort for the defence of the country were to arise, I should know what each could do. I would know who are carpenters, and who can dig trenches best. At trench exercise, one man, who is, perhaps, a navvy, will do his work in one-fourth of the time set for the "" Task,"" while liis fellow, perhaps a draper's assistant, can hardly do the work at all. If I met my company only once a year, and then for eighteen days continuously, I should know much less about them, and knowledge of your men is the basis of good work. 'Therefore, I hope that ih Committee the Government will give effect to my suggestion in regard to the continuance of the present system of training in large centres of population. Of course, in the"" country a different system is to be followed, because of the way in which the men are scattered.

I repeat that no exemptions should be granted save by the direction of Parliament, and I hope that this provision will be struck out. It appears to me, also, that in this clause a very serious reflection is cast upon the senior cadets. The senior cadets are youths who have left school and who voluntarily pay for their uniforms, and devote themselves to splendid work for which they receive very little credit. The clause provides that the training shall be(a) from 12 to 18 years of age in the cadets or senior cadets; and (4) from iS to 26 years of age in the defence force. Why should not these youths be regarded as constituting part of the Defence Force? I should describe all members of the Cadet and Senior Cadet Forces as members of the Defence Force. I object to the phrasing of this provision, since it must be offensive to youths who do not like to be classed as mere boys. Colonel FOXTON -Ho w would the honourable member distinguish between cadets and senior cadets? all as members of the Defence Force. Then, again, it is proposed to insert in the principal Act the following provisionEvery person who evades or fails to comply with all the requirements of this part of this Act with respect to personal service in the defence force shall unless ""and until he has performed equivalent personal service as prescribed(a) be and remain ineligible for employment of any kind in the service of the need an elephant to pull them up to the Commonwealth; and (4) be and remain disqualified from being an elector of Members of the Parlia' ment; and {c) be and remain disqualified to receive an consider the third penalty-disqualificatio n invalid or old-age pension.

Let us say straight out that vidingthat those who f a i l to comply with it is to be compulsory, and apply it to the-Act with respect to personal service, every class. should be arrested as a deserter, sent to a central camp, ancl there made to do double service. This is a form of legislation that will apply largely to the poor. One of the penalties for failure to comply with the law is ineligibility for employment ih the service of the Commonwealth. Whoever heard of a rich man's son seeking employment in the Public Service. Then, again, another penalty is disqualification for an invalid or old-age pension. So a rich man's son is to lose his right to an old-age pension! The only penalty that will really be inflicted upon him is that of being debarred from electing a member of Parliament. Is it not absurd to apply these penalties to a thoughtless lad of eighteen ? If they are to constitute the punishment for failure to comply with the Act, the compulsory system will go by the board. Let us imagine what is the outlook of life, taken by a lad .of eighteen ? He is told, under this B ill , that unless he joins the National Guard, he will be ineligible for employment in the Public Service. As a matter of fact, at the present time a lad of eighteen is, to all intents and purposes, ineligible. Eighteen years is too late an age at which I would describe them to enter the service, so that the first of the proposed penalties will not apply. Then, again, those who evade the Act are to be disqualified from voting.

He is now seventy-nine years of age, and he writes to me as followsI had under me Sir George Turner, the Messrs. McKinley, and about 130 others, most of them since holding prominent positions. . . .

He goes on to sayI see that the cadets and others will be compelled to attend drill one hour a week for fifty-two weeks; in fact, the school attendance at.the public, private, and secondary schools does not exceed forty weeks, and how are they to attend fifty-two drills in that time? very hard to get the schools at the present time to grant him even one hour a week, and that he would rather the provision was made more elastic, as the ordinary school year consists of about forty weeks. suggestion of the honourable member for East Sydney, by putting in the words "" or their equivalent."" for East Sydney said he favoured compulsory cadet service, and that most lads at school were only too glad of the opportunity to learn drill instead of geography.

[39] I wish now to of 7s. 6d. still a number of clauses with which I wish to deal, and feel that I am giving the House good stuff, for I am applying personal experience to these clauses, and I hope that the information I am giving will have the effect of shortening subsequent discussion. There is too much left by the Bill to be prescribed by regulations. The Bill is a sort of blank cheque for the Administration. Only about four clauses are positive in themselves, and the whole of the heart of the work is left to be prescribed, and regulations are immovable. For the last seven years I have been trying in this Parliament to get certain reforms in the regulations, but have failed. As soon as things get to "" regulations "" the House is helpless. Some of the regulations actually defv the will of the House. Some people may think that this subject is to me like King Charles' head was to Mr Dick; but it is of great importance, because, at present, ability is prevented from finding its true position-a t the top-in the Defence Forces. The highest positions are given to men who are brought in from outside, because military ability is disregarded, and recognition is given to educational ability in directions which are absolutely useless in military life. On my motion, although it was slightly amended in conformity with a request made by Major-General Hutton to the then Minister, section 11 of the Defence Act of 1903 was passed as followsIn the first appointment of officers preference shall be given, in the case of equality of qualifications, to persons who have served in the Defence Force for three years without a commission. If that is not a positive direction that the ranker, who has served for three years in the forces without a commission, should have preference and priority, I do not know is deliberately broken. endorsement of another military ma^ who » has seen a lot of military service, and knows how heart breaking it is to men to find, when they reach a certain level, that they can rise no higher.

Colonel FOXTON -The argument does nui apply to the militia, because I can give the honourable member instances where men have risen from the ranks and become commissioned officers. at present, in my regiment my commanding officer insists on every man serving two years in the ranks before he becomes an officer. manent men cannot rise. make such a request, seeing that I brought the matter up on the last Estimates?

How can any man in the engineers, comply with those requirements? A man who is a sapper knows, so far as military engineering is concerned, ever so much more than do the men who come in from outside. From his first year, when he enlists as a lad of eighteen, he has been amongst torpedoes, electric lights, searchlights, and all the apparatus connected with military engineering. How is it possible for him to leave his employment and become an articled pupil for three years, or a bachelor of civil engineering at the University ? member quoting from? 68, on page 45 of the volume of regulations and standing orders which has been distributed to every member of the House. be attended to at once as the Minister is making a note of it. the Minister was sympathetic.

394,Motion (By Mr Deakin) Proposed,"is a matter which I deem to be sufficiently urgent and important to warrant my directing the attention of the Prime. Minister to it. It relates to the proceedings in connection with the Federal Capital Site. Can the Prime Minister inform the House whether the Senate will have the same opportunity of considering a resolution with regard to the various sites as this House has had? Will the Senate have an opportunity of endorsing the Yass-Canberra selection? I should also like to know whether the Prime Minister contemplates asking this House to express its view again ns to the area that we think desirable for ihe purposes of the Federal Capital, and also with reference to obtaining access to the sea ? If the Government have made up their minds on these points, it will be as well to have a statement with regard to them. If we obtain information now as to the opinion of the Government, it may have some influence upon the result. like to inquire of the Prime Minister whether it is a fact that the Government have purchased a steam yacht for the use of the Customs Department in New South Wales, and whether the yacht purchased was formerly the property of Mr Samuel Hordern? If so, what was the price paid for it, and did the Government obtain a proper estimate of its value? I consider that the Commonwealth Government, in purchasing n valuable piece of property like a steam yacht, should at least have obtained a new vessel. I should"" like to know the conditions of purchase. It appears to me that Mr Samuel Hordern, one of our wealthy men. is very fortunate in his method of getting rid of encumbrances, because he is now in possession of a new large electric launch, and was naturally glad to sell his steam yacht, especially if he couldfind a purchaser in the Government. I direct the attention of the Prime Minister to the danger arising from the growing number of Afghans within Western Australia, ancl their aggressive attitude' Country. Since then I have had additional towards the white population? Apparently their number is increasing-the returns published by the State Statist indicate as much. Recent occurrences show that these aliens are becoming a menace to the white settlers. I have here a newspaper published on the rim of north-west civilization, The Pilbarra Goldfields News, of Friday, nth September. It shows that an armed band of Afghans have practically "" held up "" a whole districtThe tiouble which arose some weeks ago with thc Afghans in connection with the carrying trade between Port Hedland ancl Marble Bar, and which was believed to have been satisfactorilysettled, assumed a serious aspect at the beginning of this week. The strike having been declared off, teams under contract to local storekeepers loaded between 40 and 50 tons of goods, ancl after being stopped at the Causeway by some other Afghans, eventually reached the 32-mile Well in safely. At that point a number nf Afghans came up and dispersed the whole of the camels, about 250 in number, and drove them into the bush. This action was followed up by threats of violence if any attempt should be made to take anv loading inland. The goods carried lo the spot named were allowed lo remain there. The attitude of the Afghans has been defiant throughout, though on one occasion they made it annear as if they had submitted, and it is alleged they have been purchasing rifles nnd ammunition, the object of which has now been openly shown, as about forty of their number, mounted nnd f u l ly armed, are on the road nnd declare their intention of enforcing their demands. That statement is corroborated by a telegram from the Resident Magistrate and Warden of the district, Mr Durrack, to the Premier of the State. It is stated further down in the same reportThe position is still very serious indeed. Several white and law-abiding Afghan teamsters' lives are in danger, besides ^10,000 worth of camels ancl £2,000 worth of foodstuffs. We trust Inspector Osborne will be instructed to take no uncertain steps to quell what is practically nn armed attempt to starve into submission inland residents by a handful of Asiatics. It is the duty of the State Government to maintain law and order; but we also may clo something by a more rigid policy of exclusion. Some time ago I drew the attention of the Prime Minister to the character of some of the immigrants who were coming out to Australia under contract to the Queensland Government, or under its auspices. ted indicated that insufficient care is taken in the selection of immigrants in the Old proofs that the statement made was correct, ancl that not merely one, but several shiploads had created disturbances on their arrival at Fremantle. I hope the Government will see that, in their desire for cheap labour, an undesirable class of people is not introduced at the instance of the sugar planters.",47,Volumes Of Hansard

I understand that the volumes have been ready for distribution for some weeks, although nothing has yet been done in the matter. Some honourable members .'wish to have their copies I am told that the cause of delay is that arrangements are being made for the simultaneous distribution of various. Commonwealth publications. It would surely be better that the volumes of Hansard should be distributed separately as soon as they are ready. We have not only had to wait during the recess, but well into the present session before receiving our copies. I should be .glad if the Prime Minister would give the House spme information as to when the copies will be available.

So far as I know the opinion of the House, I think it is unlikely that that provision in the present Seat of Government Act will be varied, at any rate, in more than a trifling degree.. Colonel FOXTON -Had not the area of900 square miles special reference to the Dalgety site? Mir. DEAKIN -No. The intention was to include, not only the site at Dalgety, but also the watershed, for which a liberal allowance was made.
