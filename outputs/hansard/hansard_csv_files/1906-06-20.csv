Ister Of Home Affairs, Without Notice, A","question relating to an answer which he gave yesterday in reference to the .possibility of holding the general elections in October next. Does not section 89 of the Electoral Act 1902 provide that writs for a general election are returnable within sixty days after the date of the issue of such writs? Does not section 5 of the Constitution provide that after any general election Parliament shall be summoned to meet within thirty days from the date of return of the writs? If so, would not the holding of a general election on any day in October next involve a meeting of the new Parliament before the end of the present year? Shoulda new Parliament meet before the end of 1906, will not the persons returned for the first time to the Senate at the ensuing election be precluded from sitting therein, seeing that section 13 of the Constitution provides thatThe service of a senator shall be taken to begin on the ist day of January following his election. On the other hnind, would it not be unconstitutional for senators whose terras expire on 31st December next, and who are not re-elected, to sit in a new Parliament to which they were not returned ? member to give notice of his question for to-morrow. vides for the contingency referred to by the honourable member for Coolgardie. a Senator enters upon the discharge of his duties on the ist January following the date of his election, nnd continues to hold office thenceforward for. a period of six years, though during the last year a new Senator may be elected.

The officer named has simply, with the concurrence of the Public Service Commissioner, been authorized to perform certain additional duty without any change or any increase of salary, and still retains the office and performs the duties of State Collector for New South Wales. powers under Acts are frequently thrown upon officers without change of status or increase of salary, and the general provisions of the Public Service Act do not apply to such cases.' Section3 states that the Act does not apply to an honorary officer appointed, i.e., one without pay, and section 8 (2) provides that any "" re-arrangement or improved method of carrying out any work which is expedient for the more efficient or convenient working of any Department"" may be made by the Governor General in Council. 2.

If the B ill , in proposing that the Government should intervene in the best interests of the public, is to be regarded as socialistic, I am afraid that I shall have to be classed as a Socialist, because, although I am not supporting every detail of the measure, I am heartily in sympathy with its broad principles. I listened with deep interest to the speech of the honourable member for North Sydney, whose utterances are always treated with respect, because it is recognised that he speaks with a wide knowledge of trade and commerce. The honourable member raised no serious objection to the portion of the Bill which deals with monopolies, which he divided into two classes-constructiv e and destructive. Although the honourable member devoted his attention more particularly to constructive monopolies, he did not for a moment argue that such were dealt with by the B ill . The Bill is directed against monopolies that are destructive of the best interests of the Commonwealth, and, consequently, the honourable member's objections could not be urged with any force against its provisions. The honourable member for Lang stated that if the Bill dealt with monopolies in Australia-and he went so fa r as to name one alleged monopoly-it would have his hearty support. As a matter of fact, the Bill deals with Australian as , well as foreign monopolies. clear, and therefore the measure should have the support of the honourable member.

I have no desire to take up the time of the House unnecessarily, but I wish to make my position perfectly clear, because some honourable members and a section of the press are only too ready to declare that whoever supports this class of legislation is a Socialist. is the very antithesis of Socialism. warned by the deputy leader of the Opposition of the dangerous results that might accrue from the present trend of legislation. I wish to say that if this B ill can be classed as socialistic legislation, I fear That is made perfectly that I shall be found approving of it . But I rose more particularly to say a few words in regard to the latter portion of the B ill , which relates to dumping. It is to this part of the measure that the objections of the honourable member for North Sydney and of others have been chiefly directed.

68,Mr Kennedy,"L as t night we wereupon to deal with men or corporations who deliberately set themselves up to evade the law?"" Some objection has been, raised by various speakers to the proposal to vest certain powers in the Minister. I say at once that I agree with the view expressed by the Attorney-General last evening, that if it be possible to secure the determination of the questions that may be raised under the measure by a judicial authority it will be much preferable to their decision by a Board. But to suggest that, because we cannot secure a judicial award, we should not attempt, by means of legislation, to deal with what may become an evil in the near future, is the acme of folly. If we cannot obtain a judicial award I am quite prepared to approve of the appointment of a Board-a t any rate, as an experiment. It is true that this is experimental legislation, but are we to sit idly and are confronted at the present time? We have been told by members of the Opposition that we must not interfere .witli trade or commerce. But in this connection I would ask "" Do not all Acts of Parliament interfere with the rights of some individual or other?"" Further, do the powers which it is now proposed to confer upon the Minister exceed those which are vested in him under our Customs Act, and which are deemed to be absolutely necessary? Are not the powers of prohibition and confiscation vested in him under that Statute? Are not similar powers conferred upon him in some instances under our Commerce Act? I do not think it can be urged for one moment that prevention is not much preferable to cure. What is being done at the present time? Reference has already been made to the harvester business, but that business does not represent the whole of the trading operations of Australia. How is it that in Victoria rhe necessity for legislation of this description was discussed in the State Parliament long before the advent of Federation ? thing is heard of it outside of Victoria? speck which mariners sometimes pass unnoticed, I venture to say that it has been heard of all over the world. of Australia has the honourable meinber heard of it ? go very far from my own home to step into the sister State of New South Wales, where I find that the people are more anxious for this Bill than they are in the district in which I reside. The same remark is applicable to She farming districts of Queensland. Throughout the whole civilized world, the rulers of the people are concerning themselves with this very question. The honourable member for Lang stated that if the Bill were to be applied to Australian operations it would command his hearty support. Last night he asserted that the manufacturers of Australian harvesters were selling their machines in Argentine at a less prise than that at which our own farmers could purchase them. I cannot understand by how any honourable member could make . i incur the risks with which we statement of that sort and allow it to stand alone. I cannot understand why he did not adduce some proof of his assertion, more particularly as he must be aware that lepresentative manufacturers of harvesters in Australia, have sworn before the Tariff Commission that the wholesale invoice price of their machines on board ship here is £ 7 2 15s. Thai is the sworn testimony of the manufacturers whose books are available for inspection. Under such circumstances, what is the use of the honourable member declaring that they are selling abroad for 5^70. His statement is another evidence of how far some persons are prepared to go-irrespectiv e of whether they are right or wrong-in order to establish their positions. levied upon harvesters in the Argentine. whatever to do with the hard facts of the case. whom the honourable member refers invoicing their machines to themselves, or to people who were purchasing at that price? voicing the machines to themselves. visable for the honourable member to wait till the official evidence taken by the Commission is available.

I will give one illustration in proof of my statement. I venture to say that there is no Australian farmer carrying on operations upon a large scale who will not admit that, but for the inventive genius and enterprise of the local implement manufacturers, his industry would' never have assumed anything like its present proportions. Wheatrgrowing would not have been possible in the northern district of Victoria, and in the western and southern districts! of New South Wales, but for the enterprise and genius of the Australian implement manufacturers. nately, few of these individualsI venture to sav none of them'-hav e yet become millionaires. I have no special brief on behalf of the Australian manufacturer, but I speak of things as I find them, and I belong to a class whose well-being up to the present time has been dependent upon the Australian implement makers. going on to-day with regard to the disc plough? It is a recent innovation in Australian farming Australian invention ? plough is. We had ai plough brought from America, which was known as the Spalding Robbins plough, but to-day we have a disc plough purely of Australian manufacture, and one which is as far removed from the original disc plough as is the binder from the old reaping machines. The Australian Australian invention? I suppose that the honourable member will want a duty imposed upon that presently. only with the position of the Australian implement manufacturers, so far as ploughs T h a t is not the are concerned.

But, as a matter of fact, we ber know that parts of the disc ploughs manufactured in Australia have to be imported ? about disc ploughs as does the honourable member. I am not quite sure that he could distinguish between a disc plough and an up-to-date cow-bail. fore the honourable member did. are so bad, why should we fear their competition ? to date has done no harm. Finding that their disc ploughs have not met with the approval of the Australian fakmers, what have they done during the last six months ? They have gone round, and; for experimental purposes, have bought up the ploughs of all the leading makers in Victoria, and Unfortuthe makers of implements in the other States may be represented in their purchases also. The manufacturers of these implements have them covered by patents in Australia. I may say here that, so far as I know, the International Harvester Company have taken no active part in this business, but the Verity Plough What is Company of America have taken a very keen interest in it . Certain Australian implements have been subjected to tests alongside of American disc ploughs and other Australian disc ploughs. They have taken also what are known as the AusThe modern disc tralian stump-jump ploughs, and have tested them. Specialists from America, representing the Verity Plough Company, which covers the business to a great extent in the United States, have been conducting these trials, and what is the result?

91,Mr Kennedy,"The competition upare to-day shipping to America the best of our Australian ploughs, and for what purpose? Is it a question of philanthrophy with them? Honourable members are aware that it is a question of money. It is not done with a view to bettering the position of the Australian farmer, but with a view to .controlling the market here in their own interests. I am not prepared to say that, per1 haps, for a few years, when their ploughs come back here, we mav not get the benefit of some concessions in rates and prices, but I have sufficient experience to know that that will be eventually at the expense of the users of the ploughs. other instances. that American companies, who have harvesters on the market here to-day, and have their agents touring Australia, are doing business at a loss in the interests of the Australian farmer? We know quite well that if it were possible for them to crush the Australian manufacturer out of the market we should experience no philanthrophy at the hands of the American importer. It is to meet such conditions as I have described that Part III . of this Bill is absolutely necessary. We have seen what has been done In America, in Canada, and in New Zealand in dealing with this matter. The honourable member for Franklin stated that only the people of Victoria desired the passing of laws against dumping. able member whether be had heard these complaints in anv other State than Victoria. had. ony of New Zealand has made an attempt to deal with this matter by legislative enactment. ber favour a like attempt here-referrin g these matters, not to a board of rivals, but to a board representing everybody in the community ? in the discussion at the present time. point. detail. lation to prevent clumping that I am attempting to deal at the present time. we affirm the principle of the measure, the manner in which it is to be given effect is a matter of detail. In New Zealand, effect has been given to the principle, though not exactly on the lines of this Bill. Zealand measure may be said to be of a tentative character, as it has been the policy of New Zealand to feel her way in all legislation. Ardent advocate as I am of this class of legislation, I do not anticipate that the first effort of this Legislature to deal with the question will be entirely effective, because I know that the skill and ingenuity of those engaged in trade will be directed to its circumvention. That has been proved in America and in Canada, and it will be proved here. It is only by making a first step that we can find out what our powers are, and how It has been so in best to deal with such matters.

I am aware that some delay occurred at the outset, and that the Commission was constituted for some time before it commenced to take evidence. I hope that, irrespective of where they may -sit in this House, and of fhe fiscal views they mav hold, honourable members will devote their best efforts to perfecting this legislation.

In the interests of the consumer, producer, andi manufacturer, who will be affected by a B ill of this importance, I think that the measure should have received greater consideration at the hands of an expert committee, who might have been called in to advise the Minister. The duty will be forced upon honourable members on this side of going through the Bill line by line in Committee, to make it a workable and practicable measure. I The resent this, because I consider that such a responsibility is one which the Minister should not have imposed upon the House. I suppose there are few honourable members.

I believe that the Attorney-General had at one time a notice of motion on the business-paper for the appointment of a Committee of Trade and Finance, and such a committee might very well have dealt with a question of this kind.

122,Mr Knox,"I am glad of the honorof the commercial legislation which has been submitted to us has been in the direction of building round Australia a great wall to keep out importations; but the chief result of such legislation must be to force up prices. We .have heard a good deal about the harvester trust, and I do not propose to deal with that complicated question at the present time; but the workers will find that they have made a serious mistake if they insist that the people of the Commonwealth shall forego the advantages which would arise from the legitimate rivalry and competition of the world's merchants. Then, again, the provisions of the Bill are too wholesale in their character. A measure dealing with specific cases of injustice and unfair competition would have had the support of members of all parties. In Committee we must endeavour to substitute for the jury provided for in the Bill derive the f u l l fruits of his labours.

The Bil l which was introduced last session, and whicli was read a second time without much opposition, was allowed to reach that stage because many honourable members were in favour of its general principles, and were under the belief that we should be in possession of the report of the Tariff Commission before the matter was finally dealt with. I desire that the representations of the Tariff Commission should receive favorable and serious consideration. The action of the Government in introducing this measure has alreadv greatlv disturbed the mercantile community, and people are beginning to wonder why the Government should bring forward uncalled-for legislation of this kind. I am authorized to say,' on behalf of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, that they do not in the slightest degree approve of tyrannical trusts and combines such as exist in the United States. I cannot conceive of any man standing here and daring to say that he would oppose legislation that would prevent the growth of such monstrous conditions. The fear enter[16] tained in regard to this Bill, however, is that the exclusion of foreign goods will lead to the creation of dangerous monopolies within the Commonwealth. It is true that under the Bill power is proposed to be taken to deal with internal monopolies, but unless the States authorities f a l l into line we may be powerless to restrain large trading combinations which may be brought into existence as the result of the exclusion of foreign goods. I am fullv acquainted with the early history of the harvester industry. The action of Canadian manufacturers in pirating the Australian invention is to be resented to the fullest extent, and I have always been an advocate of retaliation so far as that matter is concerned.

It is quite conceivable that a small Australian manufacturer, who produced inferior -goods at a high price, might, by his representations, secure the exclusion of first-rate low-priced goods, to the great detriment of the consumers of Australia. fs the object of the Bill. I decline to believe that any practical men would knowingly introduce legislation that would have any such effect. Still, under the measure as it now stands, there is a. danger such as I Have indicated.

I have received from Adelaide the following statementIn the opinion of this Chamber the Bill is calculated to place serious difficulties and dangers in the way cf import trade for the protection-apar t from the effect of the Customs Tariff-of particular Colonial industries. It was further resolved to point out that the Bill makes Australian traders the scapegoat of the world's present and future trusts, and that while legislation cannot destroy such trusts, Australian traders are charged with all risks of doing business with them. Further, I am instructed to inform you that, in the opinion of this Chamber, the matter of trusts and legislation for their suppression should be thoroughly investigated and reported on by a committee of commercial experts before such provisions as are contained in the Anti-Trust Bill are passed. Strangely enough, I received to-day a letter from the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York. I hope that no members of the New York Chamber were associated with the scandalous work that was going on in Chicago. I notice that the vice-presidents of the chamber include Mr Whitelaw Reid, Mr Chauncey M. Depew, and many others whom I do not know. These are men of high moral standing in the United States.of America. They sayIn reply to your favour of. 15th December, asking informaiion concerning the laws of the United States for the repression of commercial trusts, I would state that this subject has received a large amount of attention during the last fifteen or twenty years, and that in 1S90, the Congress of the United States enacted what is known as the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, of which I enclose a copy. This law, as you will see, is extremely drastic and sweeping in character, and if it had been enforced literally, would have seriously embarrassed the development of industry in the United States. It is certain that the Sherman Act has not been effective in coping with the existing condition of affairs. I have been asked by some honourable members to state my objections to the Bill. Under it, if two persons agree not to sell their goods at less than a certain price their action constitutes a restraint of trade. That being so, the Bill should also apply to individuals who agree not to sell their commodity-that is, 'their labour-belo w a cer[*6]-2 tain price. If they agree to accept less wages under any circumstances or conditions, surely the provisions relating to restraint of trade should apply to them? labourer."" -is the honourable member to see fair conditions apply to the labourer. good wages upon some of his claims . 1 orable member for Maranoa agrees with me. I am sincerely desirous that the worker shall obtain the full reward for his labour, but I do not wish to see legislation introduced which will eventually inflict injury upon him. Human nature will remain the same until the end of the chapter, and legislation will not alter it. why put the burglar in gaol ? mination of what constitutes unfair competition is left to a jury. What can .an ordinary jury know of such an intricate subject, and one familiarity with which would demand a Lifetime of study? A lthough I am interested in quite a number of industries, I would not for a moment regard myself as qualified to express an opinion upon such a matter. Again, competition is fo be considered unfair as a matter of law if it would "" probably result"" in the lowering of wages. Consequently, a manufacturer has only to say that he must reduce the wages of his employees, and the competition of the foreigner will at once be deemed unfair, and the importer of his goods will be rendered liable to a penalty. We have already declared in our Immigration Restriction Act that we are not going to allow outside labour to come into competitioni with Australian labour. We have laid down that principle. I quite admit that it is iust as desirable that that principle should be applied to the results of labour as to the labourer himself. I would further point out that I f any article is produced by a new or im: proved method, necessitating' the alteration or abandonment of the existing system of. production in Australia, that competition thereby becomes unfair.

He analyzed the Bill in such a way that, to my mind, it is quite unnecessary for any honourable member to debate it exhaustively.

I orable and learned gentleman, in saying that, was defining the exact position, but if it is intended to deal with extraordinary conditions, and if any attempt to alter the Tariff must receive the approval of this House surely, after the admission of the Ministry through the Attorney-General, we have a right to ask that before the good's of any alleged monopoly corporation are prevented from coming into this country the matter shall be dealt with by resolution of this House? ber serious in making that suggestion ? I shall give more fully the reasons why I think it is desirable that that should be done. the year round. I started with, and that is an earnest protest against the manner in which these great commercial measures are thrown upon the table to be fought out, and against imposing upon honourable members the obligation to make them workable, and bring them into line with the conditions known to exist, so that they may not dislocate the whole of the. trade of the community. I am sorry that the honourable member for Maranoa and I should have come into conflict, but the honourable member is aware that there is no personal animus between us. I am not prepared to vote against the second reading of this Bill, believing, as I do, in the principle^ which underlie it ; but I have given some reasons, and I shall give more in Committee, why many alterations require to be made in it. I again deplore the fact that, instead of securing the advice and assistance of competent persons before introducing such a Bill the Minister has thrown it upon the table, and left us to wrangle .about it and put it into shape. Much irritation and confusion might be averted if , before submitting such measures the Government secured competent advice upon them, and were not so much disposed to submit them, as I venture to believe this Bill has been submitted, in order that it may be held up as a placard for the two purposes I have indicated. 4 9 last session on a measure almost identical with this, and I do not therefore propose to detain the House at so great a length as I should probably do if this were the first quite recognise that the honproposal of the kind submitted to Parliament. It. seems to me that there are a few aspects of the general question involved which may be pertinently referred to at the present moment. Perhaps one of the most interesting features of the debate that has gone on for the last two days has been the attitude assumed towards this measure by our honourable friends, who have dubbed themselves the "" Anti-Socialist Party."" They have continually asseverated, until, I suppose, they have at least succeeded in convincing themselves of the truth of the assertion, that this is not a socialistic.measure, and that it is quite reasonable for the anti-Socialist to support a measure of this description. To my mind that attitude predicates either that the honourable gentlemen who make up the "" AntiSocialist Party"" have not studied the economic difference between the position of the individualist, and that of the collectivist, or that they are dubbing themselves by a name to which they are not entitled. What becomes of all the eulogies of private enterprise indulged in by the right honourable gentleman who lead's the Opposition during fhe past few months?

I ] . _ I Spoke,"people that to, impede the development of the individual, to put shackles upon the people's enterprise, is to work dire injury and disaster to the State as a whole. He has told us that our position in the world to-day, the present condition of civilized man, and his advance from savagery, is due to private enterprise working through competition, the friction of mind against mind. That is the right honourable gentleman's explanation of the condition of things we witness to-day, as compared with the state of things existing a few hundred or a thousand years ago. the right honourable gentleman and those supporting, him have been eulogizing the free play of private enterprise and competitive institutions. That is the correct attitude undoubtedly for a convinced individualist to assume. But to-day we find that honourable gentlemen opposite have gone back upon that position, and now admit that this much-laud'ed private enterprise is capable of producing such evils as constrain even them, reluctant as they are to interfere with anything of the sort, to attempt to put some regulatory law into force, so that the interests of the community may be conserved. I say that that is an abandonment of, at any rate, the theoretical position which those honourable gentlemen are supposed to occupy. abuse in everything. ber admits that it is a proper thing in some circumstances to use the power of the State to restrain the unscrupulous private enterpriser, then he has no right to call himself an "" anti-Socialist."" He may pose, properly enough, as a man who holds that the Labour Party, or any other party in the State proposes to go too far in the direction of Socialism, proposes too rapid progression in that direction, but he cannot logically and legitimately claim to be an "" anti-Socialist."" our honourable friends opposite are gradually slipping away from politicaJ virtue, and so steadily falling from grace, that directly we shall probably discover that the only anti-Socialists left amongst uis are the honourable and learned member for Parkes, and perhaps the honourable member for Wilmot. General, there has been none since Adam opinion that the Attorney-General was quite correct in saying that there have been very few individualists, strictly speaking, in the history of the world. For the sake of humanity, I am gladi to be able to say that there were a vast number of the people who have taken a leading part in the direction of the world's affairs who have been to a greater or less degree Socialists, in that they have believed in using all the machinery of government, and all the resources of civilization, for the protection of the All through, weak against the strong. After all, that is ^what Socialism resolves itself into, it seems to me. However, I do not intend to debate that any further tham to say that it does seem to me a highly illogical attitude for honourable members opposite to aissume in consenting to support the passage of any measure of this description, no matter how they qualify their support. they know they are in a minority. quite a new reason for the failure to object, and one that I should have expected least of all from the honourable member for Wilmot. does not yet know whether I shall divide the House on this question.

It has been argued in connection with this measure that there are to-day no trusts in Australia. The right honourable gentleman who leads the Opposition only recently said that there were no trusts in Australia, or, if there were any, that they were so insignificant as to be utterly unworthy of serious attention at the present moment. I do not wish to pursue at any length even that aspect of the question, because during last session I instanced the shipping combine, which, in my opinion, is playing a part more disastrous alike to producers and consumers in Australia to-day than is any other single",27,William Lyne Th E Honourable And Disastrous Litigation These Opinions

281,Mr Watson,"What has been the exwaggons in some localities. The American Tobacco Company has already aggressively taken much of the retail trade away from its former patrons. How long before the other trusts will follow the example of these monopolies? That is the condition of things existing in America rb-day, according to two well known and highly reputable authorities. Surely that fact does not argue that any very great result will flow from legislation of this character. The honourable member for Parramatta said yesterday that, in his opinion, a great dealI am not sure whether he said the major part-of the wealth aggregation of the United States was due to the existence of patent monopolies. seen it stated that it was so. be opposed to all the experience of America as it is related by those who pose as publicists and as leading authorities. There the position ig that, because of the uncontrolled efforts of private enterprise, practices have been rendered possible which would never be tolerated in communities such as ours. The control of different avenues of industry-irrespectiv e altogether of fiscal conditions-ha s enabled a few people to build up gigantic monopolies, but these, so far as I can ascertain, are in the main quite free from patent monopolies as they are ordinarily understood. these trusts have a great manv patents of one sort or another. trust as an instance in point. It has not a patent in the purchasing of cattle or in the packing of meat orable member know ? upon the subject, which was written by Mr Russell, and I base my statement also upon a conversation which I had with him in Sydney a few months ago. He informed me that the operations of the beef trust consisted merely in manipulating the market. Similarly, the operations of the oil trust have been assisted by its power to manipulate the railway rates. It has no patent rights, but it bought the legislators. honest politician in America done more to create trusts than has anything else ? other way about. The existence of people with large private interests at stake, and of wealthy companies which desire to purchase concessions, was the direct cause of the corruption of the Legislature The honourable member for Kooyong-althoug h he said that he would vote for the second reading of the Bill spoke against the general idea underlying legislation of this character, and quoted, in opposition to the Sherman Act, a statement by Mr Chauncey Depew. That gentleman was eulogized by him as a representative .American of high standing. Perhaps it is news for the honn orable member to learn that, a little time ago, Mr Chauncey Depew was compelled to return"" disgorge,"" some people would call it-som e hundreds of thousands of dollars which he had improperly taken from the Equitable Life Insurance Company. Here is what one American paper-accord ing to the Cosmopolitan Magazine of March last-wrot e in regard to that gentleman : "" Depew stands convicted of being a corrupter of the law makers of the commonwealth,"" and "" had the audacity to cajole or bribe the chief magistrate of the State into endorsing one ot the greatest frauds ever perpetrated."" As a result of the public inquiry which was held into the transactions of the Equitable Life Insurance Company, Mr Depew was compelled to disgorge some hundreds of thousands of dollars which he had improperly appropriated, and I do not think that much reliance can be placed upon the denunciation of legislation of this character by such a man. for Kooyong. but did not agree with its contents. dently under a misapprehension.

The Court decided in a case where fhe articles of agreement of a company gave some indication of a purpose to monopolize, that its operations were against the law, and then other companies, working just as much injury to the people, gave no such indication of their purpose, and thereby escaped scot-free. That is a condition of things which we should endeavour to meet in the framing of the provisions of this measure. have gone a little beyond that. tions here, issued some months ago, by a very competent man, which cover cases of the character I have indicated of so recent a date as' up to the end of last year. I shall have pleasure later in showing them to the Attorney-General. 1 have thought it right to call attention 10 fhe deficiencies in the Sherman Act, which are continued in this measure, but whether it is possible to remedy them. I am exceedingly doubtful. I know of no measure we can draft which would be sufficiently comprehensive to get at a combine of the character of the beef trusts within our own borders. If such a measure can be suggested I shall be very glad to see the way to deal with such combines pointed out. There is another part of fhe measure -Part"" HI . , referring to dumping-whic h I can support, and from which I believe some good will result. I do not wish to go into the whole question of free trade and protection, but I will say that I was glad last night to hear the deputy leader of the Opposition admit that there can be dumping of a character which would be ruinous to the industries and welfare of the community. The honourable member did not say that dumping had arrived at that stage yet in Australia, but I understood him to admit that he could conceive of dumping of that character. That being so, I think it will be admitted that there is not the same degree of interference with I refer to the diffifiscal matters in this measure as some honourable members seemed at first to imagine. I do not assume that the honourable member for Parramatta would utter such sentiments if he thought they would injure his faith in free-trade, which I know has been very strong for a long time past. But even if the measure involved the whole fiscal issue, I should stilli say that we are justified in making some effort to save our industries from unfair competition from abroad. where competition ceases monopoly begins. evidence of a monopoly amongst our local manufacturers I sthall be one of the first to take any step that will dispose of that monopoly in the interests of the people.

I trust that this collective My definition of a Socialist is one who believes in and advocates Socialism, and I define Socialism as collective ownership. No other test of Socialism is known to any writer of standing or. the subject, and in support of that assertion I could quote the statements of socialistic lealders of thought, beginning with Lassalles, and coming right down, through Karl MarxI 'am, endeavouring ;to and others, to the leader of the Labour Party, who, in a letter which he recently wrote to a correspondent, appearing in this month's Australian Review of Reviews, The condition of things to which says that, to his mind, Socialism means anything intended to improve the social condition of the community. If that be so, all legislation is socialistic, because all legislation aims at improving the social condition of the community.

The Labour Party of Australia has stated its objective to be the nationalization of monoWe, at polies, and the extension of the industrial and economic functions of the State, but while adopting the means which would be used by the Queensland Labour Partv to attain Socialism, it leaves out the Socialist's definition of the objective.

To use the word "" Socialist'' in any other way is an abuse of terms, and the device that has been adopted of adding two or three letters to the term, and making it ""socialistic,"" does not make any difference.

It must tend towards the socialistic objective that Socialism which we, on this side of the House, are united in opposing.

Now, further remarks are being made in reply to the honourable member for Bland, and, so far as I can see, Socialism will be opened up for discussion. I cannot permit of anything of that kind. All that I can allow the honourable and learned member for Corinella to do is to make an incidental reference to the argument of the honourable member for Bland that the Bill is a socialistic measure.

It is because I believe that we have in Australiawhat are virtually monopolies, and because threats have been made to injure Australian interests by means of dumping to be present in Australia-that I say that it is not only the right, but the duty, of this Parliament to deal with these matters.

374,Mr Mccay,"Most undoubtedly I do.orable and learned member could sink so low. political ideas are at such a low level that most people have to stoop to look at them. The Bill deals with two entirely different subjects. It aims at achieving two entirely different results, and it strikes at two entirely different evils. Except for the convenience of procedure, it would have been better to deal with these subjects in two separate Bills. Part II . of the measure relates to the repression of monopolies; that is to isay, it aims at preventing prices from being raised to the detriment of the consumer. Part III . deals with dumping, the object of which is to temporarily lower the selling price, to the detriment of the local producer, though the ultimate object is to furnish an opportunity for the creation of a monopoly which will result in increased prices, to the detriment of the consumer. But the immediate evils to be dealt with are entirely different, and the subject inevitably divides itself into two parts, which have to be separately discussed, and viewed from an entirely different stand-point. Part II . of the measure, which proposes to restrain monopolies, is based on the Sherman A:t, which, as has been pointed out, hais not achieved its object as fully and as entirely as, I presume, was hoped by those who introduced it. It has, however, made the career of monopoly in the United States a much more difficult one to pursue. It has made the assured existence of monopolies much more difficult, because, but for the corporation law of New Jersey-whic h is the biggest enemy the Sherman Act has to fight in the United States-the methods pursued prior to the putting into operation of the Act would have been brought to an end through the application pf the Act to the circumstances of each case. Even as it is, monopolies in the United States have been driven back to a large extentI do not say entirely-to their original forms of pools, or secret understandings, which, while they are just as effective as the more definite and legal forms -of are an end through the falling away of one or more members of the combination. So that, even if the Sherman Act had done no more than this, its existence would have been justified, although there would be no ground for saying that no other I did not think the honlegislation was necessary. I would remind honourable members that, whilst trusts in the United States have worked great injury to the people, their history is not very encouraging to trust-mongers. A very large number of them have come to grief, and have caused great financial loss to those who have brought them into existence, or who have endeavoured to engineer them. Most trusts that have not been held together by legal obligations between the members have sooner or later failed to keep intact, and have consequently failed to carry out the maleficent objects which they have endeavoured to attain. If this measure renders the course of the trust promoter more difficult, and precludes him from relying on those associated with the trusts to carry out their bargain, it will be justified, provided always that in endeavouring to meet an ev.il which is not very great in Australia, but which mav become greater, we do not create greater evils. We must always remember that it is of no use to apply a remedy if it is likely to prove worse than the disease. Consequently, in connection with Part II . of the B ill , honourable members have to consider whether it threatens to produce evil results which would be worse than those now apprehended. If we can answer that question in the negative, the second point upon which we have to satisfy ourselves is whether the proposals are sufficient to secure the object aimed' at. There is an intermediate course open to us. We may say that the B ill requires modification in order to avoid apparently mischievous results. I do not believe that Australian producers or consumers have suffered very seriously from trusts up to the present time. To institute a comparison between the present state of affairs in Australia and the conditions that have existed at any time during the past twentv years in the United States .is to bring into contrast a comparatively small evil and a very large one. A t the same time, to use the figure of speech adopted by an honourable member opposite, it is desirable to catch the tiger and shackle him while he is young. If there is a existence whilst they continue, combination in Australia which, in the f a r ' more liable to come to words of the B ill , is in restraint of trade or commerce, or is operating to the detriment of the public, it is our duty to see that it ceases to have such effects. I think that the words "" to the detriment of the public,"" which have been inserted in this measure, remove many of the objections",40,William Lyne Th E Honourable And Disastrous Litigation These Opinions

When I was drawn off the track by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, I was about to remark that we have to consider whether this clause will meet the evil that we fear, and also whether it will create evils which we have to apprehend. I am not prepared to say that this portion of the measure meets with my unqualified approval. Like the next part, it requires some amendment, but ir. my opinion these matters can be better discussed in Committee. In spite of the addition which makes this part of the Bill less wide than is the Sherman Act, in its terms and in its application, it is undoubtedly much wider than is that Act. There are those who will welcome that fact, and others who will view it with modified approval, because they do not know exactly how fa r I do not think so. I it will carry them. I do not think that I should serve any useful purpose by discussing the clauses in 'detail at the present moment. So far as I am concerned. I supplied had inbelieve that we have reason to fear that having monopolies-eve n if they do not exist now-ma y spring into existence in Australia at no distant date to the detriment of the public, and this Parliament in exercising the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution in respect of trade and commerce, is bound to see that it does regulate commerce in such a way that the public do not suffer. But to call such action socialistic is the wildest misuse of It would not apply to a terms, and one would not need to take notice of it if the statement were not so persistently repeated in quarters where better knowledge should certainlv prevail.

I cannot agree with the leader of the Labour Party that Tariff issues, at any rate, cannot be raised in connection with this part of the measure. could that, be If worse beer were supTariff-that is all.

Government of any intention to pass this legislation for the purpose of producing results to which it could not induce this House to subscribe upon straight-out Tariff proposals. But the Minister of Trade and Customs was very unfortunate-to say the very least of it-in the expressions he used in moving the second reading of this Bill, because if Tariff issues have been raised in connection with it, he is the gentleman who is responsible for having raised them. tionist utterances upon that occasion, I certainly would have thought-ha d I not known otherwise-that he was speaking of proposals to increase duties in the Tariff. I do think that in the course of his remarks he did -intentionall y or unintentionally1 bring the question of the rates of the Tariff duties before the minds of honourable members. However, I do not believe that the Government have brought forward this part of the Bill for that purpose. that dumping, as we understand it that is, dumping at unremunerative prices for the express purpose of destroying local competitors, and thereafter dumping at highly remunerative prices-is threatened in Australia, and that such a practice as that cannot be met by ordinary Tariff remedies. But I do not believe that it will occur in many cases. So far as I know, it has not occurred at the present time. Perhaps the Minister will correct me, ""if I am not as familiar with the facts of Australian commerce in this respect as he is. I would ask him whether there are any cases within his cognisance in which dumping has taken place to the substantial detriment of Australian industries? certainly. honourable members are entitled to have in their possession. we are justified in taking more strenuous steps and incurring more risks to cope with it than would be the case if it were not 1 urgent and pressing.

The proposals in this part of the Bill, in effect, set out that gentleman is now referring, not to injury if the Comptroller-General thinks that any Australian industry is likely to suffer from any importation that is likely to take place, he may so report to the Minister. That officer may call it dumping, and the Minister may then appoint a Board to determine if it is dumping. Should it be decided that dumping is taking place, and that Australian industries are likely to suffer therefrom, the Government may prohibit further importation of the goods in question. In this connection, I should like the attention of the Attorney-General. I wish to know whether he thinks that the reference to injury to industry which is contained in Part III . of the measure would be satisfied-so far as proof is concerned-if it could be shown that one manufactory engaged in a particular industry was suffering from the importation which was taking, place, Or whether it would be necessary to show that all the factories in that industry were suffering. twenty factories making jam tins in AustraliaI select jam tins because they have never so far been a live subject in this House, and have never given rise to keen party feeling-and that a foreign trust starts to send jam tins into Australia and secures so much of the market as to compel one of the smaller factories in Australia to stop work, would that be dumping within the meaning of this part of the Bill? should rather think not. would the Board say? that would be an injury to the industry. get at; and, having secured that answer from the Attorney-General, I direct the honourable and learned gentleman's attention to the fact that the vagueness of this part of the Bill in thati respect is undesirable. What is ""injury to an industry""? We should in some way give the Board, or whatever the authority dealing with such matters is to be, some guide as to what is to be regarded as "" injury to an industry,"" because otherwise I think that the Board would probably regard the instance I have given as one involving injury to the indusforeign trust would certainly have the effect of throwing Australian workers out of employment. to an industry, but to unfair competition. That is another matter, and is only one ingredient of what might be "" injury fo an industry."" ingredient, but I have mentioned that which I think relevant to the particular inquiry I am making. orable and learned gentleman's question. is the preservation of industries advantageous to the Commonwealth. In the instance I have quoted one-twentieth of such an industry is destroyed by means of importations, and the Board might say: "" We are afraid that the other nineteeni-twentieths will be destroyed hereafter, and therefore we say that this kind of dumping is forbidden by the B ill , "" and the Government might consequently prohibit importation! altogether in that particular line. and learned gentleman's question to be practically-I s one factory synonymous with the whole industry? injury to an industry begins by so small an interference, I still say thab there is a weapon here that can be used practically to prohibit almost all importations, and that would be an unfair thing for any one, however ardent a protectionist he might be, to propose. learned gentleman does not think that the Board would do such a thing?

I say that under this part of this Bill it is highly possible, and even reasonably probable, that results just as important as an alteration of a duty in the Tariff may follow^ and if this part of this Bill is to be applied in its present form, then, after a decision that dumping is going on has been arrived at by a judicial tribunal, it ought to be by a resolution of both Houses of this Parliament that such a decision should be put into operation. If the increase or diminution of a duty by i per cent, is a power which Parliament will not part with, surely the imposition of prohibition, which is the imposition of a duty of any percentage one pleases, should in some way be an act of Parliament, and not an administrative act? Otherwise, I say most unhesitatinglv that there is a temptation to persons interested to endeavour to corrupt an honest Minister, and that is something to which no Minister, however honest and incorruptible, should be exposed. That is a danger we do not desire to create, and it is the kind of danger which does lead to wrong-doing. that I think the Canadian system of dealing with dumping, or threatened dumping, The honoris safer and more reliable than is this, but I shall not quarrel with the Bill on that account. duties. duty on a particular article which is below a fair market price. There are details of this Bil l with which I do not at all agree. I am dealing now only with general principles, and I do not wish it to be understood that I think the humblest member of because I am not criticising particular clauses I agree with everything in the B ill as it stands. I think that the Canadian system which enables the State to get the benefit by means of the duty to the extent of the difference between the dumping price and the fair market price is a very wholesome corrective which would operate very satisfactorily, and it is free from the If the honourable and dangers that are to be found in this measure. If dumping were really taking place, the dumping importers would at once raise their price to the fair market price, as they would be making no profits out of their transactions. The Canadian system properly worked operates almost automatically, and gives no encouragement to any one to use the measure as a means of practically raising the Tariff. As honourable members are aware, there are some articles included in the Tariff the duties on which ought to be raised, but, I think that they should be raised by putting the necessary alterations plainly in the Customs Tariff Act, and I do not desire that they should be dealt with under this measure, as they might be, if pa'ssed in its present form. There is much else that I should like to sav, but I am very anxious to see the debate on this measure and others confined within reasonable limits. I am very anxious to assist the Government to get on with business, and I am anxious, for example, to see the Tariff Commission's reports, and what the Government propose to do with them. I shall consequently now terminate mv remarks, only summarizing my position by saying that I do not believe that the evils threatening at the present time are great, although they may be sufficient to justify us in using reasonable means to prevent them from growing great; that Part II . of the B ill , with some amendments, cannot reasonably be quarrelled with by any one who believes as I do that the Personally,_ I may say State is justified in regulating industry; that Part III . of the B i i l aims at a danger which I do not think is an actual danger",45,William Lyne I Was Nof In For A Judicial Decision By Providing For A

He showed that he possesses a close and keen knowledge of the Constitution Act, and is also well versed in the Standing Orders and rules of procedure. I feel that, no matter what the choice of the House may be, either candidate will give satisfaction. very much pleasure in supporting the amendment. Laanecoorie occupied the chair in Committee during the last two sessions with very marked success, and has shown himself a ready, capable, conscientious, and impartial man, being well acquainted with the forms of the House, the Standing Orders, and the Constitution. On the occasions when he had the privilege of occupying your seat, Mr Speaker, during your compulsory absence, he filled the position with dignity, and' earned the respect of all.

He occupied the chair during extremely trying times, and under circumstances whicli placed the greatest strain both upon his knowledge of parliamentary practice and his resolute courage in doing his duty. We can assure the honourable member that the choice of another to act as Chairman during the last session of this Parliament has been in no degree due to any failure on his part to uphold the highest traditions of the post he admirably filled. desire to thank honourable members for having elected me to the position of Chairman of Committees. I can assure them that I fully appreciate the high honour they have conferred upon me. I do not take it amiss that some honourable members should have voted against me. Every honourable member has the right to vote according to his convictions, and it is not for me, or any one else, to cavil at what he may do. T assume that every honourable member votes with a clear conscience, and with the conviction that he is doing the right thing. I hope that, in discharging the duties of my office, I shall, so far as my abilities will permit, hold the scales of justice evenly between all parties. I desire to congratulate the honourable member for Kennedy upon having been chosen to fill the very responsible position of Chairman of Committees. I can assure him that if at any time.

I know that the position is not always an easy one to fill, but, fortunately for the honourable member, he will have a very much more complete set of Standing Orders to work under than I. had during my term of office. I am sure the honourable member for Kennedy will realize all that is expected of him. I heartily thank honourable members who have shown by their votes that they still repose in me that confidence which I feel that I have not in any way forfeited. I recognise that honourable members have a perfect right to vote in these matters as their consciences dictate. I feel very deeply indebted to those honourable members on the other side of the Chamber who have been good enough to support me. In view of their standing in the 'House and in the country, their action will tend to refute any misrepresentations that may follow upon the vote to-night. With regard to those who decided that they could no longer support me for the position, I recognise that they have given effect to the threat which their leader saw fit to utter to me during last session. I offer them my most profound commiseration. Debate resumed (vide page 473). late the Minister of Trade and Customs upon having chosen a very high-sounding title for the Bill. "" A Bill for the preservation of AustraUan industries, and for the repression of destructive monopolies"" sounds very well, and, judged by its title alone, the Bill ought to ra:eive abundant support. The honourable member for Bland branded honourable members on this side of the House as bogus anti -Socialists. I would suggest to the leader of the Opposition that he might take his cue from the Minister of Trade and Customs, and change the name of the party. He might call it "" A party for the preservation of the individual rights and liberties of the people of the Commonwealth, and for the repression of destructive land-tax legislation."" If that highsounding title were adopted, we should no doubt be able to enrol many more members under our banner. After all, 'however, perhaps the shorter name we now have is the better one, and we shall continue to fight under it. The Minister of Trade and Customs is an ardent advocate of protection. 1 He is the high priest of that fiscal cult. Although a representative of New South Wales, which is essentially a free-trade State, no more pronounced protectionist could be found in Victoria. In season and out of season he has commended protection as a remedy for all evils. Now, however, he seems to have found that his invariable panacea is deficient, and hence he has deemed it necessary to introduce a measure which practically embodies the principle of prohibition.

448,Mr Lee (Cowper) [7.55],"I congratushould have received the most serious consideration of the Government. The Tariff Commission have been engaged during the last two years in inquiring into the effect of foreign competition upon local industries. They have taken an immense volume of evidence from representatives of nearly every industry that could be affected by the Tariff, and I think that we were entitled to have their teport placed before us before being called upon to deal with this measure. The Tariff Commission have done good work, and if we had had their report before us we should have been better able to judge how far the Tariff had proved efficient to protect our native industries. TheB ill has been introduced to enable the Minister to combat the International Harvester Company and the Massey-Harris Company, whose importations are said to be injuriously affecting our colonial manufacturers. the combines with which it was desired to deal, he mentions the International Harvester Company, the Massey-Harris Company, and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. the shipping combine. trusts and combines which the Minister did not mention. combine ? whether he intends to deal with the tiedhouse question. Two sessions ago the Attorney-General could not sleep owing to his conoeiin for the welfare of our industries, which, he said, were being ruined owing to the operation of the Tariff. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports also repeatedly directed attention to the extent to which our industries were languishing in consequence of the ineffectiveness of the Tariff to protect them. They agitated for the appointment of the Tariff Commission, and yet they are willing to deal with this measure whilst hononable members are completely in the dark as to the result of the inquiries of the Commission. the Tariff? the Tariff. Company and the Massey-Harris Company, with which it is proposed to deal under this measure, are trading here legitimately. The prices they charge to our farmers are the same as those which rule at their factories in the United States and Canada respectively. They do not sell at a loss, but at a profit. Both companies were prepared to submit their books for examination by the Tariff Commission, in order to prove that they are charging fair prices, provided that Australian manufacturers of agricultural implements were willing to adopt the same course. At present the Sunshine Harvester Company have an advantage over the importers of harvesters to the extent of £ 2 0 per machine. The Minister took credit to himself for having broken up the harvester ring. I think gave information that the Massey-Harris Company were invoicing their harvesters at prices lower than they charged at tlieir He does not deny it . Among works. If the Minister can break up rings, as he claims, why should it be necessary to introduce this measure? The Minister also mentioned the case of the Standard Oil Company. That may be a destructive monopoly in the United States, but it canalso mentioned not be contended that it has operated to the detriment of. the people here. The company control the whole of the Australian market, and yet they have not raised the price of kerosene. Thiey sell their product at about 7s. per case, ex warehouse, and it cannot be pretended that ""their action has I intend to ask the Minister proved injurious to any of our industries. The Minister says that a company has been formed, with a capital of ^600,000 or ^700,000, and that it has expended ,£80,000 in developing the kerosene shale product in New South Wales. All honour to a company that will do so. They are doing this despite the fact that no duty is being levied upon kerosene at the present time. But there is nothing to prevent that company-assumin g that this Bil l Ibe passed in its present form-fro m coming to the Minister and saying, "" The Standard Oil Trust is ruining our industry,"" and from endeavouring to make out a case for prohibiting the importation of kerosene from abroad. If that were done, the Australian consumer would probably be unable to purchase kerosene for less than It has everything to do with double its present price. That is not a The International Harvester pleasant prospect.

459,That That Ring Was Broken When Mr Mckay,"national Harvester Company and the Massey-Harris iCompany to deprive the Sunshine Company of their trade in the manufacture of harvesters, was to be found in a speech which had been delivered by a Mrt Coxton at Numurkah, in which tihat gentleman had declared that the two firstnamed companies were determined to secure the trade, adding that if one agent was not enough to place in a town, they would appoint two, and that if two were not sufficient, they would appoint three. The Minister may believe such statements, but I am sure that any person who is familiar with business methods will treat them very lightly. Why, every commercial traveller, when he interviews a customer, almost invariably assures him that lie represents the best house, that the goods which he sells are the best, and that his firm are able to knock out 1 everybody else. I pay very little attention to such observations. Do we not all know the methods which are pursued by business houses to advertise themselves? Only the other day I noticed a pictoral advertisement upon a railway hoarding setting forth (hat Harper's oatmeal was the best obtainable. Underneath were the words, "" We all eat it "" That statement is scarcely correct, but we know that it is merely intended as a trade advertisement. Quite recently the Lithgow Iron Works entered into a contract with the New South Wales Government for the manufacture of pig-iron and steel rails. That contract was undertaken with the f u l l knowledge of existing conditions. Buti f this measure be passed, the day may speedily come when that company will be in a position to stop the operations of the great steel trust of America, so far as Australia is concerned. I hold that that is not right. I am in favour of preventing anv person from introducing into the Commonwealth good's which he intends to dispose of at less than a proper selling price, but I am not in favour of preventing him from selling them at a reasonable price. Trade and Customs has declared that the cane-growers in Australia who have spoken, to him upon the subject, have affirmed that they do not receive a proper return for their cane from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. When I asked him wliether the Board which he would appoint under this Bill would be able to deal with that complaint his reply was "" No, it is a matter for arrangement between the growers and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company."" have nothing to say against that company, except that they conduct their business upon true commercial lines. They sell their sugar at so low a price that nobody can take their market from them, and at the same time they exact the last farthing from the consumer. They enjoy the benefit of a duty of £ 6 per ton upon imported sugar, but I understand that a great deal of the protection which they are thus afforded goes to the cane-growers. The company came to the relief of the sugar industry in its earlydays when it was in a languishing condition, and I am sure that the success of the industry is very largely due to their operations. But the time has now arrived when we should consider whether this company should always control that industry in Australia. I believe that the proper way to deal with this question is by means of co-operation. I do not know whether the Minister has come to the conclusion that we cannot deal effectively with outside monopolies which are alleged to be endangering our own industries, by means of our Tariff. This afternoon the honourable gentleman was asked to mention one case of dumping in which an Australian industry had been interfered with, but his reply was that he was withholding the information until the close of the debate. I contend that he should have placed it before honourable members at the earliest possible moment. At any rate, he might have supplied it when he was asked to do so by tbe honourable and learned member for Corinella. I do not know whether this Bill is necessary in order to give effect to the policy of ""Australia for the Australians,"" upon which the Government intend going to the country. To my mind it looks more like a measure which is designed to set apart Australia for the manufacturers. The best way to develop the Commonwealth is not by bolstering up artificial industries-no t by excluding free competition-bu t by fosThe Minister of tering a spirit of self reliance amongst our people -We want to extend our internal and external trade. All the trusts in the world cannot interfere with our natural industries. No trust can kill our butter, coal, wheat, or timber industries. We fight the trusts, so far as those products are concerned, in the markets of the world, and we are able to hold our own. There is one gigantic combine in Australia to which I I find that no allusion has yet been made. Onjy the other day I noticed that the Victorian brewing companies have recentlyformed a combine. Thev have closed two or three breweries, and intend to control the whole of the trade in Victoria. the combine has not yet come off. licensed houses in Melbourne are tied to these breweries. That, I take it, would constitute a restraint of trade under this Bill. Notwithstanding that the publicans are the slaves of the brewers, the Government do not propose to deal with the brewing combine. If they do, they have kept very quiet about the matter. The brewing combine is the most gigantic trust in Australia to-day, and it is the one which most injuriously affects the character of our people. Only the other day we discussed the question of whether Dr. Danysz should be permitted to conduct experiments with fhe microbes which he has introduced into Australia for the destruction of rabbits, and some persons were under the impression that we had no right to interfere with the Government of New South Wales in regard to such a matter. But we had a higher duty to discharge than had the Government of that State, because we had to protect the lives of the people of Australia. For the same reason Ave should not hesitate to deal with the brewing combine. Then there is the gambling evil which exists in Tasmania, to which we might profitably devote our attention.

I am personally in favour of preventing any destructive monopolies, whether in the hands of trusts, combines, or individuals, and also any dumping of manufactured goodsi for the purpose of destroying legitimate industries; but I still hold that the best way in which to develop our country is to extend our external, as well as our internal, trade.

In debating a measure such as this we have to look, not first of all to what effect it is. going to have upon the denizens of cities and the workmen there, but to the effect it will have upon the primary industries of the country, because it is to the primary industries of this country that we must look for the prosperity of Australia. I am ouite aware that there are honourable members who consider those industries of very little account. Because the farmers are not always in evidence, are not gathered in great numbers to make their wants known by great clamour, and to buttonhole politicians, they do not care very much what happens to them. the community that has had more help than have the farmers ? very far-reaching character. It touches all sections of the community, and its incidence is not merely local, Federal, or wen Imperial, but is also international. It is indeed very hard to sav what its effect will be when it is brought into active operation. I may be unduly cautious, and I certainly like to know where I am going to set my The honourable foot before I raise it , but I say that we have not reached a stage of industrial development in this country that calls for the passage of such a measure. The measure is new, and, as legislation is entirely experimental, I do not say that it is bad on that account, nor do I say that we should always follow in the beaten track of the legislation of other countries. But I say that in dealing with a far-reaching measure such as this it would be well to pause and to refrain from going at the present time the f u l l length here proposed. I claim mand this measure at present. Though that may be admitted by some honourable members, they hold that we should anticipate the demand of some later day. When that necessity arises it will be time enough to pass a measure of this kind. Other countries have had to deal with the evils which have been complained of, which the Bill is intended' to remove; but they have dealt with them differently from the "" The industries of manner proposed, and I think that it would be wise for us to follow their example, and to tread the known rather than the unknown path, making haste slowly. We do not know how the B ill , if passed into law, would affect our present conditions, and it is impossible to know how it would affect future conditions. It does not seem to me to provide a scientific method of dealing with our troubles. I would rather have the importation of harvesters prohibited altogether, if that were found necessary, and* require a guarantee that similar implements would be supplied to the people of this country by the local manufacturers at fair and reasonable prices, than pass the Bill as it stands. It is 'an undoubted fact that the competition of imported harvesters with the locally-manufactured article has brought about the introduction of this measure. A l though we have heard of other cases of alleged unfair competition, that is the only one which has been specifically mentioned'. Had the harvester industrv possessed less influence, this measure would not have been introduced. The wildest statements have been made by those who have spoken on the two sides of the question, and it is therefore difficult to arrive at the truth; but tihe Government are insisting that we shall deal with it with our eyes blindfolded, bypushing the Bill forward' when, by waiting a very little time, we could get the evidence",52,Australian Industries Preservation Bill Second Reading

Although that Commission has been referred to slightingly, no other Commission in Australia has worked harder or more honestly, and, while its members have not received much thanks for their exertions, I am satisthan that proposed in the Bill. Competified that their report will be of vailue. When a complaint was made to the late lamented Mr Seddon about the excessive importations of agricultural machinery and implements into New Zealand', he refused to give the local manufacturers the high proget careless and slipshod in their work. tective duties for'which they asked, because he saw that such a step would injure the interests of the agricultural classes. Changes are continually being made in agricultural machinery, and agricultural implements wear out very quickly, so that the farmer is put to a large expenditure in maintenance, in addition to a primary expenditure of from ,£250 to ^300 in providing himself in the first instance with the requirements for the working of a farm of 300 or 400 acres. Mr Seddon would not make the farmers of New Zealand the prey of either outside trusts or inside monopolies, and therefore, while giving the local manufacturers fair play, arranged that ""the users of implements and machinery should be allowed to buy them at fair prices. Those who have had to do with the passing of manv Tariffs, and who were in politics when the high Victorian duties were in force, know that neither outof Australia, however, the rainfall is as side trusts nor inside monopolies show any consideration for the users and consumers of what they have to sell, but squeeze buyers as much as they can. Mr Seddon provided that when the local market was in danger of being swamped', and a complaint to that effect was made by two or. more manufacturers, the matter should be submitted by the Commissioner of Customs to a Board, and a statement was compiled giving the current price of each kind' of implement at the time of the passing of the Act. T.he Board was known as the Agricultural Implement Inquiry Board, and consisted of the President of the Arbitration Court, the President of the Farmers' Union, the President of the Industrial Assocultivation requires special implements and ciation of Canterbury, a nominee of the Trades and Labour Council, and a nominee of bhe Agricultural and Pastoral Association,, so that all parties concerned were represented. If it was proved to the satisfaction of the Boar.dl that prices had been reduced by 20 per cent, as a consequence of the operations of importers, he granted a bonus of 33 per cent, to the local makers, and allowed them to import their manufacturing requirements duty free. That seemed to me a much more scientific way of dealing with this matter tion was not prevented, but it was regulated so that the local manufacturers would not be injured, while the farmers! could' still get their implements at reasonable prices. Without competition, makers anywhere will They will not keep their methods and their machinery up' to date, and will do all they can to increase prices. But under Mr Seddon's legislation prices could not be increased, because there was always the competition of the foreign manufacturers!, although it was not allowed to injure the local manufacturers. Mr Seddon has been claimed as a labour representative; but, although he had the support of the Labour Party, he never ceased to recognise that the productions of the land are the basis of national prosperity. We have yet to fullv recognise that in Austr.alia. Moreover, the problems which we have to meet in cultivating the land are much more difficult and complex than are those of New Zealand, where, in many places, there is an average rainfall of 40inches, .and, with decent farming, crops are assured. A hundred miles from the coast low as 20 inches, and gradually decreases as one goes further inland, until it becomes next to nothing. In consequence of the scarcity of coastal land, farmers have had to go back into these arid regions and till them as best they may. The arid regions of America comprise 300,000,000 acres, and for years were looked upon as country of which nothing could be made. But within the last four or five years it has been found, as the result of the experiments of scientists and experts, that, with improved methods of cultivation, and the use of imported drought-resisting seeds, fair crops can be got from that country, and a good living made on it. Still, ifs machinery, the secret of success there being constant tilling. Moreover, it is a dry land, where the feeding of horses and other animals is very expensive, and therefore the greatest ingenuity has been exercised to dispense with the labour of domestic animals.

On some of the farms engines are being used which make .gas from brown coal or oil, and are constructed to feed themselves automatically, whilst last year a Bill was passed permitting farmers to grow sugar-beet and potatoes, and from them to make alcohol, which, when denatured, they can use as fuel for their machinery without payment of excise duty. Buti f the Bill which we have before us is passed into law and strictly enforced, the importation of such machinery and appliances as they are now inventing in America may be prohibited, as interfering with local production. will not permit Australian farmers to be deprived of the advantages to be derived from the researches of the scientists and the ingenuity of the inventors in other parts of the world ? The. United States has been held up as a shocking example of a country under the thraldom of trusts, and, no doubt, for some years past, the American trusts have been an overruling, arrogant power, looking siimply to their own interests, and riding roughshod over the community. But they have their good side. stands industrially had it not been for They ran railroad's through deserts in which they had large grants of land, and employed all the resources of wealth, enterprise, and ingenuity to develop the country. and very rich, and they worked things to suit their own ends, but it was not until many years afterwards that any steps were taken to keep tXiem in check or curtail their operations. Our conditions here are quite different. There is no possibility of a trust producing the same evils that have arisen in America. The trusts in the United States of America are able to keep their grip on the country because they control the means L-'7] of transportation by land and sea. Great trusts own the railways and the shipping, and they work in conjunction with each other. They are able to bring over immigrants by hundreds of thousands, and to settle them upon the land, thus retaining The honourable member is their grip of the whole community, and controlling production, trade, and labour. There is no gainsaying that they have worked In America the efforts of Governgreat harm, but similar results are not likely to be brought about here, because the railways are owned by the State, and no private monopoly of transportation can exist. When I was in America last year, I paid some attention to this matter. I asked some of the people why they put up with the trusts, and they replied that they had become used to tihem. Thev had been brought) to regard the condition of affairs as normal, and did not think it necessary to take any steps to combat the combines. One of the largest trusts -the meat trust-operate s in this way: It will send a representative into a village or town and invite the local butcher to join the trust, and thus increase his opportunities for making money. The local tradesman may say, "" No, I buy my sheep or cattle from the neighbouring farmers, and I shall have nothing to do with you."" The Surely the House first thing the trust does is to start a shop, and, by selling meat at 1 or 2 cents per lb. below the prices asked by the other tradesman, gradually undermines his trade. The trust then sends its agent to the farmers, and offers to buy their stock. The farmers may say that they have been dealing with the local butchers for many years, and prefer to go on supplying them. The trust then says, "" Very well, we shall see what will happen to you."" As the trade of the local butchers falls away, they can no longer take the farmers' stock. The farmers then America would not be where she have to send their stock to the railways, which refuse to carry it. Eventually both the the operations of these trusts. farmers and the butchers have to knuckle down to the trust. The great power wielded by the trusts is exercised owing to their control of the means of transportation. They could not operate upon similar lines in the These trusts became very powerful Commonwealth. Another evil influence is the enormous power wielded by the trades unions. These organizations have assumed gigantic proportions, owing, in the first instance, to the overbearing disposition of the trusts. The middle classes of the community, who do not belong to either the trusts or to the trade unions, are gradually being ground between the upper and the nether millstone.

477,Mr Mccoll,"That is not Socialism,in his very able and clear address last night, did not appear to 'be on very sound ground when he stated that we could deal with trusts operating within a single State. He seemed' to put that view forward with some hesitation, but was perfectly sure of his footing when he told us that the Commonwealth had authority to deal with trusts whose operations extended over more than one State. It is of no use for us to curb the operations of outside monopolies, if internal monopolies are to be allowed to carry on without hindrance. The position appears to me to be an anomalous one. torney-General stated with perfect clearness that we could not interfere with an individual monopolist. Therefore, whilst two persons joined in a monopoly could be dealt with, they could dissolve partnership, and, by carrying on operations separately, place themselves beyond the pale of the law. The prohibition of importations might lead to undesirable results, because limitation is the very essence of monopoly. This matter presents itself in another aspect. year we heard a great deal about Imperial reciprocity. should enter into an arrangement for a mutually beneficial interchange of goods between Australia and the old country. The late Mr Seddon, when he acceded to the wishes of the manufacturers of New Zealand, provided not only for their protection, but also for preference to British -manufacturers. It seems to me that if any country outsidte Australia will suffer as the result of this legislation, it will not be the United States, in which labour is highly paid, but Great Britain, where wages are lower, the hours of work longer, and the conditions of labour generally are far below our standard. In America high wages are paid, perfect methods of working are adopted, and the very best plants are employed. I had the privilege of inspecting the Deering implement factory, and I was amazed at the splendid manner in which the work was marshalled. Every man was employed on piece-work, and was working very hard. going like lightning. a good deal. The honourable member and his friends do not like that kind of thing. They prefer to take it easy. It is important for us to consider how the proposed legislation would affect our relations with the old country. I should like to know how the Treasurer, who has recently been to England, and who, while there, worthily upheld Australian interests, views this proposal. How can he vote for such a measure when he must know that, if its provisions are strictly carried into effect, British manufacturers will be excluded from our markets. The cry "" Australia for the Australians "" seems to me to be an unworthy one. It would be a worthy one if we extended it as the Prime Minister once, did, but does no longer, to "" Australia for the Australians, and for the Empire."" The The Atcries ""America for the Americans"" and "" Germany for the Germans"" are all right. Those are self-contained countries, whereas we are merely the offshoot of a great Empire. The spirit in which the cry "" Australia for the Australians "" is sometimes uttered seems to me to savour very much of disloyalty. It is to be noted that the anti-trust legislation in the United States did not originate in the national Parliament. It sprang from the States, and Last for many years no attempt was made by the national Parliament to deal with monopoI t was suggested that we lies and trusts. The first efforts at legislation in this direction were directed not so much at commerce as at transportation. The subject was a very difficult one, because the trusts, owing to their great wealth, were able to command the State Parliaments, and also a majority in the national Congress. They were thus able to burke discussion and prevent anything from being done to checkmate them. member think it would be wise for us to prevent any such conditions from arising here ? affairs is likely to arise here, and we must be careful that the remedy does not prove worse than the disease. Anti-trust legislation lhas been passed in twenty-two States. The first Act was passed in Georgia in 1877. No further measures were brought forward in any of the States until 1889, when thirteen States passed anti-trust laws. In 1890 five additional States entered upon antitrust legislation, and in 1891 two others did the same thing. The first Federal Act was passed in the latter year. If we are to check trusts and combines, the Federal and the State Parliaments must work hand in hand. Otherwise the Federal authorities will find themselves powerless to deal with certain combinations operating in a single State to the detriment of the public.

481,Mr Mccoll,"No such condition ofprovided in the Bill that competition shall be regarded as unfair if it will tend to lower the standard of wages here. I should like to know who is going to fix the standard of wages. Are we to adopt fhe standard of the TradesH a l l , or are we to appoint a Board which will fix a fair wage? Sometliing should be done to define the conditions of labour that are to be maintained, and also to fix the prices to be charged for tihe goods made by our own peopleI I believe that it would be very much better to effect the object which Ministers have in view by imposing fair duties, instead of leaving the matter to be dealt with by an individual, or a Board, whose decisions might be beyond control, and might work great harm to the community. If we are to make any progress as an industrial community, we must keep our machinery and plant thoroughly up-to-date. If we rely entirely upon our own people in this regard, they will not prove equal to the situation. The majority of the people of Australia are protectionists, but, alt the same time, are nbt in favour of very high duties. They will support only reasonable duties. In 1891, the late Sir Graham Berry, who was then Treasurer of Victoria, introduced an extremely high Tariff. In a year or two, however, there was a strong revulsion of feeling, and in 1894 the duties were cut down by 20, 30, and 50 per cent. In the same way, if we impose very high duties, the people will resent them, and in the end our manufacturers will suffer as they did in Victoria. Under the B ill no stimulus would be given to our manufacturers. What we should' do is to excite competition, and to stimulate our manufacturers to turn out goods that will bea;r comparison with the best of the world's products. If extremists have their way and our manufacturers can shelter themselves under a high Tariff, all competition will 'be bludgeoned if this Bill passes :as it is introduced, ancl the people will have to pay dearly for goods of inferior quality. That was the experience in Victoria. WhilstI shall vote for the second reading of the Bill, I shall endeavour to secure a modification of its provisions so far as farming implements and machinery are concerned. I shall also invite honourable members to follow the methods adopted by the late Mr Seddon in New Zealand, rather than those proposed in the Bill.

In dealing with this trust problem, and the dangers of vast accumulations of wealth in private hands, we are seeking to lay down beforehand the law of a healthly national, life , and not groping after the cure of a deadly sickness when once it has laid us on a bed of trial. I quite recognise with the deputy leader of There is no the Opposition that the day of combinations and corporations has come to stay. It would be quite impossible under our present complex industrial and commercial 1 conditions to conduct business without them. I have in my mind's eye a very striking illustration of that fact. Some fifteen years ago the ironmasters of Melbourne determined to form a trade combination. One of the most successful houses which was presided over by one of the most reputable men in Victoria declined to join it . Last year, after struggling for about fifteen years, that house failed with a tremendous deficit.

I do not support this Bill because I am opposed' to organizations -per se. I am not. I believe, with the honourable member who spoke last, that these trusts and combines have taught us a very great lesson. They have taught the value of organization and concentration, and how much can be saved by those methods. I believe, and my belief is backed up by the conclusions of the last Conference of Trades Unionists, held at 'Chicago, that in many cases combines have tended to the bettering of working conditions and the raising of wages. That can be proved' beyond the shadow of a doubt. But I cannot get away from the appalling facts revealed in this paper, to which I earnestly direct the attention of honourable members. I find the following statement made: Judge Grosscup, on the iSth February, 1903, gave a decision against the Meat Trust, and I would use all their magnifiamong some of the charges he considered as proved being "" in restraint of trade"" between States were : The combining firms had forced down live-stock prices by agreeing to refrain from bidding against each other in the market; they had regulated selling prices; they had bid up the prices of cattle to stimulate shipment; they had limited the quantity of meat shipped I think it is a mistake for to agents. Whether such practices are harmf u l in themselves or not the result seem to have been that the profits of the Meat Trust in 1901 amounted to nearly $100,000,000 more than in 1900, whilst the price of meat to the public inEvery procreased by 3 to 5 cents. This is an example how a combination can affect the price of commodities. Wages, however, do not rise in the proportion the price of commodities .can be made to do. Two hundred and fifty thousand organized workmen of New York received between the years 1S97 and igoi a total advance in wages of 7 per cent, (to be exact, 7.4 per cent. See ""State Bureau of Labour Statistics)."" The prices of commodities rose from July, 1897, to July, 1901, about 27 per cent. From the 2nd January, 1902, to the 2nd January, 1903, the price of beef rose 40 per cent., thanks to the Meat Trust. (These figures are those of the Treasury Department). So that labour was I recollect a speech powerless to increase its wages as capital had increased the price of commodities. Moreover, ground-rents near the great cities rise year by year, and the workman has to pay an increasing tax to landlords without an increase in value An excited auditor thereupon received, to the further depreciation of the apparent advance in wages. you name the date, I could give a number of similar quotations, whidh go to prove that there are trusts in America doing their blighting, deadly work in a way we ought to dread even to think of.

I could understand it from the leader of the Opposition or from honourable members opposite, but I fail to understand it from an honourable member who professes to be a protectionist, and whose theory is that the Australian workman ought to be protected from the low wages which he has pointed out are paid in Great Britain. One other matter to which I should like to direct attention is that the opposition to this measure comes with very bad grace from honourable members who took great pains and went to no end of trouble to prevent trade unions becoming so strong as to be able to dominate those outside trade unions. Honourable members urged that if trade unions were not checked I should like to point and certain steps were not taken, no end of harm would follow, and when we propose to apply the same reasoning to these great trusts we are told that all sorts of bogus dangers are going to overtake the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Echuca said, amongst other things, that the disloyal. I cannot for the life of me understand how he arrives at that conclusion. If Australia is not going to be loyal to itself, and is not to be for Australians, who is it to be for-for the foreigner, the American, or the German? The honourable member Their special legislation says that we should say ""Australia for Australians and the Empire."" Surely he It was passed to deal must see that we can be of very little use to the Empire unless we are strong in ourselves? Unless we are strong in our commercial and industrial life we can render very little assistance to the Empire. We were able to help the Empire in her time of trial, because we had strong, stalwart sons who had grown up under the southern skies under wholesome conditions, and who therefore were in a position to help her. If we are to make of them only hewers of wood and drawers of water, they; will not be able to help the Empire in the hour of difficulty. I say that "" Australia for Australians "" is a national cry, a fair cry, and a loyal cry, and it ought to be supported by every true Australian. honourable member who has just resumed his seat can always be trusted to put the tenets of his fiscal faith in the most appetizing way. I do not propose, in a discussion of this B ill , to be led into any of the bypaths of the fiscal question, but there were one or two things said by the honourable member upon which I feel it is the duty of a free-trade representative to offer some observations. In the first place, the honourable member seemed to claim, on behalf of the party to which he belongs, all the benefits enjoyed by the farmers throughout Aus-",59,Australian Industries Preservation Bill Second Reading

The new protection, however, now tends to prevent immigrants landing. about the farmers being protectionists, and the honourable member has lost the whole point of my remarks. remarks were not so pointed that it was easy to understand them, but I gathered from him that he claimed that the farmers of Victoria have .received all their benefits at the hands of protectionists and protection. tectionist party. statement that they did not receive them at the hands of protection? The honourable member, in quoting the anti-dumping precedents of Canada and other parts of the world, asked why, if Canada had passed anti-dumping legislation, we in Australia should not pass similar legislation. frankly that if we are to have anti-dumping legislation, and a majority of honourable members seem to think we should, the precedent which Canada has set us is an infinitely more honest, open, and straightforward way of dealing with the matter than the method proposed in this B ill . The Canadian Act provides roughly that whenever it appears to the satisfaction of the Minister of Customs that the export price of any article imported into Canada is less than the fair market value in the country of origin, such article shall, in addition to the duty otherwise established, be subject to a special duty of customs equal to the difference between such fair market value and such selling price. That is a fair way to deal with the alleged evil of dumping. If it is found that goods are being sold in Canada for less than in the United States, a special duty is put on to meet the case. The Canadian Parliament decides what is to be done in these emergencies, and prescribes what action the Minister shall take. But in this Bill we are asked to forego our privileges, and to allow the Minister to say what shall be done. cedent, the honourable gentleman who last I believe that the reason why the addressed you, sir, did us a service, because the method adopted in Canada is much more straightforward and adaptable to the circumstances which have to be met than is that now proposed. I deeply regret that, throughout this discussion, the House has found it difficult to arrive at a true estimate of the scope of the measure. The Minister who introduced it dealt at length with a number of the cases I did not say a word which it is intended to meet; but, in his anxiety to hit certain political rivals, forgot to explain its scope; while, last night, the Attorney-General gave a lucid The honourable member's exposition of the meaning which he attaches to each of its clauses, and explained what he would do if he had to administer them, but did not tell us exactly what is comprised by the measure. To show that those who are most interested are firmlv of opinion that the Bill reouires the f u l lest consideration, and the frankest criticism and scrutiny, I propose to read a telegram received this afternoon from the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, and signed by its acting-president. It is as follows :Chamber condemns Anti-TrustB i ll as excessively hostile to trade, and tending to I say disturb the whole foundation upon which commerce rests and always has rested. Are certain the results of such a Bill passing will not only be the abandonment of many useful and almost indispensable industries, but block any introduction of capital and immigration. Every effort should be made to defeat its passing. Consider it quite unworkable. The telegram concludes with the statement that the report of the sub-committee is being forwarded. duced by this Government which they have not condemned ? doing so, I could mention a large number of Bills which have not been so condemned, and have been supported by every party and every industry in the State. Surely the opinion of those who will have to work under the Bil l is entitled to respect at our hands. The honourable member for K a l goorlie may have a lofty contempt for the members of the Chamber of Commerce, but, as a deliberative assembly which has in its keeping the progress and prosperity of Australia, we should pay attention to all the information brought before us, whether In pointing to the Canadian precoming from experts, or merelv from interested political parties.

The former hit out recklessly-I use the word advisedly-a t his political rivals and enemies. that than stab them under the fifth rib. preferred not to stab them at all, and said, in effect, that he would rather not speak of the matters with which the Bill is supposed to deal, because so many of them are sub judice. colleague regards that as a reflection on his action in bludgeoning those concerned in those cases, but it seemed so to me, and to others qn this side of the House who have so tender a regard for him. geon me if they got half a chance. orable member refer? member's friends the trusts. of things.! An honourable member has only to ask the Minister to explain a measure of which he is in charge to be accused of being a friend of the "" criminals"" with whom it has been introduced to deal. Last session the Minister of Trade and Customs, or the Prime Minister, explained that the real urgency of the measure lay in one case, and that the Bill had been mtroduced to deal with the importation of har1 vesters and nothing else. thing else. made the measure an urgent one, we were told. sard must be misleading. reason for urgency. lay the extreme urgency of the measure. That was why it was thought that it should have been passed last session. Last night, however, the Attornev-General told us that, while only extraordinary developments' of trade were proposed to be dealt with under Part III . , they were altogether too numerous to allow Parliament itself to deal with them. Here we have another curious difference of opinion between two responsible Ministers. These numerous differences lead me to ask, with the utmost respect, whether the Bill has received the corporate consideration of the Cabinet. Still, as it is not in many of its provisions a party measure, I do not propose to approach its consideration I would rather do in a party spirit, and therefore shall not labour the auestion. I wish, however, to deal briefly with one curious point in the speech of the Attorney-General. According to the Melbourne Age, which usually reports him fairly, he saidThose members who were strong in support I do not know if his of individual liberty should assist the Government in passing this B ill , because it was a measure for the maintenance of true individualism. The Attorney-General asks honourable members on this side of the House to support the measure as one which will increase private enterprise; and, at the same time, we are told that the Bill has the support of the party which has sworn to stamp out individual enterprise, so far as it is possible for it to do so. my honourable.friend is no longer a Socialist? orable member has subscribed to an objective which aims at the nationalization* of all the means of production, distribution and exchange. a bit too previous. honourable member will not endorse that objective ? take what he can get. honourable friend; but the Federal Labour Party of Australia has endorsed a socialistic objective, and its members having done so, must, therefore, be Socialists. As Socialists, the majority of them are warmlysupporting ,a proposal which, the Attorney General says, is worthy of the support of everv individualist in the Chamber. This is a curious state of affairs.

539,Mr Carpenter,"Thos e on the Opposiand do not know where they are in respect to this B ill . party is, no doubt, better seized of the actual scope of the measure than is that to which I have the honour to belong, but I believe that they have received private assurances as to its effect, while we have only the utterances of Ministers in this Chamber. There is something sinister in the change of attitude towards the Bill on the part of those in the Labour corner. Last year they were singularly anxious as to 'its scope, and wished to know if it would affect the they are members; but that anxiety was completely dissipated before the introduction of the Bill this session. Therefore, I infer that honourable members in the Labour corner have privately became better seized of the actual scope of this measure tlian have honourable members on this side of the House. The Bill is in three parts. preliminary. With the objects of the second part honourable members on this side have no quarrel. It deals with the repression of monopolies, and members of all parties desire to make' the provisions adequate, while not too comprehensive. The third part of the Bill, to which a certain section of the Opposition is absolutely opposed, should not distract our attention from the good objects which are sought to be attained by other provisions in the measure. far as the repression of local trusts is concerned, I am sure that the Minister knows that he will have the support of every, member of the Opposition. first of all, however, be informed as to what these proposals really amount to. A number of terms have been used, which, so far, have not been explained, and unless we receive some enlightenment with regard to them, it will be impossible to avoid a large amount of useless discussion in Committee. The Minister of Trade and Customs was asked, by the honourable and learned member fon Corinella, for an explanation of one Or two provisions of the measure. He seemed to think, however, that his duty to the House would be discharged if he refused to give a simple answer to a simple question until he made his the debate. propriate attitude to adopt in respect io but I do not think that the Minister was justified in assuming that position towards an honourable member who is sympathetic to a measure which is not controversial in all its aspects. All we know, with regard to the second part of the B ill , is that it is based on the Sherman Act of the United States. To those who wish to see anti-trust legislation made effective, that fact does nof convey very mucb comfort, because we know that the Sherman Act has absolutely failed to accomplish the object with which it was designed. When the Act was introduced into the United States in 1890 trusts and combinations were in their large organizations of which infancy. Now, after the Act has been in force for sixteen years, they are in f u l l operation, and have become a by-word throughout the civilized world. All that we 'know at present is that the Act upon which this measure has been framed has proved a failure. We know, in a vague way, the ends that the Bil l is intended to accomplish. The Attorney-General has exThe first portion is simply plained some, of the objects, and has told us how he would administer the measure. As a deliberative assembly, however, we are concerned, not so much with the intentions of the Ministry, as with the manner in which those intentions are expressed in the measure. We should assure ourselves that our intentions are made clear, and that they cannot be distorted. Our Courts of Law will not hear evidence with respect to the reasons which led up to the framing of So any Statute. They simply take the Statute as it stands. Therefore, we must be absolutely certain that, by the time the B ill leaves this Chamber, it will clearly express We should our intention, and nothing more and nothing less. Several terms are used which require to be carefully defined. The second portion of the Bill deals, as I have said, with "" the repression of monopolies,"" but the measure contains no definition of the term ""monopoly."" It is presumed that the repression is intended to apply to bad monopolies, but the Socialist Party seem to think that all monopolies are bad, because one of the planks of their platform aims at the nationalization of all monopolies. ber is again indulging in misrepresentation. That might be an apthe honourable member will deny that there is a plank in the platform to which he suba bitterly controversial measure, scribes which aims at "" the nationalization of all monopolies.""",62,Australian Industries Preservation Bill Second Reading

Again, there are certain philosophic radicals who callously hang on'to monopolies in constituencies like Clifton.

Some of the actions of that combine may ibe bad, and' others may be good, but before the Bill reaches the Committee stage I wish the House to consider -carefully which of its actions are bad and whicli are good"".

571,,"Mr KELLY I can tell the honorablewith the shipping companies to maintain high freights upon produce from South Australia or Victoria? If so, how is the matter to be determined? If the case were tried in Western Australia, a jury in that State would no doubt declare that low rates of freight were detrimental to the public interest, whereas, if it were tried in Victoria, we should be told the reverse. Thus the verdict arrived at will depend entirely upon where the case is tried. In this connection, let me instance the coal trade between New South Wales and Victoria. The Victorian collieries are vitally interested in keeping the rates upon coal between Newcastle,and the southern coal ports of New South Wales and Melbourne as high as possible. Upon the other hand, the New South Wales collieries are equally interested in securing the lowest freight. If any of these collieries entered into an arrangement with the shipping companies regarding the freight to be charged upon coal, would that be a combination detrimental to the public interest? In this instance, as in the other illustration which I gave, the decision would depend entirely upon where the case was heard. Consequently, I hold that honourable members should be given a proper explanation of this portion of the Bill before it reaches the Committee stage. It is a curious thing that all the parties who attended the South African Shipping Conference, which was held some years ago, made it a condition precedent to any action being taken by that body, that freights should not be fluctuating. ""How can we prevent freights fromfluctuatingexcept by combination ? Personally, T do not agree with the decisions in this regard arrived at by the South African Conference. I prefer to see open competition working out the freights upon economic lines. which influenced that Conference in coming to its conclusions should be worthy of our attention, even if they do not secure our endorsement. There is just one other matter in connection with this portion of the Bill to which I desire to direct attention. Of course, the common carriers of Australia-the greaf railwav systems of the Commonwealth-wil l be immune from the operations of this Bill. I should like to ask the Ministeri f that is not so? member call them a trust? within the provisions of this measure ? that they will not. there is a combination between the railway managements of the different States regarding the rates to be charged upon certain goods. Opposition assist me to pass the Inter-State Commission Bill when I brought it forward? to discuss anything except the Bill that is under consideration. impression, but I have not looked into the matter to which the honourable member refers. they can, constitutionally, be brought under the Bill. Those in charge of these railways could not be prevented from cutting rates and arranging freights in any way they pleased, whilst the sea-carrying companies, who must compete with these land common carriers, are to be prevented from cutting rates and arranging freights. The managers of the States railways can enter into any combination they please, and can arrange a vast Australian trust, without coming under this measure, though a considerable proportion of the Inter-State trade of the Commonwealth, which is one of the few things over which we have power, is carried on over the States railways. Whilst those in charge of the States railways may do this with impunity, those controlling the carriage of goods by sea will be penalized under clause 6 of this measure, if they attempt _ to arrange freights and cut rates. That is am anomaly worthy of the consideration of the House. I ask what is a "" reBut still, the considerations straint of trade?"" I wish to ask honourable members of the Labour Party whether they think that the corporations to which they belong, the great .industrial organizations and trade unions, of which they are members, are trusts within the meaning of this Bill, and whether some of their actions might not constitute a restraint of trade?

These are the figures of a sworn return furnished to the Tariff Commission. Yet the Minister, who is so adverse to a consideration of this B ill , managed to misrepresent the facts, and say that the commission paid amounted to more than the total cost. Sir WILLIAM LYNE The commission and cost is what I said. memory than has the honourable gentleman I The Minister has had an opportunity of seeing that Hansard has reported him correctly, and has decided to permit the report to stand. He now says that the amount to which he referred covers commission and extras, but Hansard reports the honourable gentleman as having said that ""commissions to the extent of £ 2 6 or ^ 3 0 "" have been given for the selling of a single harvester. When he now discovers the facts with which he should have been conversant in the first place, he tries to hedge, and to escape responsibility for giving the House false information. I hope that, considering the way in which he has wasted the time of the House, he will not further worry other honourable members in I will give the honorthe performance of their public duty. There is another point in the Bill which I wish to have explained, and that is what is These are the figures. The meant by the order of the words in the phrase, "" producers, workers, and consumers."" All through the Bill these three separate sections of the community are named in that order. Is that intended to give an indication of their relative importance in the community ? Are we fo consider the producers as more important than either the workers or the consumers? I also wish to have it clearly laid down in Committee whether ""producers"" in this connection means producers in general or only the particular producers affected in the matter in dispute. Because honourable gentlemen will see that, if these clauses are applied to small isolated bodies of producers, the Bil l will be absolutely prohibitive of trade, internal and external. That is a matter which wants clearing up. I also desire to draw the attention of the Minister to paragraph c of clause 6, which saysFor the purposes of the last two preceding sections, unfair competition means competition which is, in the opinion of the jury, unfair in the circumstances; and in the following cases the competition shall be deemed ,to be unfair until the contrary is proved(c) If the provision would probably, or does in fact, result in throwing workers out of employment. Does it mean throwing out of employment any workers, or does it mean throwing out of employment considerable bodies of workers ?
