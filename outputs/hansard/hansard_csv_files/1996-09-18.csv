But you do not do that We were often as a government under presunless you are prepared to encourage research sure to review whether the amount should be and development, and that is why Labor did 150 versus 125, but we never looked at it commit heavily to these programs.

As a result of these cuts veyed by the Bureau of Industry Economics we will see growth held back. The budget said that their research and development acknowledges that. The budget says that we would have been lower if research and develwill only grow this year at best 31;2 per cent opment deductibility were reduced. This and 3Y2 per cent for every other year.

The Gregory go into a nursing home because they need report, which is the report the minister took care, because they are unable to look after such delight in using to try to score cheap themselves, because they are vulnerable and, points against our side of the House three most of all, because they need to.

He nursing home care-most particularly, the said: proposal to insist on an entry contribution The circumstances under which clients seek access averaging $26,000. to nursing homes are considerably different from hostel clients.

However, he Approximately 60% of nursing home admissions rejected the idea, and I would like to read out are from hospitals. This is one indicator of the fact his reasons for doing so. He said: that nursing home entry is often urgent, motivated overwhelmingly by the need for nursing care.

How can any minister say that someone costly acute hospital care free of charge. who needs nursing home care should be faced with that sort of choice? It is these differences which mean that the system of charges applying to hostels cannot be simply extended to nursing homes. As Professors Gregory and Howe have shown, people entering nursing homes are, But there may be an element of choice. Let us sadly, at the end of their lives, the majority have a think about what the element of choice entering from acute hospitals and, more often is that this government is seeking to impose than not, with a considerable degree of mental on families.

Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill. This bill will extend the time available for international education and training providers to become registered. Registration requires accreditation and approval by the respective state or territory where the agency operates. As well, it imposes financial conditions on private education providers. Australia's commitment to international education commenced in the 1950s when numbers of Commonwealth students were educated under the Colombo Plan. The aim was to assist Commonwealth developing countries by training their future leaders. In those days there was no expectation or understanding that there was a two-way benefit for the country. The education was expected to be of greatest assistance to those who were students. In the 1970s, restrictions were placed on quotas of international student enrolments. In the 1980s, Britain, once the favoured destination for Commonwealth and other Southern Hemisphere students, introduced full cost recovery fees to their universities. In response to that, Australia's international student enrolments grew hugely and the country was seen as offering a low cost, high quality education in a stable and mostly welcoming society. Of course, this sudden influx of overseas students brought quite heated public debate about overcrowding in universities and the costs of educating these non-Australian students. Two significant reports came out in the mid-1980s. The Golding report saw mutual advantage accruing to domestic and overseas students; it very much saw this as something important for our nation. The increase in international understanding and goodwill was seen as a very good outcome. The Jackson report took a more commercial view-that international education was a potentially significant export industry for Australia. So it advocated a free market approach to m<!ximise returns for competing institutions. In 1986 we saw deregulation of the tertiary education sector. This allowed non-residents to purchase education on a full fee-paying basis in Australia. Under the federal government's national unified education policy, the number of tertiary education providers increased hugely. The response to deregulation saw the numbers of international students increase by over 100 per cent between 1980 and 1987, with most of these students coming from Asia or Oceania. At that time there was ineffectual regulation and very little monitoring of parts of the industry-in particular, those that offered English language education and training. At the same time, student visas were often used to short-circuit immigration procedures. This led, as most of us know, to a very damaging international education crisis. The reverberations of this disaster lasted for a very long time. In particular, Asian markets looked at our smaller private",131,Pairs

420,Mrs Stone (Murray) (10.18 A.m.),"I rise to support the Education Services for Overseas4624 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 institutions as a high risk for their sons and daughters. Many were left with fees paid but no service offered, and they could get very little action from the government of the day for quite some time. When I worked at the University of Melbourne as a manager of international development in the 1990s, when I was overseas I was often asked by parents whether it was all right to come and study under the ELICOS program in Australia. They were only too aware of friends and relations who had been damaged by fees paid and students left stranded in Australia. This bill is extremely important in that it seeks to ensure that all providers of education to international students have a quality offering and that they also have financial regulation in place so that such an embarrassing crisis can never occur again. In Australia, we now recognise that our overseas students are of enormous benefit to our current and future situation as a nation situated in Asia. For example, our educational and professional development is enhanced when students in Australia mix with future business partners and professional partners, as the global expansion of our markets takes our next generation well beyond Australia's shores. Anyone doing business today understands the significance of interpersonal networks that take time to develop. If Australian and non-Australian students work together on courses for three to four years, friendships and networks can begin in their youth. That is of enormous significance and potential advantage as those two groups grow up and share their friendships into later life. That is also important for our cultural and diplomatic objectives. Education in Australia is known elsewhere in the world to be of a high quality. Some of our leading institutions have the most prestigious research institutions in the world. For us to offer places to students to share in the learning in those agencies is substantially appreciated by many families in Hong Kong, Singapore and mainland China. It is also a form of development aid that we can offer to overseas nations, helping students to do courses in Australia which, when they go back to their own countries, will assist their nations to grow and develop. That is a very important part of our aid. Of course, the enhanced research outcomes that come from international education in Australia are good for both the research outcomes in themselves and for our international reputation. As a result of these students coming to Australia, we also have substantial economic benefits. Overseas students in this country expend something like $1 billion a year on goods and services and some $700 million on course fees. The multiplier effect of their purchases in this country increases our domestic markets. It is an exceptionally good thing for our economy to have many more people within this nation buying goods and services. Some 86 per cent of our students come from Asian countries. The majority of those-74 per cent-are enrolled in universities, but others are at TAFE colleges, secondary colleges, primary schools and English language intensive courses for overseas students-our ELICOS programs. We are clearly in a situation where the reputation of our educational offerings is what is most important as we compete with other nations in offering these educational services. People in Asia or Europe can now choose between New Zealand, the United States, Canada and the various Australian states when they make their choices about where to buy education for their sons or daughters. Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE 4625 Australia's reputation as a nation which offers high quality education and institutions in a very carefully regulated environment is extremely important as the parents and students choose where they will go. Therefore, this bill is of critical importance. It extends for several years the time that an institution may take to become registered. It is, without a doubt, one of the most important things we can do to safeguard the reputation of our nation for years to come. SoI am very pleased to support this bill. I believe that, as overseas students receive an education here, or in Malaysia or Thailand where we have taken some of our campuses offshore, they may perhaps come back to Australia in years to come as business people or as people applying for full-time residency. This will be significant for the Australian economy, for our culture and for our reputation as a nation that pulls its weight in the world. I commend this bill to honourable members. Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (10.27 a.m.)-in replyMr Deputy Speaker, as members are aware, this is a very simple and very straightforward bill. It extends the operation of tuition assurance schemes for a further two years. These are excellent arrangements. Since their introduction in 1993, all students have received the tuition they have paid for or have been refunded their fees. As a result of these arrangements, the Commonwealth has not been called upon to provide financial support to students where a provider has been unable or unwilling to meet its commitments. So they are very good arrangements. They have the support of the educational industry. They have the wholehearted support of education providers. I am delighted to see that they have the support of the opposition as well as that of the government. I thank the shadow minister for his contribution to the debate, I thank members on both sides for their contributions to the debate, and I am delighted to know that the education industry is progressing so well in the electorates of honourable members.

(5) the spending cuts and tax increases contained in the Budget are, on the evidence of the Government's own Budget Papers, not necessary to reduce the Commonwealth Government's debt-to-GDP ratio and will not produce a significant improvement in the current account deficit; (6) the Budget not only offers no hope to the unemployed but actively harms their prospects of finding a job by cutting labour market programs and privati sing the previously publicly provided employment service function of the CES; (7) the Budget will have unfair and unjust consequences for the struggling and disadvantaged in our midst-the poor, the old, the sick, indigenous Australians and newly-arrived migrants; (8) the many spending cuts concerned with education and training, research and development, trade development (including breaches of promise with respect to EMDG, ITES and lAMP), production bounties, and other business support, will be counter-productive in their longer term consequences; (9) there is deception involved in the family tax package contained in the Budget, whereby what the Prime Minister appears to be putting into one pocket is for most middle Australian families being taken right out of the other by the Treasurer in higher education fees, Austudy changes, higher nursing home charges, higher fees and charges;

Appropriation Bill (No.1). The appropriations set the scene for a better future for Australia. As the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) mentioned in his budget speech, the focus is on savingssavings for investment, sustainable growth and real jobs. The first observation I would like to make is that this is a budget that has been welcomed by middle Australia. They know that this budget turns around the failures of the past and sets this country on track for the future. They know that we cannot live forever beyond our means on the bankcard with ever growing debt. Mainstream Australia understands that hard decisions have to be made and, more importantly, they expect a responsible government to do just that. The coalition went to the election promising a better deal for families, for small businesses, for real jobs, for older Australians. As well as that, we promised improvements to our health care system and to fix this country's financial system. All of these things have been achieved in this budget. We have, indeed, delivered just that. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Treasurer on the budget, a budget that is strong but fair. This government has fulfilled its major promises that we took to the Australian electorate in March this year. The Australian people will not forget that it was the previous Labor government, those members opposite, who took great pains to hide the true state of the nation's financial situation from the Australian people. The Labor government hid the fact that the budget outcome for the past year was a deficit of over $10 billion. Such financial dishonesty should never be inflicted on the Australian public again. Therefore, I applaud the",135,Representatives Main Commitiee
423,Mrs Johnston (Canning) (10.30 A.m.),"I rise today to speak to the government's4628 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 Treasurer for initiating the charter of budget honesty that will require a government to make the Australian people aware of the real state of the Treasury's books before they cast their vote. The financial burden left by 13 years of Labor mismanagement is shared fairly by asking high income earners as well as business to make a contribution. This huge debt problem created by the previous Labor government could not be ignored by this new government, so we have taken the responsibility of fixing that problem, and the Australian people are backing us all the way. Let me refer to an opinion poll published in the Bulletin magazine of 3 September 1996, conducted after the budget was handed down and when Australians had had a chance to digest its contents. Seventy-seven per cent of respondents view the budget as average or better. Even 60 per cent of Labor's voters agree. This detailed Morgan poll shows the high level of trust the Australian people have in this government. We have honoured our major election commitments while achieving a major turnaround in the nation's finances. Our central election commitment was to Australia's families. One of our highest priorities as a government is to relieve the financial pressures on low and middle income families with children. In January this year, while I was campaigning in the seat that I now represent, I produced a report called Canning chasm, which looked at the incomes of families in the electorate of Canning. The report was drawn from Australian Bureau of Statistics data outlining the inequality between families on different incomes in the south-eastern suburbs of Perth. According to the ABS data, 14.5 per cent of families living in Canning were surviving on incomes of $16,000 or less. Meanwhile, 11 per cent were living on incomes of over $60,000 per annum. This showed the electorate of Canning to be an area that had a great disparity between families who were well-off and those battlers who struggled daily to make ends meet. The people I represent in Canning have told me time and time again, as I meet with them around the electorate, that they are very pleased with this budget. And these people represent middle Australia, the battlers to whom we promised a better deal in the election campaign. The people of Canning also understand that our family tax initiative will really benefit them. This initiative will assist almost two million Australian families and recognises the financial sacrifices made by those families with young children where one parent stays at home. This will provide a great deal of additional assistance for families in my electorate of Canning, as I am sure it will also do to many other families in many other members' electorates. "" The family tax initiative, along with other budget initiatives such as the health insurance tax rebate, funding for marriage and relationship education and parenting education programs will all go a long way to helping these families.-, In addition to that, there will also be an increase of $5 million a year for emergency relief ' funding to welfare agencies who help those families who are most in need. This will alleviate . the pressure that the majority of Australian families have been feeling over recent years. , Australians know our central election commitment was to look after families and we, I believe, have truly met that commitment. This is also a budget that acknowledges the needs of women and issues such as child care and balancing work and family. Of course these concerns are not unique to women and there are many men who also juggle these commitments today. But women now represent 43 per cent of the paid work force and many women spend different periods of time in and out of the labour market mainly due to family concerns. Through this government's initiatives on Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4629 family tax measures, freeing up the industrial relations system, making superannuation easier and breaking new ground in marriage and family support, women will benefit greatly. The coalition also campaigned to give Australians real jobs. This budget takes responsibility for getting employment on track again by helping small business to get back on its feet. Small business is the backbone of the Australian economy, and it is small business that employs the majority of Australians. I note with interest the report and an editorial in the Australian Financial Review on 16 September 1996 reporting that Australia has lost the equivalent of $12 billion in export earnings, forgone partly because of our decline in competitiveness. The Financial Review states: The previous Labor Government must take the blame for much of this problem. In its final years it has failed to drive forward with those micro-economic reforms that could have made Australian businesses more flexible and competitive in export markets. The Financial Review goes on to ask how the business sector can reach its full potential when, and I quote: It is hobbled by a regulatory environment that impedes our international competitiveness. The newspaper also notes that the Howard government has already taken initiatives in this area and indeed we have. Our workplace reform legislation and our package of measures to help business will go a long way to strengthen this sector. The government has already met its commitment to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor to 6 per cent. This means that small business is no longer assessed for provisional tax on income in excess of what it has earned. The capital gains tax rollover relief that was announced in the budget will allow small business to rollover their business assets without capital gains tax disincentive. This government's industrial relation reforms currently before the parliament will rectify the job-destroying unfair dismissal laws. I recently sent a small business survey to all small and large or medium sized businesses in my electorate of Canning, and there are approximately 3,000 of them. I asked them, 'If you could fix any problem to help your business or create jobs what would it be?' The most common answer that I got was to fix the unfair dismissal laws brought in by the previous Labor government. Many other business owners also mentioned the fact that they would like to take on apprentices if it was made more feasible for them to do so. Therefore, one aspect that I am particularly pleased with is the apprenticeship scheme announced in this year's budget. The allocation of almost $260 million in incentive payments and wage subsidies will provide real jobs and a real future for young Australians. This government will deliver real jobs-not revolving door training programs which have left people, particularly our youth, despondent about their future and their worth. Under Labor, the number of apprenticeships dropped to its lowest level in 30 years. In government they favoured countless training programs with fancy names and not much else. They did not work and, unfortunately, many of the people who went through these schemes did not end up working either. As I mentioned before, the coalition made it clear during the election campaign that one of its central priorities was to tackle Australia's high level of youth unemployment. I believe that the apprenticeship system has always been a tried and true method of getting young Australians into real jobs and I am pleased to see a return to this system. 4630 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 The budget is about creating real jobs. We are not going to con the unemployed as Labor did. Their training schemes were, in the main, unsuccessful. Sadly, too many people ended up back where they started: unemployed and without a job. It was a cruel and callous hoax. This was a disgusting and totally irresponsible and immoral scam by the previous Labor government, the so-called champion of the unemployed. This government is not going to use the unemployed as pawns in some gigantic chess game. We in the Howard coalition government have genuine compassion for the unemployed, and we are determined to provide a far better future for them. Let me quote an article published in the Economist on April 6, 1996. Listen very carefully, on the other side. The article says: In a growing body of research, economists have compared groups of unemployed people who enter government training schemes with similar groups who do not. In almost every case, these studies have found that the schemes have failed to improve either the earnings or the employment prospects of their clients. After surveying the results of various broadly based training programs for unemployed adults, the training-friendly OECD was forced to conclude in 1994 that there is 'remarkably meagre support for the hypothesis that such programs are effective.' By easing the burden on small business, by introducing the modem Australian apprenticeship and traineeship scheme, by introducing employment placement enterprises, and by opening these enterprises up to the private sector, we will be creating real jobs for the unemployed. For the first time in 13 years, the unemployed have real hope that they will be able to get a job. The article in the Economist again says: Of five Australian training programs studied during 1989-92, only one could reportonly one, mind youthat at least half of its participants were either working or studying three months after completion. Who was in power in 1989-92? The members opposite: that is who was in power-the members opposite, who grew increasingly out of touch with reality and who had no real plan to fix the problem they had helped create. Our jobs pathway guarantee program will take school students and give them active work experience and the opportunity to take on apprenticeships or traineeships while still at school, to adequately prepare themselves to adapt to working life. Germany leads the world with this type of scheme, called the 'dual-education system'. Many German 16-year-olds sign an apprenticeship contract with local firms to work part-time in training positions. The rest of the time, they go to a vocational school. These apprenticeships are not necessarily only for traditional trades or skilled jobs: they also include white-collar and professional occupations. It is a company apprenticeship scheme that is tied to the educational system. When the apprentice/pupils finish, most get jobs either with their employer or, at the very least, in the field in which they had trained. This scheme works, just as the jobs pathway guarantee program will work, by allowing the education system and industry to work hand in hand to quickly respond to industry needs. This government is committed to the youth of Australia. It is going to be a very difficult task to raise the standard of literacy and numeracy skills, which has been very much in decline in recent years in Australia. There is presently a new Western Australian designed program that is being piloted at East Maddington Primary School and at other schools in my electorate of Canning. Called 'Reading for sure', the program was developed by Perth clinical psychologist Dr Julia Solomon, in an attempt to reduce anxiety in children who were afraid to read for fear of making mistakes in pronunciation. Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE 4631 Dr Solomon's research showed that it was necessary to produce a reading method which could capitalise on the consistent findings that children learnt to read by breaking up the sounds in words. The 'Reading for sure' program has already been used in a number of Scottish schools, where it was used to train severely dyslexic students to read. Within 18 months of starting the 'Reading for sure' program, most of these students, who had reading skills five years below average for their ages, had caught up to the same reading levels as their peers. I mention this only because, if we raise a generation of people who have only the most basic reading and writing skills or who cannot even count without a calculator, and if we continue to have a generation like this, industry will not be able to advance. According to the same 6 April article in the Economist that I quoted from earlier, a report released in January this year by Industry in Education, a British employers group, said that what they really needed was not more skills training but people who could actually address an envelope. I have spoken to Dr Kemp, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, about the 'Reading for sure' program, and I will continue to lobby for funding for this and other numeracy and literacy skills programs after the budget, so that we can give our youth-and adults, for that matter-the most basic skills of being able to read, write and do arithmetic, so as to assist them to get jobs that will lead to a better future for themselves and for Australia. I want to point again to the responses I received to the survey I recently sent out to small businesses. They strongly indicate their support for the measures put forth by this government and they particularly agree with our commitment to scrap Labor's unfair dismissal laws, so as to give small business a chance to employ people and to thrive again. As I drive along the Albany Highway in my electorate of Canning and look at the new developments taking place there, I can see that business confidence has grown with the election of the Howard coalition government. Some very large businesses are expanding, promising higher employment and a much healthier local economy. New shopping complexes and factories are being built, whilst others are being enlarged. This confidence augurs well for the future. I have already stated that small business is Australia's largest employer. We need small businesses in our suburbs and our towns, not only to provide local amenities and facilities but also to provide opportunities and work for families. My remarks during this appropriation debate have been mainly concerned with the need for small business to succeed, the need for reducing our country's huge bankcard debt created by the previous Labor government and the need for a stable economy. Indeed, we cannot halve our social problems in this country if we cannot solve our fiscal problems. This budget goes a long way to solving our nation's economic ills. I look forward to Australia reaping the social benefits once our economy is back in shape. Bill (No.1) provides further evidence that the coalition government's policies and philosophy stem not from the homes, the workplaces, the communities or the lives of ordinary Australians but rather that they find their genesis amongst the pages of the driest of economic rationalist textbooks and theories. I have no doubt that is primarily from where the previous speaker, the member for Canning( Mrs Johnston), received her economic education. In the time. I have available today, I would like to highlight some of the ways that this budget impacts on the people of my electorate. Having driven along the Albany Highway this year and noted the similarities between the south-eastern suburbs of Perth in the electorate of",137,Representatives Main Commitfee
424,Mr Wilton (Isaacs) (10.48 A.m.),"The budget we are debating today in Appropriation4632 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 Canning and those of my south-eastern Melbourne electorate, in particular in the area of Cranbourne, I have no doubt that the two electorates would feel the impact of this budget in very similar ways. Cranbourne is the third fastest-growing area in Australia and, like the electorate of Canning, could very much be described as typical of middle Australia. The government would no doubt have us believe that Cranbourne and like suburbs around the country were the beneficiaries of this budget, that it was aimed fairly and squarely at them and that they will, in the government's words, no doubt be better off because of it. It is time that we had a fairly critical look at the glib rhetoric that emanates from the mouths of members of the government, especially in their submissions on this appropriation bill, and to that end I intend to tum to some informed Isaacs local commentary, to see what prospects the budget holds for the people of Cranbourne and, I am sure-by extrapolation-for the people of Canning living on streets that border the Albany Highway. The Cranbourne District Commander of the Salvation Army, Mr Derek Linsell-who, I might add, was a willing host to the then opposition leader, John Howard, on 5 October last year in a detailed tour of the Salvation Army's jobskills facilities in Cranbourne-recently summed up rather succinctly the fear and despair that this budget places on the lives of ordinary Australians, the kind that the government claims to represent. In the 3 September edition of the Cranbourne Sun newspaper, Mr Linsell attacked both the Victorian and federal governments for putting the budget bottom line ahead of the needs of the poor. In that edition of the Cranbourne Sun Mr Linsell said: Ultimately this strategy will come back and bite us on the rear end. We're all going to have to get used to 10 per cent of Australians being in an underclass, which will mean more crime, more vandalism and more poverty. So much, I might add, for the fulfilment of the government's promises to assist the families of middle Australia, as claimed by the honourable member for Canning. Mr Linsell went on to say: My concern is that we just don't seem to care for people. History shows us that this is not only bad economic policy, it is also bad social policy. This is the same man who happily led John Howard by the arm around the Salvation Army facilities in Cranbourne late last year. He went on to describe how the situation in Cranbourne, in middle Australia, is deteriorating. He said: Six or seven people are coming to us every week for emergency housing. That demand has come from nowhere in the past couple of months and some homeless people are living in squats. Cranbourne is all about people achieving the great Australian dream of having a family and owning a house. Many people come here expecting to get on the housing ladder and find they can't. Mr Linsell went on to warn that Cranbourne was facing a welfare crisis which could push many recipients into a permanent underclass. I have no doubt that we can all see worrying signs. We realise that we will always have poor people, to greater or lesser degrees. But the beauty of Australia over the last decade or more has been that we have put a safety net in place. The danger-and this view is shared by Mr Linsell-is that this safety net will simply disappear. I have no doubt that his fears are particularly well-founded. This budget will do nothing for those in our community who are struggling to raise their families, run their businesses and achieve their goals in life. The family tax packages offer little because of the cuts that are being brought to bear, whether they be in the fields of Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITfEE 4633 education or health. In fact, one of the great urban myths that is developing in this country is that the so-called easing of unfair dismissal laws will be the great panacea for small businesses which have been the beneficiaries of a low inflation and low interest rate economic regime for several years. As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Beazley) so precisely put it in his address-in-reply to the budget: The message of this budget is don't be sick; don't be old; don't expect to go to university; if you're unemployed, too bad; and if you're young and unemployed, forget it. I think we should look at some of the impacts of this budget in more detail. I have made some brief mention of cuts to the health portfolio in this budget which targets private hospitals, pensioners and the disadvantaged through a massive reduction in public hospital funding, higher charges for prescriptions and reduced access to dental services. So much for this budget fulfilling the promises, hopes and dreams of middle Australia, as claimed by the member for Canning. The budget papers indicate that a further $320 million has been cut from grants to the states over the next four years. In addition to the sum of $600 million pro rata health reduction announced at the previous conference, this will dramatically increase hospital waiting lists for those who depend on public hospitals. Pensioners will have to pay an extra $100 million a year for drugs under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The cost of each script will increase to $3.20 without any compensating increase in the pension. In perhaps one of the more pertinent issues, which has been the subject of complaints to my office in recent weeks, the betrayal of the least well off in our society is compounded by the abolition of the Commonwealth dental program. The news that the federal budget will end funding of the highly successful Commonwealth dental health program can only be described as callous and miserable. The Commonwealth dental health program was introduced by the previous Labor government in 1994 to assist the states to reduce severe inequality in dental health care in the Australian community. Under the program, dental health services were available to the holders of pensioner concessions, pensioner health benefits, health care and Commonwealth seniors cards. Some 4,736 health card holders were treated in the electorate of Isaacs alone last year, with nearly 200,000 people across my state of Victoria receiving some form of dental treatment. The providers of the dental care under this program in the electorate of Isaacs include the Berwickwide Community Health Service which provides both general and emergency dental care to residents of Cranbourne, Berwick and Packenham. It treated 1,389 patients from the town of Cranbourne alone last year, as well as the 528 patients it treated in-house. The service also referred 861 cases to private dentists. Similarly, the Frankston Community Health Centre located in the seat of Dunkley provides general and emergency dental care to residents in the Mornington Peninsula and is likely to lose around a half a million dollars due to the budget cuts. It either treated or arranged treatment with private dentists for nearly 6,000 patients from surrounding areas last year. The centre has two dental surgeries and refers any work over its capacity to the approximately 35 locally operating private dentists. The Chelsea Community Health Centre similarly provides general and emergency dental care to residents in the cities of Kingston and Bayside and treated 2,934 patients last year-a 4634 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 470 per cent increase over the number of patients it treated before federal funding was introduced. As well as those patients it treats in-house, the centre also refers between 70 to 100 cases a month to local private dentists. The Treasurer ( Mr Costello), in his budget speech, justified the abolition of this much loved dental health program by saying: As waiting times for public dental health services have now been reduced, funding for the Commonwealth dental health program will cease. It looks like the funding abolition will see the waiting lists of these centres blowout, far from being reduced in the future, from around 12 months currently to five years or longer, even for basic dental treatment, blowing the Treasurer's illogical and short-sighted premise well and truly out of the water. Patients from Isaacs in need of emergency dental work will be forced to travel into the dental hospital in the city or be forced to pay private dentists to have teeth extracted as the cheapest option available. The abolition of this program will no doubt be a tragedy as it enabled the less fortunate members of our community who previously received only the most basic of dental care or who missed out all together to receive the dental health care that they both need and deserve. As the Leader of the Opposition said, it is hard to think of a more callous budget decision in the last decade or one that more clearly breaks the Prime Minister's commitment not to hurt the most vulnerable in our community. Again, so much for this budget fulfilling the promises of Australian middle-class families as submitted by the member for Canning in her speech in this place not a few moments ago. The security and quality of life of older Australians have also been made much less certain by this year's budget. The decision to force those in need of nursing home care to find the money to pay an up-front entry fee is an attack on people at a very vulnerable and a very fragile stage of their lives. As we all know, this entry fee will be something like $26,000 but could be as high as $88,000. On top of the entry fee, nursing home residents who are not full pensioners will be charged nursing home fees of up to $34 per day, or some $12,000 per year. This fee is charged as soon as a person's income goes $1 above the pension free area. The many older Australians-there are many of them who live in Isaacs-who receive care at home via the home and community care program will be faced with much higher user fees for the first time as a result of this budget. When I returned on the Friday of budget week to my electorate of Isaacs, one of the first functions that I attended on that day was the Longbeach schools district mid-project achievement celebration at the Mordialloc Primary School in the heart of Isaacs. The celebration might have been referred to better as a commemoration rather than a celebration because there was something bitterly ironic in the fact that such a function should take place only days after the federal budget spelt the end for the very program that was being celebrated. The function celebrated work carried out on 22 schools within the Longbeach schools district under the federal governments new work opportunities program--one of the programs claimed by the member for Canning to have fancy names and not much else. The work included the construction of rotundas, pergolas, amphitheatres, brick and concrete paving, outdoor furniture, Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE 4635 garden beds and general building maintenance at schools within the Longbeach district. To date, approximately 50 per cent of those works have been completed. According to Mr David Turnbull, the project coordinator, participants of this project employed adults who were willing to take the first step on the road to employment. The skill and pride that they have demonstrated in the work they have completed is reflected in the high standard that has been achieved. I can attest to that high standard, having seen many examples of it in and around schools across the electorate. But the government has decided to shut down over the next 15 months every significant locally run job program, such as new work opportunities, which have helped local people gain the skills, expertise and, most importantly, the self-esteem and confidence required to take that all-important first step back into the workplace. Other labour market programs to be abolished include jobskills, skillshare and jobclubs. Again, these are initiatives which have more than just fancy names. These are initiatives which make the less than confident in our society understand that they can go out there and get work if, through these programs, they are job ready. But the coalition government has gone back on its promise not to cut labour market programs which help unemployed people find these real jobs. These common sense programs, such as new work opportunities, have been real success stories, getting people off the dole and providing them with skills and training, which make them attractive to employers. The2 September edition of the Frankston Standard newspaper provides us with yet another example of irony. The Liberal member for Dunkley( Mr Billson) is reported as praising the Mornington Peninsula jobsnet campaign for what he called its 'meteoric rise' in the number of traineeship places available in the Frankston and Momington areas. The honourable member rightly pointed out the importance of traineeships and the success of this particular program, which is a joint effort between local business, media and DEETYA, in getting more than half of the trainees into ongoing real jobs. The irony was provided some two pages later in the same edition of that newspaper in an article entitled 'Jobs scheme future doubt'. The first paragraph of that article states: The Peninsula's successful and much praised job creation campaign, Jobsnet, has been cut adrift by the Federal Government. Cut adrift-despite its worth being recognised by the member for Dunkley and despite receiving glowing praise from the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, when she visited us in relation to the same scheme only last month. On a budget of $72,000 last financial year, jobsnet created 1,076 extra jobs in that 12 months, with over 280 young people now in permanent work as a result of this program. The Westernport Area Consultative Committee generously donated $15,000 to the program to see it through the coming years-more accurately, to see it through to the end of this year-but its long-tenn prospects are in jeopardy. Given the Howard government's own predictions of little or no reduction in the unemployment rate in the foreseeable future, without effective labour programs such as skillshare, jobsnet and new work opportunities, the unemployed face a very bleak future indeed. I could go on at some length to talk about cuts to legal aid. The pensioner legal aid centre has been the victim of significant cuts to the legal aid budget and no doubt will be devastated by cuts to its budget starting in financial year 1997-98 of over $33 million-more than 20 per 4636 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 cent of what the Commonwealth spends on legal aid funding. Again, this will impact most savagely on the needy in our society, quite contrary to the submissions by members opposite during this appropriation bill debate. When I was first elected to parliament I made a pledge to the constituents in Isaacs. That pledge was that I would hold this government accountable to meet the high standards set by previous governments and demanded by the people of Australia in ensuring that the principles of equity, of tolerance and of community which underpin our society are the parameters which guide and control our law makers and those whom we charge to enact those laws. Along with my colleagues from the Labor Party who have spoken out against many of the provisions of this budget, I believe we have clearly demonstrated that it falls well short of the standards set by previous governments and that-far from being guided by the principles of equity, tolerance and community-the ideology behind this budget is that of the bottom line, an ideology which recognises the cost of everything but the value of nothing. Ms WORTH (Adelaide) (11.08 a.m.)-It is with pleasure that I rise today to speak in support of the budget measures announced by this government in Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1996-97. This is the first budget of the 38th parliament, and one which takes the first step in turning around the creeping sense of inevitability that was beginning to pervade Australia prior to the 2 March election. No longer must we resign ourselves to a declining. standard of aged care, a shrinking small business sector, apathy about the macro-economic environment and finding real jobs for Australia's long-term and young unemployed. This is a bold budget. Not prepared to put off the tough decisions and be content to tighten spending, this government has reaffirmed its commitment to economic responsibility and to providing Australians with real answers to the dilemmas caused by unemployment, public sector debt and a feeling of isolation within the mainstream in Australia towards the decision makers of this country. This is a firm but fair budget. It is also somewhat of an anticlimax for members on the other side of the House in light of the ridiculous claims that they made before the budget. Unfortunately, the scaremongering and exaggeration about the effects of the budget have continued, as has been so evident by the standard of debate from some of those on the opposite of the House. As the Adelaide Advertiser commented, rarely have Australians been presented with a happier anticlimax. It went on to say that there were actual advantages for families with children and for some couples. Can we forget the scaremongering of 12 per cent cuts to universities, the reduction of the aged care pension and jobsearch allowances and the number of other untruths spread throughout Australia about the unknown content of the budget? As one newspaper announced, this budget is about priorities and pragmatism. It makes a priority of those vast sections of the Australian community forgotten and neglected by Labor and also makes a priority of the reduction in debt and deficit with fairness, with this government asking all sections of the Australian community to contribute. It is pragmatic because it does not avoid the challenge of reducing public sector debt, and it is pragmatic in the sense that it highlights the need for long-term strategies to deal with Australia's chronic unemployment problems. The coalition has delivered, in the context of the economic mess left by Labor, a sound budget. This government, as has been made abundantly clear in this budget, is about fairness and sharing the burden to undo Labor's economic legacy. The 'spend, spend, spend' mentality Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4637 of Labor has allowed it, like some sugar daddy, to buy its way into Australian political folklore. It irresponsibly increased public spending to feed the ravenous hunger of special interest groups and has pursued a policy of trophy economics, of grand schemes and Keating's so-called 'big picture'. But I put it to members in this Main Committee that the Commonwealth's ability to continue to provide quality services depends upon a reassessment of the level of public expenditure. To do otherwise would prove to be a far greater threat to the provision of quality services than this budget has been made out to be by the Labor Party. Under Labor, Australia's economic sovereignty was placed in a perilous position, with our net foreign liabilities, as a proportion of GDP, the third worse in the industrialised world, ranking Australia 45th out of 49 countries in terms of external debt to exports. The uncontrolled spending spree has come to a very necessary end. The deficit, however, will remain an ever present reality. The government will have to work within the economic confines it has created. In true form, the Labor government, instead of contributing to repairing the economic mess that they created, accuses this government of ideologically driven cuts. If propriety is an ideology, if responsibility to the taxpayer of Australia is an ideology, and if fiscal restraint in light of this economic debt is an ideology, then I and my coalition colleagues stand guilty. I would argue, however, that far from ideology, this is a budget driven by common sense and pragmatism. A 'spend, spend, spend' mentality cannot go on forever unabated and without direction or proper financing. This budget also returns the political momentum of this country back to those who Labor has for so long forgotten and neglected, as is so apparent from the attrition inflicted upon Labor on 2 March. Among their numbers were small businesses everywhere. Labor went into the 1996 election with nothing to offer small business. It is no understatement to say that the coalition has done more for small business in the last six months than Labor did in 13 years. The reduction of the tax uplift factor, changes to capital gains tax arrangements which will amount to a $150 million tax cut, the provision of information, consultation and support mechanisms, a reduction in red tape and better relations with the tax office and, most importantly, the scrapping of Labor's unfair dismissal laws are among the broad vision this government has for restoring some faith in a crucial sector of the Australian economy. As Max Walsh commented, the bottom line is that the budget is good for business and good for Australia. Contrary to the lies circulated during the election and again in the lead-up to budget night, the coalition will continue to index pensions at current rates. What a scandal for the ALP to circulate any information to the contrary to the 14,800 persons on the age pension in my electorate of Adelaide. The government has also eased the burden on self-funded retirees, providing them with the same tax rebate as pensioners. Couples will now have a tax-free joint income threshold of $19,850. In regard to health policy, the government has made up to $250 available to couples and at least $450 available to families to put towards private health insurance. This is a significant step towards undoing the outrageous negligence of private health in this country, which has seen levels of persons covered by private health insurance drop to just 34 per cent. The only way the health crisis can be averted in Australia is by coordinating the recovery of both public and private health sectors. You cannot do that with only one in three people in private health insurance, and Labor never had the answers. 4638 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 High income earners will face an increased Medicare levy surcharge. That is right and proper. Again, this is a measure aimed at equity and at sharing the responsibilities of Labor's terrible legacy. In addition, there are important improvements to public health. Areas that have received particular attention are the national childhood immunisation program, the national diabetes action plan, maternal and child health, injury prevention, and life education centres. Improvements in rural health include the setting up of a department of rural health in rural areas, with links to university medical schools; the Institution of John Flynn scholarships for medical students to give them greater exposure to country medical practice; and the provision of financial assistance to help improve locum arrangements. This government did not create the unemployment disaster in Australia, but we will take the long-term responsibility and put into place measures that will reduce unemployment. Only a long-term strategy will do justice to the nature and enormity of the unemployment problem in Australia, and the best and most genuine way of creating more employees is to create more employers. I have already spoken of the many benefits to the small business sector, but I would like to add that initiatives like the $207 million apprenticeship scheme and the ongoing reduction of interest rates will improve the macro-economic climate for employers, thus making them more confident about expansion and the increasing of staff numbers. Complemented by the government's intended reforms in the workplace, this is the only way that a long-term recovery in employment figures can come about. These measures reveal the mind-set of the government which is aimed at real solutions, even if the benefits will not be seen overnight. This is in direct contrast with those who are now in opposition who were intent on the bandaid measures and short-term irresponsible strategies which were so convincingly rejected by the Australian public at the last election. For all those people on newstart, for the 3,485 people on jobsearch and for the 178 people on the youth training allowance in Adelaide, this is the first good news they have received for some time. Again, putting some balance back into job training, this government has allocated $3.7 million in the next four years to rebuild the decimated apprenticeship and traineeship system. The budget does not pretend that the problems of long-term and youth unemployment will be solved overnight, but it does provide real hope to our jobless and the end of the cruel and endless training merry-go-round that was the norm under Labor. These budget measures are about real job creation. The allocation of $20 million over two years to the Australian Taxation Office will boost investigation of the tax avoidance schemes of the super-rich. This is simply another fair and equitable measure intended to ensure that all sections of the community contribute to restoring financial security for Australia's future. Much has also been made of the announcements of changes to the higher education portfolio. But let me take this opportunity to remind members that the coalition changes mean that students do not have to pay up-front fees and will not be denied entry because of an inability to pay. They will be required to pay HECS only when they can best afford it as they recoup the financial and career rewards that the study they have undertaken brings to them. The message sent out by the opposition parties in regard to full fee-paying places has been particularly disappointing. Full fee places mean extra places at university over and above those Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMIITEE 4639 that are funded by the Commonwealth. Overseas students have had the opportunity to buy places at Australian universities for years. Under access and equity principles, surely it is only fair that these opportunities be extended to Australian students. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, has stated that the government is firmly committed to maintaining the level of benefits to eligible families which Austudy provides. At the same time, we want to send a strong message to the whole community that well-off families with extensive assets and on high incomes will not be eligible to receive financial assistance via Austudy. Again, an element of fairness has been added to the measures already in place. Not only has the coalition government set about undoing the mess left by Labor, but it has gone as far as possible to ensure that this situation never repeats itself. The charter of budget honesty will ensure that this shameful chapter in Australia's economic history is brought to an end. Let me remind members that last year the previous Labor government spent $10 billion of taxpayers' money to repay interest on government debt, both here and overseas. The public sector debt must be reduced in this country, and the Australian Labor Party should be honest enough to acknowledge this and to acknowledge its own culpability in creating this situation. The previous Labor government taxed and it spent. Labor increased wholesale tax and petrol tax, introduced the FBT, raised the pension age for women to 65, introduced retrospective HECS changes, increased the Medicare levy and raised company tax. Despite this, Labor still managed to accumulate $69 billion in deficits over its last five years. As Terry McCrann has stated: This is the Budget we had to have-and self-evidently never got and never would have got from the previous occupant of the Lodge. Another commentator, Alan Wood, has stated frankly: Labor should apologise for its terrible failure as a financial manager and help Costello clean up the mess. One of the most disastrous examples of Labor's mismanagement was the running into the ground of Australian National, in my own electorate at the Islington workshops and elsewhere around South Australia and Tasmania. In the 13 years, the number of employees of AN has declined from 10,500 to 2,500. Yet Labor now triesMr Sawford interjectingthe opposition attempted to pretend that this had occurred since the change in government. But they do not fool the workers at AN who know and understand the situation. They know that Labor set up National Rail and that AN had, in the words of one worker, 'the guts ripped out of it'. And in the words of another: If the National Rail Corporation was made to pay its way at market rates, Australian National would still have its original investment which it could use to invest in other areas, such as the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link or other investment which would benefit Australian National, the country and, ultimately, the Australian taxpayer.",141,Representatives Main Commitiee

429,Ms Worth,"Was he on the government benches in recent years? As recently as yesterday4640 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 There is some good news in the budget for the workers and their families at the Islington workshops and for the residents of my electorate who live nearby. Money is at last available to clean up the badly contaminated land there, and that was confirmed in the House yesterday by Minister Sharp. All this is in sharp contrast to the previous ministers for transport, Senator Bob Collins and the member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Brereton), who talked on this subject but never delivered. As the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) has also recently commented: We do not want to condemn Australia (() a high deht future, nor put at risk the reduction in interest rates and the growth that will flow from it. That's the choice. There are no easy choices in relation to the Budget ... If we don't do it now, future generations are going to have less choice than we had because they are not only going to be trying to pay for their own services out of their own taxes, they are going to be servicing the dehts that we ran up on their behalf. I endorse those comments. They encapsulate the position-that bind, if you like-in which the government finds itself. The coalition has introduced some tough measures, but they are for the future for us all, and to guarantee future Commonwealth credibility in financial matters and the Commonwealth's ability to provide quality services into the next century. Labor created this mess and now wants to obstruct the very measures that will undo it. In regard to interest rates and business and consumer confidence, this is an especially irresponsible measure. Under Labor, home mortgage rates hit 17 per cent and business loans went over 20 per cent because Labor could not control its spending. As the Treasury secretary has stated, Australia will be 'courting danger' by doing anything else but putting into place a sincere and genuine attempt tu tackle government debt. I read with some shock the comments by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Beazley) to the effect that the budget was an act of betrayal and the first step towards a new, unfair society. I have gone to some lengths to explain the many fair measures in this budget that give no small amount of attention to ensuring that all sections of the community contribute to undoing Labor's mess-the legacy of its betrayal of Australian taxpayers, the unemployed, the elderly and the battlers. In speaking on the budget, I cannot let the events that transpired on the eve of the budget go without comment. I was in the position to observe these events first-hand for one and a half hours as I assisted those who sought to defend this place. Television coverage of the event did much to convey the violence that was apparent that afternoon, but television is a medium that does not easily capture in its entirety the mood that can be present during such an event. I can assure all those who think that the riots were sensationalised or over-reported that the threat was very real and a pervading sense of fear hung heavily on all those who were present in the foyer that afternoon. I would like to take this opportunity to place on the record my admiration for the way the Federal Police handled that situation. They were calm under extreme provocation. Damages arc now estimated at $300,000 and I hope that those responsible are made to pay. I know that there is extensive video film of the riots and some people have already been identified. One unionist from Adelaide, who authorised such charming election material as the message, 'If you believe in religious freedom and human rights, put Worth last,' has been identified as heing a ringleader. In conclusion, I would like to address some of the issues raised during this debate by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). I would like to draw all members' attention to the fact that Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4641 the federal seat of Oxley is one in a desperate position. In many ways, it is a microcosm of Labor's mismanagement. The member for Oxley would do better to address the problems of unemployment and poverty in her electorate than to make overgeneralised attacks on our indigenous communities and bodies like the United Nations. What will negative campaigns do to alleviate the suffering experienced by her constituents? We have seen only this week the benefit of being part of the United Nations, with Australia sponsoring an anti-nuclear testing agreement. This will prove beneficial for all Australians, including the constituents in Oxley. But the member would have us leave it. The member for Oxley refers to her research proving that indigenous Australians are better off than nonindigenous Australians. I have already circulated to my parliamentary colleagues, in July of this year, my own arguments that reveal the shortcomings in her research. All members on both sides of the chamber are here to represent all sections of the Australian community, and to promote the politics of inclusion and tolerance. It achieves little to concentrate only on negatives and those arguments which seek to divide. In particular, I wish to raise the issue of Grayndler and the impact that this budget will have on my electorate. The people in my electorate have been hurt by this budget. They have been hurt because of the savage budget cuts inflicted on them by the new Howard-Costello razor gang. I was at university the last time the coalition handed down a federal budget. At the time, I believed that the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, was a Thatcherite. In hindsight, he was positively dripping wet compared with his sidekick, the architect of the first razor gang, the now Prime Minister( Mr Howard). Mr Howard promised during the election campaign that services to people in need would be maintained. He promised stability and he promised fairness. Obviously, these were not core promises, because what this budget delivers is cuts to services and instability for families across the country. budget probably does represent and deliver for people in St Ives, but their interests are not the same as those of the people in Marrickville. Apart from making savage and unnecessary cuts to the public sector, higher education, ATSIC and the ABC, what this budget does is to shave off funds from virtually all government sponsored service delivery programs, which will adversely affect people most in need. Let us look at my electorate. I stated earlier that the people I represent have been hurt by this budget. They are people who can least afford to be hurt. According to the 1991 census, 41.6 per cent of people in Grayndler were born overseas-the Australian average is only 22.3 per cent-and 47.8 per cent of people speak a language other than English at home. The Australian average is 15 per cent. By and large, the working people of Grayndler are wage and salary earners-88.8 per cent. What effect has this coalition budget had on these people? First of all, the Medicare office in Marrickville Road has been earmarked for closure but, never fear, they are going to put a fax machine in the local pharmacy! It is a pity that this cannot be programmed to assist those residents whose first language is not English, and it is a pity that those who cannot afford to",149,Representatives Main Commiitee
430,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (11.27 A.m.),I wish to speak in opposition to this budget.,151,Representatives Main Committee

432,Mr Albanese,"I say to the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), in particular, that this4642 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 wait for cheque refunds are going to be disadvantaged by this. I note also that there are no Medicare offices on the hit list to close in the seat of Bennelong or in the seat of Higgins. Secondly, the CES offices are closing. They have been marked off to close at Marrickville, Ashfield and Leichhardt. I guess if you cannot register for work you do not appear in the unemployment statistics. Just a few doors down from my electorate office is Marrickville Skillshare. This is an organisation which has excelled in getting long-term unemployed people into real jobs. On average, 60 per cent of their clients go on to find long-term employment. Furthermore, Marrickville Skillshare has developed a specialist expertise for people from non-English speaking backgrounds. What is their reward for such conspicuous success? The minister responsible, Senator Vanstone, has decimated the Skillshare budget. Its staff numbers have been halved. This time last year Marrickville Skillshare was able to provide six months training and work experience for 45 adults and 42 youths in its brokered programs. Today, the brokered programs no longer operate. It is likely that for this financial year Marrickville Skillshare will be funded to assist 340 clients as opposed to the 800 that it assisted in the last financial year. Labour market programs are the key to addressing the problem of unemployment in this country but all this government can see is the amount of money that can be saved by cutting them down to the bone. Even if you look beyond the rationalist response; even if you look beyond the human cost of unemployment then you will see that the economic cost is also massive because people, if they are not in jobs, are not paying taxation. Therefore, on the revenue side you lose money and on the expenditure side you are forced to continue to pay out social security rather than people gaining their income from employment. This is policy madness. It will lead to an increase in unemployment and it will also have a long-term negative economic effect. Moving a little further afield we come to the Marrickville region Adult Migrant English Service situated at Enmore. This time last year AMES was running 15 DEET funded English for Work courses. These courses are by and large taken by highly motivated, newly arrived migrants. The courses themselves are not for the faint-hearted. There are three levels, each of which involves 20 hours of intensive English tuition over 20 weeks. Upon completion of English for Work III, students would be considered eligible for entry into TAFE vocational courses. How many courses are currently running today at Enmore AMES? There are two! Last year there were 15, now there are two. Forget the shaving analogy of the budget I used earlier, this is slash and bum. Incidentally, AMES also runs adult migrant English program courses for the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs but from 1 October this year the concessional rate of $2,205 for the English education charge will be scrapped, which means that NESB migrants will have to pay the full charge of $4,405. On1 January 1997 the charge will rise to $5,500. Currently, some 90 per cent of people who pay the charge are eligible for the concessional rate. This cost recovery measure inflicts a further financial burden on the very people who can least afford it: new and potential migrants. This is another example of the government implementing an agenda which has played up to the racists in our community, which suggests that those in ethnic communities can go to the bottom of the pile. Perhaps when we see the Prime Minister show some leadership in speaking out against people such as Pauline Hanson Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE 4643 he will have some credibility and the people on the other side of the table will have some credibility as well. Realistically, the only migrant groups unaffected by this charge, the only ones that have been left alone, are those from English speaking countries. There is a lot of rhetoric also from those on the other side about the family. Increases in child-care fees are inevitable given the loss of operational subsidies for community based long day care centres. Families using these centres will be paying around $20 a week more for each child in care. My electorate has 16 community based long day care centres providing places for 756 children. This provides the opportunity for the parents of those 756 children to actively participate in the labour market and provides 252 workers at these centres with employment. All this productivity comes at a cost of only $820,275 in operational funding to the government. This is peanuts, given the productive value that these parents have for our economy. Community based child care aims to provide affordable, quality care. The prime motive for private child-care centres is making a profit. Therefore, it is community based child care that sets the standard in the marketplace. This represents yet another broken promise by the new government. In a letter to the Australian Early Childhood Association, dated 28 February 1996, just days before the election, the then shadow spokesman for family services, Dr David Kemp, made a commitment to preserving the operational subsidies, and I quote: The policy also states our continuing support for the community-based long day care sector, and we regard the operational subsidy as one of the key supports of that sector. The coalition has no plans whatever to change the operational subsidy. It is a very clear commitment that has been broken by those opposite. I guess this is just another one of those non-core promises. We had two sorts of promises. There were the ones that the new government kept. They were the core ones. All the rest were the non-core promises. They do not really count. We will remember that and we will be reminding those opposite of it in the lead-up to the next election. The so-called family-friendly tax initiative is also fundamentally flawed. A low income family who, by necessity, must have both parents working gets a tax break of only $1,000 per dependent child. Such a family may earn only $70,000 a year, or $35,000 each. However, a single income family can earn up to $65,000-which increases by $3,000 for each additional child-and get the $1,000 per child and an additional tax break of $2,500 if they have a child under five years. Therefore, a family with three young children, struggling on a combined income of $60,000 a year, gets a $3,000 increase in the tax-free threshold. However, a single income family with three young children can earn $71,000 a year and get the $3,000 plus an additional $2,500 increase in the tax-free threshold. The message is very clear. To women in middle-class families, who can afford that, it is: stay at home. But to those on the lower end of the rung it is: bad luck. There is no equity in this decision. Let us face it: the only people this family tax initiative will assist is upper middle income earners who can afford to live on one income. Low income families, who by necessity must have both parents working, are, in effect, punished. These tax concessions, along with the cuts to the child-care sector, are a transparent attempt to get women out of the work force. Women being forced to leave the work force provides a double bonus for the government. Firstly, their departure creates a job vacancy and, secondly, because they cannot afford to be in the work force, they do not register for work and therefore 4644 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 do not appear in the unemployment statistics. Is this the coalition's secret strategy for bringing unemployment numbers down? Certainly, this budget is not making Australia the clever Gountry. Another area where the people of Grayndler will be hurting is in changes to the higher education contribution scheme and Austudy. Understandably, most families are very keen to see their children succeed. This sentiment is especially strong in first-generation Australian families, who by and large had very humble beginnings. I remind members that almost half the population of Grayndler was born overseas. One form of relief for these parents was that independent Austudy became available to many students at the age of 21. To raise this to 25 years places an untenable burden on many families. Furthermore, lowering the income threshold for HECS repayments from $28,495 to $20,701 means that many graduates will find it very difficult to get ahead. As a result, they may need to rely upon the support of their parents even longer. The likely outcome of these changes is that children from lower income families will be forced to give up the dream of a tertiary education because their parents simply cannot afford it. But then, perhaps this is actually one of the aims of these changes. I can assure the Main Committee that, contrary to comments made by Senator Vanstone, not too many students from the inner west of Sydney will be paying their way into university in the 'dumb but rich' category that is being implemented by this government. The privatisation and Americanisation of the Australian higher education system, whereby people from richer areas, from rich families, can buy their way into university, having not got the marks, is a disgrace-given, in particular, that they will have had advantages of going to the sorts of upper-class private schools that some of the people opposite obviously went to. The elderly and the frail are not immune from the new, improved razor gang either. There is nothing like hitting people when they are down. The coalition government has withdrawn $88 million from its contribution to home and community care funding. And the government's proposed solution of the shortfall in funds? User pays, of course-user fees for meals on wheels, user fees for home visits, user fees for community transport, user fees for respite care, user fees for shopping support, user fees for home maintenance. These services allow the elderly and the disabled to remain in their homes with dignity. Without them they will be forced into nursing home care. But of course they cannot really do that, because once they apply to get into a nursing home, having had the choice of staying at home taken away from them, the government begins to impose an up-front fee of an average of $26,000. This may not be a lot of money for people in Bradfield, but I can assure you that it is a lot for people in Grayndler and it is a prohibitive amount for vast numbers of elderly Australians and their families. Furthermore, thanks to the budget, people already living in nursing homes face increased fees. This will negatively affect almost 2,000 elderly people currently living in the 34 nursing homes in Grayndler. There are 1,954 people in my electorate who will be impacted by this. Perhaps one of the most unjust aspects of this government's cost-cutting plans is the threat to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. Funding for the next financial year may remain stable, but it is only while reforms are being worked out. It is clear, however, that these so called reforms will lead to funding cuts of up to $500 million. The importance of public housing may be lost on the coalition government, but for hundreds of thousands of people across the country it is no exaggeration to say that it is a lifeline. Having grown up in public housing for the first 20 years of my life, I certainly can attest to that. -"" ',',I',',,',' Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4645 The government's idea, in effect, is to abolish public and community housing, and to extend rent assistance to public and community housing tenants. In an area like the inner west of Sydney, the rental market is very tight and market rents are very high. You would be lucky to rent a bed-sitter for less than $100 a week and an average three-bedroom home would rarely be leased for less than $300 a week. Such a change would alter the whole character of inner city areas, where public housing has ensured that there is a mix of people of different backgrounds. Even with increased rental assistance, low income families will be severely disadvantaged by the loss of public and community housing. The effect of these changes is potentially devastating to low income families. But then it seems clear to me that when the Prime Minister and the Treasurer talk about family friendly initiatives they do not include lower income families. In conclusion, this budget will increase inequality. It is a road which has been gone down before; it is a road which Margaret Thatcher went down in Britain, and Reagan and Bush went down in the United States. But it is a road which is being rejected all over the world. The UNDP's Human Development Report, which came out this week, when comparing economies throughout the world said: ... the key to East Asia's success was a relatively equal distribution of private and public assets. Countries there concentrate on redistributing not income but wealth. What generates income is productive wealth. A progressive redistribution of assets tends to boost growth because it has a broad positive effect on people's incentives. There is also a report by the OECD that came out in July 1996. This report concluded that growing inequality is far from conducive to growth. It admits the future prosperity of OECD countries depends on reducing social and economic exclusion in the forms of high unemployment, non-participation in the labour market and, in some instances, growing inequalities in earnings and incomes. The World Bank has also put out a report suggesting that growing inequality is bad for economic growth. I would suggest that the results of this budget are very much going to be a reduction in economic growth, an increase in unemployment and an increase in inequality in our society. When you look at the labour market programs, where you have a strategy implemented to have labour market programs withdrawn, you also have changes to the social security system with massive proposed increases in penalties for people. If you do not turn up to a job interview, you can cop up to at least 13 weeks withdrawn social security payments. Some of the honourable members around this House should think about what they would do without 13 weeks of any payment. Those people have to get their money from somewhere. This is not a 'fair go' budget as the government would like us to believe. It is a 'have a go' budget. Have a go at the elderly. Have a go at the unemployed. Have a go at low income families. Have a go at women. Have a go at students. And have a go at people least able to fight back. I urge the House to reject the measures in this budget. Dr NELSON (Bradfield) (11.47 a.m.)-BeforeI commence I would have to refute some of the nonsense that was just said by the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Albanese). The best study on income distribution in Australia was done by Boyd Hunter and Bob Gregory from the Australian National University. Bob Gregory was a member of the Reserve Bank Board. From 1978 to 1991 the top five per cent of income earners in this country increased their average income by 23 per cent. The bottom five per cent reduced their average income by 22 per cent and, in fact, the people who were displaced most from the work force were 4646 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 women in low socioeconomic areas and blue-collar workers. This budget, amongst other things, actually does a great deal to try and reduce income disparity in Australia. In the period leading up to the March federal election I was asked by a number of people why I was in such a hurry. I replied that this election was occurring at a time when, in every sense, our country was at a turning point in its history. As such, I do not consider that the election was a cricket match to which we would return in three years time, nor was it a question of whether John Howard or Paul Keating would occupy the Lodge for the ensuing three years, but rather, the outcome of the election would see the economic and cultural destiny of Australia set for the next 30 years. This budget represents the first of what will be a series of major changes in direction for Australia. In its broader sense, it heralds two fundamental shifts in the way that we see ourselves. The first is to set a three-year program to tum the deficit into surplus to stop indulging the present generation at the expense of our children. In returning expenditure to a level below that of income and consolidating this nation's capital base, we begin the long road back to funding social infrastructure from income rather than from the accumulation of further debt in the sale of assets including the acquisition of Australian companies by foreign interests. The second major change and arguably the greater change to be found in the budget papers is a cultural shift. Under the previous government, in particular, the expectation of what governments can and will provide had grown at an unsustainable rate. This budget represents the first instalment on rediscovering the forgotten ethic of those who can afford it being encouraged, if not expected, to care for themselves, whether that be in health, aged care or higher education. The opposition parties, and the Labor Party in particular, cannot seem to make up their minds. On the one hand, the shadow Treasurer, suffering from relevance deprivation syndrome, certainly publicly, and I suspect also within the Labor Party, agrees to a three-year strategy for deficit reduction, but on the other, thinks that $7.2 billion in savings should be obstructed. As Alan Wood, in the Australian on September 10, said, Labor seems intent 'on extending its record of fiscal irresponsibility into opposition, aided and abetted by the Australian Democrats. ' For every billion dollars of budget savings blocked by the opposition, another billion dollars has to be raised on the international equity markets or through the sale of Australian assets. In debating this budget, this parliament needs to put our circumstances into proper perspective. We have had external deficits in 28 of the last 30 budgets. Sixty-nine billion dollars was accumulated in deficits by the previous government's last five budgets. Household savings at 2.5 per cent of disposable income are the lowest in the OECD and the lowest savings ratio in the developed world. We have a lack of savings, public and private, which has meant that growth approaching 3Y2 to four per cent has required us to use monetary policy and increase interest rates to stop a balance of payments problem, with people who are left trying to manufacture in Australia having to borrow money offshore in order to support growth. The use of our debt under the previous government to prop up consumption has exposed us to an exchange rate depreciation. Four per cent of our gross domestic product has been spent servicing debt and equity obligations. Net foreign debt approached 40 per cent of GOP and, under the previous government, debt reached a staggering 19 per cent of gross domestic product. If you then look at Eslake' s work on social security payments, he found that, in 1970, Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4647 18 per cent of Australians over the age of 15 were in receipt of some kind of social security payment. In 1995, 30 per cent of the people in this country over the age of 15 were in receipt of social security payments, and if you excluded unemployment benefits it was 24 per cent. Last year we spent more on health, welfare and education than all of the money raised by taxes on income-and that is PA YE taxes paid by the attendants in this chamber and by people in blue-collar areas, like that of the member for Grayndler ( Mr Albanese) and the member for Port Adelaide( Mr Sawford), who are out there working today. I repeat: more money was spent on those three big-ticket items than all of the money raised on taxes from income. The amount spent last year on health, education and welfare was $71.3 billion. In contrast, $65 billion was raised by taxes on PAYE income earners. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot snuggle into bed with two to three per cent underlying growth, denying transport, communications and industrial relations reform on the one hand, and then, on the other, insist on free education, health and aged care. The Labor Party's history of opposition to serious tax reform completes a picture of disengaged unpreparedness for the realities this nation now faces. Little wonder the shadow Treasurer's accurate self-diagnosis of relevancy deprivation syndrome! Let's hope it is not contagious-for the member for Port Adelaide at least. This budget finally moves Australia in the right direction. In the 1995-96 budget, the deficit, as we now know, was $10.5 billion. That is 2.1 per cent of GOP. cent of GOP. in the following year we will return to a surplus of just under $1 billion. What the member for Port Adelaide fails to appreciate is that in those other countries that have those levels of debt they also have high levels of growth, they have high levels of savings and they also have positive balance of payments. What this means to us, to everyday Australians, is a return to surplus, an effective long term improvement to national savings and to a deep-seated balance of payments problem and, along with industrial relations reform, unshackling of the impediments to growth. The other important aspect of the budget that needs emphasis is a charter of budget honesty. For the benefit of members on the other side, honesty means that you actually tell the truth, that you tell people what the facts are. The charter of budget honesty requires that the heads of the Department of Finance and Treasury will sign off on an economic and fiscal outlook within 10 days of the election being called. After the election is announced, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition can request costings of their announced policies by heads of the Departments of the Treasury and Finance. It requires annual updates on the government financial position and economic outlook. Every five years the government will have to publish an intergenerational report which assesses long term sustainability of its policies. It will require a fiscal strategy statement to be produced annually and, of course, we will move to accrual accounting.

I received 1,285 valid responses. There are another 60 people who did not identify themselves, and so I did not include them in the survey. The survey was made possible through funding provided by the members of the Liberal Party in my electorate; and for their hard work and sacrifice I am extremely grateful. When asked to specifically rank 12 listed national issues in order of greatest importance to them, 11.4 per cent of respondents nominated foreign debt as the highest priority; 10.9 per cent, taxation reform; and 10.3 per cent, health care financing reform. But analysis of the responses showed that there was a significant proportion of residents who consideredcorrectly, in my opinion-foreign debt, taxation reform, interest rates and unemployment to be issues where both the problem and the solution were interdependent. I should also point out to the House that, whilst a code of ethics for parliamentarians rated a 12, a significant number of respondents explained that, although they were placing it last, in their opinion the ethical and professional behaviour of federal parliamentarians would be likely to substantially improve when the then Prime Minister finished his term. Question4 invited respondents to nominate the single most important issue that I should address on their behalf, and 265 respondents rated economic productivity issues as the highest priority to them, followed by health, social services, social justice and youth unemployment. I also advise the House that, in analysing the more specific responses to this question, I was struck by the concerns shown by Bradfield residents not only for the economic indices, but also for a higher priority to be placed on what might be loosely described as social justice issues. Amongst these, permeating the survey was a concern for Aboriginal reconciliation, foreign aid, community service and the treatment of carers, the despair of young people, and what could be described as the compassionate manifestations of the elected government. Some of the calls that I have received in my office in the last few months have related, in fact, as much to those sorts of issues as they have to economic ones. The most interesting part of the survey was the specific comments that people made. I have 160 pages of comments in my electorate office. I read every survey before it was collated into the computer, and I then listed five pages of specific comments from people in my electorate which reflected a cross section of their views and concerns. I will now highlight some of these",157,Represent Atives Main Committee
437,Dr Nelson,"The survey was distributed to the households in my electorate and requiredWednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4651 responses, because I believe that they confirm that, in a general sense, the budget is moving in the direction in which my constituents would like to see us go. The following are quotes from my own constituents. 'I feel powerless as I see Australia slipping downhill.' ' ... working for the good of Australia and Australians on a long-term basis rather than on an ad hoc basis geared to the next general election.' 'Population growth: do we need to grow? Can we sustain growth?' 'The question that needs to be asked is: does Australia need multiculturalism? We are not being asked; we are being told that it is good for us. I question that.' 'I have been disillusioned with the political process and its participants, short-term perspectives and constant criticism of the opposition, irrespective of what is good for the country.' 'No private enterprise could exist if managed the way this country has been in the last 20 years. Change it and make decisions.' Other responses included the following. 'Develop and rediscover hope in people's lives. Give incentives so that effort is rewarded and they can achieve their dreams.' 'We desperately need support for small business: simplification of rules governing small business to encourage employment, and simpler tax for casual or part-time workers. There are too many rules and regulations covering the simple exercise of doing a day's work.' 'Unless we rectify economic issues first, the nation cannot afford to rectify quality of life issues' -and therein lies the fundamental difference between us and the opposition party. 'Let's get the country back on a sound financial footing first. You cannot have quality of life in a sick economy.' The responses continued: 'The issue I rank above all those listed is the increasingly inequitable income distribution in Australia, such that the rich are getting richer and the poor are becoming more numerous and poorer. We face a bleak future if this trend is not reversed.' 'There should be a long-term bipartisan plan for Australia, not three years stumbling from election to election.' 'An economically strong Australia will benefit all its citizens.' 'We are living beyond our means. We must cut spending under our present government.' 'Introduce a GST-we are currently taxing all the things we are trying to encourage.' 'The plight of our Aborigines is a national disgrace. It is embarrassing that so many Aboriginal people do not even have access to basic needs.' 'Has Australia really become an Asian country? Where are we heading? Are we acceptable to the rest of Asia? How must our people change?' 'Industrial relations: there must be a proper balance between capital and labour. Each must cooperate with the other and bloody-mindedness exists on both sides. Our national future depends on cooperating effort.' 'Make unemployed people work for the dole, for example helping in nursing homes, gardening for the aged and other community programs.' Further responses included: 'The problems facing self-funded retirees are becoming overwhelming. We are treated almost with contempt. We urgently need tax relief, support with private health insurance and concessions available to government funded pensioners. Why is it that you work all your available years and are taxed, try to save and you are taxed, then retire because you have made an effort to save, do not get a pension and still get taxed?' 'We have the tragedy of family break-up due to the ease with which the young can obtain support from the government, and we parents are told that it is none of our business when we appeal for help. Amongst numerous families I know in this predicament, my own daughter left home at 15 years. She was at a private school-paid by us-but still managed to get Austudy on two occasions when stopped by us. In the three years away she has managed to live on welfare, jobsearch allowance, workers compensation--obtained after one week's work-and other handouts which she wastes on trivialities, including cigarettes and alcohol. 4652 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 A group of them move from place to place and therefore do not pay any rent. It annoys us immensely that this child earns more than I do a week, as I work part time, have eight certificates and a degree. My husband is too busy trying to survive in business to tell you what he thinks. Do the best you can.' The responses continued: 'The only way anyone will employ young people is if there is a youth wage.' 'I wish to live in a just society with equal opportunities for all. It may surprise you that I do not mind paying taxes to bring this about.' 'What a welcome relief for someone to ask my opinion.' 'The total negativity of one political party to the other is appalling. The TV picture of abuse and name-calling is so pathetic and we refuse to watch it. See if you can bring some decency and respect back into federal politics.' 'The country has no hope, the way things are going.' 'If you are going to pursue politics do it with passion and not platitudes. Make the tough decisions and not the politically expedient.' The responses included also: 'Youth suicide: concentrate on the needs and welfare of our young men and women, particularly, and give them hope.' 'Please oppose republicanism. We believe this overrides all the above mentioned issues.' That was a comment from a household of eight people aged 9 to 89. The next respondent said, 'The republic: I will not vote Liberal because of the attitude to a republic. Liberal policy has to broaden its appeal.' So on it goes. These are people in my electorate expressing their own concerns, their own aspirations for Australia, and this was at a time immediately prior to the election. It was a time when we were labouring, if you like, under the previous government. Therein lie many of the reasons why there was a change of government and the reasons why the people wanted to see change. I know that the member for Watson( Mr Leo McLeay) yesterday described me as 'the silvertail doctor'-I wish I were a silvertail-'from the Upper North Shore of Sydney'. But the aspirations and concerns of the people in my electorate are in many ways little different from those of the people in Grayndler or in Port Adelaide. They were desperately concerned about the way our country was going, and they really felt that, while there were many decent people in the previous government, the government in almost every sense had lost its way. To refute the idea that everyone that I represent is wealthy and affluent: I will never live in a three-storey mansion, I will never own a Rolls Royce, but I will fight to the death for the right of any Australian, whether they live in Grayndler, or Bradfield, to believe that one day they might be able to do that. The budget is about those two things, as I said earlier. It is also about us stopping indulging ourselves. Of course, in many cases we would love to fund not only the things the opposition is concerned about but also much more; but we can only spend what we earn. Every time we spend more than we are earning, we are spending the future savings of our children, we are forcing people in the private sector to borrow money from overseas, and we are continuing the pressure to continually sell Australian assets. On this issue, by the way, of the electorate that I am privileged to represent, one respondent said to me, 'Remember that there is an underclass on the North Shore and that we are hidden, but we are trying to live with dignity on social welfare.' I am very much aware of that fact. I commend the budget to the House. It is going to do two things. It will return us to the position we were in pre-Whitlam, which is that our social infrastructure will be funded on income rather than on debt. It will, as I said before the election, also change the destiny of this country. We now have a Prime Minister who is like anyone of us, an ordinary man, a Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4653 man who clearly is relating the decisions that he and the government make to the concerns and aspirations of people in my electorate and people in the electorate of Grayndler and of Port Adelaide. He is someone who is obviously taking into account what we think when he makes a decision on our behalf. Those of us who are privileged to be members of this government will do everything that we can to see that the voices of our constituents are being heard, whether we happen to agree with them or not. I commend the budget to the House. path of the downsizing of government involvement in the economy that has been at the heart of economic thinking in this country for more than a decade. However, this government has taken the credo a step further in what I believe are its misguided endeavours to balance the budget inside of two years. Let it not be forgotten: the so-called $10 billion Beazley black hole is about one-third of the Howard cosmic catastrophe left in 1983, yet that was brought back into balance, as indeed can this deficit be controlled more conservatively, and with less disruption, than this budget allows. In the desperate rush to win credit ratings from the money markets, we have slashed any meaningful commitment to many of the long-term unemployed and to regional development, Aboriginal reconciliation, alternative energy development, and our national broadcaster. We have premised any environment commitment upon the sale of our greatest earning asset; which sale will provide, for the huge environment problems we face, less funding than has been provided in normal outlays in forward estimates in recent years. Middle Australia has been provided with a tax break, on the one hand, but has been asked, on the other hand, to fork out more for child care; while dental programs for the disadvantaged and elderly have been dismantled. First, let us examine the labour market programs. New employment placement enterprises will now be paid on the basis of their success in getting unemployed job seekers into sustained employment. While this new market driven labour program is attractive to free marketeers, the payment structure will, according to the budget papers, 'be focussed on finding people jobs rather than placing them in training programs.' What a wonderful motherhood statement! Will this mean that the displaced power workers, the road workers, and the defence factory workers of the Lithgow district, for example, will be delivered into new jobs? Where, I ask, will these new jobs come from? The government has set no target on reducing unemployment, and most indications are that it will sit at around eight or nine per cent for the foreseeable future. So where, I ask-as we downsize Telstra even further by 23,000 jobs, as we become even more efficient for the sake of fewer and fewer-are these jobs that these entrepreneurs of the unemployment marketplace are to deliver? PEPEs, those private employment enterprise centres, look set to be the boom growth industry of the late 1990s. For what results? At a time when there are few jobs emerging in regional Australia, our government has chosen to slash back its commitment to regional development-surely the catalyst for growth and job generation. To expect a balanced budget to deliver lower interest rates and then, by some magic, a growth in job investment, is pure fantasy. The transport and regional development sector of these budget papers is shameful. Apart from a commitment to maintain a bipartisan agreement on the Pacific Highway funding, nearly every category is a negative. That is a cut in regional commitment. Let me list just three of them: a $132 million reduction over four years in funding for the national rail infrastructure authority; a massive reduction in funding for the national highway system; and abolition of the regional development program which has been",160,Representatives Main Committee
438,Mr Andren (Calare) (12.07 P.m.),"The 1996 budget represents a continuation down the4654 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 severely criticised by local government, farming, commercial and community groups around Australia. At a time when regional Australia is crying out for infrastructure assistance, this government is turning its back. When the minister announced the RDOs were being cut, I said I looked forward to his commitment of projects of 'real and lasting benefit to regional Australia.' Where are they? A political handout of $48 million has been provided, in such excruciatingly tight fiscal times, to the South Australian Liberal government for Adelaide airport. Let us analyse this. Given that Adelaide airport's performance is declining, how does this government find $48 million to extend what is one of the country's lowest ranked airports-being neither a major tourist destination nor having any significance as a freight airport-to link into south-east or north Asia? Adelaide is primarily a domestic airport. In the financial year 1995-96 it handled just 230,000 international passengers-just two per cent of the national total-while at 6,554 tonnes of airfreight exports in calendar year 1995 it barely exceeded three per cent of the national total. Yet this government has found $28 million this year, and a further $20 million next year, to fund Adelaide airport runway extensions. At a time when we need to be funding-and when both sides of politics promised-at least a feasibility study of a new freight airport at Parkes, this government has provided zero, zilch, nothing, to a project that potentially could deliver many hundreds of jobs and billions of export dollars from goods delivered efficiently to our markets to the north. It is difficult to see what benefits will flow to Australia from $48 million worth of Adelaide airport extensions--certainly not a huge leap in international passenger traffic or airfreight export from an airport ranked below Cairns in importance. This budget has also sold out any real commitment to alternative energy research. The fledgling ethanol fuel industry, of which the Manildra group was a major player until budget night, has rightly challenged statements by energy minister Senator Parer who claims, 'current production and use of fuel ethanol is not cost effective in reducing emissions of greenhouse gas and environmental pollutants.' The axing of the bounty, due to be in place until the year 2000, saved the government $21 million. That bounty has helped attract more than $40 million in private sector investment in viable production of fuel ethanol through the processing of feedstocks. The ethanol bounty scheme also provided $4 million for research and development of processes to produce ethanol from forest plantation thinnings, sawdust, crop stubble, cotton trash and biomass from urban waste, among others. That research and that 18c a litre bounty have been stopped dead in their tracks. Along with the government's refusal to endorse the greenhouse emission targets that the rest of the developed world demand, this decision displays a lack of environmental concern, policy that suits the petroleum industry, and a guarantee that if our economic direction may no longer be that of a banana republic-although I have doubts about that-our environmental record is certainly heading that way. Since World War II, government subsidies to the oil industry are estimated to be $2.9 billion. Against this is the $25 million under the ethanol bounty scheme, $3.9 million in associated research and development, and $2 million for a pilot ethanol program. Yet the Australian Institute of Petroleum complained that the bounty would give ethanol an unfair advantage. Major oil companies refuse to participate in the bounty scheme, but 100 independently owned Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMIITEE 4655 service stations have been supplying ethanol blend fuel in Sydney and regional areas. The dark shadow of the oil giants lies right across this disgraceful budget decision. Such also are the environmental credentials of a government that wants to flog off our most valuable asset on the spurious grounds of setting up an environmental heritage trust, which could easily be funded by accessing that very Telstra dividend indefinitely. The Telstra sale is not about the environment; it is a continuation of the shameful disposal of our national assets begun by that champion of national sovereignty, Paul Keating, and embraced with passion by the Liberal Party. The National Party has tagged along with this economic lunacy, too timid to argue against, and now enmeshed in the sticky web of, downsizing and sell-offs to explain to its bewildered and angry constituency why government and former government services and publicly owned enterprises are disappearing before their eyes. To dispose of Telstra, delivering $2.3 billion to its shareholders-the people of Australia-is short-sighted economic vandalism. Let us tum to the elderly and how they may be treated by this budget. The changes to nursing home contributory funding-the shift of costs from government to the public-must be better explained to an older generation that has yet to be fully consulted about the implications for the family home, the inheritance that all older people want to hand on to their children. Such cashing-up of assets to pay for nursing home accommodation also dramatically underlines the physical cut these elderly people must make from the life outside to that within an institution. Chances are that many families may choose to try and keep their frail elderly in their homes and try to provide less than professional caring. I hope there is no plan here to ease the demand for nursing home beds. The Thatcher government introduced a similar scheme-the cost was debited to the elderly patient's estate-that brought about a huge increase in home care, with disastrous social results, but delivering the desired cost shift from the government to the patient or their family. But having said that, I must report that one local community body in my electorate, the Yeoval Multipurpose Health Centre, containing as it does a nursing home, hostel and hospital, sees real benefits in obtaining such funding from local clients to enable maintenance and extensions and improving a facility for the benefit of local elderly people, who will, in fact, be investing in a community asset, ensuring its continued viability and caring for older people within their own district, rather than their being forced to seek nursing accommodation in some more distant town. This is perhaps one of the unintended and unsuspected positive outcomes of this new policy for more remote towns and communities. But it certainly needs widespread explanation and consultation before it is implemented, because there is a concerned sector of the elderly population in larger centres, such as Orange, Bathurst and Lithgow, who see this is an assets grab for little apparent return. Having paid taxes in the past to support aged care, they are now being asked to pay for their own. Mr Deputy Speaker, while mentioning the Yeoval Multipurpose Health Centre, might I plead with the government to research this model of what smaller centre health care should be all about and to maintain federal commitment to the multipurpose centre biannual grant program. The Yeoval community have been successfully conducting their multipurpose health centre for seven years, and they firmly believe the concept is one that suits rural and remote areas. So do 1. 4656 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 Throughout my electorate there is grave concern at the abolition of the dental health program, to save this government $55 million alone over the next 12 months and $112 million, $114 million and $116 miIIion in each of the three years after that. The Minister for Health (Dr Wooldridge) said in the House that it was a very difficult decision, but cuts had to be made. He said that it was a program that had handled the backlog and was now to cease. Why, then, was there no money set aside for the years ahead? Do underprivileged and elderly people's teeth stop rotting now that the backlog has been met? In the Orange, Cowra, Lithgow and Bathurst health districts, there is a six-month waiting list for people to access the program. That was before the budget. Emergency care only is being offered from now on. Over 20 per cent of the population will now be denied this assistance; 74 per cent of dental health funds for the economically deprived have gone; four clinics in the region will close. It is a service for which there is no substitute except a dramatic decline in dental health care for disadvantaged young, adult and aged. The Commonwealth sought, and gained by referendum in 1946, the power to make laws for the provision of 'hospital benefits, medical and dental services'. In his policy launch of 18 February this year, the Prime Minister vowed to 'continue an effective social security net for the disadvantaged and needy and to maintain all current Commonwealth concessions' which includes dental concessions. Half a million people access this scheme. If it is discontinued there will be waiting lists three years long by 1998 and after that these people will be forced to have their teeth extracted. The state cannot pick up the huge funding shortfall to deliver these services. Changes to the higher education contribution scheme could also impact heavily on my electorate and rural Australians. While I have no great problem with a modest incremental increase in the contribution to tertiary education by its beneficiaries, the steepness of these increases will particularly hit remote and distance education students from institutes like the Orange Agricultural College. The cost of $4,800 or thereabouts for rural science and marketing degrees will prove too expensive for many rural students coming from somewhat depressed areas in the bush, trying to upgrade their skills in a rapidly increasing competitive agricultural marketplace. I have fears, too, that the dramatically increased HECS will tum many economically disadvantaged away from tertiary training generally, and their skills could be lost to the nation. I applaud the extension of the actual means test on Austudy to catch those rorting the system through manipulation of their taxable incomes. It is a patently unfair system which excludes many deserving students with honest parents while including children of families that have prodigious wealth. Why can't part of the savings in the higher education area be directed into more Commonwealth scholarships for the lower income groups, complete with living away from home allowances-a scheme that worked so well in the 1950s and 1960s and offered a transparently fair income tested access to university for thousands of young Australians? One thousand such scholarships for rural and remote area students is a start, but it must be multiplied twentyfold and offered to students right across the spectrum. Those who can pay should assist more; those who cannot must be assisted in far greater numbers than this budget provides. Otherwise, we will fail to tap the intellectual resources of young people trapped by the economic circumstances of their parents. The cutbacks to Aboriginal funding-the ATSIC slashes-have been well documented. This country has debated Aboriginal welfare for decades. We have patronised indigenous Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4657 Australians for generations and only in the last decade has any semblance of self-determination, apart from Wave Hill, emerged. Yet, at the start of so-called reconciliation with the first Australians, we have buckled to impatience, ignorance and mischief at best, racism and deliberate community division at worse. We have pulled $400 million from Aboriginal programs. It is one thing to share the budget pain, it is another to devalue both funding and self-determination. Our spending on Aboriginal programs-$1.5 billion out of $130 billion-is about 1.2 per cent of total outlays, less than the two per cent of the population that Aborigines represent. Let us get this funding priority in perspective. While the extension of SBS to more regional areas is welcome, the 10 per cent cuts to the ABC in each of three financial years from 1997-98 and the current thrust to further corporatise this great broadcaster represents an assault on our cultural infrastructure unrivalled in recent times. I search with hope in these budget papers for a sign of real commitment to regional Australia. I applaud the supermarket to Asia strategy to boost food exports, but I despair at the lack of commitment to any infrastructure designed to get food to those markets. I heard the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy( Mr Anderson) say: It is a carefully designed strategy to identify bottlenecks. I suggest that air freight transport-an exclusive air freight component and an exclusive air freight industry-is an obvious one needing direct support now and not another committee. I applaud the $115 million funding boost to CSIRO. I applaud retention of the diesel rebate scheme provided that its rorts are attended to. I applaud exceptional drought circumstance funding continuing and rural adjustment funding. They are vital and obviously welcome. I applaud the fringe benefits tax exemptions and the capital gains rollover concessions-a boost to small business that will hopefully be supplemented by amendments to the unfair dismissal laws. I was pleased to see a $36 million road black spot funding program until I saw the $621 million cut in national highways spending over the next four budgets. A throwaway line on page 158 of the budget statements says: Funding for national highways has been reduced. Well, $621 million is a devastating reduction in a country crying out for better roads as our arteries are hammered by heavy road freight that should be on rail. Sydney-Melbourne rail freight, for example, has dropped from 50 per cent in 1972 to 20 per cent now. The green corps job scheme is welcome but will soak up but a minute fraction of the LEAP and other former labour market unemployed scheme participants who will not qualify for traineeships-perhaps 60 per cent of our unemployed. A one-stop employment and social security service will be achieved through closure of CES offices in many areas with resulting net loss of jobs. The MAATS system of apprenticeship and traineeships is very welcome. But the cost of implementing it will be at the expense of programs for the most desperate unemployed. It seems that the gold medallists of the jobless market will be catered for but the long-term unemployed will languish, too difficult to train, not potentially productive enough to attract the new bounty hunters of the labour market. 4658 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 Medicare services will allegedly be improved by closing Medicare offices and asking chemists to take over this complex task complete with fax machines and 1-800 lines for the old, the ill and the confused. In essence, this budget begins to balance the books. But it is too rigorous. In so doing, it creates an imbalance in our society that may well prove counterproductive, socially divisive and uneconomic, particularly for regional Australia. At a time when we need vision and renewed commitment to publicly funded soft and hard infrastructure this budget takes it away. At a time when we need to support job generation in regional Australia this budget does very little. Australians expect a mix of public and private ownership and investment; a mix of private and public employment. By reducing its own spending so severely and relying on the market place to fill the void, by expecting struggling users to pay more by shifting costs to the states, this government and this budget risk contracting the economy of regional Australia even more. 1996-97 on behalf of the people of McEwen; those families who have battled to make ends meet; the young people denied access to higher education or a job; the farmers who have survived drought and flood, volatile commodity prices and high production costs while competing in global markets; and small business people who have survived high interest rates, mounting compliance costs, unfair dismissal laws within a rigid labour market system and a tax system that actually penalised them for working hard and building up their businesses. I speak on behalf of all of these people who, for the first time in more than a decade, have an opportunity to break free from the legacy of disadvantage and dishonesty that has held them back and denied them opportunity. They know that we are entering a new era. This has been recognised by editorial comment throughout the country and is reflected in comments, like those of Terry McCrann, describing the budget as 'arguably, the only honest budget in living memory'. People realise that as a government we have not tried to hide the facts. We have stated right up front what the real problem is-a huge deficit of $10.3 billion with a rising level of debt, including a rapidly rising level of Commonwealth government debt moving over the past six years from $17 billion to $96 billion, an increase of 464 per cent, as a result of policies introduced by the previous government. The major task facing this government is to reduce that deficit and level of debt in the fairest possible way by providing measures to sustain growth and enable business to begin to thrive, while ensuring that those in real need in our communities are cared for. In order to achieve that, a substantial program of reform is needed. That is exactly what the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) has delivered in the first budget of the Howard government-a program of reform to reduce the rising levels of deficit and debt. As the Treasurer said, although we did not create these problems, we have taken the responsibility of fixing them. This will be achieved largely through expenditure savings, some reduction in tax expenditure, and a crackdown on tax avoidance. The hard decisions needed to begin the repair and reform of our economy are long overdue. People in my electorate are appreciative of the fact that this government is prepared to take strong measures but will do so in a way that is fair, balanced and responsible. There are no increases in income tax rates or company tax rates, nor are there any increases in wholesale tax or petrol excise. This budget offers hope and a revitalised future for our country.",163,Representatives Main Committee
439,Mrs Bailey (Mcewen) (12.27 P.m.),"I speak today on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1)Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4659 One of the key areas this budget will address is the enormous problem of unemployment that we currently have as a direct result of both monetary and fiscal policies pursued by the previous Keating government. The facts about levels of unemployment are these: throughout the 13 years of Labor government, unemployment reached levels that we have not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Much is being said by opposition members of late about unemployment targets. I am staggered that these people have the audacity to talk about numbers. Let us put these claims under closer scrutiny. Even though those levels of unemployment were high, they were not the true figure. We know that anyone who worked for a few hours a week was not counted as unemployed, and there were many thousands of people underemployed-working way below their level of qualification or getting only part-time employment and no opportunity to start a career. On top of this, thousands of people were shunted from one training program to another, the only outcome being placement in yet another training program, but no job. The opposition constantly refers to their Working Nation program as a success, but the reality is contained in a DEETYA report commissioned by the former government. This report found that Working Nation failed to assist the short-term unemployed, that it neglected the newly long-term unemployed, and above all, it found that labour market assistance had been changed from inexpensive programs with good outcomes to expensive programs with poor outcomes. It is the height of hypocrisy for these people, who were responsible for such failed programs, to criticise our government-after only months in office-for the unemployment levels that they created. It is also hypocritical for the opposition now to be demanding targets for unemployment, when even the now Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Beazley) said in 1993: Our commitment, as a government and as a nation, should not be any arbitrary unemployment number or rate. Our commitment must be to the reduction of unemployment as rapidly and as completely as possible. The Leader of the Opposition knows in his heart that setting targets for unemployment is not the main responsibility of government; it is to actually tackle the causes of unemployment. The opposition's claim that they could have achieved an unemployment rate of five per cent by the turn of the century is a fairy tale. Setting targets does not create jobs. The reality of the situation is-the people of McEwen recognised this on 2 March-that Labor's policies over the past 13 years have been the cause of unemployment, not the cure for it. Let us examine how the previous government destroyed people's chances of employment. They used monetary policy to create such a depressed economy, where small business-{)ur major employer group--battled high interest rates and lack of consumer confidence. We saw record numbers of business bankruptcies. Those who managed to survive those conditions then had to contend with unfair dismissal laws which resulted in thousands of small businesses ending up in court. An unfair provisional tax uplift factor, high compliance costs and a mountain of paperwork all restricted the ability of small business to become more competitive, more productive and more profitable-the very ingredients needed for growth and jobs. This budget removes those impediments. An amount of $180 million will be delivered back to provisional taxpayers because this government has already honoured its commitment to reduce this uplift factor of six per cent. This means that we have ended Labor's unfair practice of assessing small business for provisional tax on an income in excess of what they have earned. We have introduced 4660 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 legislation to end the unfair dismissal laws of the previous government. Small business will once again begin to employ people because they will not be penalised for doing so. The impact of capital gains tax in small business has been a serious issue for a very long time. The previous government had the Beddall report on small business for six years but did nothing. That report recommended major changes to tax-including capital gains tax--on small business, but it sat and gathered dust. Once again, this government has demonstrated its commitment to small business by introducing in this budget changes to capital gains tax, allowing profit to be rolled over in order to encourage small business to become bigger. It also allows those small business people-who have risked their capital, worked hard, supported themselves, provided employment for others and used their business both to provide a livelihood for themselves during their working life and to build up a nest egg for their retirement-to be exempt from capital gains tax up to a capital gain of $500,000. This budget also provides encouragement for employee shares as a form of savings through more generous tax treatment. All of these measures are designed to get government off the back and out of the pocket of small business and allow them to thrive in a, more flexible economic and labour market environment. The Australian electorate must be aware that the very people who, when in government, sat and did nothing to help small business employ more people are the same people who, in opposition, are crying crocodile tears about unemployment levels while preparing to vote against our measures of reform in this budget. In other words, they did precious little themselves while in 13 years of government and have now set a course of action to prevent this government from making the changes that they failed to make. We were elected to tackle this problem. People said that they had had enough of being told that this was as good as it gets, when all around they were confronted with the reality. In country towns and suburban shopping centres there were vacant shops that had previously supported a family and provided local employment, factories forced to reduce shift numbers, and farms that could no longer afford to employ. There was a massive shift from productivity to dependency as the CES list grew and numbers of social security recipients grew. That is what this government inherited after 13 years of Labor government. Those in opposition, the very people responsible for that legacy, are now the ones opposing and criticising aspects of reform that we want to introduce to fix the mess they created. They lack all credibility. However, we will not be deterred. People elected us to implement reform, and this budget is the beginning of the repair process. This budget marks a turning point for both young and old Australians; for families, for small business in the country and in the cities. Thirty per cent of young people who drop out of school before year 12 have had no option in the past other than to join an unemployment queue. We will change that. This budget makes provision for $187 million for the development of vocational education in schools. This means that young people not suited to, or who do not want to, study at the tertiary level will now be able to begin an apprenticeship at school and get a chance of a career and a job. The Australian Secondary Principals' Association has welcome this initiative by saying: At long last there is a recognition that vocational education is important to secondary schools and has a crucial place in the secondary curriculum. Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4661 Towards the end of the Keating government, the number of young people in apprenticeships had fallen to the lowest level as a proportion of the work force since the 1960s. This budget sets to repair this situation by appropriating $200 million over the next four years to modernise the apprenticeship system. There are new growth industries like information technology crying out for a highly skilled work force. By providing the funding and making the system more flexible to allow young people to work at multiple sites through group training means that we are providing a modem apprenticeship training system in tune not just with the 1990s but the next century. This gives hope and opens new pathways for young people. This budget focuses on providing the best results through traineeships, apprenticeships and encouraging businesses to take on employees by providing wage subsidies. This budget, Mr Deputy Speaker, also acknowledges the struggle so many families have had in making ends meet over the past decade by providing assistance to approximately 2 million low and middle income families. Eligible parents will receive an increase of $1,000 to the tax-free threshold. This means that a single income family with two children, with one under five, will receive an extra $34 a fortnight. This government has also honoured our election commitment to make private health insurance more affordable to low and middle income families by introducing in this budget a program of incentive payments. From1 July next year eligible families with dependent children will be entitled to receive an incentive of up to $450 per year paid either as an upfront reduction in their premiums or as a tax rebate. These two initiatives mean that eligible families with two dependent children who take out private health insurance will benefit by up to $51.90 a fortnight. We have developed a comprehensive strengthening family strategy to help prevent and overcome family breakdowns. This strategy incorporates measures to support families in times of financial, social and emotional crisis, strengthen relationships and help prevent child abuse, youth suicide and youth homelessness. Mr Deputy Speaker, families living in regional areas have undoubtedly been the hardest hit by the previous government--even to the extent of many of the farming families in the Seymour district of my electorate being denied access to drought relief. At a recent meeting of farming families from this region they readily acknowledged that they could do little to affect global commodity prices. What they want and have been trying to achieve throughout the Labor years of government is a reduction to their costs of production and to be able to operate in a more flexible labour market. They are sick to death of having to watch their products-which have been produced using the most cost-effective means available to themleave the farm gate and lose their competitive edge through the high costs of transport and fuel, and then face delays and further high costs on wharves due to inefficient work practices. This budget recognises the importance of regional areas to our national economy and recognises the hardships and special needs of people living in these regions by providing extra assistance for education, health, child care, landcare and road funding. The Prime Minister's announcement of the supermarket to Asia strategy is a tremendous boost to regional Australia. This not only recognises the advantage we have as wellrespected producers of clean, green produce from a disease-free environment and our proximity to the Asian markets, but acknowledges the role regional Australia will play in the future MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 , development of value-added products to an Asian food market estimated to be worth several hundred billions of dollars over the next decade. This future development, however, and the jobs that will be created in the process are dependent on us as a nation being able to harness our natural resources, talent and technology to take advantage of prospective markets. This budget underpins our future success in these areas. Yet again we find an opposition ready to put this development at risk by opposing aspects of this budget. The extension of the export market development grants for the tourist industry demonstrates a clear commitment by this government to encourage further development of this growing industry and highlights the inadequate response of the previous government to support this growth industry. Already there are tourist operators in my electorate eager to take advantage of this assistance and I can assure members of the opposition that they are watching very closely to see how they vote on this legislation. I mentioned earlier the advantages Australia has in producing clean, green food-and how important this is to us as a trading nation. We have this reputation because of our clean environment. However, in order to maintain that reputation as weJl as repair degraded areas, improve our water quality and control weeds and feral animals so that we can increase our levels of production and maintain our marketing edge, we must spend money on restoration of the environment. This budget makes provision for an additional $158 million over the next four years. But this is in addition to the $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust from the one-third privatisation of Telstra. Landcare groups in my electorate are already identifying areas in urgent need of repair that will benefit from this. There is $49 million to assist the states in expediting regional forest assessments in order to fulfil our commitment to implement the national forest policy statement. The central highlands of McEwen will benefit from this process. Once the NFPS is implemented, we will at long last have achieved a balance between protection of high conservation value areas and security for our timber industry, which in my area alone contributes almost $20 million to our national economy and over 600 jobs in the local area. Young people between the ages of 17 to 20 throughout McEwen will have the opportunity to participate in Green Corps and demonstrate their support for preserving and maintaining the environment in a very practical way while gaining valuable work experience. It is imperative that this budget be passed as soon as possible to enable us to begin the job of repairing our nation and restoring opportunity to all. I guess it is not hard to realise why we have been left with such a huge task of repair when the opposition is still not able to face the cold hard facts. Just a few days ago the immediate past Treasurer made some statements that defied all credibility when he said: Clearly, by the standards of comparable countries we do not have a budgetary problem, and we do not have a government debt problem. One can only wonder what sort of planet the members of the opposition are occupying. What it does say, however, is that they are continuing to delude themselves, but at the expense of people in my electorate. This budget is an honest start to begin the long haul of reducing crippling levels of deficit and debt, and restoring confidence. Any attempt by opposition or minor parties to block aspects of this budget -laces this process at risk. (Time expired) Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4663 to canvass a number of areas in the budget that relate directly to science and research and development, because I think they are quite critical areas and it is very important that we should highlight what the government has done in this budget to these vital areas of our national infrastructure. Unfortunately, as a society we are inclined to take science a little bit for granted these days. Those members who are of my generation will recall that the first lunar landings merited almost a full day of television coverage. There was blanket coverage by the news media of the day, and most of the population was transfixed by the spectacle and gave it a great deal of their attention. Now, I am afraid, this kind of event rates but a few minutes on national television. Indeed, often these things are not covered at all in the United States or in this country because they no longer attract an audience share of comparable size. This says a lot about the way in which our societies regard science, how they regard innovation and technological change. We live in an era of information overload. I am afraid the advances now come so quickly that the public are almost overcome by the rapidity of that change in the science and technology areas and are no longer able to differentiate it, to attune to it, in a way that they once did when the interval between progress and change was somewhat greater. There are dramatic effects of that in our economy because those changes in society and technology do lend themselves to substantial gains to our economy, to health, to all of those areas of applied science which we take so much for granted in our everyday lives. But, unfortunately, they do create a climate where budgets can sometimes ignore the impact of these vital areas on our national infrastructure-and this is one such budget. I, for one, believe it is vital that the public are informed about what has occurred here and that the information about the impact of this budget on science and technology and engineering is brought to public attention. This budget represents a very massive attack on innovation in this country. I think it is important to focus attention on the way in which it has attacked innovation in particular, because that is really what we are talking about. Fundamental research and development, whether it is in the pure or applied sciences or engineering disciplines, is vital to the process of innovation in our culture, and innovation is what leads to growth in national wealth. Throughout Australia's history we have relied on science, engineering and applied science to deliver the goods for our agriculture, mining, health and communications sectors-a wide range of our national infrastructure. It is on those things that we have accumulated wealth over the last ISO-plus years. Without science, without innovation, we would not have been able to achieve the national gains which we have made. It is vital, if we are to consolidate those gains, that budgets of government recognise, particularly at the national level, the vital importance of science, applied science, engineering and technology in delivering growth for the future. It is critical to examine firstly the area of reductions in research and development expenditure. They are perhaps the most dramatic or the most obvious in the budget. Some $2.25 billion will be saved over the next four years by a combination of reducing the taxation concession available for research and development from 150 per cent to 125 per cent and by abolishing altogether the syndication package. There has been a very small introduction of new funding under the so-called start program which will provide some additional funds for",168,Representatives Main Committee
440,Mr Martyn Evans (Bonython) (12.48 P.m.),"In speaking in this budget debate, I want4664 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 research and development, but it is minimal when compared to the dramatic cut which the research and development tax concession has suffered and which the abolition of the syndication scheme has brought about. Those two schemes between them, in their own way, have been responsible for ensuring that Australian industry was brought into the research and development revolution. Australia has always had a very strong background in public research and development. Our universities, CSIRO, ANSTO, AIMS-that whole range of public sector institutions-have always been at the forefront of world science research and development. Business, on the other hand, has never had quite such a strong commitment. In many cases, it has purchased research and development work from overseas, from parent companies or from other companies who have taken the technological lead. Or, alternatively, it has simply failed to undertake the necessary research and development to ensure that its product line was world's best practice, was at leading edge and was therefore able to grow with the world economy. The Labor government introduced the very substantial tax concession at 150 per cent. It introduced the syndication scheme to address the questions of those companies who are, in effect, cash poor; they have no current profitability because they are committing so much of their funding as a start-up company to research and development that they are not in the luxurious position of having to pay income tax which would, of course, mean generating a profit. So, by syndication, they are able to combine with those who do have taxable funds, profitable funds, and therefore have the opportunity to provide a cross-fertilisation in the industrial and private sector to ensure that new start-up entrepreneurial firms, vital for growth in the 21st century, are able to take advantage of the tax concessions available and are able to get some public assistance in their research investment. It is critical to have public assistance at the early stages of this process. I certainly do not believe that we should be providing public support, taxpayer support, to mature, well established companies who are able to generate sufficient funds for their own research and development over the longer term. But it is certainly vital that we provide initial start-up capital and that this is freely available to those who want to engage in early research and development, to get their products started and off the ground-a very good way in which syndication was able to address it. For longer-term research for the BHPs, the General Motors, the IBMs or whatever of this world-so long as that research is undertaken in Australia-the 150 per cent tax concession addressed their needs and certainly provided substantial encouragement for the board of directors to provide that funding. So combining those two schemes together creates a very good package. That was reflected in the increasing activity in the private sector research and development field that would have generated substantial gains to Australia in employment, in national wealth creation and in preserving our technological leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. We have put all of that at risk by cutting the R&D tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. We are now putting ourselves in the category of New Zealand, for example, where the tax concession was abolished and research and development has dropped dramatically. That is the kind of risk we take. People will compare us with our neighbours, Malaysia and Singapore, who offer 200 per cent concessions, perhaps under slightly more restrictive arrangements, Mr Deputy Speaker, but nonetheless under arrangements which are readily Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4665 accessible to firms which can easily relocate in this region. I think therein lies a very significant risk to this country. This government is undertaking a massive experiment in the research and development sector. If they are wrong, if that experiment demonstrates what I suggest it will, then Australia will be a very substantial loser. Research and development funding will go offshore; companies will be dissuaded from embarking on what is a very high-risk undertaking; they will buy proven research from overseas; and Australia will return to those days when we did not enjoy a substantial lead in this area. I think that is the grave risk of this massive experiment which the government is now undertaking for very short-term, financial expediency reasons. When we tum to the other side of the research coin, which is the public sector agenciesCSIRO, ANSTO, AIMS, to name the most prominent three-then, of course, a different historical picture needs to be taken into account. These organisations, along with the universities, have always maintained a very substantial public research sector presence in Australia. They have a great track record. Indeed, all honourable members, I think, would be well aware and proud of the record which agencies like CSIRO have maintained on behalf of Australia over the years. So how has this government rewarded them? At first, I thought, 'Very well.' The budget night speech of the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) indicated, to quote him directly, 'An additional $115 million will be provided to CSIRO.' My first thought was a very positive one, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I am sure it was for all honourable members. I thought, 'What exciting science and research projects CSIRO will be able to undertake with this very massive additional amount of money which this government has provided them!' But, like so many other aspects of this budget, when you begin the examine the fine print, that is when the disasters are revealed. Of course, what the Treasurer did not tell us on budget night-and I suspect that it was a very substantial misleading of the House in that regard-was that the fine print in the budget will take millions of dollars out of CSIRO's available funding and, indeed, over a period of the next triennium and beyond, will leave them $10 million or so worse off than they were before the budget. How will this occur? It will occur by an increase particularly in the efficiency dividend which now applies to all CSIRO activities. Under the previous government there was a modest efficiency dividend on administration, which was defined as 30 per cent of CSIRO's activities-a very modest efficiency dividend in that regard, which encouraged more efficient administration. That has now been extended to three per cent and it has been extended to cover the whole of CSIRO's programmed activities. That is a very massive withdrawal of funding from CSIRO. How is the government going to recover the rest of its $115 million additional grant? A new efficiency dividend of asset realisation was introduced to ensure that CSIRO would be required to sell buildings, to vacate premises, to liquidate other assets, which will ensure that a total of some $60 million or thereabouts is also returned to government coffers during the course of the triennium, and along with a few other minor measures, realising a few million each, the government will, in fact, recoup more than its $115 million touted additional investment in CSIRO. This will leave our premier public sector research agency about $10 million worse off as a result of this budget over the course of the next triennium. Look at the dividends which CSIRO has paid, not necessarily in immediate dollar terms, as this government now requires, but in public sector research terms. We have seen from that 4666 MAIN COMMIITEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 organisation, over several generations now, the benefits transferred to industry in the patents taken out and in the innovative and often brilliant public sector research. And how has this government rewarded that organisation? It has withdrawn funds from it in a quite deceitful way, given the Treasurer's initial statement on budget night, which will cost this nation dearly over the next few years. Similar consequences apply to other public sector agencies, like ANSTO and AIMS, which are now subject to the full three per cent efficiency dividend. So, even though, on the surface of this budget it would appear that there was no immediate or dramatic cutback in those agencies, when you take into account the insidious impact of that three per cent efficiency dividend, they will also be left worse off. I thought it was a nice juxtaposition to see the Minister for Science and Technology ( Mr McGauran) in a Meet the Press interview the other Sunday morning announcing an increase in the AIMS project of a marine science and technology policy for Australia while cutting 20 staff positions out of the AIMS budget. The net effect will be that an organisation, which even the minister admits has a valuable role to play in helping Australia develop its offshore resources, ocean based resources and other freshwater resources in the fisheries and marine area, will now see its funding significantly cut, with some 20 positions, including eight within the scientific projects area, also going. At a recent budget debate in the science community following the release of the August budget, the minister admitted that over the last six months he has spent so much time working out how to take money out of the science budget that he has not had time to develop a science policy or vision for this nation. So much of the vision that we saw before the election in terms of election commitments has been breached by this budget that I can understand why the minister now needs to prepare a fresh version of that. But I suspect that the community, and the scientific community in particular, will imply a vision for this minister in the absence of an articulated vision from him and that vision will be implied by the actions of this budget. We will have to conclude that his vision implies cuts, cuts and more cuts to public and private sector science. That is the vision for science that we have seen from this government. It was demonstrated within weeks of their taking office when the European southern observatory project was summarily cancelled-again, for short-term expediency in the budgetary sense but at a long term cost to the economic and technological development of this nation. The information technology industry, to tum to another aspect of our science based portfolio, has also done very badly out of this budget. Although there is some prospect that large multinational companies will benefit from the outsourcing bonanza which we might reasonably expect in 12 or so months time when the next budget is being put into place-because I suspect that this government is heading towards that kind of outcome in next year's budget statement-again, that will be at the cost of our local Australian software suppliers and our hardware suppliers as well. Those small to medium companies which have taken a very significant lead in Australian information technology over the last few years will now find that, in this budget imposed drought in IT, they have no role to play. Whether they will be around next year to take advantage of the outsourcing opportunities which the government will offer, I very much doubt. I also doubt the value of those potential outsourcing opportunities. Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4667 We have a situation now where the government has failed to deliver-in a way, thank goodness-on its promise to cut $1 billion out of IT over the next three years. It has admitted that election promise was totally unrealistic and absurd. But instead it has imposed a freeze on significant IT expenditure which will not only hold back savings in government administration, improvements in efficiency, and service delivery to clients, but will also impose an intolerable burden on small and medium sized Australian computer information technology suppliers, software suppliers, who will now have one of their larger customers simply telling them to go away for at least 12 months. I do not think that is a realistic position for many small companies; they will simply go under. The multinationals will wait it out and they will be around next year to pick up the large contracts which, I suspect, this government will offer. But this imposed drought, if you like, I also suspect will have a very negative outcome for our service delivery possibilities. IT now is one of those things that needs to be devolved in the power structure. We need to have individuals and departments making assessments about their own requirements and taking advantage of diversity within an overall framework. I understand that we cannot have anarchy prevailing here, but we certainly need to ensure that we capture the benefits of diversity and that we capture the benefits of innovation in client service delivery. Those are the things which we are in danger of losing in a government mandated whole-of-government approach which ensures that those outside government in the international computer companies are able to dominate our Australian industry in a way which is entirely at the cost of Australian companies. The majors-the EDSs, the IBMs and other like companies-have a valuable role to play in the provision of information technology services. I know a number of the people who operate in Australia on behalf of these companies. They provide a significant service to Australian business and to government, but their role must be clearly defined. It should not be to take over the whole of the operation; it should be to form strategic partnerships with departments where they have a special expertise and are able to offer something for the government to take. I suspect that this is an argument which we will be having next year, and will be a substantial one for this country. In conclusion, I ask: how has this budget dealt with science? The answer is: very harshly, very unfairly. There is a range of matters that I have not had a chance to talk about. The increase in HECS fees for university students in the science and engineering disciplines will be a severe disadvantage. The massive cutbacks to universities as a whole will undermine our ability to delivery on research and development in the sciences and in the engineering fields. Those areas are quite significant, as are the government's cutbacks in international collaboration. Just to take one example, the program on global change is likely to suffer government cuts in this area, and that will undermine our international reputation as well. Organisations like Telstra in mere anticipation of privatisation, are dramatically slashing their research activities. Those cuts in the Telstra research laboratories, for example, amount to 250 jobs in less than four years-almost half of their research effort. That is what they are doing while we think about privatisation, while the bill is still before the Senate. What happens were it ever, God forbid, to go through and Telstra actually were to be confronted with the reality of that situation? The whole of that research effort will also be undermined. Even small areas, like Internet access for members of parliament or the provision of these information technology 4668 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 services throughout the government, have been the subject of significant reductions in funding. (Time expired) 1996-97. The people in the electorate of Swan knew this government was about to deliver change, a change for the better. They knew that, while delivering our commitments to ensuring that Australian families were given greater security and greater opportunity, we would have an overriding responsibility to reduce our national debt. They were sick and tired of living on the bankcard and sick and tired of this great country having to do the same. We had to reduce a deficit caused by years of overspending, when money was directed into bandaid measures rather than long-term goals. The previous government were debt junkies who threw money at their problems and then had to find money to pay for it. The people of Swan knew that this government was going to change the way the health system and health insurance were administered. They knew that there would be changes in training and education. They knew that there would be changes to small business regulations. They knew that there would be industrial relations reforms. Superannuants were desperate for help and wanted to be treated as equals. Middle income families wanted relief from being underresourced and overtaxed. They wanted security for their and their children's futures. The Australian people knew of plans to privatise one-third of Telstra and of the National Heritage Trust which would begin the long overdue commitment to the environment of this nation. Most of all, Australians wanted the opportunity to pay their own way. They were tired of being on the end of handouts. The electorate of Swan-indeed, the people of Australiaknew that there would be these and many other changes. That is why this government clearly has a mandate to govern in a manner which demonstrates fiscal responsibility and prudent economic management. The Australian people now want this Howard coalition government to get on with the job that they were elected for. This government inherited an enormous amount of debt, larger than the people of Australia were told by the former government. The $8 billion Beazley black hole was our first shock. Now we are informed that it is more than $10 billion. As part of this budgetary process, this government has committed itself to a charter of budget honesty so that we will see the real figures that a new government inherits rather than the dishonest figures displayed by the previous government. This budget encapsulates some of the necessary measures for debt reduction. Australians generally do not mind taking the pain if they can see that it is being done for some net gain. The previous Labor government told us to endure the pain and things would improve but we were deceived because things only got worse. The previous government deserted their bluecollar supporters, who really needed their help at a time when the gap was widening more and more between the well off and the battlers. The net result was that the traditional blue-collar supporters of the ALP voted with their feet on 2 March and supported this government in their droves because they realised that they had been taken for granted, taken for a ride. This budget has been well received. The measures have had some criticism from the usual quarters but in SwanI generally have had a most favourable response. The electorate has indicated that they are willing to do their bit and learn to live with some sacrifice if it means a positive outcome. But this budget is not only about cuts. There also have been increases in many areas and shifts of funds, which often go unnoticed-and unnoticed by the media, as I have had to",173,Representatives Main Committee
441,Mr Randall (Swan) (1.09 P.m.),"I wish to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No.1)Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE 4669 explain to those in Swan who sought clarification on points in the budget. The Australian people are looking at the long term rather than asking how this will affect them today. That is the reason that this budget has been so well received. In Swan, youth unemployment was up to 30 per cent. That one-third of our youth was unemployed was totally unacceptable. At times, 12 per cent of the general population in Swan were unemployed; well above the state's average. This is a disgusting state of affairs in my electorate, given that the now Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Beazley) was in the best position to help these people as a former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, and then as the Deputy Prime Minister-but he did not. I kept hearing over and over again that the unemployed people-the youth and the older people who once upon a time had been able to find a job when they wanted--did not want to go from one training scheme to another and be caught in the bureaucratic labour market program cycle. They wished, at the end of their training, that they could find a job, a real job. The priority of the previous system of labour market programs was markedly different from that which we envisage for the future. Its priority often seemed to be its own administration rather than a focus on outcomes for clients. It was good at hiding the unemployed. The outcomes of these schemes were not fantastic. The numbers of people who found real jobs at the end of these training programs were not high enough to warrant the huge costs of their operations. Two-thirds of the people who went through the Working Nation schemes are still out of work. Some participants of these programs would then go on to further training at another institution, such as a T AFE, and repeat what they had already learned. Clients were course hopping. One example is the number of forklift drivers who were turned out of these sorts of courses for a very limited number of actual opportunities to be forklift drivers. That is not to say that training schemes are unnecessary. Some of the labour market programs run in my electorate of Swan were very well run and had high outcomes. Let me make it clear that I support training, but by efficient, genuine programs that offer the prospect of real jobs. I did witness duplication of services at some of the labour market programs in Swan. I saw at first hand the need for some cutbacks. Some courses being run by skillshare were also being offered at the T AFEs and at other tertiary institutions. Some of the courses offered by skillshare were not accredited courses and that made it difficult for some employers to accept clients because they did not have recognised qualifications. Over the next four years, the $5.4 million-plus that the government has allocated to labour market and training assistance will help those in the labour market to seek employment in a more performance and output orientated program. I support the implementation of the modem Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system, better known as MAATS, which will be partly funded by a considered reduction in labour market program funds. MAATS is this government's response to the fact that in 1995 the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships, as a proportion of the total work force, was at its lowest level in three decades. The previous Labor government deserted the apprenticeship scheme, which has resulted in a dearth of skilled tradespeople. Industry is now feeling the effects. This is demonstrated by the fact that one company in Perth, for example, has had to bring in some specialist welders from the Philippines. Current apprenticeship and training schemes do not allow for the schemes 4670 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 to extend to farriers and blacksmiths, for example. These people, once qualified, have the potential to earn immediately from $60,000 to $100,000 a year in their particular trade, but at the moment most farriers are self-taught and it is very hard to provide skilled training for these people because there are very few skilled people to train them. The previous system has failed these people by failing to train them properly. Too frequently in SwanI see the social ramifications of the years of not being able to find a job or be trained. I see the dysfunctional people who have lost their self-esteem and ego and self-respect. These effects last for years to come and not only permeate other areas of their lives but also often affect the other people in their lives. My electorate of Swan is the home of a large section of the West Australian racing industry. As much as there are apprenticeship schemes all around Australia which might have accommodated apprentice jockeys, these schemes have been largely ignored because of the lack of incentive and the lack of funding for quality trainers to take on the right sort of apprentice. The system now has done more to train strappers than potential jockeys. Under the modem Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system this has been corrected, and the right people are encouraged to find training. The new funding for MAA TS will make it more attractive for the better trainers to take on these budding heroes of the future. RecentlyI attended a hospitality awards presentation for apprentices at the Ascot Racecourse, which is in Swan. The participants were working in the industry and they were delighted that this budget had provided new funding for MAA TS of more than $200 million over four years. This will take the Commonwealth commitment for apprenticeships and traineeships to some $1.7 billion over four years, which is almost half of the $3.7 billion four-year training package announced by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Minister Kemp. I passionately support the removal in our workplace reform package of the Brereton unfair dismissal laws, which have been the greatest disincentive to job opportunities for young people. Together with training reforms and small business reforms, employers will have the incentive which has been missing for so long and which has hurt business and employment in Australia. An issue which has received support in my electorate has been the changes to the higher education system. Significantly, people welcome the fact that those who were likely to earn more at the completion of their degrees were going to contribute more personally than they did under the previous system. I know of only a few students who object to taking responsibility by contributing to their own education. In the last year, nearly half a million university places were filled across Australia and this simply could not have been done without the funds provided by HECS. I also support the government's decision to speed up the payback of HECS debts by lowering the income threshold. I was asked by a lawn-mowing contractor in Swan recently why his $24,000-a-year income had to pay for someone to be educated, while a graduate earning $24,000 in the first year or two did not have to pay any extra. I could not really answer this, because it was unfair and inequitable. Now, though, the minimum income threshold is $20,701, and this only attracts repayment of less than $12 per week, which will barely affect the lifestyles of future Australian graduates. Through the changes to the higher education system, this government has addressed yet another situation where those who could least afford to were subsidising higher income earners. Again, it has received the support of my electorate, which I am certain is indicative of other marginal seats in Australia. Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE 4671 That leads me to comment on the health system and private health insurance. This government has made a genuine attempt to make the Australian health system universally available. The private health sector has run down from approximately 60 per cent of Australians being privately insured to the current deplorable state where only approximately 30 per cent are privately insured. The result is that there are fewer places in the public health system because those who could be privately insured do not have the incentive to stay. To address this, this budget delivers our pre-election commitment that those who can afford to be privately insured will be encouraged to do so, and those who do not wish to be privately insured and who can afford to will pay more in the Medicare levy. This principle will free up hospital places and facilities for those who are genuinely in need and will have the effect of injecting more funds into our beleaguered health system, which has previously been stripped of this vital capital. Older Australians, families and the less well off can take comfort from such a decision because Medicare will certainly stay to service them. I am happy to say that for the families of Australia, and the families in Swan in particular, this government has delivered on its commitment to ease the financial burden experienced by so many families. In particular, low and middle income families in Swan with an income of less than $70,000 per annum have welcomed the raising of the tax-free threshold by $1,000 for each dependent child. The $6 million over the next three years to increase marriage and relationship education services to the community will contribute to assisting families to stay together. This government is serious when it says that the family is the cornerstone of our society, and we are providing genuine support in the form of these types of budget measures. It is my honour to be in this Main Committee to endorse the first Howard-Costello budget which delivers the pre-election commitments to all Australians. Some tough decisions needed to be made in this budget so that our country can be returned to the status that it deserves in the world community. My belief is that the majority of my constituents in Swan understand and appreciate that these decisions needed to be taken. However, a government which cynically keeps an eye on the popular polls, rather than on those it is committed to serve, is really a government which lives on the edge and does not deserve the support of the people who placed their faith in it on 2 March. I commend this budget to the people of Swan and to the people of Australia. Sitting suspended from 1.23 to 4.32 p.m. Mr SA WFORD (Port Adelaide) (4.32 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, the greatest challenge for all governments in the industrialised world is to address two basic fundamentals: firstly, the fair distribution of income; and, secondly, the attainment of full employment. This budget does neither. This is a poll-driven budget but without a coherent game plan. This is a budget without the vision thing. This is a budget with a flawed rationale. This is a budget that encourages processes that divide, exclude and ignore. This is a budget based on ill-founded assumptions. The Liberals say this hudget is framed to overcome Australia's biggest problems of debt and deficit. The Liberals tell Australians that the Australian economy is somehow in deep, dire trouble as far as debt and deficit is concerned. What is the real truth about debt and deficit in Australia? According to the criteria of the European Monetary Union, Australia has the fourth lowest debt in the industrialised world. What about the deficit? Australia has the third lowest deficit in the industrialised world. That is the real truth. 4672 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 Under Labor, Australia developed an economy that was internationally and widely accepted as one of integrity and quality. A couple of months ago the Australian economy was confirmed by the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) as sound. So what is all this nonsense about a budget to deal with debt and deficit? This is an assumption that is clearly wrong. This is also a government that says its WROLA bill, the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, will mean higher productivity which will lead to more employment. It is therefore worth examining that assumption. Over the past 50 years in the industrialised world the following has occurred: capital investment has quadrupled; energy consumption has tripled; productivity has tripled; but-and this is a very big but-employment has grown by only a third. Higher productivity does not lead to higher employment. The government is wrong. This is also a government that believes in downsizing and that it leads to higher productivity and efficiency. It does not. Its guru, Stephen Roach, said so and has clearly rejected the benefits of downsizing. Corporations and business will not deliver full employment. Why would they? Downsizing does not produce higher productivity. It does increase the unfair distribution of income-the gap between rich and poor simply gets bigger with downsizing. Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a budget based on flawed assumptions. The debt and deficit argument is wrong. The higher productivity-higher unemployment link is wrong. The downsizing link to productivity is wrong. But the wrong-headed thinking of the government continues. The supposed links of budget surpluses to interest rates is wrong. The claim that privatisation is better than a public sector is wrong. The Liberals say that Labor's opposition to $425 million of the budget bottom line will risk rises in interest rates. Beg your pardon? Run that past me again. At the end of the 1980s, Labor was running budget surpluses and interest rates were 15 per cent. The Prime Minister's attempt to create a connection between interest rates and surpluses is clearly wrong. The Liberals say that privatisation works better than the public sector, is more productive and gives greater dividends to consumers. Wrong, wrong, wrong. It is competition, not privatisation, that gives lower prices to consumers. Labor has never said, and does not say now, that our economy is not without problems. Obviously we have a national savings problem which we addressed with a superannuation scheme. There is also a current account deficit problem, to which curiously I have not heard one reference from the government. Labor could have achieved a budget balance in the lifetime of this parliament, but without the savagery of this budget's cruelty to vulnerable Australians. The Liberals' budget strategy of taking nearly $8 billion out of the economy will contract growth and employment. And yes, the Liberals admitted it in the budget papers. They project no more than 3Y2 per cent growth right through to the tum of the century. There is no target for growth, there is no target for employment. As I said, this budget has no game plan. This budget gives no direction. The Liberals have not got the faintest idea where they are going. And there is the sad irony: they do not know where they are going and there is a great likelihood they will end up somewhere else. The great pity of that scenario is that millions of Australians will be seriously harmed in the process. By contrast, Labor's budget strategy would have achieved a balance in 1998-99. Labor would have had growth of 4 per cent over the next three or four years. Under Labor that would Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE 4673 have meant more jobs; under Labor that would have meant more private income; under Labor that would have meant more savings; and under Labor that would have meant more government revenue. The reasoning in the Liberal's budget is flawed. It is a blatant betrayal of the ordinary working people of this country, who will pay for this failure. The budget will do nothing for what the Prime Minister said before the March election was Australia's most pressing problem, that of unemployment. By the government's own admission, the budget will do nothing for unemployment at all. The government agrees there is no hope of a brighter outlook for the jobless in the foreseeable future. If this is their number one priority, then they have already admitted failure and broken their promise to Australia and to Australians. Of course, it is clear that, having attained government by claiming that they care about the unemployed and by claiming that they will continue to provide opportunities for people to retrain for the workplace, that priority has been quickly abandoned. It is just a bit of trickery, really-cruel trickery. No longer do you hear people on the government side saying that unemployment is the country's most pressing problem. These days they say the most pressing problem is the deficit. Before the election, they portrayed themselves as being compassionate, saying that they would frame their policies to create jobs. After winning government, though, what has happened? They have shed the costume and framed a cruel budget based on false assumptions. The government has abandoned those who are looking for work and those who are facing redundancy for the deficit-the third lowest deficit in the industrialised world? So much for their care about the needs of people, about the plight of the unemployed. This budget completely abolishes $1.8 billion worth of job training and reskilling programs for those seeking work. It abandons all those who are looking for work, young and old, a decision that will deny 230,000 people the training and the skilling they need in order to get ready for the workplace. The truth is that creating jobs was not a priority in the framing of this budget; it was not even a factor. It has been shuffled a long way down the list of priorities, down as far as it has always been for conservative governments. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) said on television the other night that if unemployment does not come down then the government does not deserve to be re-elected. But it has already demonstrated that it is not willing to formulate a budget designed to bring down unemployment. This budget will actually make people sick. This budget ruins the quality of health care. There are direct cuts to health care. There are huge cuts in funding to the states, which means that the states will cut health funding. There is also evidence of the first steps in the dismantling of Medicare. Despite the government promising that its policies would not entail cuts to public hospitals, the budget does just that-lopping around $800 million off public hospital funding. The abolition of the Commonwealth dental care program, which provided basic and emergency dental care to health card and Commonwealth seniors card holders, is a particularly mean and heartless act which will bring greater hardship to low income people and particularly the aged. The Liberals promised to maintain Medicare in its entirety, but in their first budget the promise has already been betrayed. This budget reduces rebates for certain items and increases 4674 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 the maximum patient payment-signposts on the road to dismantlement of the most popular, most successful and fairest health care system this country has ever had. But that is nothing too surprising. The Prime Minister has been a lifelong opponent of a fair and a decent health care system, and his squinty-eyed protestations to the contrary during the election campaign can now be seen for what they were. The coalition also promised to maintain the Medicare levy at 1Y2 per cent. That promise is broken. The budget contains a lot more broken promises, all of which will mean greater hardship for aged pensioners and other beneficiaries. For example, the coalition had promised to maintain the real value of rent assistance. That promise is broken. The budget increases the pharmaceutical benefits scheme co-payment for all health card holders without offering any compensation whatsoever, which effectively cuts the real value of pensions and other benefits. The coalition promised to maintain the real value of pensions and benefits. That promise is broken. The coalition promised not to force those eligible for the disability support pension onto unemployment or other benefits. That promise is broken. It promised to maintain a lump sum advance system. That promise is broken. It promised to introduce a pension bonus plan. That promise is broken. The list goes on. But it is easy to expect the Liberals to frame a budget which hits low income people and beneficiaries the hardest-they always do it. This budget, however, also attacks those on middle incomes: the middle Australia the Prime Minister wanted to feel relaxed and comfortable; the middle Australia the Prime Minister claimed had faired badly and deserved extra support. In fact, it is middle Australia who will feel the brunt of this government's ideological, zealous, irrational cost-cutting. For families with incomes in the middle range, the small tax cuts offered will be more than countered by a whole raft of increased charges. For example, families will have to pay more for child care; they will have to pay more to give their children a decent education; they will have to pay more to have their elderly parents looked after in a nursing home; and they will have to pay more for hospital and medical care. Take child care, for example. Those using community-based child care will have to find an additional $14 a week. That alone is far more than what they will get with the tax cuts. In all, the government is taking $500 million out of child care and it is that amount that parents across the country will have to pay from their own pockets to make up the shortfall. But the Prime Minister also wants the middle range family to pay for the nursing home care for their ageing parents. They may be asked to find $26,000 to buy them entry into a nursing home-maybe more-and then face the new daily fee of up to $34 a day. How will families on middle incomes afford these extra imposts? For those aged persons living in their own homes and utilising the range of services provided under Labor's home and community care program, higher user-pay charges will apply. Again, it is their children and their families who will have to foot the bill-and add the increase to $20 per script for prescription drugs. But while middle Australia has been hit very hard, it is a budget which will bring perhaps the greatest hardship to older Australians. Firstly, they will be hit with the abolition of the dental health program and next by the failure of the government to adjust the deeming rate to reflect lower interest rates attainable by age pensioners on their savings without having to put their money at risk. The budget cuts the real incomes of age pensioners. And changes in Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4675 superannuation will unfairly deplete the retirement incomes of those people who retire or who are retrenched at 55 years of age. This budget will also bring hardship because of its failure to support business. The budget abolishes the research and development syndication, despite the coalition praising it before the election, and reduces the tax concession rate for research and development. These broken promises, along with cuts to a range of schemes and programs like Austrade and Auslndustry, will severely retard small to medium enterprises in their pursuit of innovation and excellence. Is this not the very thing this country needs to create employment and turn around our terms of trade? There are broken promises in almost every area of government administration most of which I have not even time to mention here. For example, the cuts in Aboriginal programs were a vicious, callous and totally unwarranted attack on some of the most vulnerable people in our community. Another example is the $1.4 billion to be paid by university students in payments and repayments of their course fees. Another broken promise. Those who remember the Prime Minister when he was the former Liberal Treasurer do not find the broken promises surprising. Nothing has changed in the Prime Minister's head, but he has employed, I admit, better make-over people. Other broken promises include: cuts to the environment, roads-$622 million-tourism, trade, the ABC, education, the arts, foreign aid, and on it goes. The Prime Minister made a big play in the lead-up to the election about promising Australians a comfortable and a relaxed nation. That promise is broken. This budget will eventually make a lot of people in Australia very uncomfortable and very anxious while at the same time it will send this country intellectually to sleep. This budget makes almost every sector of the Australian community pay more for the services they currently enjoy while completely abolishing other important services, typically those services which assist those most in need. The focus of the attack on those most in need was, however, predictable. Conservative governments compulsively attack those in need the hardest. But what was even surprising to me, and not predictable, was the extent to which middle Australia will be made to pay for this budget. And pay they will, for everything from child care, to health care, to education for their children and nursing home care for their ageing parents. But the budget's big failure is a failure to steer the country, a failure to lead. This is the failure which follows inevitably from the failure of vision. This government has no vision for this country. It has no clear view of where it wants to go. This much we know from the budget. This is a budget steering us nowhere in particular. It is a dead hand-as Kim Beazley has said-on the national tiller. Conservative governments do not lead. Instead, they hand over government to a particular stream of the bureaucracy, to the public servants from Treasury and Finance, who are just the captives of the financial markets. They do not make policy to drive Australia forward; they let their departments in Canberra shuffle the cards. They do not roll up their sleeves and work at the engine of government; they wash their hands of the responsibility of government. They put the country to sleep. In that respect, this budget returns Australia to the sleepwalking days of the 1950s and 1960s, and even the late 1970s-the era when opportunity passed this country by, the era when our national economic infrastructure developed the great structural faults which Labor has, 4676 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 for the last 13 years, sought to mend. It was the era of the big, irresponsible conservative yawn. True to form, this is a budget which will send Australia to sleep. It is a budget devoid of vision and it is based on false assumptions. It is a product of ideological zealotry, of a frenzy of cost cutting for the wrong reasons, of a failure to reason and of a complete absence of compassion. It is a budget without the spine of common sense evident in all sensible and responsible offerings. It is a budget that will take this country nowhere. And it is a budget that will cause great hardship for most in our community-and the greatest hardship will have to be borne by those with the greatest need. The budget slashes billions of dollars out of government programs-and those billions of dollars are going to have to be found by ordinary working Australians. It is a complete fabrication for the government to argue that the hardship they are inflicting upon Australians with this budget is a harsh but necessary medicine. It is a medicine forced down the throat of a healthy economy, a cure for a non-existent illness. The real reason is simply ideological zealotry. They do not see a role for government in assisting people in our community who are in need. They do not see a role for leadership. They believe in a crass sort of individualism which, in their thinking, overrides any sense of collective responsibility for the country and the community we are building. They think that, if people are in need of government assistance, they have not worked hard enough. They submit to the fundamentally flawed idea that somebody's failure to get a job, or hold a job, is that person's own fault. You look at the budget papers and you think, 'What is the matter with this word ""unemployment""?' The old word processor got a bit of a blip, didn't it? You hardly see a mention of it anywhere. This Liberal government also commits itself to the fundamentally stupid idea that, if somebody gets sick, then it is their responsibility to be able to pay for the medical treatment they need. If they or their kids cannot afford to go to the dentist or to the doctor or to have an education, the government's view-according to this budget-is that they therefore do not deserve any of these services. There are three members of the opposition here-I mean the government. I cannot get used to it, can I? Ms Gambaro--It will be the case for a while, too. Mr SA WFORD-I remember the times before Medicare, when aged people, vulnerable people, sat in doctors' surgeries from nine o'clock to five or six o'clock at night and were then told to come back again. This is the era that you are going to bring us back to. Or perhaps the message of this budget is that people who cannot afford dental care should resort to the practice of 50 years ago and get all their teeth pulled out in order to avoid the cost of dental care altogether. Government members interjecting Mr SA WFORD-A bit sensitive to that, are you? The conservatives have always been big on whips and punishments. The government's ideological position leaves no room for the idea of collective responsibility, for fairness or equality of opportunity. They subordinate those principles and guiding thoughts to the notions of individual rights and user pays, regardless of the capacity to pay. Just like any plan with concocted wrong reasons, it will fail. This budget was framed on debt and deficit and that has clearly made the proposition unworkable. It is simply not true. This is a government that framed the budget and said that higher productivity will lead to higher employment. Wrong. This is a government that says Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE 4677 downsizing will lead to more productivity. Wrong. This is a government that links interest rates to surpluses. Wrong. They are the four frameworks, the four parameters, on which you have based this budget. Can you not see that, if you base it on the wrong reasons, then the fundamentals in terms of the processes and the outcomes that you deliver are going to be wrong? This Howard-Costello budget will fail all Australians. So much for a government elected on the slogan, 'For all of us.' There are on the government side perhaps 35 new members and probably 30 of them-at least 20 of them-are in for the short stay in parliament. They are in for the short stay in parliament because when you come new to this place it is a bit of a culture shock for all of us. But they have been manipulated. Their lack of experience in the place has seen them agree to a budget that is going to harm many people in their constituencies, and when it comes to September 1997 everyone in their electorates will know. (Time expired) Australians in this great nation of ours? Could it be a glimmer of hope to some? Yes, I think so. Could it be the green light for small business that will instil economic confidence? Once again I think so. There are many initiatives in this budget. The most important is the reaction of the financial markets to reduce interest rates as a result of the sound policy decisions of this government for reducing the mas<;ive debt left by the opposition. This has had a major effect on home owners and small business people who have suffered for far too long. Yet there is more to come, a lot more. When the coalition's industrial relations reform passes the Senate it will rectify a number of the anomalies that have been holding small business back. They will then be able to start employing people and creating real jobs. We will also be encouraging small business to take on more apprentices and trainees instead of running costly training programs in basket making, for instance, only to see those involved return to the unemployment queues. The reduction of the provisional tax uplift factor will provide a great boost to the small business sector, as will the allowance to claim an exemption from capital gains tax up to $500,000 on the sale of a business when proceeds are used for retirement. The small business task force investigation will also provide a lot of the answers the business community is asking for, such as a reduction in bureaucratic red tape and paperwork. I have a vision for the electorate of Capricornia. I have set goals that I expect to achieve. Some may say that I will never get the money from government to put major infrastructure into my electorate, such as extending the dam wall at Mount Morgan and building a dam in the Dawson Valley. And the many other projects that will follow will reduce unemployment in my area. However, I am used to working with knockers, people who focus on the tall poppy syndrome and only want to knock one's tireless efforts. There are those who knock the many initiatives in this budget that have been carefully planned for the people. I say to those people that the new Austrade office will give producers of any product the ability to directly trade overseas from my electorate of Capricornia; there is the $1 million for accommodation at Shoalwater Bay for the military; and there is the 6.25 per cent increase to local government in untied financial assistance and road funding grants. I am proud to say I had great pleasure in championing these projects for my electorate.",178,Representatives Main Committee
442,Mr Marek (Capricornia) (4.52 P.m.),"What does this national coalition budget mean to4678 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 The increased funding to local government in Queensland became a very real need to me as I was a councillor on the Belyando Shire Council in Capricornia. My council colleagues, including the mayor of the Belyando Shire Council, Councillor Jim Turner, Councillor Margaret Henn, Councillors Mary and Dale Langford and Councillor Arthur Plate-just to name a few-always instilled in me the need to fight for increased funding for local shires. This was followed up by reams of paperwork and literature passed on to me by the chief executive officer of the Belyando Shire Council, Mr Alan Lambert. This paperwork was generated in an effort to receive the result that the executive director of the Queensland Local Government Association, Mr Greg Hallam, called for when he lobbied all candidates prior to the 2 March election. Another institution in Capricornia also received funding. I hate to mention it, really, because I know it really sticks in the throat of the member for Hotham( Mr Crean). I mean that it sticks in his throat, for he is still trying to get his foot out of his mouth after his statements, made to the media while visiting my electorate, regarding the funding shortfall to the Central Queensland University. To his surprise, it just so happens that the university received a nine per cent increase in its funding over the next three years, and not a cut. The vice-chancellor and the acting president of the student union have both come out saying they are pleased with the budget outcomes. Back to the knockers. I consider myself a rather humble sort of man. I say this with great passion: apart from my Christian views on life, my good wife, Leica, and those close to me in my family, nothing else is as important to me as the people of Capricornia. With this thick hide and these broad shoulders I will soldier on to provide a result to my employers at homethe residents of Capricornia. No matter where you go, you cannot please everyone. I understand this. More to the point, people do not mind change as long as it is not to them. So, if changes to social security hurt some, or certain jobs are lost because funding has run out, I say, 'Don't despair, there will be other opportunities out there for you.' To this end, I will continue to make representations to this government to continue to receive money for projects that will give full-time jobs, not just twoto three-month training programs that lift your hopes and then throw you back on the unemployment queues. With this coalition budget, I see new initiatives that will cause my electorate of Capricornia to prosper and grow. It is a shame the other side of the House will not look ahead to see the big picture. It is very clear to me that until politicians from both sides of the fence scrum together and put forward constructive criticism that is to the benefit of this great nation we will continue to have people miss out, owing to ego-driven individuals who are not prepared to wear a little humble pie for the good of this country. After my previous statement, it would be remiss of me not to point out an area that I will continue to lobby the Minister for Health and Family Services( Mr Wooldridge) on. That is operational subsidies to community based child-care centres. I am concerned that some of these centres in my electorate will suffer as a consequence of this decision. Some of these centres are in drought-stricken areas where the money is tight. There are a number of single mothers who have to go out to work to make ends meet. I take on board the fact that these cuts only bring all the centres into line with the privately owned centres, which is fair to all. So, at this stage, until the smoke clears and we can see Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4679 exactly what will be the end result of this initiative, I will continue to monitor the funding cuts. Another issue I will be taking up, with the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), is the 500 per cent increase in the environment management charge, which, because it was introduced to be effective immediately, will hurt a number of tourist operators in my electorate and the adjoining electorates of Wide Bay, Hinkler, Dawson, Herbert and Leichhardt. I strongly support my coalition colleagues in opposing this increase as it stands. Together, I am sure we will convince the minister to reconsider the implications that this increase will have for our tourism industry. While it is fair enough to charge tourists for the costs of maintaining the reef and the local environment, it is not fair to impose the charge on the local operators-which is exactly what this does-as they cannot pass the increased charge on to pre-booked tourists. While I am on the subject of the environmental management charge increase, I was astounded today to be handed a press release issued by the ex-Speaker of the House, the member for Cunningham ( Mr Martin), which claimed the coalition members affected by this increase had voted against a motion to debate it. This grubby attempt by the member for Cunningham to politicise the amicable negotiation efforts of the south-east Queensland members in this important matter is nothing more than a blatant lie. It is a typical political stunt by the opposition to pull on a debate ahead of its time. statement. refer to members of the House by theirimplication that he is a liar. problem was there and his statements were not fair. On another sensitive subject, I heard the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission kick up a stink over shortfalls to funding to its previously exaggerated budget. I have seen Aboriginal people miss out on the necessities of life such as housing, health care and education owing to the wealthy administration of ATSIC and to its commissioners not passing the money down the line to the people who really need it. Until the commission proves there are no inequities in its system and stands accountable to the public, then a cut to A TSIC is warranted. In relation to ATSIC and its rules for one and not another, let me raise the issue of ATSIC's election of office bearers. ATSIC holds secret ballots and conducts non-compulsory voting to elect its representatives. This is completely opposite to the Australian parliamentary system of electing representatives. ATSIC calls for equality and reconciliation, yet it is not prepared to adopt a democratic and accountable system for its people. There are many people in this country whose ancestors were sent here in chains for offences that today we regard as petty. They did not have a choice but were taken from their families and dumped in a strange land across the seas, thousands of miles from their homes. Would it be unfair to say then that they have equal claims? Two hundred years later, would it not",187,Representatives Main Committee

But that does not change the fact that the4680 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 be fair for their ancestors to expect the Australian taxpayer to keep them in the same way as the Aborigines? I do not think any other Australian would expect that either. In relation to ATSIC and its rules for one and not another, I must say on behalf of all those good black and white Australians out there that, while there are two sets of rules for the people of this great nation, the country will continue to be divided. I have heard some individuals complain about the changes to HECS, but for every one who has complained I have heard four others who say it is about time the system was made fair and equitable. To explain this, an example is called for. I have a friend called Scott who has a truck courier business that operates from Rockhampton throughout the central Queensland area. This is a good example. To get his start in life, Scott chose to buy a truck. He paid up front. I think he even had to borrow the money from a lending institution. For Scott, it was an upfront investment fee of say $60,000. What would he expect to net after mechanical expenses and fuel running costs to the truck? Maybe $55,000 a year income. Now let us look at the HECS scheme previous to the proposed changes. Students could study at university, complete a course-or should I say, purchase an investment or asset from the Commonwealth-at approximately $2,500 a year and not pay it back until they were employed and/or earning an income of $28,500 a year. With this in mind, it is not hard to argue the case for change. It is a person's decision to purchase the asset in relation to the income they wish to make. I will explain. A degree in teaching may give an annual return of say $35,000 to $40,000 a year, therefore a relatively low HECS fee should be considered. A student wishing to purchase an asset that has the capacity to earn say $200,000 to $300,000 a year should have to pay more for his or her investment or asset. The repayments for that asset are worked out on a percentage of their income after they begin to earn $20,000 per annum and then not until they have the capacity to pay it back, which means it could be some time before they start work-many students I know shoot off overseas for a well-deserved break before getting into full-time employment. They are not even compelled to start making payments until they have a job. Under these circumstances, this is a fair initiative. I say to one and all the cuts to every area had to come. We cannot afford to continue to throw money at everything that moves. We have to tighten our belts a little or the childrenyes, our future generations-will be left with a country, or more to the fact, Mr Deputy Speaker, they will be left with nothing for we will have written cheques that our taxpayers cannot afford to pay. It is time to put our best foot forward and not take a selfish outlook on life and give this country the future of love and prosperity. appropriations and speak on the budget. I support the amendment moved by the member for Holt( Mr Gareth Evans). This is Jobless Johnny's first budget and it is a very disappointing budget. There is no growth, no jobs and no job certainty. When one discusses the appropriation bill it is always important and relevant to look at some of the macro-economic framework that the budget is placed in. When you look at the macro-economic framework you see that things are not looking good so far as growth in the economy is concerned, so far as jobs and job certainty and security are concerned and so far as unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, is concerned.",189,Representatives Main Committee
449,Mr Stephen Smith (Perth) (5.06 P.m.),"I am very pleased to take part in theWednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE 4681 I will not actually start with the budget paper. I will start with a very important part of members' reading in this place and that is the 1996 annual report of the Reserve Bank which the former Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Fraser, signed off on 6 August. It is a nice prelude to the budget on 20 August and at page 11 the board refers to the labour market and says as follows: Employment growth was broadly in line with the path of economic activity but the within-year movements were quite variable and their interpretation was complicated by uncertainties relating to the data. Over the year, employment rose by 1.0 per cent compared with 4% per cent during the previous year. The slowing was evident among both part-time and fUll-time workers but was more pronounced among full time workers. Despite the slower growth in 1995-96, employment has increased by around 10 per cent or over 750,000 since the trough of the recession in mid 1991. Over [fie past 18 months the slowing in employment has been more pronounced than the slowing in economic growth. So the scene for the budget on 20 August as signed off by the Governor of the Reserve Bank is a slowing in employment and a slowing in economic growth. When you move on in the board's report to pages 12 and 13, the board has this to say: The unemployment rate was largely unchanged over the year at around 8V2 per cent. Long-term unemployment continued to fall in 1995-96 with the unemployment for those out of work for more than a year falling to 21;,1 per cent of the total labour force. This is still higher than for much of the 1980s but well down on the peak of the above 4 per cent recorded in mid 1993. The concentration of unemployment among certain groups in the community suggests that, while lasting reductions in unemployment require sustained growth and economic activity, combined with restraints in labour costs, there is also a role for training and other programs targeted at groups figuring prominently among the unemployed. What is the board saying here? The board is handcuffing itself, as the previous government did with the Working Nation white paper, to the notion of the need for economic growth to create employment and the need for programs aimed directly at unemployed, particularly long term unemployed. I repeat what the board had to say, ' ... there is also a role for training and other programs targeted at groups figuring prominently among the unemployed'. That is why it is so distressing to see a budget which has no economic growth, therefore no prospects for employment growth, no prospects for reduction in long-term unemployment and, at the same time, a massive reduction in the expenditure out laid for those programs which are aimed at trying to give the long-term unemployed, in particular, a chance at employment. When you tum to the budget itself, some 14 days after the Governor of the Reserve Bank signed off the bank's 1996 report, if I refer the committee to Budget Paper No.1, it is interesting to see how through the macro-economic forecasts and statements in Budget Paper No.1, you get a very clear understanding of the notion of no jobs, no growth, higher unemployment and higher long-term unemployment. In some other matters I will refer to subsequently, I think that we will see that these forecasts are now a bit tenuous and in some respects are optimistic. At table 6 at page 1-20 of Budget Paper No.1 we find the forecasts for growth or real GDP. The forecast for 1996-97 is 3V2 per cent; for 1997-98,3 1,4 per cent; for 1998-99, 3V2 per cent; and for 1999-2000, 3V2 per cent. All are forecast below four per cent, which is that percentage of economic growth generally regarded as the percentage you need to make some inroads into unemployment. Anything less than four per cent is basically just picking up those newer entrants to the labour market. Page 2-3 states: Economic growth is expected to continue at a firm and sustainable pace in 1996-97 with GDP forecast to rise by 3V2 per cent. 4682 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 There are two things here: again, confirmation that we are looking at modest proportions of economic growth, but also there is a bit of an illusion here-I frankly do not regard 3Y2 per cent of growth as firm and sustainable or, as it is referred to subsequently in the papers, as 'a forecast for strong growth'. It is simply growth in the economy that is barely enough to take care of those newer entrants to the labour market. Moving on, under the heading 'Employment and Unemployment' at 2-15 of Budget Paper No.1, we find the budget paper saying: Despite continued fairly rapid growth in year average terms, employment growth eased significantly through the course of 1995-96, increasing by around one per cent in the year to the June quarter 1996 compared with 4.8 per cent in the previous year. At page 2-20: Australia's economic outlook is for another year of strong growth. I do not regard 3Y2 per cent as strong growth. And the final comment in the macro-economic section of Budget Paper No.1, again under 'Employment and Unemployment': With continued non-farm GDP growth and an expected deceleration in real wage growth, employment growth should accelerate through 1996-97. However, a slowing in employment growth in year average terms is likely given the weak outcomes in the second half of 1995-96. The current level of job vacancies and the expectations reported in business surveys, support a short-term outlook of modest employment growth. Increasing employment opportunities and higher real wages through the course of 1996-97, should encourage people to re-enter or enter the work force, resulting in modest rises in the participation rate. With the labour force expected to grow solidly through 1996-97, the unemployment rate is expected to decline only gradually to around 8t.4 per cent in the June quarter 1997 compared with 8.6 per cent in the June quarter 1996. On the budget paper's assessment, which I will argue is now in a sense an optimistic assessment as far as employment and unemployment is concerned, and a massively optimistic assessment so far as defining 3Y2 per cent growth as strong, the key element arising out of this budget is no jobs, no growth, no job certainty. Jobless Johnny has really set himself to his nickname with this particular budget. But shortly after the budget we find in the Australian on Friday, 6 September the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, saying: Long-term jobless may rise with reforms. The federal government's radical redesign of labour market assistance might not reduce the number of long-term unemployed, Minister Vanstone conceded yesterday. Senator Vanstone said it was, 'theoretically possible that long-term unemployment would rise.' For 'theoretically possible', read 'absolutely sure and certain' because what have we seen since budget day? What we have seen since budget day is the unemployment figures for August 1996 going above and beyond any of the forecasts or expectations that we find in the budget so far as unemployment is concerned with the monthly rate for August 1996 at 8.8 per cent. The Banker's Trust, in its commentary on the monthly unemployment figures for August had this to say: Our quick conclusion is that the labour market is still just muddling along. The member for Port Adelaide( Mr Sawford), I know, would be interested in this quote. The unemployment rate for males rose from 8.5 per cent to 9.1 per cent, its highest level since last October. The female unemployment rate was steady at 8.4 per cent. Almost all of the rise in unemployment in the month was accounted for by males. Who'd be a bloke? And they conclude their comment by saying: Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4683 The labour market is simply stagnating, getting neither better nor worse. Again, I think that is optimistic, given what we have seen in the last couple of days in so far as a couple of surveys and forecasts are concerned. There is one point I would like to focus on for a moment. That is the notion of the need for economic growth to create employment, but also the need for governments and society to take special steps or measures to do their best to give unemployed people-in particular, long-term unemployed people-the chance of getting back into employment. It is the notion picked up in the Reserve Bank's report which I have referred to, and it was the intellectual and policy basis of the previous government's Working Nation report. The shorthand version of that policy approach is simply 'growth plus'. In other words, you need economic growth, but you have got to take special steps or extra measures to make sure that the long-term unemployed in particular get a chance of employment. And what have we seen in this budget? On the one hand, no growth, no jobs, no job certainty. And on the other hand, a massive slashing of the programs and the funds devoted to those special measures or extra steps. At the same time, if it was not enough for these very modest growth proportions or projections to be subscribed to by the government, in areas where we know we have had considerable success over the last decade in improving economic growth and jobs-namely, our export performance and Australian industry's performance-we also see, systematically through the budget papers, industry assistance, incentive or support programs and trade or export enhancement or incentive programs either abolished in breach of election promises or massively slashed. If you are interested in building ships and exporting them, the bounty is gone. If you are interested in being a small or medium size company that exports, the EMDG scheme has been gutted effectively and a cap of $150 million put on it, cutting EMDG expenditure by $426 million over a four-year period in breach of an election commitment. That commitment was that funds to EMDG and Austrade would be cut by $58.3 million over a three-year period. And my reference is just to the EMDG scheme. When you look at what is occurring in Austrade you effectively have $90 million cut out of appropriations for this financial year. It is in that context that we saw the release yesterday by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Westpac Bank of their September quarterly survey of industrial trends in manufactures in Australia. In the course of the materials released by the ACCI and Westpac yesterday we find Bill Evans, the General Manager, Economics, for Westpac commenting: Given that the budget was aimed at restoring business confidence and its associated forecast predicted a very healthy 14 per cent increase in business investments, the results of the survey, in showing that manufacturing activity continued to ease, will be disappointing for the government. In other words, the 3V2 per cent maximum growth which is in the budget papers is predicated on a 14 per cent increase in business investment. And, a short time after the budget, the ACCI and Westpac are saying that you will not necessarily get that private investment. So, in addition to all the other things that are going on that I have referred to, you are not necessarily going to get the private investment which is also required to meet the very modest growth projections that we see in the budget. Mr Evans continued: Another worrying sign relates to employment. The March and June surveys reflected an economy where employment growth was negligible. Hopes for a stronger employment performance in the September 4684 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 quarter are not supported by this survey. Expectations for the December quarter offer little hope of any significant improvement in employment conditions. In other words, don't expect any great increase in employment and, on the other hand, what will you also get? You will get an increase in unemployment. In the highlights by the ACCI and Westpac, there is a specific reference to unemployment. It says: Labour shedding continued in the September quarter with a net balance of minus 24 per cent versus minus 23 per cent previously. A further decline in numbers employed is expected in the December quarter with a net balance of minus 19 per cent. The decline in overtime work is expected to continue in the next three months The survey shows, not an increase in employment, but a decrease in employment and a consequent increase in unemployment. The summary of the survey of industrial trends released at the same time by the ACCI and Westpac says: Manufacturing activity continued to ease with actual outcomes in the September quarter 1996 broadly similar to those reported in the previous three quarters. New orders, output, employment and overtime work all declined, in most instances marginally more quickly than in the previous quarter. So, where is the trend line going? Down. Employment is going down. Orders are going down. Investment is going down. The trend line in unemployment is up. Jobless Johnny: no jobs, no growth and no support for the long-term unemployedami to refer to the members of the House by their titles. the effect of increasing joblessness in Australia. Capacity utilisation remained at low levels. Increases in new orders and output are again predicted for thc next quarters with expectations for new orders strongest in the lead-up to Christmas. And you can look at the tables that are attached to the survey, under the headings 'Employment: Labour shedding continues unabated' and 'Overtime declining'. AndI will not take any further time on that particular survey. Then you can look at the MTIA's budget assessment. The MTIA in its input special budget production has a very nice table which makes these points quite illustratively: 'The outcomes and forecasts, main economic forecasts from the 1996-97 budget'. The MTIA, in its formal hudget response, refers to risks and challenges, and makes the very obvious comment: 'four per cent plus growth must be our goal'. But for the forecasts and the statistics which the MTIA regard as being significant: GDP--outcome 1995-96 year average, 4.1; forecast 1996-96, 3.5growth is down. Exports of goods and services-1995-96 year average, 4.3; forecast, 8 exports are down. Imports of goods and services-year average 1995-96, 5.6; forecast, 1996-96 year average, II",190,Representatives Main Committee

Unemployment rate, 8.5 year average 1995-96; forecast, 8.5 last month, we saw 8.8 and all the evidence from the surveys that I have referred to are for that to increase. And we saw in the Australian today a summary of those reports under the heading 'Jobless forecast fuels fears of economic slowdown'. The article stated: Fresh evidence that unemployment could soon reach 9 per cent and the prospect of further job losses in manufacturing have fuelled fears of a budget induced economic slowdown. That is obviously the case, given the measures contained in the budget. The article continues: As the worse long-term jobless figures in seven months were released yesterday ... The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry found manufacturers expected labour-shedding to continue... Westpac's general manager, economics, Mr Bill Evans, said there was ""a chance"" that unemployment could hit 9 per cent by the end of the year... The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the number of long-term unemployed ... rose to 229,300 in August. It wathe third monthly increase in a row and the highest figure since January. Senior Treasury officials played down hopes of a rapid improvement in employment from the Government's labour market reforms. And, of course, the other thing that we are regaled with in the budget is the Budget Paper's waxing lyrical about all these problems which will be solved by the government's workplace reform bill. All you have got to do is force the wages down, give the workers low-paid jobs, and that will solve all the problems of the world. SoI was very pleased to see that Professor Gregory was reported in the Financial Review today challenging this very simplistic notion that those on the other side always love to handcuff themselves t-namely, that we will solve all the problems of the world by just pushing down the workers' wages. The Financial Review article, which is headlined 'Gregory challenges Government push on labour flexibility', says: ... Professor Bob Gregory has issued a sweeping new challenge to Federal Government claims that greater labour market flexibility will significantly reduce unemployment in Australia. Professor Gregory argues ... that Government moves toward creating a more US-style labour market will reduce the wages of low-paid workers. The restoration of full employment will lie in a direction other than reducing the wages of the low paid,' he says. The article continues: Noting the Government's claim that its planned individual employment contracts will not worsen employment terms and conditions, Professor Gregory says: 'Is it possible to reduce unemployment and produce jobs by creating greater labour market flexibility, but ensure that this flexibility does not extend to reducing wages and conditions?' So Professor Gregory scotches the simplistic notion that coalition members have always trotted out in this place that all one has to do is crush the workers' wages and the problems of the world will be solved. (Time expired) Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (5.26 p.m.)-I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Main Committee on Appropriation Bill (No.1). It is quite interesting listening to the member for Perth( Mr Stephen Smith), who gave us a bit of an economics lesson today. But what is quite extraordinary is that some time ago he worked for the former Prime Minister in the 4686 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 Treasurer's department. He quoted so many figures of economic growth, but debt level was not mentioned once. He did not reveal that we had the highest interest rates under the previous Labor government and somehow he tried to link unemployment rates with the new incoming government. It was quite interesting that he did not once speak of the debt levels that he left this country with. It was extraordinary that under the previous government we had high economic growth but we have also had high levels of unemployment. I might put to you that the reason that people are not employing-and every person that I speak to will not employ people-is that we need to sort out the industrial relations area. Until that legislation goes through that is the disincentive, not the economics figures and statistics that you quoted. The first budget hrought down by the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) is based on fair and responsible economic management. It is an accumulation of many hours of hard work, and many industry, business and community groups around Australia, and in particular in my electorate of Petrie, have shown their appreciation by applauding the budget. The appropriation bills are Australia's litmus test for the next three years. From the federal election six months ago, this government, the first coalition government in 13 years, has a mandate to return this country to strong economic management. This government has taken the responsibility to bring the $10 billion deficit back to level terms in three years, to throw out the ALP's unfair dismissal laws, to privatise one-third of Telstra, to get small business back working and to provide for the heart and soul of this country, which is families. This government has a mandate because under Labor interest rates were at record high levels, unemployment reached levels not seen since the Great Depression and national youth unemployment soared to well over 20 per cent. As a new member of the House of Representatives representing the seat of Petrie in the northern suburbs of Brisbane, I eagerly awaited the first coalition budget in 13 years. There was a lot of pre-budget speculation around. There were the opposition calls of a horror budget and scaremongering among many groups in the community. My electorate office was ready for that Wednesday following the budget, and were we inundated with budget negativity? No, no, no. My constituents instead were calling me bitterly complaining about the riots at Parliament House and disgusted at the burning of the symbol of Australia, our flag: an episode which I would like all members in this particular chamber to thoroughly condemn. People calling my office were more concerned about the welfare of myself and my staff and offered their assistance, and I thank all those people who contacted my office for their consideration and thoughts. The Petrie electorate includes people from all walks of life: small business, schools, older residents, the fishing industry and local government. Each stands to gain from this budget. As I talk to people in the electorate, I feel that this is a budget for families, for young people in our community, a budget for small business. In fact, it is a tremendous boost to get this country working again. Families are the life and soul of our community. It is the family unit, no matter what shape or size, that is the cornerstone of society. It is families who have found it so incredibly tough over the last 13 years. Double figure unemployment rates, high youth unemployment and high interest rates have left families wondering where the next dollar is going to come from. There are many families out there who are just living from week to week with the bare minimum in their shopping trolleys. This government will provide assistance through family tax Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4687 initiatives and by providing financial incentives to low and middle income families who invest in private health insurance. This government came into power on the platform of giving hope, of giving respite to families who have struggled particularly hard over the last five years. In the government's first budget, we have delivered. As promised, Medicare has been retained in its entirety and the operational subsidy for family day care centres has been retained, as has child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate. The government has provided a fair and responsible budget; a budget which will help the hip-pocket of the people of Australia and will give confidence to the marketplace and encourage consumer spending and self-esteem. From my electorate's perspective, one of the most pleasing aspects of the budget has been its flow-on effects for young people. The Howard government believes young people have for far too long been neglected, with sky-rocketing unemployment, spiralling suicide rates, and a lack of hope and inspiration. This cannot continue. Our young people, next year's generation, need hope and inspiration, and our budget delivers. Working Nation has failed a lot of those young people and the long-term unemployed. For too long these people have been going through the revolving door of endless labour market training programs before returning to the unemployment lines. Real jobs did not eventuate, and many of these people lost hope. Confidence in the system plummeted. In workplace reforms, the move towards a quality apprenticeship system for young people has been very well received in the community. Many people can remember the days when apprenticeships led to real jobs. You cannot beat the experience gained from working on the job, and skill based training lays the foundation for a quality system. The apprenticeship system that we have instigated reflects the modern labour market and the needs of business and industry; provides world-class training in skills that business and industry require; gives employers a key role in determining the kinds of skills and training required; and also makes training arrangements simpler and far more flexible. The apprenticeship system put forward by this government is a step towards growth and employment options. The changes proposed in this government's industrial relations mandate will allow for flexible training arrangements. It gives more options and opportunities through small and medium sized businesses, so important to the economic vitality of the Petrie electorate. These changes, importantly, will allow businessmen in my electorate-such as cabinet-makers, fibreglass moulders, mechanics, printers, typesetters and electricians-to expand their businesses, using the talent and skills of the young as apprentices in an affordable and well-managed system. The apprenticeship scheme proposed by this government needs to be cultivated and supported, and can in time bring tremendous benefits to this country. I also wish to support the government's move to curb the high levels of youth homelessness. Organisations such as the Society of St Vincent de Paul, Lifeline, the Smith Family, City Missions, the Salvation Army and those individuals who spend their life comforting those on the street must be applauded. These people have hearts of gold and high levels of determination and dedication, and most of them work in a voluntary capacity in very trying circumstances. The growth of homelessness in our communities is debilitating and does nothing for the self-esteem of families or communities. In a recent edition of the Queensland Courier-Mail, I was saddened to read that the Council to Homeless Persons has warned that Queensland's rate of homelessness was 'nearly twice the national average'. The article reported that it had been estimated that there were some 4688 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 61,000 homeless people in Australia, of which homeless families make up 13 per cent. Community groups are taking more and more responsibility each and every day, and people are crying out for comfort, support and someone to talk to. It has been estimated that there are over 20,000 homeless young people aged between 12 and 18. This figure is a very sad indictment of our society, and something needs to be done. The youth homelessness pilot program shows the government's commitment to this important area of society. With an $8 million package over three years, it will focus on family relations. The strategy is based on improving the existing supports available and reviewing the ways that information is transferred from community groups to income support agencies. Early intervention and family reconciliation are other areas which are being supported. The fact that the program is voluntary is also important. Similarly, youth suicide is an issue that has touched many families. Australia's suicide rate is one of the highest in the world and this government is prepared to take a stand here. Research and early intervention measures are needed. Counselling services are in great demand and the national youth suicide strategy will be welcomed in many communities, including those in my electorate. While on the topic of young people in our society, I attended a function recently at Deception Bay High School, where the principal, Mr Jim Stephens, was so proud of the achievements, academically, socially and culturally, of his students. Furthermore, Redcliffe State High School deserves special mention with their recent result in the Queensland Rock Eisteddfod, where they finished second-a great result for the determination and dedication of students, teachers and parents. Last Saturday, I was delighted to join the principal of that school, Mr Barry Ferris, in opening up their new performing arts complex, where the Commonwealth invested substantial funding. This government continues to support schools and education in such a way to further improve the opportunities that are available. This budget will provide further incentives for students through educational and training schemes. Over the next four years, Australia's schools will receive $14 billion in funding from the federal government. We are preparing our young people for future employment. In fact, just recently the Australian Secondary School Principals' President, Duncan Stalker, has applaUded the fact that schools are to be given direct access to funding to support an increased emphasis on vocational education for the nation's secondary schools. He said: At long last there is recognition that vocational education is important to secondary schools and has a crucial role in the secondary curriculum. The challenge facing secondary schools is to design and implement vocational courses that are equally valued along with other school programs by students and parents. The Petrie electorate has welcomed this government's commitment to the job placement, employment and training program. JPET aims to assist young people to establish a stable lifestyle, resolve family conflicts, attain life skills, return to education and prepare for entry to and continuing participation in the work force. I commend the funding of $11 million per year over the next two years which has been set aside for this program. We just cannot forget our young. This government has a rock solid commitment to young people in the Petrie electorate and throughout Australia. A key area in getting this country back working again is small business. The Attorney General only this week released provisional bankruptcy statistics, and it is a disgraceful legacy from the Labor administration. There were over 17,000 bankruptcies for 1995-96 and in my Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4689 state of Queensland, as the member for Brisbane( Mr Bevis) would know, there was a rise of nearly 40 per cent for the financial year. The previous government failed to deliver real industrial relations reform and the current account went out of control, forcing up this country's national debt. I have spoken previously of the sad sight in my electorate of the growing number of small businesses shutting their doors over the last few years. Vacant shopfronts have become a far too familiar sight in too many suburbs, in community shopping villages and even in the central shopping malls. Capital gains tax initiatives introduced by this budget have been very well received in my electorate and the capital gains rollover relief will, in time, have a very positive benefit for many small businesses. They have the opportunity to expand and to create more jobs. Generous tax treatment for employee share schemes will provide a sense of ownership in our big businesses and encourage participation from within. The government has made a commitment to ensure that a lack of financial operations does not constrain growth and development of small business. Business leaders representing prominent Australian organisations recently met in Canberra and they have given full support to these budget measures. They called on the minor parties in the Senate to pass the workplace reforms and, as National Farmers Federation President Donald McGauchie said, 'We expect the passage of the bill to produce conditions for increased employment and higher wages.' Business will be given a choice in managing their work force and enterprise agreements negotiated under a dual system will provide business with much more flexibility than they presently have with a rigid awards system. The key area on the mind of every small business person in my electorate is the unfair dismissal scheme. This is an ALP legacy that will stick to the opposition for many years to come. The present unfair dismissal laws are a noose around the head of many small businesses who struggle from week to week. I am talking about the family corner store, the florist, the baker, the butcher, the coffee shop owners and the restaurants-each and everyone has grave concerns about these unfair dismissal laws and they are crying out for help. What has happened is that the move towards casual work has been the death of many full time jobs. In some industries, where there have been large turnovers of staff, employers have become very careful with their placements. A coffee shop owner in my electorate recently told me that he no longer employs full-time employees, preferring instead part-time and casual workers. This government intends to amend this legislation for benefits across the whole country. Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a further measure which is targeted towards jobs-real jobs-for the benefit of our community. This government recognises the needs of the unemployed, particularly those in the 50 to 60 age group. Many of these people find it terribly difficult to re-enter the work force, through lack of skills or limited opportunities. Whether their predicament is brought about by retrenchment, economic circumstance or family situationmale or female-it is important that the needs of these people be further examined. On the subject of industry, the fishing industry is a valuable asset to the electorate of Petrie. I represented the interests of the constituents with fishing enterprises recently, to save the diesel fuel rebate scheme from abolishment. I am pleased that the diesel fuel rebate scheme has remained intact. This is of particular significance and will achieve economic sustainability throughout the whole fishing industry. Not enough emphasis is placed on the fishing industry. At the moment, many in the industry who harvest prawns are in a state of decline due to poor 4690 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 climatic conditions. I look forward to working with local and state fishing organisations, processors and consumers, to work towards a more productive sector. I had the pleasure in Brisbane recently, on behalf of the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), of launching the new strategic plan for the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation-a corporation which has been doing commendable work in managing fisheries research and development programs. Research by the Southern Fisheries Centre, coordinated by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries at Deception Bay, has received funding from the government for its projects, particularly in the prawn trawl fisheries. It is budgeted that the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation will invest $ 13.5 million in 200 new and continuing projects, highlighting the government's commitment to this important resource sector. Mr Deputy Speaker, the higher education sector is of interest to my constituents. I believe the move by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to announce budget initiatives early was a positive step to help universities and students in their decision making processes and planning. The Petrie electorate includes the Carseldine campus of the Queensland University of Technology, a university that I have had an association with over a number of years, both as a student and as a tutor. I was very pleased to see that the Queensland University of Technology's operating grants for 1996-97 have risen by 3.8 per cent and the variation for 1996-98 is 4.9 per cent. I expect that the university will benefit from the research funding that has also been made available. The increased funding for university research is upwards of $140 million over four years. The changes to the user-pays system for university education will make it, I believe, a fairer system. The three-tiered system will change for the better the irregularity that existed before. The new proposals are a far more equitable system, streamlining the process which existed where everyone was charged the same, regardless of which course they undertook. Australian students will also be given the opportunity to purchase an undergraduate place, in the same way that overseas students can do now. The reality is that education costs money. We live in a user-pays society, and the variations to the HECS system will provide far more equity. Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a chronic shortage of carers in our community. I have made the point of speaking to many community groups, such as St Catherine's Respite Centre-a St Vincent de Paul centre in the Petrie electorate. The centre caters for approximately 40 clients a day, providing a freshly cooked three-course meal for lunch in a very caring and supportive environment. I have spoken to a number of church and community groups concerning this issue. Respite centres in the Petrie electorate, unfortunately, are limited. There is certainly a great need for overnight centres and occasional weekend care. Those who spend their lives comforting and supporting others must be applauded for their wonderful efforts. If these dedicated people were not so committed, the situation would be far worse than it is today. I will do everything I can to support the needs of carers in my electorate. I will work towards this cause in providing overnight care and weekend occasional care. This is a quality of life issue, and everybody deserves a break to settle their own nerves and their own system. The lifelong love and dedication which carers provide need to be rewarded. The national carers action plan introduced by this government is a step towards this quality of life. This plan recognises the role that carers play, and their importance in today's society. I understand that there will be a focus on matching services and assistance to the needs and circumstances of individual carers. I am proud to see that this government has not ignored Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4691 these carers and that we have taken them under our wing and will recognise and support their efforts. The importance of this budget will not only have benefits for this country fiscally, but will also provide substantial benefits to the confidence of the business community and families. This budget will lay a foundation for this country's future and provide a far brighter future for all. for Petrie, and I acknowledge her interest and the interest of the member for McMillan( Mr Broadbent) in the small business sector. I look forward to working with them on the inquiry into fair trading and I hope that we can bring in a report that the government will implement. The first budget of the Howard government, presented by the Treasurer Peter Costello, shows once more a lack of imagination from the conservative side of Australia politics in public policy making. In a short space of time, the Treasurer has already shown that he is clearly a slave to economic orthodoxy. There has to be a better way to build a better country than is shown in this budget. The fixation with budget deficits and ultra low inflation rates belies the fact that we need economic growth in which to create jobs. The Howard government has clearly failed to recognise that the role of government is not just to balance the books like a small suburban accounting firm; it is actually to create the climate for economic growth and to redress market failures. Obviously, there have been significant market failures in Australia over the past 50 years. We have failed to address the need to replace jobs lost with new jobs for ordinary Australians. In my electorate of Rankin there is a well known suburb called Inala, a suburb in which I grew up. When I was growing up, there were a number of opportunities for people to work. These included the heavy engineering firm at Rocklea, Evans Deakin Engineering, General Motors Holden at Acacia Ridge, and the Huttons Meatworks. All have since closed due to competitive pressure or rationalisation. What this government needs to do is to tum economic policy into an instrument for creating jobs for these people. The unemployment in this suburb and in other areas in my electorate is unacceptable. It is one of the reasons we are now in opposition. However, the unemployment minister Senator Vanstone has admitted that unemployment will stay at 8 per cent until the year 2000. This is simply not good enough. From their own words the government has let down the unemployed in my electorate and across the country. Let us take a look at what they think the answer is. But let us first say what the answer is not. The answer is not to smash the job schemes that actually help people find jobs, nor to cut $1.8 billion over four years out of labour market programs. I challenge government members to visit places like the Inala South-West Skillshare office in my electorate and to speak with the 730 people who benefited from the Skillshare program during the last financial year. What are these people, and the hundreds of other people in my electorate who found jobs through the Skillshare programs, to do? The government's answer is to cut funding for programs like the new enterprise incentive scheme-NElS-and the jobskill program. These schemes have been successful in my electorate in areas such as Inala, Browns Plains and Woodridge. The answer is not to make the unemployed feel ashamed of their position and guilty by introducing things like the so called 'dole diary'.",194,Representatives Main Committee
455,Mr Beddall (Rankin) (5.46 P.m.),"It is a pleasure to follow my colleague the member4692 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 As I talk to community groups in my electorate, I find one thing is certain. Senior citizens are concerned about and just plain scared of the consequences of this budget. The government's decision to align the nursing home system with the hostel system results in senior citizens having to pay an entry contribution to gain admittance to a nursing home. Older members of the community who need nursing homes may have to pay up-front fees of around $26,000. We cannot yet get the Minister for Family Services( Mrs Moylan) to identify what the figure will be. She answers every other question, but will not answer this one. The Minister of Family Services has tried to defend the decision by saying that it is simply a matter of aligning the two systems of nursing and hostel care. This is a ridiculous argument, and it is clear that she does not understand her own policy. You do not need to go through a test to get into a hostel as a matter of choice. You have to be assessed before you get into a nursing home and that is a fundamental difference. It is the reason that the previous government did not relate the two together. Anyone who has any understanding of aged care policy knows that the two types of care are indeed vastly different. The increase in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will result in pensioners now paying an additional 50c per prescription, or $3.20 in total. Many of the pensioners I represent are angry that there was no warning of this sudden increase. There is not the compensation that there initially was when the scheme was introduced. Many of my constituents who are on fixed incomes will find it difficult to deal with this sudden increase. For a sick pensioner it can mean up to an additional $5 per week. Elderly people who live at home and who have chosen to stay at home in familiar surroundings will be slugged user-pays fees at a rate of around $4 per hour. The government has also reduced its contribution to home and community care funding by $88 million over four years. All these measures make it difficult for pensioners, and they are right to ask why this government is hitting them so hard. Too often we have become slaves, however, to economic theory. That applies to all sections of the Australian political spectrum. What we have to do is find Australian solutions for Australian problems. I recently listened to a debate on the ABC about what used to be called the 'fair go country'. In fact, we have lost in recent years the attitude of a fair go for all. I think the election of this government is a further step away from it. Unless this government recommits itself to the philosophy of a fair go, we will end up as a society with a distinct underclass. I know this because I have seen many of the people in my electorate suffer under the types of programs that have been cut in this budget. What the budget will mean for low income families, pensioners and the unemployed is not a pretty picture. Many members have spoken of how the scrapping of funding for the Commonwealth dental scheme will affect the community. I did some research and found out how many people in my electorate used this scheme, and I was simply staggered by the result. My electorate of Rankin had one of the highest usages of the scheme in Queensland. Over 13,000 residents in my electorate used the scheme during the last financial year. Over 7,000 residents and health care card holders in Logan City in my electorate used the scheme last year. So these people can now expect long queues and much pain from John Howard's broken promises. Before this scheme was introduced, the cost of dental health care was out of the question for many poorer Australians. Under Labor, they were able to receive dental health care. This, cruelly, will no longer be the case. This is an absolute disgrace, and I will be making it clear to the people of Rankin that they have been forgotten by this government. Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4693 The only way for people to break out of the poverty cycle is through economic development and through jobs. Both of these objectives have not been met by this government in its first budget. Small and medium sized enterprises can offer many opportunities for Australians, as many speakers on the other side have said in their contributions to this debate. Going back a little in time, the McKinsey report entitled Born global, which was brought down in 1993-1 recommend it to all honourable members-showed how many Australian companies are able to focus on new markets, and the global market is part of their initial business plan. This is something that has not been part of Australian culture in the past and something the government needs to nurture. It is not natural for Australian companies to think of international trade as their basic market. In the past, we have always been a country that fed its domestic market and sold any excess to export markets. We did not see exports as a primary source of income for business. But, when we see in this budget the EMDG scheme, the DIFF program and a whole range of other support programs attacked as business welfare, we see that the economic rationalists within the Treasury are getting their way with a continuing stream of coalition ministers. These types of programs are not business welfare. They are addressing a market failure in creating an export culture. Because of our OECD membership, we also tend to think that we are a fully developed country. The opposite is true. We are still a developing country, admittedly with a very high standard of living but one that continues to improve. If we do not improve our standard of living, then many people within our society will fall through the net. We have to look forward now and have a look at the safety net itself, to see how it is administered. We have to do so, not because it has failed or because we want to cut funding, but because we want to redirect it to enable Australians to become more part of a productive society. Unless we offer all Australians the right to work we will fail the test set down by this nation. There are ways to create jobs and to do it through our natural resources. Australia is the world's leading mining nation. It is the leader in mining technology and mineral exploration. We are at the forefront of mining technology development. This is, of course, one of our most important sectors. We fail to realise that already we export more goods and services from the mining sector than from the well-publicised wine industry. Quite often, we do not recognise that research and development is taking place in these areas and that Australia is producing world-class goods for export markets. What we need to do is promote them more and ensure that our trade bodies, such as Austrade and Ausmine, are given the support they need. Australia can set the trend. Most people would not realise that the first CD-ROM technology exported by Australia was an adaptation of mining programs on teaching an operator how to use underground equipment. This was, as I said, done on CD-ROM for the first time and exported out of Australia. There are ways, of course, to create new employment. But we need to be forthright and not listen to the economic theorists who tell us what we cannot do rather than what we can do. In December 1995, during discussions I had with a major Japanese paper company, I asked the simple but obvious question of why this particular company had invested in paper production facilities in Canada and other countries but never in Australia. The answer was something of a revelation. It simply was that Australia had never told that particular company that they had to invest in Australia, whereas the Canadians had. 4694 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 Many ministers have been told you cannot instruct overseas business to construct plant in Australia. The reality is that if you own the natural resource and you want to put a condition down you will get the investment. The Canadians have shown us how to do that. It is now time, I think, that Australia grasped the nettle. That is how we can overcome our trade deficit as well as create new jobs for all Australians. Unfortunately, this budget will not create jobs and will, in fact, add pain to those in the community who are unemployed. What we need is innovation and what we need is new ideas. What we have got in this budget is not just economic rationalism but economic orthodoxy. We have closed CES and DSS offices. With the cutbacks in job programs, with pensioners being hit, with the unemployed being offered no future and with cuts to child care, we can truly say that this government is certainly not governing for all of us. restores Australian families and small businesses in our regions to their pre-eminent position after 13 years of neglect from the former Hawke and Keating governments. In fact, having heard from the speakers today and having two of the guilty party, the member for Fowler( Mr Grace) and the member for Rankin( Mr Beddall), sitting here in this room, it is a pleasure for me to address this hallowed chamber and discuss a couple of matters that came out of the member for Rankin's address. Talk about nowhere to run and nowhere to hide! These two are two of the guilty party. As the member for Rankin said, he watched his people suffer through 13 years of neglect in the seat of Rankin. Why did he not do something about it? As the former minister for small business, for heaven's sake, he was the minister who presided over small businesses in Australia paying 22 per cent interest rates. That was a total failure, not just on his behalf. I noted, as he spoke today, that he still had some good ideas. He was one of the ministers who actually had some good ideas. But his own party walked away from him every time he put those ideas forward, because he actually used some common sense. He actually went to the Japanese and talked to them about how he could get investment in Australia. But he was rejected, along with all those backbenchers and ministers who sat in regional seats. They were ignored by the executive. That is not happening with this government. You saw-and I do not want to be distracted, Mr Deputy Speaker-that historic meeting where the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) brought together all of those people on the woodchip issue. He brought the conservationists together, he brought the industry people together and he brought the interested members of parliament together on the coalition side. They sat down and, very quickly, came up with an idea that is acceptable to the Australian community and provides a great opportunity for jobs in regional Australia. The speech we have just heard from the member for Rankin shocked me. It shocked me in that, once again, they are using scaremongering with the elderly and the most vulnerable in our community. That is a great disappointment to me as the member for McMillan, having suffered through so much of this in my first three years here, watching a government use the scaremongering with the elderly and the vulnerable in our community through the whole of the Fightback package. And now I am seeing them doing exactly the same thing again in opposition. No-one pretends that this was an easy budget to deliver. In fact there must have been this huge sigh of relief in Labor ranks when they lost because they had nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. You heard the member for Perth( Mr Stephen Smith) talk about job programs and",201,Representatives Main Committee
456,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (5.58 P.m.),"I rise to speak in support of a budget thatWednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4695 denigrate the Prime Minister-as only the Labor Party do-by using language for the member for Bennelong. But I noticed you pulled him up, Mr Deputy Speaker-and I thank you for that-when he called him 'Jobless Johnny'. At the same time the member for Perth said, 'On the other hand-' and what was on the other hand? Nothing. He had no new ideas, no new policies and no hope. What this budget brings to Australia is hope, and it returns to the people the ideas and the aspirations that they have for this nation. I repeat, no-one has pretended it has been an easy budget to deliver. But most of the members on the other side of the House know that, had they been re-elected, they would have been delivering a very similar budget. The decisions and the commitments made were difficult. At the same time, however, one cannot dispute that in this budget the burden of the challenges facing the Australian community has been delivered equitably. The government had no other course, after 13 years of mismanagement of the Australian economy, but to take the action that they have taken and spread the difficulties equally amongst the people. This budget-in my humble opinion-is a tribute to the Prime Minister, John Howard, and to the Treasurer, Peter Costello, for the way they went about the process of fairness and equity to get an outcome like this that is not merely concerned with the next financial year, nor that reflects some pre-occupation with reducing the deficit bequeathed by Labor. This budget is the first step towards retrieving a credible role for government in our community. In the face of growing cynicism and doubt, not only about the function of government but also about the very effectiveness of government itself, this budget establishes the foundations essential to resisting this trend by restoring credibility and honesty with respect to national governments. In recent years we have witnessed the increasing perversion of due process in government. After so many years of incumbency, the former Labor government deluded itself by believing that it could retain power merely by being seen to do something. It overlooked the necessity to actually deliver real outcomes. In my electorate of McMillan prior to the election campaign we had the then local member, Mr Cunningham, announcing in the local paper that he had received $10 million in funding for the electorate. Little has been delivered. We cannot find it in any budget anywhere. Was it just another hollow promise? It is disappointing a whole lot of people around Moe. I noticed that the Opposition Leader( Mr Beazley) actually mentioned funds withdrawn from Moe in Gippsland. There have been no funds withdrawn by this government. In fact, we have delivered exactly what we said we would. We said that, if this was a government commitment that had been signed off, we would do it-and we have done it. We have done it in every regional area. The former government was an administration by style not substance. The dying days of the Keating government can best be described as a shell adorned by labels, such as Working Nation, Creative Nation, Young Nation, One Nation, with little to excuse its failures for 13 years. Labor had even less to justify its sixth term in office. In no other area of public policy was this more manifest than in the proliferation of labour market programs that paid absolutely no regard whatsoever to the effectiveness and performance of such schemes. The former government's own adviser, DEETYA, in its report entitled Working Nation: evaluation of the employment, education and training elements determined after having carried out an assessment of labour market programs that Working Nation had failed by promoting placements in relatively expensive programs that failed to meet the measure of the quality 4696 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 expected. This report compounded the weight of growing evidence, which the government was electing to ignore, that effectively suggested that government concentrate on delivering real jobs rather than formulating programs. Other reports were compiled with the Economic Planning Advisory Council and the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. The DEETYA report condemned Working Nation for shifting the number of placements away from such effective schemes as the jobclub program to programs such as new work opportunities. Under the new work opportunities program, the employer had no obligation to retain the employee, whereas under wage subsidy programs an incentive was available to encourage the retention of placements. In addition, taking on a trainee was far less expensive under NWO schemes than through many other labour market programs. While the number of placements in wage subsidy programs was intended to increase, there was an evident decline in the number of these positions. For example, in 1993, 26 per cent of program placements were in the jobstart program. That figure fell to 18 per cent in 1994-95 and to 17 per cent in the first eight months of 1995-96. There is ample evidence to suggest that the new work opportunities program was competing for placements in the private sector together with other DEETYA programs. The basis of the more expensive labour market programs was not solely flawed on account of effectiveness. Those programs were placed in areas without, it would appear, any genuine consideration of the priority attaching to such assistance. Administrative data reveals that 15 per cent of all new work opportunities program placements went to the 30 DEETY A areas with the lowest unemployment levels while only 16 per cent of all new work opportunities placements were landed in the 30 DEETYA areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Sufficient time does not exist here to fully trace the failings of Working Nation. What can be said is that Labor has attempted to disguise a policy vacuum with a myriad of programs, distorted incentives and avoided any transparent commitment to real outcomes. In contrast, the transitional and long term initiatives contained in this budget are premised not on programs but on outcomes. They are focused on the individual and not on remote or misbegotten targets. This budget will establish the framework within which the range of labour exchange services can actually be expanded. At the same time those programs that have demonstrated effectiveness will be retained such as new enterprise incentive schemes, NElS, and various English and literacy programs. Regions, like my electorate of McMillan, will benefit by the retention of the Office of Labour Market Adjustment; regional community employment councils, formerly area consultative committees; and the forest industry adjustment package. I note also with very great pleasure the allocation of $48 million towards the finalisation of regional forest agreements. I know that the timber industry, which supports many families in my electorate, will benefit directly from this initiative. It is appropriate at this time to congratulate the government on its decision to lift the woodchip export ceiling by one million tonnes. The decision is much more than the export ceiling; the decision represents country jobs for country people in the electorate of McMillan. Over 1,000 jobs directly depend on this industry in my electorate. Countless other jobs rest upon the activity and employment in the timber industry. I know that employees, management, the NFF, the VFF, the Forest Protection Society and the CFMEU have worked diligently to correct many of the myths surrounding the industry in Australia. Were it not for their Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4697 confidence in the Howard government, this process would have been rendered far more difficult. It also provides medium to long-term supply security which is so vital to the industry. Many industry representatives in McMillan have long been restricted in their investment decisions by uncertainty as well as the risk of government policy decisions over the years. We have witnessed so many of these. By accelerating the conclusion of RFAs, this budget allows for a stable and sound environment for investment planning. The process that has been outlined by the Prime Minister encourages managers to adopt thinning operations which maximise future sawlog yields in production forests and illustrates the government's commitment to the national forest policy statement as well as value adding in Australia by providing an incentive for woodchip exporters to source their material from sawmills. The modem Australian apprenticeship training scheme guarantees much-needed flexibility that has been absent. We have been neglecting the needs of our young unemployed, not to mention their prospective employers. The wage top-up serves as a safeguard for apprentices, trainees and employers. I have noted with annoyance that the opposition has levelled criticism at the principle of apprentices being paid only for productive time in work. This is a principle which has been accepted by both parties. For the Labor Party to oppose in opposition what it embraced in government is manifestly opportunistic. I tum now to the issue of health. BeforeI do, I will just make my point on how important the woodchip situation is. I will not say who sent me the fax; I will just read out what that fax says. They are talking about an address I made in the House yesterday. It says: I caught up with your spirited defence of the new woodchip regulations. I understand the shadow resources minister, Neil O'Keefe, made his usual destructive contribution on this matter. I appreciate your support for our industry as the past environment has created much uncertainty and has caused much unnecessary hardship in rural Australia. Thanks again. Look forward to catching up with you soon. That is just another person seriously concerned about jobs in regional Australia. I know the member at the table agrees with every word I am saying on this. I come from a position where I cannot believe that you can sit here and be as brazen as you were today in the House during question time when you know that, between 1990 and 1993, you sat there while employment increased 150 per cent. It went from 3,000 to 9,000 in the seat that I formerly held. It is an indictment of you that you can actually sit there and think that we are not going to do the best that we possibly can for those people who are unemployed. We will do it. Everything this government can afford we will do on behalf of those people who are unemployed and genuinely looking for jobs. The health portfolio, better than most, demonstrates Labor's impotence in office. Despite having virtually unlimited resources to effect change, Labor was constrained not only by its industrial wing-to no-one's surprise-but also by a commitment to a version of universality that guaranteed neither access to public health services nor fairness. I suspect Labor consi<hed that, by its commitment to a standard Medicare levy in the absence of private health insurance rebates, it was addressing the current crisis in our public health system. Sadly, its commitment in this regard became a pretext for inaction. Only the coalition has had the courage and the sense of social justice to embrace a two-tiered Medicare system, requiring the wealthy in our community to contribute more to the operation of our public health system. I am sure I would be supported by every member in this room on that issue. The Medicare surcharge for high income earners is an eminently fair measure, 4698 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 adding perspective to our health system. The long-term maintenance of the public sector depends on greater contributions from higher income earners. The availability of rebates places singles, couples and families in a better position than they enjoyed under Labor. While the availability of rebates for private health cover has been affected by recent increases in health fund premiums, let us remember that the recent increases and impending applications for increases are a direct result of the trend of decline in the number of people taking out private cover. For the opposition to attack the coalition on this front is unforgivable. It is worthy of dismissal for what it really is: a desperate attempt to repair its poor performance in the polls and its poor performance on the health issue. In the establishment of the inquiry by the Productivity Commission into the state of health funds, the government has acted promptly to ensure that the value of these premiums is maintained. In fact, access to health services will be further enhanced in electorates like McMillan. Allowing pharmacies to serve as Medicare agencies will improve access for clients and pensioners in Australia's regions and more remote areas. I am incensed when I hear criticism from the opposition in the wake of our announcement of our intention to reform the aged care sector. It is the height of hypocrisy for a party which introduced an identical system for hostels to now oppose the implementation of the very same system in nursing homes. Unifying the hostel and nursing home system is a measure necessary to address a steadily worsening crisis in nursing home care. In simple terms, nursing homes around the country have not been able to attract sufficient funds to upgrade facilities. Many premises are increasingly dilapidated and fail to meet the standards that we, as a community, should expect for the elderly. In 1994, the then Labor government commissioned a report on the state of nursing homes. After surveying 150 nursing homes, the following findings-amongst others-were made: 75 per cent of homes needed fixing or rebuilding to meet Australian design standards; 13 per cent of homes failed to meet fire authority standards; and 39 per cent of residents were in rooms with four or more beds. The government's objective for aged care is twofold. Firstly, the package allows sufficient funds to address the capital crisis facing many homes; and, secondly, it removes inequities between the nursing home and hostel systems in order that the financially disadvantaged will be protected, while those who can afford to make a contribution will be able do so. Twenty per cent of people who are financially disadvantaged will not be paying to go into a nursing home. They will not be charged $26,000. And everybody on the opposition side knows exactly that. Importantly, full-time pensioners are exempt from having to make any entry contributions. So, too, are financially disadvantaged persons who have not owned a home in the last two years. What people need to understand is that entry contributions, which are established by agreement between management and client, will not be compulsory. While the contribution is to be negotiated between the prospective resident and the proprietor, there are very strict conditions under which arrangements can be finalised. Very secure safeguards exist for the benefit of prospective residents. We should remember that, under the previous government, millionaires enjoyed better access to nursing home beds than the battlers who so conclusively deserted Labor at the last election campaign. For instance, a resident must always be left with assets of at least 250 per cent of the pension-some $22,000-and the entry contribution can only be drawn down at the Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMlTIEE 4699 maximum rate of $2,600 per year for a limit of five years. Members on the other side know that. Most significantly, people will not be forced to sell their own homes at fire sale prices. The same system implemented by Labor for hostels in 1988 will now be applied to nursing homes. While people are given six months to sell their homes, if they fail to do so they cannot be ejected from their accommodation. Their draw-down simply becomes a debt due to the proprietor. A further guarantee exists in that no prospective resident will be asked to make any contribution within the first six months of admission to a nursing home. I do not have the opportunity today to address other issues which are so important and specific in this budget. My community is relieved that the years of the Keating and Hawke governments have gone. We now have the opportunity to build on this budget to make sure that we deliver the promises and the programs that are in it on behalf of the Australian people. I see myself as having had a great blessing in being able to make this address on behalf of the constituents of McMillan. I will serve everyone of them, whichever way they have voted, to the best of my ability. (Time expired) talked about coming from a regional area. McMillan certainly is a region of Victoria. Regional areas were certainly betrayed in this budget-totally betrayed. They were betrayed and abandoned, and the honourable member for McMillan's electorate was abandoned. The Department of Regional Affairs has been gutted-there is no longer a department. The minister has said that there is no clear rational or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional development. The minister's statement has wiped out the Department of Regional Affairs. But it is easy to compare what this budget takes away from regional Australia with what Labor had in place. The federal member for Wannon, David Hawker, who is chairman of the Federal Liberal Regional and Rural Committee, said in a press release on 21 July 1995: It is a disgrace that people who choose to work and live in the country often have to put up with the inadequate or non-existent services. While many of the capital cities have started to recover from the hardhitting recession, that recovery has not flowed on to regional areas. I would like to say to David, and to the member for McMillan and all the other members representing regional Australia in this government: 'Let's talk about some of those services.' Let's talk about the Medicare offices which have been closed right around Australia. This budget closed them in regional Australia. And it is no good putting in your rebate claim at the chemist-the chemist does not have a fax machine that can refund you with dollars and cents. Social Security and CES offices have been closed in regional Australia. They are regional services that apply within Australia. They are regional offices right around the country and they are being closed. The tax offices are being closed in Launceston. People in that area have to go all the way to Hobart to talk to somebody in the tax office. That makes things really difficult for older people who like to talk to a tax official on a one-to-one basis. They cannot do it anymore. Bingo! Out it goes. With this budget, this government, out it goes. The Family Court in Launceston is being downgraded. I do not know whether there are other family courts in other parts of regional Australia. If there are, I am sure they are under attack and I am sure they are under pressure of closure. This all happens in regional Australia. The",204,Representatives Main Commitiee
457,Mr Adams (Lyons) (6.18 P.m.),"The honourable member for McMillan( Mr Broadbent)4700 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 honourable member for McMillan( Mr Broadbent) is listening very intently, and so he should, because his region has been betrayed by this budget. University places have been lost in regional universities. In Tasmania, we have lost 380 places from our university. We were very fortunate and we worked very hard-and I know you did too, Mr Deputy Speaker-to increase the opportunities in the northern part of Tasmania and also in the north-west so that, especiaIly in the north-west which has one of the lowest retention rates of tertiary education in Australia, we would have more places for people up there. We have lost that opportunity and those places are now under pressure. Thirty places have been lost at the Australian Maritime College in Launceston. That is a loss to the north of Tasmania. A report I was looking at recently on the economics of northern Tasmania stated that 23 per cent of its economic activity comes from education-university, the Maritime CoIlege, secondary colleges and other educational facilities. So that is a big loss to the state and to that part of Tasmania. Labor's $ I 50 million in infrastructure funding has gone out of the budget. Bingo! It is taken out of the budget; there is no more infrastructure. There was no rational or constitutional basis for that decision, but the minister does not believe that this government has a constitutional or a rational reason for being in anything to do with regional development. The sale of Telstra will affect regional Australia enormously. Tasmania will lose at least 600 jobs for a start, and that is a big loss of incomes for Tasmania. There has been some discussion that digital mobile telephones will be the answer for regional Australia and that regional Australia does not need to have the same services as urban areas. I think this is what is being pushed to all the regional members of the government. They are telling them that mobile phones are the answer for regional Australia. At the moment, 70 per cent of the base stations are located in metropolitan areas, 25 per cent are located in regional areas and five per cent are located in remote areas. I sourced that from answers to a question on notice from the member for Parkes( Mr Cobb) to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government ( Mr Warwick Smith) on 20 August 1996. So only a small proportion of regional Australia currently has access to mobile phones. There will not be an increase in the infrastructure in the less populated areas after privatisation. Even if there was, the mobile phone does not allow the same interactive communication that is available on the Internet or e-mail. It does not allow CD-ROM. It cannot give access to the information systems of the world in the same way that is possible with a physical cable. Without Telstra's current ability to cross-subsidise services, the regional areas will be forgotten and discounted and they will not receive the roll-out of the cable. Tasmania is in a very vulnerable position. I worry greatly about its being able to receive that roll-out. If they do not have this technology, will the individuals, organisations and areas be at an economic disadvantage? It would certainly heighten Tasmania's isolation, as it would with many other regions throughout Australia. Then there is the $600 million sliced off national highway funding. They have pork-barrelled a bit up in the northern part of New South Wales and given the members up there some areasA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 6.26 to 6.40 p.m. Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4701 funding. I think this translates to about $9 million less for Tasmania's highways. Last week the Brew report indicated that they are trying to get rid of our railways. It is a double whammy, of course: they are taking money off the highway system in this budget and closing the national railways in Tasmania, or trying to. There will certainly be a significant loss of work on the Bass Highway and I am sure there are places in the Penguin area and other areas towards the north-west coast where work was being phased in that will probably also be set back. Let us have a look at the loss of the last government's labour market programs, comparing this budget with what was there under a Labor government. These programs were about skill development for long-term unemployed and for young people. It was the opportunity to gain skills through some of these programs. Skillshare is about giving skills to some people who would not get into TAFE, people who would need help with basic literacy and numeracy, basic English, that sort of training, in order to have skills to find a job, to have an opportunity to compete, to have a chance of competing on equal terms with others in that very competitive job market. Those people are going to be denied an opportunity with a 33 per cent cut in the skills hare budget. So there is going to be a reduction in labour market programs, a reduction in chances for people to gain skills, a reduction in opportunities for them to be able to get job ready and a reduction in training for some of those young people who need to come through a program before they can go towards an employer to be taken on board as an employee. You can say that these were Mickey Mouse programs, you can say whatever you wish about them and run them down-which the other side does-but they were programs that were there to assist long-term unemployed and other unemployed. And when we, first as a government and then as an opposition, have sought to find out what this current government would set itself as a target to reduce unemployment, it has refused to tell. So this government has been able to cut $1.8 billion out of labour market programs and it has cut that at the expense of the unemployed, young people, long-term unemployed, people who did have some hope, who had some opportunity to gain skills that would make them somewhat competitive in a very competitive labour market. By cutting that, by getting rid of that, we have reduced the opportunity for a lot of those people. They are to have a test on whether the opportunity to do a course is worthwhile, and it will be very interesting to see how many people are thrown on the scrap heap using that sort of technique. Then there is the ABC. The Launceston office of the ABC and the local programs are under enormous threat, especially in future years. Over the next four years the ABC will lose $209 million-$11 million next year and then $66 million each year for the next three years. Regional Australia has got to take a loss when you start cutting the ABC like that. We are going to have the networking of programs out of Melbourne and Sydney and we are going to lose regional programming right round the country. It will devastate the ABC and will mean the loss in Tasmania, I am sure, of the symphony orchestra. Local programs will disappear and all our news and current affairs will probably come out of Sydney. What relevance does all this have to regional Australia? Those members opposite who represent regional Australia have failed to be able to contribute to the debate within this government. They have failed to take up the issues that are really relevant to regional Australia.",209,Representatives Main Committee
458,Mr Adams,"As I was saying, they have taken $600 million off the national highway4702 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 There are the losses and changes also to programs, such as the reducing of the tax concession from 150 per cent for research and development to 125 per cent. This puts at risk programs that were being started in our country. For instance, it has recently become technically feasible to treat primary sulphide concentrates by bacterial oxidation to dissolve copper, followed by solvent extraction and electrowinning of the copper. Simply, this is using technology to mine and retrieve the copper concentrate. The new Mount Lyell mine, at Queenstown, is experimenting with producing copper on site rather than sending it overseas to be smelted. This is a new way of smelting, a new technology. This is about smartness. This is about doing things better and differently. This is a good, value adding project, something that we desperately need in my state of Tasmania and in the rest of regional Australia. The project would have three stages over three years in conjunction with BacTech, one of two or three companies in the world who have the technology to treat these copper concentrates in this manner. So here we are, getting on the edge of technology and being knocked over by a really silly, stupid decision of a government trying to play at a political level about something to do with big black holes. This would have meant 30 to 40 jobs and the long-term the viability of this mine, which has to make itself a viable proposition over the next few years. The project is at risk. Why? Because this government really is not looking at the future. It did not have any vision in this budget. When I have heard members from the other side speak in the budget debate on the appropriations bill here, all they have wanted to do is to attack this side of the House. They want to attack the previous government but lack putting much vision into the future. They have failed to be able to go in there and take on the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) and the executive of this government, and to be able in any way to influence this. All those members who have come in from regional Australia have been walked over, and regional Australia has been the loser. The betrayal of the private sector, which is taking risks for the future, is a really silly decision. The government has a vital role to play in facilitating this and should have been in there doing it. Then there is the loss of the $150 million in infrastructure funding, putting other projects at risk. Orielton Lagoon, in southern Tasmania, is at risk. There is an irrigation scheme here and an effluent recycling project. The feasibility study showed the export opportunities for farmers involved in new crops in this area. In my electorate, just over from the airport of southern Tasmania, there are close opportunities for cherry farming, for intensive farming, taking water out of a recycling sewage farm and putting that water on to the golf club, selling the water to the golf club, selling it to farmers. The feasibility study has been done, all the engineering is done and all we needed was a bit of capital to make it happen. Of course, bingo: $150 million infrastructure funds for regional Australia, bingo. 'No constitutional responsibility,' says the minister. I turn to the shipbuilding bounty. Everybody knows the Incat success story in Tasmania. Some of the rewards that we have there are at risk. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Senator Vanstone) talks about real jobs. Real jobs have been created there, with new jobs in welding and aluminium product, and very new skills have been founded. A lot of work has gone into building up the skill base. The bounty was reviewed in February 1995 and the report found that the industry had totally transformed itself in the 1980s from a domestic situation to export, and about 80 per cent of Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4703 the production is now exported. Why change a success story? It is very hard to understand and it is just a stupid decision by government to do so. Then there is the hydrodynamic facility at the maritime college in northern Tasmania. This would have been a world class third-generation ocean testing basin. It would have put Australia at the forefront of this type of research. The sort of research that they are doing there in the maritime college is work on the platforms for the oil rigs that are now being made in Australia at Bunbury, I think, in Western Australia and at Newcastle on the east coast. The technology for these things has been developed in the test tanks at the maritime college in Launceston. Fourteen million dollars would have given us a facility that would have put us at the leading edge of technology, but that has been knocked back by this government, using this budget. So the honourable member representing that region has failed that region miserably. I could go on. I have not touched on things like funding to the state governments for programs such as housing, dental care, child care, superannuation, elderly care-all these programs that really matter to families. Government members have been quite forceful in saying that they represent families. Families are the basis of all those programs that are affected by the cuts in this budget. The families will feel the disappointment, the let-down, of the many broken promises. The government has been very short-sighted in this budget. It has failed to give a vision, a hope, to many different groups within the community that were probably thinking that with a new government there would be new opportunities and we would get some vision. But the government wanted to play around with the politics of the edge. They talked about a $9 billion deficit, black holes, et cetera. But they offered no vision to our industries or opportunities to help the long-term unemployed by putting in place the programs that needed to be put in place. This government is wishy-washy. It does not have a clue about how to stimulate job creation in this economy. It has failed. Its ministers are in disarray in the other place. The minister in our House is talking about trying to get the number of apprentices up, but he does not even know in which industries he is going to get the apprentices up. Australia has been betrayed. Regional Australia has been abandoned, betrayed, forgotten and run away from by all those members on the other side who came in from regional Australia. It is a shame, and they should be ashamed that they have let down their electorates. (Time expired) me tonight I would like to make a few points relating to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyons( Mr Adams). First of all, let me say that 77 per cent of the Australian population have already spoken. They have told us that they believe this is a fair, equitable and responsible budget, which is something that has not been achieved in my memory and certainly not in the last l3 years. I will make a couple of quick comments regarding his last remarks. I noted down on the pad in front of me the words 'short-sighted approach'. I think that is exactly what the Labor Party had. The fact that they were willing to sell the future by overspending now indicated quite rightly that they had no long-term vision. In fact, they were quite prepared to sell off the farm. They were quite prepared to go further into debt in order to fulfil their short-term goals rather than to look at the long term. They talk about the failure of the minister for employment. That is hypocrisy at its best. Six months we have been here. The Telstra bill, the industrial relations bill and the budget-the",211,Representatives Main Committee
459,Mr Brough (Longman) (6.52 P.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, in the short time available to4704 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 September 1996 things with which we went to the people-are not yet through the parliament. When the legislation is passed and they have had time to be put into place and to have an effect, we will see real jobs created. I think that we are going to pay the price for taking an honest approach to government. We saw in the lead-up to the last election so many people being put into jobs. I should say 'into outcomes'. They are not jobs; they are long-term training projects. They enable people to come off the long-term unemployment list and on to the short-term unemployment list. They do not create a job; they do not create any wealth for Australia; they do not give these people any hope. They simply made the government of the day look better. I will perhaps leave to my second instalment my other comments regarding the budget, which the greater percentage of Australians acknowledge was the correct measure to take. I make reference to A fair go for families, a publication put out by the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission. This is to pre-empt the debate that will take place in the main chamber perhaps tomorrow in relation to the family tax laws. It states: A simple method of moving towards a fairer taxation system for families would be to introduce additional tax thresholds in respect of dependents. That is exactly what this government has done. It goes on: This would recognise the additional minimum costs incurred by families with dependents. This publication of 1987 was available to the previous Labor government for some eight years, yet it never took it up. In our first term we have taken it up and on 1 January of this year we will see those tax cuts come into effect. There are two issues I would like to address in the very short time available. The first one is aged care in my own electorate of Longman. Aged Care Queensland has put a submission together which will be going to the federal and state ministers for family services in the next few days. This submission identifies particular areas of Longman as being the most disadvantaged areas when it comes to nursing homes. The area of Bribie Island in particular is one which has seen a great deal of growth, particularly for elderly people as they move there for the fishing, the beaches, the fine weather and, of course, the quiet lifestyle. It has also resulted in the fact that we have only 50 places in total, provided by one nursing home, for the entire population. The population of people aged 70 and over is some 3,000 to 4,000. This means that in reality, to be able to meet the criteria, we should have somewhere between 300 and 400 nursing home places and we have 50. The situation in Caboolture is no better. In the past the whole approach to nursing home places has been totally misdirected. We have talked of regions, and Bribie Island and Caboolture come into a planning region called Cabool. Pine Rivers Shire is also part of that particular region. That helps to equalise the numbers. It means that through this process we have been unable to deliver the places where they are needed and where the elderly population wish to live. We do not, unfortunately, have a large population. The Gold Coast, known as the south coast region, has 3,021 aged care places for a population of 30,939 over 70 years of age. This means that they are underserviced by only 73 places. In the area of Cabool, we are 224 places underserviced. If we were fully serviced just in the Bribie-Caboolture area alone, all of those places would be taken. Wednesday, 18 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4705 I am reassured by Aged Care Queensland that they are recommending 30 places be allocated to Caboolture and 70 to Bribie Island to bolster the already high quality establishments that are there, such as the Bribie Island Retirement Village and the War Veterans' Home at Caboolture, not to mention Sunnymead Nursing Home. Finally, I would like to bring to the committee's attention the plight of the Autistic Association of Queensland. I have been meeting today with two people, Mr Bruce Faye, the President of the Autism Association of Queensland, and Carol Renard. Of all the areas of special needs, this particular group is probably the most disadvantaged because, as these people pointed out to the minister and myself today, if you have in this room people suffering from perhaps Down Syndrome, it is quite obvious. Their impediments can be seen and it is very obvious visually. People with autism look just like you and me. The fact is that the needs they have are very much specialised. They need additional care. Unfortunately, in Queensland at this stage we have an absolute lack of people available to service the parents, the school teachers and the carers, as well as the children who suffer from autism. Whilst people with autism look 100 per cent healthy, their behavioural patterns and ability to communicate are often extremely lacking. The additional care they require is imperative if the families are going to have any quality of life and if the teachers are able to assist them, in particular in regional Queensland where we have one staff member looking after more than 400 families with autistic children. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned.
