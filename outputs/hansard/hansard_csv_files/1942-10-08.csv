Minister) -by ' leave-The Government has decided that the debate'on the Constitution Alteration (War Aims and Reconstruction) Bill shall not proceed until after the measure has been referred to a special committee, consisting of eight members of the House of Representatives and four members of the Senate, to be equally representative of the Government and the Opposition. The Government desires that the committee shall have added to it the Premier and the Leader of the Opposition of each State Parliament.

I propose that the House, having risen, shall meet again before Christmas, but of course the Parliament will be convened earlier if the circumstances make that necessary. The members of the committee to be chosen from the House of Representatives will be the Prime Minister( Mr had been returned to Shepparton by the Curtin), the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden), the Depnty Prime Minister( Mr Forde), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hughes), the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Army, although there was one foT the AusMenzies), the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley), and the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page). The gentlemen from the Senate who have been nominated to act on the committee are Senators Collings and Keane, representing the Government, and Senators McLeay and 'Sampson representing the Opposition. I am confident, in the light of the history of the efforts that have been made from time to time to amend the Constitution, that Tecourse to this procedure, whilst delaying the consideration of the bill by the Commonwealth Parliament, will add immeasurably to the practicability of giving effect to whatever legislation this Parliament may pass. to act in a purely advisory capacity, or is it to have mandatory powers? Has the Government fixed in the preamble to the bill a limit beyond which it will not go? consider the bill, and make any suggestions that it may wish. But the form in. which the bill shall become law will be entirely a matter for the Commonwealth Parliament. planation.

I of food instrumentalities. As an inask tbe House to believe that I obtained stance, I mentioned tinned fruits of various kinds as having been returned to Shepparton to be reeanned as fruit salad for the use of the American forces. In the Melbourne 11erald of the next day, the following statement appearedThe allegation made yesterday in Parliament by Mr Holt (United Australia party, Victoria) that tins of various types of fruit s United States Army Supply Department to be made into ""canned f r u it salad""-were described as "" all rubbish"" by an official of the Contracts Board to-day. He said the allegation must have resulted from a foolish rumour. Actually there was no contract for tinned f r u it for the American tralian forces. The information that I gave to the House reached me from what I regarded as a most authoritative source. I used it unhesitatingly, having full confidence in my informant. Having read the press reference I have quoted, which received considerable publicity in Victoria at the evening news session of the broadcasting service, I made further inquiries from the same source, the Tesult of which was to confirm the information I had previously received. The Shepparton Preserving Company was the canning company in question. AlthoughI had not alleged that any requisition had been made by the Contract Board, it would appear that a requisition was made direct by the American authorities. I have to-day received from a merchant who deals in canned fruits a letter in which he statesYou may bo interested to know that 1 have it on very good authority, that what you suspected did take place and also that another canner was requested to supply the Shepparton Cannery with canned pineapple in smallish cans for the purpose of mixing with the fruit s yon spoke about. Perhaps you will consider the last portion of the above cutting an equivocation when on the same authority we have it that the hoard makes an allocation of canned fruit s for the American forces, and further I have confirmation that this is more or less the position in a letter received from the office of the Chief Quartermaster of tlie United States Forces.",12,Membekb Alteration

Having regard to the lengthy period during which the honourable member for Barker has been parading in uniform, is there any good reason, Mr Speaker, why he should not graduate from the ranks of the koalas and go overseas to be shot at? able member should not make personal reflections of that kind under cover of a question. So far, he has not been seeking information. whether there is any substantial reason why the honourable member for Barker should, from the ambush of parliamentary privilege, have the right to take a shot at the koalas? ber is out of order. Honourable members are given the privilege of asking questions so that they may elicit information on matters of public importance, and it is specifically provided in the Standing Orders that questions must not contain comment or argument. enforce that rule somewhat more strictly in future. order. Yesterday, the honourable member for Barker referred, in what I regard as disparaging terms sulting terms to members of the Australian Military Forces, who are protecting this country in New Guinea to-day. Mir. true. orable member's reference insulting, but a very grave reflection order? The honourable member for Barker cast a grave reflection on members of the Australian M i l it a r y Forces, and you permitted it . I am now asking whether the members of the Australian M i l it a r y Forces, who are not protected by your rulings, are to be reflected on in that way, and whether the honourable member for Barker is to receive your protection simply because he happens to enjoy the privileges of membership of this Parliament. In short, was the honourable member for Barker in order yesterday in reflecting, as he did, upon the Australian M i l it a r y Forces? If so, are counterreflections on his own desire to serve out of order in this chamber, where he has an opportunity to defend himself? the honourable member for Barker made yesterday is not properly the subject of a question. the Army take action at the earliest I want to know possible date to withdraw to training bases all Australian soldiers of eighteen years of age from New Guinea and other forward battle areas?

That is why I decided that boys under twenty years of age must have had at least six months' training before they were sent to those areas. policy of the Government that youths under twenty years of age shall not be sent to forward operational stations if they have had less than six months' training, what action does the Ministerf o r the Army propose to take to bring back those thousands of youths under twenty years of age who were sent to operational stations, in some cases, as in Queensland,",14,Australian Army Territories Minor S At Operational Stations Mr Archie Cameron

It has been applied to centres throughout Australia that I do not wish to mention now, which, although large numbers of troops are stationed at them, cannot be said to be operational stations. It is true that a few shots were fired at Sydney by a submarine, but one could not call Sydney an operational station because of that. Mi-. ABBOTT -Would the honourable gentleman call New Guinea an operational station? that New Guinea would be by-passed. is wrong in saying that. As a matter of fact, I have always held that we should defend New Guinea, and the towns along the coast of Queensland. nobody knew what would be the next operational station in Australia-that it might be Perth or Fremantle, or any of the towns along the eastern seaboard which are considered to be important industrial areas. BecauseI believe that wo should have well-trained troops, and that raw recruits eighteen years of age should not be sent to operational stations, merce defer his decision regarding the I gave a direction that they should be sent to training depots for three months before being allotted to units where they should be given at least a further three months training. whether the Minister proposed to take action to bring youths back from operational stations. has my assurance that I shall have a searching investigation made of any case in which he can show that the instruction issued by the Commander-inChief on my definite advice has been disregarded. the Army take up with the Commanderin-Chief of the Allied Land Forces immediately the question of returning to Australia, as soon as possible, all boys eighteen years of age now serving in the armed forces of Australia, and of placing them, on their return, at training bases within the Ccunmonwealth ? members of the Parliament will be held later to-day at which I shall refer to matters relating to the defence of New Guinea. I have already mentioned that the Commander-in-Chief issued an instruction on the 10th July last that universal service personnel under the age of twenty years who have been called up will be allotted to training units and will not be posted to operational units until they have received at least six months' training. I cannot help thinking that the questions of the honourable -member for New England( Mr Abbott) are actuated by party politics. The honourable member wants conscription introduced so that men may be sent overseas. In any case, I am not a baby killer.

Labour and National Service aware that officers of his department have issued orders to farmers' sons to leave farms and go to certain metropolitan areas to operate freezing works, whilst the Minister for Commerce has been endeavouring to secure labour to operate freezing works in country areas? In addition, does the Minister agree with the policy of still further denuding the country districts of labour which is already in short supply? any orders have been issued along the lines mentioned by the honourable member. I do not agree that labour resources now available in farming communities should be further depleted. I shall discuss the matter with the honourable member, and if he can give me specific instances of complaints, I shall see that appropriate action is taken. AND NATIONAL SERVICE. MrM c EWEN I wish to ask the Prime Minister a question which bears upon a report, published in the Sydney Sun, on the 7 th October, of a meeting at Rockdale, which was addressed by two members of the Government. I ask this question subject to the Minister for Labour and National Service not having been again misreported. The newspaper statedThe Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward) said that when tlie Curtin Government took office there were only three Beaufort bombers in this country. That was the extent of the country's 'bombing aircraft. In view of the censorship restrictions and security considerations which prevent this grossly inaccurate statement from being corrected by those who know the facts, will the Prime Minister take steps to restrain his Ministers from making such statements? at all.

Bill read a second time, and reported from committee without amendment or debate; report adopted. Bill-by leave-rea d a third time. Debate resumed from the 30th September (vide page 1203), on motion by Mr1 That the following "" Activities of Department of War Organization of Industry-Ministerial 30th September, 1042."" On the 29th April last, the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr bicycles, as well as to the rationalization Dedman) made a statement to the House in which he described the various classes of rationalization schemes that he had in mind. It suggested to me that be bad made some examination of his subject, but had not reached any conclusion as to how or where he should start the job. Five months later, the Minister made another statement. He has now been in office twelve months. It is time he found a better defence for himself than a wearisome reiteration of the mis-statement that after an initial period of three months in office from the time the department was gazetted, I left nothing for him. What1 did was to make a survey of the problem, prepare foundation plans and recommendations and leave them for a Minister who did not use them. Be sure of this: I never intended to proceed along the lines that, he has followed, neither did I intend ever to set up the organization that he has allowed to be created. In some respects, the Minister now presents a broader view of the activities of his department, since he makes a more satisfactory reference to its work as the Secretariat and Executive Department of the Production Executive. Under this heading, he explains the efforts made towards co-ordination of the work of other departments, and mentions in particular the Australian Clothing Council, the Transport Emergency Freight Committee and the Food Council. AU these are important functions, though I shall not pause at this stage to express my own view as to how they could be better approached if the Department of War Organization of Industry were placed in a more advantageous position. I shall refer to this matter before I conclude my remarks. In other respects, the Minister's statement suggests that, some of the bright dreams of April have faded during the long winter nights that have since passed. Time for reflection may have brought with it a realization of the futility of some of tbe schemes of the autumn. Either the Minister is not able, or has pa.per lie printed: purposely failed, to touch on this statement. occasion on a number of important references which he made in April to such industries as the manufacture of windmills, electrical appliances, and of wool, meat, garages and service stations. It is in this branch of ilm department's activities that trouble is most likely to be found and made. This Minister has evidently discovered this fact, for he now refers to a large list of industries where rationalization has proceeded on a voluntary basis under some measure of departmental leadership. He is evidently not. so confident now of",22,Second Reading
103,Mr Spender (Warringah) [3.39],,23,Dedman
104,Mr Spooner (Robertson) [3.41],"the doctrine of "" concentration"", upon which the House was addressed at considerable length in April last. On the 29th April, the Minister saidThe rationalization plans for the banking system, now well advanced, include provision for a special form of concentration. This is to be effected by closing one or more bank branches in the many localities in which hankabout men who, in the future, will be ing facilities are greatly in excess of the community's needs. The Minister then proceeded to complain that banks had anticipated him by closing down branches ""without any sanction"". The Minister added that be had "" taken up the matter with the banks, which had now undertaken that no further branches would be closed down pending the completion of our rationalization plans "". After five months, I can find only one reference to banking in the Minister's that of wholesale and retail distribution, and statement of the 30th September. He this is not being neglected. saysIn the near future complete proposals for a covered a large haul of man-power-som e considerable number of industries, representplace where the scope for his war ing months of careful preparation, will he organization could be used to some purproduced. Some of the industries in respect pose. AllI can find upon this subject in of which a great deal of work has already his statement made five months later is been done are indicated in the following list. the following vague statement:Here follows a list of twelve industries, with banking placed inconspicuously in its closest attention to other fields in which tbe middle. It follows electroplating, man-power and other problems are arising and precedes hand and garden tools. in an increasing degree-for example rural Some of its other colleagues in this list industries and wholesale and retail trade. of twelve are cosmetics and dentifrice. The Minister is not always organizing ing solution of the problem that in April industry for war-be is in some cases last he described as a "" f r u it f u l field for preventing the organization of industry concentration "". for war. The banks wanted to do the job, and started it. They would have finished it and done it well without new ground with regard to the retail injury to the industry or inconvenience trade only. In this connection, however to the public. Let me tell the House his remarks do not appear to have much what is being done voluntarily by one to do with the war organization of of the largest banks in Australia. It has industry. He seems to be anxious to closed 168 branches and agencies secure some political defence against the throughout Australia. 2,359 men from the Australian staff for his department are having the effect of the services. It is carrying on with a closing down small businesses. Indeed -> total male and female staff which is 1,091 the Minister rises to heights of indignaless than at the outbreak of war. It has tion on this point. He saysmade an agreement with the man-power authorities to release gradually 107 men, who have already been granted war leave piece and are awaiting call-up with the small firm. various units, and 370 men under eighteen years of age who will be released Nobody said that he was biased against Mr Spooner. as they attain military age. Upon releasing these men, the bank will have provided in Australia 2,729 men, representing 67 per cent, of its total male staff at the outbreak of war. Illustrations like this show how ungenerous are the Minister's cheap gibes taken from "" white collar"" jobs to do work requiring physical exertion. Let me tell the Minister that the white collar men have not waited for him to lead the way. Nor have they taken jobs in munitions factories at double their former pay. They are in the front line in their thousands, and Australia will bless them for their courage and patriotism. On the 29th April, the Minister saidAnother fruitful field for concentration is It seemed that the Minister had disThe department has recently begun to give This does not seem to be a very satisfyOn this occasion, the Minister breaks It has released charge that the unsettling activities .of I challenge memhers to produce a single of evidence which suggests that my department's actions are biased against the small firms. What is said of him is what he then proceeds to admit in his own statement. I quote himFinns have been eloscd as a result o l my orders prohibiting non-essential production, but these orders have put out of business all firms dependent upon the prohibited products, whether large or small. AllI can add is that the large firms have protected themselves, because they were able to change over to different goods, whilst small firms have suffered for the clumsiness of the Minister's policy. The Minister appears now to realize the political danger of this, foT any one can see to-day the empty small shops in country towns and suburbs. He saysAmongst those who have suffered aTe the small firms which have been unable to keep going on a reduced turnover as supplies have become short. The Minister's solution of this problem is worth quoting in f u l l The closing down of small auburhan shops is an aspect of this problem which has given rise to particular concern. The Government is now considering ways and means of diverting man-power from retail trade, and in this connection it may he possible to take action which w ill result in the diversion to the small shops of some of the business that is now done in the large departmental stores. This w ill raise difficult problems, but members may rest assured that the Government w i ll take any action along those lines which is administratively practicable. advantages of this course lies in the fact that the large stores employ a typo of labour which is well suited to the needs of war production, whereas small shops in the suburbs can rely more readily on part-time assistance and on workers not easily transferable to WBT jobs. the doubts and the generalities of this statement, one may easily perceive that the Minister has no solution of the problem at all. I would say, in regard to the assertion of the last sentence which I quoted, that the reverse is usually the position. LaTge stores can carry on with specialized girls, but small shops require the versatile man of greater capacity in many cases. The Minister will not allay fears by such foolish statements as this. On the 29th April, the Minister appeared to have made great discoveries in the woollen and worsted textiles. He saidInvestigation showed that firms were producing classes and grades of material for civilian purchases which bore little OT no relation to the real needs of the community. W it h the co-operation of tlie manufacturers and tlie Textile Workers Union, we were able to allocate production in suitable proportions to a number of standardized hues which are essential. Nothing more appears in support of this except that on the morning after the Minister's' statement, the press announced the appointment of another committee. One might have expected the Minister to make some mention of this new committee, seeing that it deals with an important industry which is strained to the limit for war production at this moment. The Minister, in a preamble to his statement on the 30th September, said that "" honourable members are entitled to the fullest possible information "". Why does not he tell the House about schemes affecting textiles, retail trades, and the wool industry concerning which we read, within a few days before and after his statement, more or less official forecasts in the press as to what would happen ? The Minister's statement delivered on the 30th September, is, on the whole, not nearly so impressive as the statement of the 29th April. Tbe present statement is that of a frightened man who looks from right to left, because most of his experiOne of the ments up to now have provided for him an experience that leaves no margin for optimism as to the success of future experiments. What the Minister must realize is that the people in control of Australian industry are just as patriotic as he is, and there is no need to threaten socialistic schemes under cover of a war effort. He will get all the co-operation that is possible if only he asks for it. My observations lead me to say that Australian industries, large and small, need only to bo told what is expected from them and they will co-operate in preparing and implementing a sound plan to releaso men and materials. I go further, and say that the only result of real value that the Minister has secured in rationalization and what he calls "" concentration "" is where he has appealed for and secured the co-operation of industries which, from their own intimate knowledge of their undertakings, are able to bring into operation without chaos the measures that are necessary to release man-power and",23,Dedman

In this connection we are examining the policy adopted by the United Kingdom Board of Trade which September statementprotects as far as possible the interests of suppressed firms by arrangements for the pooling of profits in one form or another so as to minimize the advantage of the firms kept in production. I find l it t l e or not h in g in the M in is t e r ' s activities the department is assisted by the statement on the 30th September to r e f u t e the suggestion t h a t as he gained more experience of the realities of in d u s t r y those well-intended doctrines f e l l by the wayside.

The most recently established committee is the Transport Emergency Freight Committee. This committee was set up in recognition of the fact that, however effective the separate authorities responsible for providing transport facilities may be, there is need in addition for a body which will look at the transport question as a whole and ensure that freight priorities are so allocated that first things come first whether transport by sea, land or air is in question. A central focus for transport priorities is imperative in these present circumstances when transport facilities are strained to such an extent that even the basic fuels and raw materials of industry must often bo withheld for lack of transport. I shall watch the progress of t h is e f for t , and I hope t h a t it, w ill not go the w a y of of unreality Like its predecessors in April, it reads too much like the adaptamention large rationalization schemes impracticable and prepared by people I quote again from the Minister's The department is looked to for advice on the relative essentiality of various civil industries from the viewpoint, for example, of man-power policy and the supply of scarce materials. In these and other co-ordinating fact that the statistician of the Department of War Organization of Industry has been given general charge of the war statistics section constituted by the Commonwealth Statistician to maintain liaison between statistical officers of various war departments. As an. answer to my question of the 9th September the Minister's statement upon rationalization in particular is about as vague as it can possibly be. I am no wiser than before I asked the question, for in respect of all the matters he mentions I have seen references in the It is press from time to time. I am not at all thrilled by the fact that he has set up He a super-statistician to co-ordinate the existing army of statisticians. I quote it I do not want without purpose to say anything in disparagement of what the Minister has done. His efforts have been encouraged in the press at times, but. in the aggregate they leave me with an empty feeling. The"" Victory"" suit without a vest may or may not save a little cloth, but I am afraid it will cause a lot of bronchitis and pneumonia if it does not, break down before next winter.

115,Mr Spooner,"The Minister spendsplan submitted to the Central Wool Committee. These points suited the illustration he sought to make. When invited to read the balance of the plan he said he would not weary the House by doing so. When assured by me that I should not be wearied and that I wanted to hear the plan, he said it was a confidential Cabinet document and he could not disclose it. If this is so, why did he another huge and independent organizadisclose the first two points that suited him? All this suggests to me that the Minister is not sure of himself. C can guess some of the balance of his plan, because it has appeared in the press. some eases, that it is working at cross If the Minister thinks it proper to reduce purposes with action or policy in another the number of sheep in Australia he had better seek some sound advisers who understand the industry. He might then find a very different view, -both as to the advisability of such a policy and as to the practicability of carrying it out department really needs to be born again. either by voluntary or compulsory methods. I have been critical of the Minister and his department, but I do not want to conclude my remarks without offering some constructive advice, for I feel that the department needs some help. It seems to me that there are two basic weaknesses in tbe administration, and if these can be removed many of the troubles of which I have spoken will remove themselves. First, the department is too far removed from the big jobs of the war. Iu my view the Departments of Supply and Munitions should be under one Minister and the Department of War Organization of Industry should also come under that Minister. If necessary he should have an Assistant Minister. Most of the things which the Department of War Organization of Industry tries to do are the function of another Minister. The Area Boards of Management control factory production of munitions. Supply Department controls the purchasing of materials and foodstuffs. It is not likely-that the Minister for War Organization of Industry can exercise much influence upon the real problems of these departments while he controls a separate administration. production executive to co-ordinate these and other departments is the next best thing. In war-time, however, we cannot afford to have the next best thing. We Mr Spooner. need the best, and the best can only result from direct policy that is administered through the departments that deal with industry, production and war needs, and that are in a position to know how to get results without disturbance to war production and .urgent civil needs. The Minister has allowed his department to run true to official form by building up tion that works on the outskirts of the real problems of the war. Every now and then the department seems to pounce on one of these problems only to find, in department. Secondly, the department's staff is too large, and, in many cases, too theoretical. It lacks the guidance of men who have had person contact with and experience in industry. In this regard, the A glance through the extensive range of principal offices, set up in the department proves the wisdom of a celebrated character in The Gondoliers, who saidWhen everyone is somebodec Then no one's anybody. There is a director and there are three assistant directors-on e for rationalization, another for administration, and a third for production investigation. There is a deputy director, who is also chief economic adviser. There is also an economic adviser, who has the status of an assistant director. There is a statistician to oo-ordinate the statisticians of various other war departments. There are also six State deputy directors. There are four industries divisions and each of them has a head. They are foodstuffs and associated products; building, printing, stoneware, all services and amusements; iron and steel, industrial chemicals, The engineering .and motor vehicles; and clothing, textiles and footwear. There is a prohibitions division and, of course, it has a head. There follow a number of gentlemen with very imposing titles, such as these:-Advise r on pastoral industries; adviser on industrial chemicals; adviser The constitution of a on rural economics; adviser on bread and milk zoning. Then there are a few gentlemen with these specially imposing titles -Chairman, Australian Clothing Council and deputy, chairman, Australian Council for Clothes Styling; liaison officer with, transport authorities; executive officer, Pastoral Industries Survey. In New South Wales there is not only a deputy director, but also an assistant deputy director. There are four sectional officers. In Victoria there are six industrial officers. It is amazing that there has been built up in a year an organization that is estimated to cost no less than £103,000 in 1942-43. What we really need ia somebody to unorganize the Department of War Organization of Industry. To these officers, each' doing Ids best, no doubt, the Minister must seem a mythical figure to whom reports must travel through tbe hands of State deputy directors, central deputy directors, assistant directors, and on to the director, at which stage the reports are getting fairly close to the Minister himself. When the history of this war is written, it will be recorded that the road to victory along which our soldiers travelled in their triumphant return was strewn with thousands of reports that nobody had time to read properly. I tell the Minister now that, amongst the decisions which I had made in my three months of exploration, was thefixed,determination that I should work the Department of War Organization of Industry with a director and a staff of about six to ten at the most. I intended to use the machinery of the existing departments to investigate and implement plans for the war organization of industry. I fear that the Minister has lost control of the department, which has passed into the hands of officials, economists and statisticians. urgent need of the department to-day is a plan to rationalize itself. The truth is that much that the Department of War Organization of Industry is trying to do by unnatural means would happen in a perfectly natural manner if the Government had the courage to set in operation a policy that would go to the roots of to-day's financial and economic problems. The excessive spending power that enables the public to make demands upon industry for consumer goods is reflected in the activity of all industry from tbe manufacturer to the retailer. The diversion of this excess spending power to war needs would be achieved very effectively and simply if there were in operation a scheme of post-war credits such as has been urged during the budget debate. This should be supplemented by a more extensive scheme of rationing than is now in operation. If I were a betting man, I am sure that the Minister would very sportingly lose a bet to me that, before next February, this Government will be forced to institute a system of post-war credits. Had it done so at the proper time, it would have avoided many of the economic ills from which this country is suffering to-day. If this were done, most of the results now sought by the rationalization of industry would be secured right away, because the public would bave less money with which to create immediately the demand that now compels industry to use man-power and materials that are needed for war purposes. Conversely, the people would have more money after the war, when spending upon consumer-goods would help to restore industry and reduce unemployment. It is because this is not done that a widespread and complicated system of rationalization is being applied. This is not only difficult to apply, but also difficult to police, and difficulties will not diminish as time passes, because tbe root troubles are increasing every month. Only some of the people will practice austerity and contribute by voluntary methods to the national funds. The balance of the people will continue to create this unnatural demand of which I have spoken, and which will continue to embarrass The most the nation. The only real cure is a balanced programme of compulsory savings, rationing and rationalization. When the point is reached where this is recognized by the Government and put into operation despite its political difficulties, most of the need for this extraordinary and complicated activity in the Department of War Organization of Industry will have ceased to exist. The problem would have been tackled in this way if the previous Government had remained in office, and if I bad continued in office as Minister for this department. I am convinced that, had this course been followed, the work of the Department of War Organization of Industry, so f a r as rationalization is conemployment orders and the rationalization of cerned, would have been reduced to non-essential industries where civil production gradually to war production. | Extension of lime granted.} The Minister's statement is no reply to the question which I asked the Prime Minister on the 9th September. It commences with a survey of the people transferred from civilian life and work to direct war work in the armed services, factories and elsewhere, and presents what the Minister describes as "" a broad picture of the achievements in diverting resources to the war effort to which the Government can lay claim "". By a skilful suggestion, it narrows down the credit to the Department of War Organization of Industry by saying, ""' Man-power movements oi this magnitude have not been achieved without careful planning and organization "". I say that the foundation for this was left to the present Government by the previous Government, which prepared for great expansions of the munitions industries which have occurred during the last two years, and particularly since June, 1940. Huge factories in different parts of Australia were in course of construction, and some were closely approaching the stage of completion in October, 1941, when they required staff and equipment. Obviously, the entry of Japan into the war in December, 1941, also created conditions that made possible an outlook on the part of Australians entirely different from anything that had existed up to that time. Isi t not possible to stop this game of political chess? Doesi t matter which government did things, so long as we w in this war and save Australia for our children to live peacefully and happily? Why should we expend our energies as 1942 dra ws to a close in endeavouring to prove which government or which department holds the blue ribbon of achievement? The ineffectiveness of the Minister's reply is evidenced in one paragraph of his statement:Measures designed to divert labour and resources include control of buildings, the prohibition of the manufacture of certain ( articles, the control of new businesses, disifr. Spooner. industry. I do not wish to weary the House with a detailed account of all these activities and will confine my attention to the problems could have been transferred of the rationalization of industry. But he would not have wearied me. I wanted to know what his department was doing. I know all about the control of buildings. That was an established function under the Treasury long ago and handed over to the Minister as a going concern a few months back. I should like to know something about the new business that he is controlling. Does he refer to the activities of the Capital Issues Board, for that also has been functioning for more than two years and was placed under the Minister only recently? I want to know about these prohibitions-wha t they are, the reason for them, and exactly what results have been achieved. I have in mind a small manufacturer who wrote to me recently that hibusiness had been closed J down. A fte r I bad written to the Department of War Organization of Industry asking the reasons it was discovered that he had been doing work for the naval services and the Ministry of Munitions. He was then allowed to reopen his factory. I quote the following from a letter he wrote to me on the 7th July:Since the closing down of my business on the 12th -Tune, I have received several urgent orders for chain for defence work, hut with the present restrictions 1 am prohibited from making chain either for defence or any other purpose. This is the kind of action that results in the closing down of small businesses. The proof of it can be found in the Minister's own statement, fro m which I quote the following: Most of the rationalization schemes BO far introduced-especiall y those introduced voluntarily-d o not go the whole way towards rationalization. Often still more varieties, could be eliminated ami production concentrated in fewer firms. That blessed word ""concentration"" is the death-blow to small firms. It is easily understandable that when the production of six firms is concentrated so that only four firms remain, those that are eliminated are the small firms who thereupon pay the penalty for a tragic policy. [ am told by manufacturers who will not allow their names to be disclosed that they receive instructions from the Department of War Organization of Industry that cut right across arrangements for the production of war supplies that they have with other government departments. I was told of such a case only last Monday. I mention this because it is evident that, the department is not fully co-ODerating with the large departments that, are responsible for war production and supply. I am convinced that it was a huge blunder for the Department of War Organization of Industry to be made a separate entity roving amongst the industries that are working at top pressure for the war. people in Sydney and Melbourne the department is nick-named "" The Department for Disorganization of Industry "". When I listened to the Minister's vague statements, and read his explanation of the set-up of this huge department. I , ealized that there must, lie sound reason other subjects involved in an all-in war for the disquietude that I find everywhere concerning the department's activities. I often wonder whether Australia, with its limited population of 7,000,000 spread over a huge continent, is trying to do too many things in tlie winning of this war. that I do not suggest that we are doing too much, for that is not, possible when our country and the lives of our women and children are at stake. It is possible, however, that we may do twenty things imperfectly where we might, do fifteen things perfectly, and get a better aggregate result. It is mathematically correct, even in a war, that two into one will not go. A complete examination, of this view would be a worth-while function of the Department of War Organization of Industry. The Army-and I have nothing but gratitude in my heart for the Army -ma y see only its own problems. The Cabinet is the only authority that can clearly survey all departments associated with the war effort to see how Australia's aggregate resources may be applied for the best, result. I do not seek to pose as a military authority, and I offer no considered opinion upon this subject. I am entitled to think about it . however, and I find myself wondering very often whether, with fewer men at the battle stations and with more men to organize the production of munitions and food, our position might not be stronger. The mechanization of armies and our dependence upon aircraft compel me to think along these lines, particularly as the war is likely to last a few years longer and the needs of England, Russia and China will not diminish in relation to America's productive capacity. When the Man-power and Resources Survey Committee conducted its inquiries in the first half of 1941 it gave some thought to these problems. Its conclusions may, or may not, have been r i g h t ; but it at. least made many recommendaAmongst business tions concerning the organization of manpower, technical training, the organizing and financing of factories for war production, the administration of government departments under war conditions, the solution of labour problems, the construction of strategic works, and many eifort. That, too, was months before Japan entered the war. I am sure 1 speak for nil the members of that committee, of which I was chairman, when 1 say that if they had been told that their recommendations had been considered Let honourable members be clear but could not be adopted, they would at least have accepted the position with regret and felt that they had done their best. Sixteen months after the first and second reports of the committee were delivered to the Government, the committee \va= asked to meet again to consider longthy comments and criticisms that had been made during the interval by the departments in respect of which improvements had been suggested. From the nature of many of these comments it would appear that the committee could not offer many suggestions that were considered of value and that the existing procedure left little to be desired. A fte r a group of recommendations by the committee had run the gauntlet of comment, by the Department of Munitions, the Treasury, the Department of Supply and Development and the Board of Business Administration, they finally came home to rest with the Department of War Organization of Industry. The Minister was evidently bewildered and at a loss to know what to do, so he has staved off the evil day of decision, by asking the committee to meet again, more than a year after it thought it was dead and buried, to confer with departmental representatives and consider the recommendations and their comments. The committee will do this, and do it gladly. I cannot be blamed for feeling, however, that any misguided person who seeks to enter the dark doors of officialdom witb any suggestions should, first, read, the notice over the portal li Abandon hope all ye ^ho enter here"". It is well known, that the Minister holds advanced views upon the socialization of industry. I have no intention, at the moment, of debating these theories witb him. Whatever is to happen to our industrial and social order will happen after the war. The people will decide this issue after much has been said for and against many proposals that will be advocated. In the meanwhile we are in danger of losing our priceless heritage. The only thing that matters is how to get the benefit of every ounce of the nation's resources in men, materials and money. To do this we need to use the industrial system-bot h the farms and the factories-for war purposes, and to supply the civil population with essential needs as well as to supply England and our allies, where we can, with foodstuffs and other productions of this country. To do this it is not necessary to break down our industrial system in the middle of a war. Every unit, however small, may be made to play some part now in achieving our aims. There is need to maintain nM>rale in industiy as well as amongst the people. Industry will give of its best if it is handled the right way. We can be critical of one another, for only by fair criticism can we improve methods that we consider are not in the best interests of the war effort; but there is no need for us tochide one another upon our positions or our principles, for that can lead 1 only to division in the national ranks. The Minister's attitude towards industry reminds me of a famous couplet, and I apologize for adapting it to the administration of the Department of War Organization of Industry which endeavoursTo .prove its doctrines orthodox By economic blows and knocks. The theologian concerning whom this was written with apostolic reference may If r . Spooner. have done more good and achieved better results, by a more tolerant attitude and a better understanding of tbe faith of those who did not agree with him. I offer thai observation to the Minister as a guiding principle that may help him in the administration of the Department of War Organization of Industry. statement made to the House by the Minister for War Organization of In dustry ( Mr Dedman) on the operations of his department has caused the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) to release a tirade upon us which from my observation, suggests that tbe honourable gentleman, who was Minister for War Organization of Industry in two previous governments, is jealous of what the present Minister has been able to achieve. The honourable gentleman may justlybe absolved from having done anything while he held the portfolio! During his term in office numerous questions, were asked of him in this House concerning one aspect or another of the organization of war industry, but all his replies were to the effect that he had not been able to discover the proper function of hi3 department, and consequently was not able to say whether the subjects referred to him came properly within his purview or not. He held the office for quite a considerable time; yet he had no knowledge of what he was supposed to do. The war was developing; yet there was no provision for the maximum use of manpower for the defence of Australia. The present Government had. to make good many of the shortcomings of its predecessors. Considerable man-power had to be provided, for tbe Army, for other war services, and for munitions production,, because the previous Government had definitely fallen down on its job. The task has been accomplished with a substantial degree of success. It has not been pleasant for either the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) or the Government. When Australia found itself at war with Japan, large forces had to be placed in the field, and a substantial number of men and women had to be engaged in munition* production and various other avenues for the supply of essential needs. In order",27,Dedman
116,Mr Clark (Darling) [4.29],"-Thethat that might be done, man-power bad to he transferred from industries that were considered not absolutely essential during the war to others that are essential. The Minister for War Organization of Industry bad to bear the brunt of what had to be done. His department is most difficult to administer. When he assumed office, he found that no organization had been built up by the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner), and he had to start from the ground floor. I consider that he has done exceptionally well, because he had no previous experience to guide him, and no precedents to follow. Praeticallv every other department had operated in times of peace, and many of them had also been operating throughout the war. Incoming Ministers, with the exception of the Minister for War Organization of Industry, had the benefit of the advice and guidance of officers who had had many years of experience. The Department of War Organization of Industry was entirely new, and the Minister not only had to do what was expected in regard to the rationalization of industry, but also had to build up the machinery with which to do it. Although some of the schemes evolved may not have been carried out to the best advantage, all things considered, the work has been performed most meritoriously. The honourable member for Kobertson would hope to achieve results by taxation or other monetary means. Positive and physical methods are the most practical. Man-power has been directed from one source to another where it has been most desired. Any haphazard scheme for the taxation of an individual and the reduction thereby of his spending power would not divert an establishment from the manufacture of refrigerators to the manufacture of parts for aeroplanes or to any other essential purpose. The employees in industries that have been devoted to the production of war needs would not have had avenues of employment had it not been for the organization established by the Departments of War Organization of Industry and Labour and National Service. Special reference has been made to the the working of the system. What comrationalization of the sheep and wool plaints have been made were based on industry. Action taken by the Minister in that respect has been quite satisfactory, and there is no reason for complaint by any one. Those interested in the industry have been consulted, and the Minister will continue to consult them before adopting methods designed to obtain what the Government regards as necessary. Our flocks are now larger than they have been for many years, and are considerably larger than the average. That position is in some degree attributable to improved pastures, fewer rabbits, and greater carrying capacity. Recently, Australia emerged from an extensive drought , that covered the greater part of its area. It is therefore reasonable to assume that with better conditions, such as are now being experienced, even larger numbers of stock could be carried with safety. The Government does not desire or intend to reduce the number of stock merely for the sake of having fewer. The Minister requested and appealed to those concerned to consign their stock to treatment works for dehydration and canning purposes in order to supply the needs of the Army. It is necessary to stress the necessity for the provision of dehydrated meats, because our troops in New Guinea and other tropical regions have to be fed on those products. If the required number of stock be not sent voluntarily by those who produce them, other means to achieve what is desired will have to be found. The action of the Minister in that connection has been quite satisfactory, and no one has cause for complaint. Steps were taken for the establishment of shearing zones. This may have proved inconvenient to some owners of stock, hut generally the scheme has worked satisfactorily and shearing has proceeded with few hitches. Had action not been taken by the Government, many persons might not have been able to obtain shearers, because they were scattered throughout the country. Shearing in zones has largely helped to concentrate labour, with the result that sheep have been shorn on time and with the least dislocation. I have recently been through a large portion of different .States, and have found very little complaint in regard to prejudice, or were tlie result of misfortune in connection with private arrangements that had been made. The transport of wool is a vital problem. Railway rolling-stock is needed for the movement of troops and supplies in different parts of Australia; consequently the existing facilities for the shifting of ing of the matter. The people are apprewool are not so great as were those in normal times. The action taken by the Minister has considerably eased the position. Those engaged in the industry realize that the Government is labouring under great difficulties, and that the Minto chaos in one industry after another. ister cannot be accused of failing to take action to meet the position. The charge appears to be that he has gathered round him a staff of varied experience. The Minister for ""War Organization of Industry has done an excellent job and the ex-Minister, the honourable member for Robertson, is rather peeved about it. Because he failed to do anything while he was in office for three months, he regards it as his special right to attack the present occupant of the office every time he gets the chance. The letter addressed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr the report reads as follows:Fadden) to members of his party, a copy of which was read in this House by the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr held to endeavouT to get information as to the Pollard) recently, invited honourable members to ventilate in the House their grievances against the Department of War Organization of Industry in an attempt to embarrass the Government. Evidently, the honourable member for Robertson accepted the invitation, and during the recess prepared a long attack on the department, which he has now read to the House. That was his contribution to the attack upon the Government and, now that he has got it off his chest, he will probably be satisfied. The work of the Minister for War Organization of Industry may safely be left to the judgment of the House. The present Government may have erred because it acted in certain directions, but the previous Government erred more grievously in that it did not act at all. source of astonishment to me that the honourable member for Darling( Mr and the only remedy was the rationalization Clark) should have been able to discover in the work of the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) anything upon which to congratulate him. If the honourable member were to go out into the country and listen to what, the people are saying, particularly those who have been affected by the activities of the Minister, he would obtain a different understandciative of the reasons which led the Minister to attempt to do something, but they say, quite rightly, that his attempts have completely failed in their purpose. What he has done has led, and is leading, 1 know that bis job is not an easy one; probably it is more difficult than the job of any other Minister in the Cabinet, but he should have been able to make a more successful effort than he has made. I am particularly concerned with the effect which his measures have had on small shopkeepers. I have here a report of a conference which was recently held in one of the largest towns in my electorate, and it is illuminating as showing what is happening to a large and important class of business people. An extract from The chairman briefly reviewed the discussions and stated that the conference had been probable cause of the closing of so many shops. It was stated that in Prahran 200 small shops had closed down, and in St. Kildu. 177, while Hawthorn. Camberwell and other suburbs had also suffered severely. It was considered that the closing down of these shops had been due to lack of man-power or shortage of supplies, or both. A committee interviewed the mau-power authorities, and it was found that no relief could be given in that direction. The supply problem was different, liowever, and the Director of Supplies has been asked for information. The supply question was a serious one. He did not know how Dandenong was being affected, but, judging by the attendance, local businesses were evidently meeting with difficulties. The chairman stated that Mr Gerald Magirs. in replying to a questionnaire sent out, gave it as his opinion that the present position had been brought about by the big emporiums in the city getting most of the supplies and the small shopkeepers merely what was left. One delegate said that the main cause of all. the trouble, he considered, was the wholesale distribution favouring big stores, which were able to trade in almost every commodity, of business. If n man is a grocer, let him sell groceries only, and so on. This would eliminate the difficulties of supply and distribution.",32,Dedman
117,Mr Ryan (Flinders) [4.43],"It is a"" My main trouble is man-power"", said anotiier speaker. "" Since the war began, I have lost live of my staff. In some instances, tliere has been a shortage of supplies. 'What beats jne, though, is that some lines, more particularly those required by the farming community, are unobtainable from the warehouse, yet can be purchased in the local market and, in many eases, without the correct number of coupons."" Another speaker pointed out that there was a slackening of supplies to Dandcnong from the beginning of A p r i l , but he had found that the country. I could name half a dozen the big stores in the city still carried a plentiful supply of everything. This was unfair to tbe small man, who sticks to his legitimate trade. The Director of Supplies should go fully into the matter and t r y and arrive at rationalization of business. As far as confectionery was concerned, what he used to get weekly ho now gets monthly, or once in six weeks. That sums up the position f a i r l y as regards the small shopkeepers. The Minister has also closed bank branches in country areas, and he has been closing other businesses in a laudable attempt to make man-power available. man-power will eventually be directed into the war effort, but there is often a considerable lag between the release of man-power from some civil occupation and its employment upon war production. Tliere are in Australia a great many men-som e of them retired, but still active-wh o are not at present engaged in industry, but who could be so engaged. Before that available reservoir has been completely exhausted, the Minister should proceed warily in breaking up the. small businesses that are affected by the present regulations. The small shopkeepers constitute a part of the backbone of the community. The majority of them built up their own businesses and are employed in a very useful work. To force -them out of business, as a class, will be to do a great disservice to the country. Before the Minister closes their businesses, he should examine closely the unemployed man-power that is still available. Many person? n k honourable meme bers to find work for them. several hundreds through my hands, many are capable of performing useful war work. June, I received a visit from a refugee from Singapore. Aged 40 years, he was a qualified civil engineer and had been an official in the service of the Government of the Malay States. He was not obliged to work, because he was still receiving a salary from the British Government, but he was keen to find a war job. No department would employ him, so in despair he communicated with me. 1 wrote to five departments on his behalf, but after five months he was still looking for an opportunity to assist in the war effort. His experience and qualifications would be of great value to men, in their early fifties, who have had managerial experience and who desire to serve Australia. Why should we upset, small businesses and shops when a large reservoir of man-power is still available to fill a hundred and one different positions, if only the organization were there to absorb them? Before the Minister proceeds with his work of disorganization, he should ensure that these people shall be placed in useful employment. speech of the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) was a classic example of non-co-operation. In my opinion, the honourable gentleman would make a fitting successor to his former leader and colleague who represented the Commonwealth on the Eastern Group Supply Council at New Delhi. In India at rhe present time the policy of nonco-operation is very active, and has distressing potentialities. The display by the honora.ble member for Bobertson would teach some of the leading Indians new tricks in non-co-operation. No honourable member was more fitted tban the honourable member for Robertson to discuss the subject of rationalization as applicable to small shopkeepers. Unfortunately, he did not deal with it in the spirit that members of the Labour partu approached it . Thousands of their friends are being displaced from industries which are not considered vital to the war effort, and we bad to explain to Of the tbe persons affected the reasons for their who have passed displacement. But the honourable member for Bobertson made a plea for the reLast tention of a class that he knows, in his heart, can have no place in a strongly and strictly rationalized system, The retention of half a dozen small storekeepers in a street, 100 yards long, each competing with the others, creates in",34,October 1942 Organizationof Industry 1535
118,No Doubt This Mr Bbee N (Galare) [4.55],"Th ewar-time an impossible position. As an accountant, tbe honourable member knows that better tban most people. Yet, for political reasons, he made a plea for the retention of such a system. Every one has sympathy for the tradesmen who must be displaced in the present crisis; but we also have sympathy for the families which have been broken up when men have joined the fighting forces. We do not allow our sympathy so to distort our sense of proportion that we make political speeches urging the retention of the troops in industry. Such a practice would produce chaos in the Defence Forces. Knowing the position, the honourable member for Robertson showed himself to be a person who is playing party politics to extremes. I come now to the scheme of rationalization that the Minister is attempting to introduce in the primary industries. No part of our economy calls so insistently for rationalization as do the primarry industries. money . has been poured into farms in order to maintain these uneconomic units and to create surpluses of products which we cannot sell. Representing a primary producing electorate, I know the suffering that results from the policy of rationalization; but I am honest enough to tell the people that if with the small resources at our disposal we are to defend Australia, they must suffer. the whole position is unfortunate, because these uneconomic units are a hard-working and useful section of the community. Some sacrifice has to be madej and that is a section of the community whose operations can be dispensed with more than those of scientifically developed sections of primary industry. bounties have been paid to certain sections of primary industry to continue them in the production of a commodity that we cannot consume. Large sums of money have been paid year after year in order land, which we know cannot be economically managed. We know that certain sections of the country have been wrongly allocated for closer settlement, but, instead of admitting the mistake and cutting our losses by transferring the farmers to other areas where they could produce economically a needed commoStr.

They eke out some kind of an existence far below the standards of living on which we pride ourselves. Those remarks apply, not only to the wheat-growing industry, but also to the wool-growing industry and the frui t industry, and, lately, we have had brought forcefully to our notice the depressed state of the dairying industry. That industry has reached such a lowstate that many men have been forced to abandon their farms; others have been driven to open revolt. That state of affairs, in my opinion, is the direct consequence of a long period of mismanagement and unscientific control. If there be one section of the community that calls for the close attention of the Minister for War Organization of Industry and his staff, it is that represented by those engaged For generations, in primary industries. Their representatives have been most insistent in demands for re-organization of the industries. They have been able to see more clearly than the outsider .could the chaotic conditions in which they labour, and they have been appealing for the creation of a central authority with power to give effect to its decisions for the rationalization of their industries. In Admittedly, the last twelve months since this party took office we have had in the Commonwealth a government which, as the primary producers have realized, is clearly attempting to do something to straighten out their affairs. Month after month, especially when Parliament has been in session, deputations from primary indusFor generations tries have asked the Government to establish a central authority for that purpose. Every organization representing primary producers has sent to the Government resolutions asking for the appointment of a director of agriculture to keep wheat-farmers on with a full power of control. It has been said that the Minister for War Organization of Industry has not sought tbe cooperation of the people who know primary industries, but has imposed on those industries a secretariat without any sympathy with or understanding of the rank and file of the industries; hut the very fact that the representatives of those inin the Department of War Organization dustries have appealed to the Government to take control of them is positive proof that the Augean stahle can be cleared only by apolitical Hercules like the Minister for War Organization of Industry. I say that advisedly, because, if there be any herculean task, it is that War Organization of Industry with reconfronting the Minister. All his colleagues realize that. Former Ministers, now in Opposition, critical though they be of what the Minister is doing, realize the tremendous task he has in front of him. If there were any truth in the Opposition's professions of co-operation, its criticism would be more constructive, and not so destructive as it has been shown to bo in the debates which have lately taken place in this chamber. I , with other honourable members, realize that the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) has a very awkward job of work to do, but I suggest that it would be made much easier if he had a staff conversant with primary industries, business, and manufacturing industries generallya staff that could tell him where anomalies are being created and advise him in a maimer which would enable him to make regulations and take action to correct, or at any rate not dustry claimed that the rationalization perpetuate, a number of the foolish mistakes that are occurring at the moment.

What the honourable gentleman said about small shopkeepers applies also to the men in primary industries. The Minister has been asked a number of questions in this House with regard to the rationalization of the pastoral industry. I have received a. letter from a returned soldier colleague in Queensland which shows that the Minister's ""soul-male"" is certainly helping to rationalize this industry. I have no doubt that his action has the full accord of the Minister for War Organization of Industry. My friend has been touring Queensland purchasing horses for the allied forces, and consequently he has visited many country centres and has heard some extraordinary facts regarding the calling up of men. His letter statesThere's a f r i g h t f u l lot of blundering and messing about going on.

Let me give one or two examples of the kind of thing that is happening in the retail trade a>t present, In a certain retail store in Sydney a University student was trying to make up her mind whether she could afford to buy a certain article. She did not have the ready money that women engaged in our munitions factories have nowadays. While she was trying to make up her mind a little lass standing beside her at the counter said, "" I ' l l have two of them "". She then turned to the University student and said, "" You know yous is us, and us is yous these days"". In another store while a purchaser was trying to make up her mind whether she could afford the money required for a certain article, a person standing behind her said, ""Hurry up and make up your mind; if you don't want it, I ' l l take it "" . Such incidents could be multiplied many times. The biggest factor in upsetting the Minister's plans for the rationalization of industry is the surplus money that the people have at their command. the eyes of the honourable gentleman that the workers now have a little money to spend. should not misunderstand me. The responsibility for the rationalization of industry rests with the Government, which should take action to correct matters by drawing upon the surplus money in the hands of the people. If that policy were applied the work of the Department of War Organization of Industry would be .simplified. It appears, however, that the Minister desires to make it bard, and not easy, for tbe general public. appears to be anxious that we should take the easy way. merit in making things unnecessarily hard for the general community. If the Minister would accept the advice of practical men who understand the problems associated with industry, and take effective action to prevent the purchase of luxury goods by causing the withdrawal of surplus money from the people, most of his problems would be overcome.

I now submit a bill to apply this policy. It is not necessary for me to restate in detail the circumstances which have led to the Government's decision to provide assistance for the dairying industry. Suffice it to say that this is a major war-time industry, the output of which is vital to the health and efficiency, not only of the fighting forces in and around Australia and the civilian population of Australia, but also of the British people.

142,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Treasurer )has been experienced in maintaining a sufficient labour force on dairy farms to ensure the output required to meet the demands for dairy products. An important provision of this bill is that the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration may be requested by the Minister to determine terms and conditions of employment in the dairying industry. Any determination made will operate as from the 1st October, 1942. This will do justice to a large section of employees who have hitherto been denied access to a recognized wage-fixing tribunal, and it will also establish conditions under which the maintenance of an effective labour force will be reasonably assured. Any raising of wage standards and conditions of employment in the industry will naturally impose additional costs upon producers. To meet these, and to relieve the industry of other disabilities, tribunal for a determination. The Gosuch as drought in certain areas and generally increased costs since the outbreak of war, the Government has decided to make available in the current year an appropriation of £1,500,000. The subsidy will commence .as from the 1st October. It will be granted for the production of butter and cheese, and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that the whole of the subsidy shall go to the producers. The terms and conditions upon which the subsidy will be paid are to be the subdustrial costs of an increase of the price ject of investigation and recommendation by the Tariff Board. Clause6 of the bill authorizes the Tariff Board to make such inquiries and investigations as it thinks necessary, and to recommend to the Minister for Trade and Customs the allocation of the subsidy, taking into consideration the existence, in any area, of drought conditions, any disabilities of producers attributable to the war, and the terms and conditions of employment as prescribed from time to time by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Honourable members will appreciate the fact that the Tariff Board has bad extensive experience in investigating conAustralia, and expanding demands from ditions in industries of all types, and in advising the Government upon the terms on which subsidies and bounties should be paid. The board is undoubtedly the Mr Chifley. most experienced governmental agency for this purpose, but in order to ensure that its reports shall be made on the basis of an intimate knowledge of the dairying industry, specific provision is made in the bill for the appointment to the board for the purposes of these investigations of a person experienced in the industry. The bill provides that regulations may be gazetted to deal with other matters arising out of the administration of the Government's plans for the dairying industry. There will be many administrative problems. The Prime Minister advised the House yesterday of some of these problems. Thus there is the question of the allocation of assistance 'between parties to share farming. It will be provided that where any dispute arises as to the proportion which the working partner should receive, the aggrieved party shall have the right to appeal to a vernment also intends to review the existing regulations in regard to transfers of properties and land values, with a view to ensuring that any assistance granted to the industry shall not be completely offset by higher land values, to the detriment of tlie producers and workers in the industry. In deciding to give relief to the dairying industry by way of a subsidy, the Government gave special consideration to the effects on the price level and inof so fundamental a commodity as butter. A rise of the price of butter would raise the retail index number, upon which the automatic adjustment of wage rates is made. Under the method of subsidy, it is hoped that no such increase of price will be required, and that to this extent the Government's objective of promoting stability of price and costs will be realized. A t the same time attention had to be given to the urgent need for stimulating the output of butter. I have already referred to the importance of maintaining supplies of butter. With increasing demands from the fighting forces in and around Great Britain, it will be necessary for Australia to sustain the dairying industry at tbe highest level consistent with the demands of the armed forces and other war industries with the man-power available. I am pleased that the Government has brought down a measure to give some assistance to the dairy-farmer. I agree with the method chosen, namely, assistance by means of a bounty, because, as the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) has rightly argued, only by such means may the cost of living be prevented from rising on this account, and wages and other costs be prevented from beginning an inflation spiral. I also agree with the honourable gentleman that the dairying industry should be generally recognized as a major war-time industry, and therefore deserves special treatment. But I cannot agree that what is proposed will stimulate the output of butter. The total amount of the subsidy is not sufficient to give that relief that have to be purchased by the farmer which is absolutely essential at present. of the method proposed in connection with the allocation of the subsidy will cause so much delay and difficulty that any good effects that might arise by reason of the subsidy itself will largely be deferred or even destroyed. I wish to make it clear that one substantial reason for the small increase of the cost of living in Australia by only 18 per cent, since the commencement of the wara remarkable performance compared with what occurred during the last war-ha s been that tbe price of butter has remained practically constant. For many years prior to the war, because of the organization that I was largely instrumental in building up, tinder which equalization was effected, a home-consumption price for butter operated' in this country. That price had risen by only Id. per lb. in the last ten years before the war. Because of my actions in bringing into existence the Dairy Produce Control Board, and my govermraent's' imposition of the duty of Gd. per lb. on butter imported from New Zealand, the operation of the voluntary equalization scheme propounded by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr certain reorganization of man-power Paterson), and subsequently the operation automatically of the present equalization and stabilization scheme were made possible during peace-time and the industry has carried on during the first three years of war. The only increase that it obtained was that of Id. per lb., which was granted by the present Government in February of this year. This represents approximately 7 per cent, or 8 per cent, of the previous price. If the production be comparable with that of normal years, the presentproposal will benefit the producer by approximately from l i d . to l i d . per lb. of butter and cheese. Yet, the total increase in the return to the grower will not equal the general rise of 18 per cent, in the cost of living, whicb is largely determined on the basis of food values, the low levels of which have been due principally to the price at which butter has been obtainable. On the other hand, the prices of inaehinery and clothing have increased by from 40 per cent, to In addition, the application 50 per cent. Therefore, I state for the benefit of the Treasurer, the Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully), and the Government generally, that the subsidy of £2,000,000, representing in a full year approximately l i d . per lb. for butter and cheese, will not be sufficient to compensate the farmer for the increases of costs he has had to face. I am convinced that the inquiries which, according to the Treasurer, are to be made by the Prices Commissioner and the Tariff Board, will quickly show that the assistance in this bill is insufficient to stimulate production. I agree with the Treasurer that the stimulation of dairy production is one of our most vital needs, for the sake of not only ourselves but also Britain, which is more short of edible fats than of any other food it can procure, and is proceeding with an internal farm economy which necessitates obtaining from Australia and New Zealand the quantity of butter that will ensure the maintenance of the small ration on which operations are now being conducted. By means of an adequate subsidy and potential, the total production of butter must be enlarged. I therefore urge that the Government shall not regard this particular subsidy as its final effort, but merely as an instalment. I hope that it",39,Second Reading
143,Sir Earle Page (Cowper) [5.32],"will call for a report from its responsible officers in order to learn what is really needed for the adequate assistance of the industry at the present time. The working out of an equitable arrangement between the owner and his sharefarmer, or between the landlord and the tenant, such as is contemplated under the bill, will be a long and complicated business, and much time must elapse before a report can be presented or a decision made. the position of the dairy-farmers all along the east coast from Bega to Mackay is desperate. been unusually dry, there is a shortage of feed everywhere, and production is low. Therefore, I urge that an arrangement be made with the dairy factories for an immediate distribution to farmers of the greater part of the subsidy on a flat rate, the necessary adjustments to be made later. Dairy-farmers are pretty well anchored to their farms, and most of them have been living in the same districts for years. They can be easily found, and tliere is no reason why this advance should not be made, especially as most of them already transact much of their business through the factories. In conclusion, I urge that, in the workdays a week. When the Governmenting out of this scheme, nothing shall be is striking a fair price for dairy prodone to dishearten the farmers, or to ducts, consideration should be given to hamper production by new regulations the ruling rate of wages paid generally or tribunals or vexatious conditions. throughout the Commonwealth, and in On many of the farms there is fixing a return per lb. for butter, labour a grievous shortage of labour, and costs should be allocated at exactly the old people, sometimes over 60 years same rate as is provided for in secondary of age, are endeavouring to carry industries.

I believe that prices should be fixed for the products of all industries, primary and secondary, and labour costs definitely established.

Moreover, the average return to the wheat-farmers themselves was no more than the wage received by their workers, despite the fact that the wheat-farmers worked ten to twelve hours a day on seven days a week. A similar position prevailed in the fruit-growing industry. Whilst an award rate of £2 a week was struck for workers, the self-employed orchardist was allocated the same rate.

If we are not prepared to stabilize the. industry, it would be better to scrap it. The alternative would be to import cheap labour. Who would stand for that? No politician would have the temerity to advocate the introduction of coloured labour to grow our food on the ground that the nation could not afford to grant a decent standard of living to primary producers. It would be suicidal for a person to preach that doctrine. Self preservation is the first law of nature. But a person would be more consistent if he advocated the importation of cheap coloured labour instead of supporting a stabilization scheme that condemned his fellow Australians to a low standard of living. The Government is doing its best to meet the emergency, and perhaps the scheme will be effective, but more consideration should be given to the stabilization of industries at parity. This is the opportune time to do it. People are enjoying comparatively high wages, and have become accustomed to paying higher prices for commodities than they did before the outbreak of war. People now pay 6d. for an apple or an orange. Twelve months ago they would have raised their hands in horror at such prices. Despite the fact that the granting of a decent standard of living to people in the primary industries, particularly the depressed industries, will cause an upward spiral in the cost of living figures, tbe public will be at least making a contribution to enable the producer to enjoy a decent standard of living. [5.55] -Afte r an anxious dtelay, the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) yesterday expounded the principles of the Dairying Industry Assistance Bill. Until then, honourable members did not know whether the Government would grant a bounty, or whether the public would be asked to pay a reasonable price for butter and cheese. The bill proposes a slight recognition of the excellent, work of the industry, but I am disappointed with the general composition of the measure. An endeavour has been made to cover an unnecessarily wide field of activities and disabilitieswith a small payment. Hon[55] orable members hoped that the Government would authorize an increase of at least 3d. per lb. in the price of butter as the first step in overcoming the difficulties of the industry. Under the bill they will be granted about 1-Jd. per lb. to cover higher costs of labour and disabilities arising out of the war and drought. In addition, the bill provides for "" delayed action"" to enable the Tariff Board to make certain investigations, whilst the Arbitration Court will be asked to make an award to cover employees in the industry. Another unfortunate provision will interfere with the rights of a person who wishes to sell his land. Presumably the Government is not desirous of inflicting an injustice on dairy-farmers, but this principle could be used to deprive an individual of his freedom, even in unavoidable circumstances, to dispose of his holding. I sincerely support the contention that the Tariff Board and the Arbitration Court should be asked to function at once. In the interim, necessary payments should be made to those engaged in the industry. The dairying districts of Queensland are suffering intensely by an increased burden of drought. It is strange that such a complicated and technical bill should be necessary to cover the simple request of the dairying industry for assistance by an increase of price. We have gone to the Prices Commissioner for an increase of price, but practically without result. We are told, however, that the Prices Commissioner will still have authority to act in respect of the prices of dairy produce after the bill has been passed. That means that at any time he will have the right to reduce prices. I hope that the Government will regard this bill as merely the first step towards assisting the dairying industry, and that other measures will be taken to l if t tbe people engaged in it from their depressed standard of living to one comparable with, at any rate, that of other industries. The deeper in the back blocks a dairy-farmer operates the greater are his disabilities, but all dairy farmers and their families live under exceedingly difficult conditions. Through flood or drought they continue to produce. In the seasons when periods of daylight",42,Second Reading
145,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"are long they are up and active on their farms from dawn to dark and in the other seasons they do not wait for dawn before starting work, and they certainly never finish till long after dark. This measure will not compensate for the ordinary difficulties that the industry suffers, and it most certainly will not compensate for the added difficulties that they experience .under war conditions with the costs of all the articles they need rising sharply. It will not remove the child labour trouble. It will mot provide the dairy-farmers with the same standards as those enjoyed by other industries. In order to l if t the industry from its depressed state much more assistance is needed. It would not be over generous for this assistance to be coupled with an increase of price by at least 2d. per lb. The city workers would not object to paying a little more for their butter when they knew that they were thereby helping to alleviate the troubles which beset the dairy-farmer and to remunerate him for the long hours he works in order to provide them, at a cheap price, with a vitally necessary food. The dairy-farmer is compelled by law to ensure that the quality of the milk shall be A l , not just first class, when it reaches the butter factories. The Health Department's requirements compel greater attention and greater skill. They require the installation of highly efficient methods and machinery to ensure that dairy products shall reach not only the local market but also the United Kingdom in the highest quality. I am disappointed that the Government has not seen fit to table the report of the special committee that inquired into the dairying industry. that this bill contains the substance of that report. I hope, however, that this measure will not serve to introduce into the dairying industry the industrial conditions which often create turmoil in other industries, and that steps will he taken to ensure the continuance of the amicable relations between employer and employee which have always marked the industry. dairy farms in this country. They produce a commodity of the greatest value. The dairy-farmers have established facMr Bernard Corser. tories to the value of more than £3,000,000, and the cost has been met mostly by means of the co-operative system. The industry has bought and paid for £5,750,000 worth of equipment. Tbe dairy-fanners, their families and their employees number at least 165,000 people. In the factories, which pay union rates of wages, there are nearly 7,000 employees. Those factories produce annually £41,750,000 worth of the highest quality butter, cheese and dried and condensed milk. This amount of £2,000,000 is, therefore, not an exorbitant charge on the Australian community for the maintenance of the industry. I hope that in committee the Government will be agreeable to a thorough review of tbe bill, because thei'e are many ways in which we can afford to be more' generous to the dairy-farmers. At least an increase of 2d. per lb. of the price of butter, which would not be much of a burden on the city workers, would be a reasonable further contribution towards overcoming the producers' troubles which have been so greatly intensified since the outbreak of war. adjourned.

I now furnish the honourable member with the following reply:Existing regulations provide that members of the Australian Army Nursing Service are entitled to deferred pay only on or after the date of embarkation for service beyond Australia. This question is at present receiving consideration in conjunction with a number of other matters regarding pay to women members of the services. On the 24th September, the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) asked the following question, without noticeW ill the Minister for the Army inform me whether it is a fact that boxers and jockeys are retained in military camps in the metropolitan areas, whilst the sons of workers are sent to battle stations? Do boxers and jockeys secure time off from their militar y duties for training purposes, although the average soldier is granted only short periods of leave ? For example, troops who had served abroad for two years were granted eight days' were preleave on their return to Australia recently. I now furnish the honourable member with the following reply:There is no such policy covering the retention of boxers and jockeys or of any other type of sportsmen because of their particular prowess. The order which sets out the conditions of -leave applies to all members of the forces without distinction. If the honourable member can supply any specific instances I shall 'be pleased to make further inquiries. upon notice1. Isi t a fact that the National Mutual Life Association Limited is still charging interest at tlie rate of 6 per cent, on loans on -policies ? 2. If so, w ill he take action to compel a reduction in this rate to 4 per cent, at most? honourable member's questions are as 1. By an order, dated the 14th March, 1942, made under regulation 11 of the National Security (Economic Organization) chargeable on any loan made after that date by any person carrying on the business of life assurance on the security of a policy issued by that person was limited to £5 per centum per annum. The interest rate in respect of any loan on a life assurance policy made under an agreement already in existence prior to tlie 14th March, 1942, could not be affected by an order under the above-mentioned regulations. I am advised that the National Mutual Life Association Limited is complying with the above order, and is not charging interest in excess of £5 per centum per annum on loans on policies made on or after 14th March, 1942, hut that the company is not varying the rate in respect of any loan made prior to that date. 2. There is no present intention of making regulations affecting the terms of existing contracts or agreements, but where the performance of the terms of a contract or agreement become unduly onerous on one of the parties as a result of circumstances attributable to the war or the operation of national security regulations, that party may apply under the National Security (Contriacits Adjustment) Regulations to a tribunal for relief. ber, the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) asked me whether steps would be taken to amend the National Security (Landlord and Tenant) Regulations in order that they may be extended to cover any hotel rents that",44,Adjournment Order Oe Business

I have conveyed the honourable member's request to the Minister for Trade and Customs, and am now advised by him that he has previously given consideration to this matter. He has stated that, insofar as the reason for an adjustment in hotel rents is the decline in sales of liquor, the matter is one for which adjustment should be sought under the National Security (Contract Adjustment) Regulations, and to which the National Security (Landlord and Tenant) Regulations rightly do not apply. The question of amending the Landlord and Tenant Regulations in the manner suggested will be given consideration.
