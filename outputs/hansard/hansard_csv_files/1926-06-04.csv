21,Mr Stewart,"I decline to beloath to take, to explain their views. The artificial regulation of wages and hours is economically unsound, because it cannot be applied to all sections of the community. If an attempt be made to fix the hours and wages of the great primary industries and to artificially regulate their return, the system will break down. I judge, from newspaper reports, that the New South Wales Government has wisely refrained from enforcing the 44 hours week in the primary industries. Responsible people in that State, at any rate, seem to have sufficient sense to realize the argument I am advancing. If the primary producer were to work only 44 hours a week for a fixed return or basic wage of, say, £5 a week, and the product of his labour were merely to be delivered to some government authority without any obligation on the producer to return value for the wages received dear loaf. expensive loaf. If we attempt to fix the price of wheat on a 44-hour basis, plus the payment of overtime for all hours worked before 8 a.m. and after 5 p.m. and double pay for holidays and Sundays-for Sunday labour is imperative in pioneering districts where water must be carted-the . community will have to pay dearly indeed for its loaf. It is liketry. I should be the last man to attempt wise with the dairying industry. If we fix the wages of the workers in that industry on the basis applying to secondary industries, and also fix the return on the capital invested, the price of butter will be enormously increased. of land? ber wishes to fix the price of everything, stands for progress and content. and I can quite understand his position. WhatI do not understand is the position of those who insist that the return on the have an incentive in view of the attitude capital invested in secondary industries of the employers? shall be protected by legislation in the shape of Customs tariff and the like, and that too many employers do not give that the wages of the worker shall be their employees any inducement to guaranteed by legislation in the shape of take an interest in their work. If the industrial courts and awards, at the same Government's proposals are carried, this time leaving those engaged in the primary subject could be better discussed when the industries, upon which the whole struclegislation to be introduced subsequent ture of industry rests, to work under the law of supply and demand, and to have their wages regulated by the shifting prices of the world's market. Take the position of the wheat areas at wheat-carting time. At railway stations early in the morning it is not unusual to see 20 or 30 wagon loads of wheat, some of which has been carted 8 or 10 miles, waiting for the railway station to open at 8 o'clock, because the railway employees, under a fixed award, do not start work until that time. That sort of thing tends to bring about artificial values, and if we attempted to apply the system all around, the whole structure upon which industry rests would immediately collapse. When forced into an impossible economic position by legislation, as the primary producers are to-day, they are compelled to ask the Government for some assistance, to enable them to carry on; but what is the reply given to them? The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), when asked by the dried-fruit growers to guarantee the cost of production, refused to do so. He said that they were asking him to accept an impossible formula. Yet the Government, under the tariff legislation, has guaranteed returns to the secondary industries. Last year, when the dried-fruit growers asked for assistance, this Parliament granted it, but at the same time the Arbitration Court granted an increased wage to the workers engaged in the industo lower the standard of living.

28,Mr Stewart,"I quite admitto their passage is under consideration. and the development that has taken place in the United States of America, seems to indicate that the workers of that country have accepted the fact that the capitalistic system cannot be destroyed, and are, therefore, using their energies to take advantage of that system by becoming employers themselves. that in that direction, and by establishing industrial insurance and banking in stitutions, we shall obtain the greatest progress. The evil of the capitalistic system is twofold-the congregation of capital in the hands of individuals, and the manipulation of credit. A wider distribution of wealth would be a much saner and quicker method of solving the problems of the workers, not only of this country, but also of other countries, than the present system, which tends towards price-fixing all round. growers asked a compulsory wheat pool, but it was found that neither the Commonwealth Government nor the State Governments had power to grant their request. A State Government has power to establish a pool within its own borders, but not elsewhere. We had a very illuminating illustration of the difference between the powers of the Commonwealth and of the Statesi n connection with the regulation and control of primary industries when the Victorian Government recently seized a consignment of New South Wales dried fruit s that had entered its borders. I believe that that Government also intercepted a consignment of Western Australian dried fruits. The Commonwealth Government is absolutely powerless in such circumstances, and I contend that such a state of affairs is alit. I shall not pursue that subject further together wrong. The Government, since it has introduced these proposals, should , have included in them a proposal to control and regulate trade and commerce, because if the powers asked for are granted, it is absolutely essential that we should have control of trade and commerce. unification. ber is opposed to the bill. I have already indicated that I think that the whole position is economically unsound. If by voting against these proposals we could improve the system of regulating wages and conditions, I should certainly support the honourable member; but it seems The expansion of profit-sharing, to me that, as a representative of the primary producers, I must choose between the present chaotic system, which leads to needless competition and duplication of State and-Federal awards, and the proposal to have the whole system co-ordinated and placed under Government control. I would sooner have a bad system It seems to me well regulated than continue to carry on in the chaotic state that exists to-day. The right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) , in his excellent speech, said that the wages board system was preferable to the Arbitration Court system, and with that statement. I agree. The advantage of the wages board system is that it brings together two interested parties, who know every detail of the industry that they are attempting to regulate. The fundamental weakness of the Arbitration Court is the fact that disputes The wheatare taken into the wrong atmosphere. W it h all respect to the legal members of this House, I say that there is not much incentive in a legal atmosphere to secure prompt'decisions. If the lawyers engaged in arbitration cases studied their own financial interests, they would prolong the disputes; but both the employers and the employees, sitting together as a wages board, are interested in reaching a prompt decision. That, it seems to me, is the outstanding advantage of the wages board system over the Arbitratio n Court. ber ever been on a wages board? have not, but I have observed the results of the system, and, judged by results, the evidence is overwhelmingly in favour of because, if the referendum is carried, we shall haA e to discuss bills to create the 7 necessary machinery to give effect to the decision of the people, and it w ill then be a more convenient time to speak on this phase of the subject.

In discussing this matter, we cannot lose sight of the projected legislation in connection with the <per capita payments.

Proposals for the amendment of the Constitution require prolonged deliberation, not only by this Parliament, but also by the people. member for Balaclava is "" in the breeching."" great credit on him. The right honourable member justifiably asked when it was proposed to bring ' in legislation to give effect to the present proposals, if they are approved by the people; would appear to me that it cannot be done this year, and the right honourable the Prime Minister did not give any indication of when he proposed to do it . If effective action cannot be taken this year, and if we are to have a constitutional session of the Parliament next year, it would be wiser to deal with this matter iii conjunction with the other important matters which most of us agree must be considered in connection with the proposals to amend the Constitution. An expenditure of £80,000 or £100,000 should not be regarded lightly. In former referendums, the people, if they did not understand the questions submitted to them, could refrain from voting, but under the conditions of this referendum, they will be compelled, by law, to register a decision, whether they understand what they are voting on or not.

I tried in that address to discuss many aspects of the question. I see no reason to-day to alter any of the opinions I then expressed, except one, to which I shall refer directly; and I see no cure for the chaos into which industrial arbitration has been rushing in this country, except the proposals now made by the Government.

This is not an opportune time to discuss the last-mentioned phase of the subject, but, when the subsequent bills come before this House, all these questions of form and procedure may aptly be debated. It is not fair at the present time to discuss a proposal for a referendum in the light of this or that view of the form the judicial powers will eventually take. some indication of how the iproposals will be carried out. that indication.

It is proposed now that complete power to fix industrial conditions shall be vested in an independent authority. That is highly desirable, for there is no doubt whatever that the principle of compulsory industrial arbitration has been obscured by discussions based on purely political motives and in accordance with the demands of certain classes of interests from time to time. The matter should have been studied in a scientific manner, so that its economic effect on the whole industrial life of the community could be determined. Up to the present,, it has been a class fight, and the honours have been with the stronger party; but it is high time that it was removed from the realm of party politics and investigated by a calm, scientific, deliberate, and trained authority. The part of my speech of three years ago t h a t I wish to modify reads"" We must recognize that the principle of industrial conciliation and arbitration has come to stay, and if the machinery to give effect to it is not yet as complete and effective as it might be, the remedy is to be found, not in abandoning the principle, but in using every endeavour to improve the legislation. At that time, I , and most other honourable members, believed that there was no alternative to compulsory industrial arbitration; but a great deal has happened since then to shake our confidence in the principle, and I wish to make it perfectly clear now that I do not believe in it ; but, at the same time, I do not think it is practical at present to abolish it. Public, opinion would not support such a move until at least one more attempt has been made to make the machinery work. 1 feel that it will be impossible ever to make it work,, but in consideration of the feelings of those who are enamoured of the principle, we ought to make an effort to do so, if only for the purpose of satisfying them that it is unworkable. Tbe taking of this step will hasten the abolition of compulsory industrial arbitration.. It must be patent to everybody that the time is not distant when all the State arbitration courts and authorities' will be absorbed in the Federal' court. The judgments of the High Court to the effect that Commonwealth awards must override State awards force one to that conclusion. I believe that when only one arbitration court is operating, people will begin to concentrate on the actual basis of the system, and that they will soon come to see that it is fallacious, and must be ultimately abandoned. I can even see a glimmer of hope that it will be abolished not by the consumers, who suffer under it, but by the employers and employees themselves.

But I wish to ask them how much further they will be towards its abolition if they vote against this measure? they intended to vote against it. gest that if they desire compulsory industrial arbitration to be abolished, it will be advisable for them to support this bill. will be taking a distinct step towards its abolition; for it will detach the application of the principle from the sphere of political clamour and contest, and attach it to an independent and scientific authority. an authority of its effect on the general economic position of the community must soon lead to its abandonment. In my opinion, we have made a considerable advance in the study of industrial questions in the last few years. The right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr more wisdom is compressed into its small Watt) whole-heartedly condemned the arbitration system yesterday and advocated the adoption of the wages board principle, while the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) urged that we should adopt a system of internal agreements in industry. Our experience of wages boards is limited almost to Victoria. It seems to me that the fatal objection to that system is that it leaves out"" of account altogether the interests of the general public. It is true that the employers and employees may, under it, get together and make an agreement which is satisfactory to both parties, and so maintain peace in their industry; but that is not sufficient. "" Industrial peace at any price"" is a foolish slogan, for we cannot have industrial peace if . the interests of the general community are disregarded. objection arise if the method suggested by the honourable member for Wannon is adopted ? to show. The example given by the honsystem we have been following here is folorable member for Moreton( Mr J. Franlowed in the Old Country, and is the cis) showed how the wages board system may fail. Our experience with the coal tribunal is certainly no inducement to us to adopt that method generally, particularly in connection with large industries. Our trouble has been that we persist in limiting our discussions to the increasing of wages and the limiting of hours; and it must be remembered that a reduction in the hours I know that, and I sugof work is tantamount to an increase in wages. People argue that if there is a reduction in wages there must necessarily be a decline in our standard of living, for, they say, wages make the standard of life. But that argument is fallacious. Our standard of living does not depend upon the amount of wages received, but upon the ratio of wages to the standard level of prices, i should like to draw the attention of honourable members to a most interesting and instructive book entitled The Secret of Close consideration by such High Wages, that has been recently published by Messrs."" Austin and Lloyd, two engineers who went from Great Britain to America to inquire into industrial conditions there. Although it is only a small book, it has created quite a furore in the Old World, and compass than is to be found in any other book that I know of on the subject. It is really an account of the industrial conditions of America, and it shows how the present state of prosperity has been reached there. I should like to see the book in the hands of every adult person in Australia. In this book the principle which I have just enunciated is stated, and it is clearly proved that prosperity does not depend upon wages, but upon the ratio of wages to standard level prices. Most interesting figures are given comparing conditions in America with those in England. If wages are fixed by the prices of goods, as is done in this country under our Arbitration Court, because the cost of living is taken as the basis for wages, we shall never arrive, so the authors of this book say, and I think, soundly, at any improvement in prosperity. that.",19,Bruce

54,Mr Mann,"I think it does. Thecause of a great deal of the industrial trouble there to-day. I may be permitted to quote some figures from this publication to show how things work out in America and in England. In America there is no restriction upon output, and no restriction upon what a man may earn. These are the two important things which bring about cooperation between employer and employee. There is no restriction on output or upon earnings, and, on the other hand, it is recognized that only efficiency shall be retained, whilst inefficiency must be discarded. the inefficient ? industry may be efficient in another. The idea that because a man is inefficient in one industry, that industry should carry him, instead of his finding employment in one in which he is efficient, cannot be justified. every walk of lif e we have too many round pegs in square holes. saying. The system adopted in America puts that right by putting the round pegs into round holes, and the square pegs into square holes. That is what we need in every branch of industry. The system so works out in America that men earn enormous wages, and yet the prices of goods are kept low. The wages do not affect the cost of living, because high wages are set off by increased output. We hear a great deal in our arbitration courts to the effect that increased wages are beneficial, because highly-paid workmen are most efficient. That would be quite correct if we could ensure that extra efficiency would produce an extra output. B ut it is not so, because here with increased wages we are having restrictions upon output: Increased output does not do any in j u ry to the worker, because he shares in the profit derived from it. to by the honourable member say anything about *he inefficiency managers 1 published which shows that managerial inefficiency contributes 75 per cent, to the waste of industry. more done to secure the elimination of waste than is done in America. I can assure the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) that if he will read this book he will find that it contains most valuable information. It is one of the latest publications. It attracted world-wide attention, and became a famous book in a few weeks. In order to show how the system adopted in America works out, as compared with the result obtained in England, I quote the following: Mr Hoover, the United States of America Secretary of Commerce, in his annual report, made public on 29th November, 1925, the Department of Labour index of the movement of wages and prices fronr 1920 to 1925, using The inefficient in one the 1913 levels as the unit of 100. The price percentages represent the average wholesale prices of all commodities. The figures given are as follow :Year. Wage Rates. Prices. 1920 199 126 1921 205 147 1922 193 ... 149 1923 211 154 1024 228 150 These figures show a substantial diminution of prices of commodities associated with a very marked and steady rise of wages. Again, taking 1913 levels for a unit of 100, the corresponding figures for GreatB r it a in were as follow:Year. Wage Bates. Prices. 1920 230 283 1921 260 181 1922 200 .. 159 1923 170 162 1924 170 174 In the last year the wage rates in Great Britain were 170, as against prices 174, whilst in America the corresponding Britain were-Wages, 228; prices, 150. These results are due to the fact that wages in England are fixed by prices of commodities, as they are here, whilst in America prices are fixed by output. I have searched our statistical register, but I have not been able to obtain figures exactly corresponding to these for Australia. There is, however, sufficient evidence to show that here wages rates and prices act in relation to each of employers or other, as they do in Great Britain, and not as they do in America. The right Of course it does. honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) in discussing this hill laid it down as an axiom, which cannot be disputed, that there is an insuperable incompatibility between capital and labour, that we must recognize that, and that it",20,Bruce

It may perhaps seem impertinence on my part to say so to a gentleman of the great experience and special knowledge of the right honourable member, but I am emboldened to do so from the facts and figures which may be gathered by reading of the industrial position in America. In that country there is concord and compatibility between capital and labour. I may be told that that has not always been the case, but the fact remains that there is in the United States of America practically no unemployment, except in local centres and local industries, and of a temporary character. The great mass of labour in America is always employed, and at very high wages. country! the largest free trade area on the face of the earth. is breaking out in a new vein.

If the honourable member challenges me, I tell him that the fact that the protective policy of America is practically nullified so far as its effects on industry are concerned is shown by the fact that she put no restriction whatever on the importation of labour for 30 years.

In view of these facts, which are being brought home to different branches of industry, and to the public which has to pay the bill all the time, I .believe that the yeast of a sane economic policy is gradually working in the public mind. I think that before long our absurd system of compulsory arbitration will go by the board I hope, for the sake of Australia and the advancement of civilization, that some of the saner principles I have been talking about will find their only freotrade way into the minds of both employers and employees.

We must wait unti l the common sense of the public abolishes it . All that we can do, and it is but a poor second best, is to try and improve the machinery in order to keep it going for a time. That is the way in which I regard the subject. We must keep the existing machinery going for a time until common sense makes it clear to the community that we do not want it at all. It is on these lines I am supporting the bill, and on these lines I spoke three years ago. The present position is intolerable, and the basic economic principles underlying industry must be scientifically studied in a calm atmosphere, away from the heat of party politics. I should be very sorry if the adoption of this proposal led to all industrial issues being decided on the floor of the Housei n the heat of party discussion. It is theoretically possible that that may happen. Parliament may delegate these responsibilities to an authority, but it can also withdraw them. these matters cannot be taken completely out of the control of Parliament. delegate to the created authority such powers as it chooses, w i th certain limitations and qualifications. The extent to which this may be done is debatable, but I sincerely hope and believe that Parliament w ill have the common sense to keep these matters out of the atmosphere of party politics, leaving them to be calmly studied by an independent authority. If these matters are brought into the political arena, this Parliament w ill be converted into a bear garden. It w ill have no time to deal with big national questions, such as our relations with other countries, and its atmosphere w ill become corrupted by all those forms of political bribery which are associated w it h the present industrial system.

These proposals w ill effect more people than is generally realized. Statements have been made as to the probability of this and that section of the community voting for the proposed amplification of Federal powers. If , as I believe it must, the jurisdiction of this Federal court extends to what are known as Government instrumentalities, at least 1,000,000 persons connected with the public services w ill be affected.

It is improbable that the decision of the people upon these questions w ill be known before August.

Effect to the proposals in this bill can be given only if On e of the strongest the people so decide; and it is advisable that they should be consulted upon this issue now rather than that these amendments should be referred to them in conjunction with others which may be suggested during the proposed Constitutional session next year. I hope that such amendments will not be inany. Tho need for amending the Constitution is grossly exaggerated, being prompted by certain specific and narrow interests.

Leader of the Opposition at that time, the late Hon. Frank Tudor, the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), Senator Gardiner, the honourable member for South Sydney( MrE . Riley), and many other members of the Labour party spoke during that campaign in support of the referendum proposals. like the Argus to remove the impression that honourable members on this side of the House did not assist the Government during the referendum campaign of 1919. has been quite a pleasure and an education to me to listen to certain of the speeches on this b ill , and for that, if for altered to give greater powers to this no other reason, the Government is to be complimented for having introduced it . Itwould be a good thing if the whole economic position of Australia could be calmly considered. I have listened carefully to the speeches of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) and the honourable member for Wimmera (Mir. Stewart), and I largely agree with them. I also agree with the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) that the Government has offered no constructive suggestion in place of the present method of regulating hours and conditions of labour. Australia to-day realizes that the Arbitration Court, in its polygamous character, has taught the worker that kissing goes by favour. If the one thing does not suit, then the other will. This has brought about a Gilbertian situation in Australia. ' The bill w ill at least remove the polygamous character of arbitration by preventing the wooing of one party and then the other. It is held by some honourable members that this measure is the introduction of unification. Unification has no special significance to me. Any legislation that may be characterized as tending towards unification, if for the benefit of Australia, will receive my support. able member for Perth has indicated, the appointment of a judicial court will not solve our economic conditions as they have been solved in the United States of America, except possibly that the new standard of fixing wages w ill enable thti court to investigate, in the interests of both capital and labour, the effect of the payment of wages and the rendering of I myself appointed and services upon the economic position of Australia. If the court merely adopts the old system of fixing wages on tlie cost of The living, the only alteration w ill be the establishment of one court to> fix wage3 and conditions as against the present method of having two authorities fixing different standards. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) yesterday pointed out that under the Constitution the powers of this Parliament, I should elected on adult franchise, was limited. The people of Australia and the members of this Parliament feel that certain things should be done in the interests of this country, but owing to our paper Constitution we are powerless to do them. For many years it has been generally admitted that the Constitution should be Parliament. plenary powers. ment of Australia should undoubtedly have plenary powers but we are helpless, because of the limitations that have been set up, and we cannot secure the necessary amendments because of the shibboleths that have been raised, one being State rights. I believe that State rights could and should be clearly defined. We should increase the number of Statesi n Australia, and thereby increase the status of the Federal Parliament. The opinion of the people, respecting their varying needs, would then have a greater field of expression in this Parliament. To-day half the people with a common need are centralized w i th a community of interest. The other half, with all the other needs, is widely distributed. Under our present system of States we cannot obtain the representation that is necessary to develop this great country. There is too much centralization. Every honourable member must have felt the As the honortruth of the remarks of the right honourable member for North Sydney, when he clearly depicted the weakness and inability of this House to carry out such legislation as the people wanted.

I agree with the honourable members for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) and Swan( Mr higher wages than the union rates, and Gregory) that the farmer is hit every time, and all the time by the effect of arbitration court awards. that unless this court is to be clothed with additional position will not be improved, except that the work will be carried out in a more efficient opportunity additional eommumity, upon the primary it is by the export of primary that 96 per cent, of the wealth of the people is «reated. posed court will have power to give consideration to the effect of its recommendations. successfully in the same sphere, and thai is why I favour the creation authority with judicial powers not possessed by the existing court.

These factory to the company had beem made. The' profit actually amounted .to oneeighth of a penny per l b . of the output. Almost the same powers In other words, if the company had sold The subto the consumer at one-eighth of a penny per lb. less, it would have made no profit. I am quite satisfied that the company waaald purchase as economically as posThe bill sible, and it has to sell in competition with other firms. In that concern the greatest reward is given to the employee lf this measure is who can show how to sell to the consumer at a lower price; but it appears to me that in this country the man is paid the most who can show a combine how to exIt tract more from the public. That seems to be the fundamental difference betweeu the methods of conducting business in the two countries. Mr Henry Ford has expressed views similar to those held by the S w if t Company. He pays his men he has Tiade himself fabulously wealthy by rendering cheap service to the comI recognizemunity.

Both manner, thus lessening the of them may be of great value, but in for strikes. When any any case this Parliament should have cost is placed on the power to control them. I support the 96 per cent, of it falls b ill , not merely because a Nationalist producer, because Government is in power, for .any power produce the people give to this Parliament, future governments, be they national or labour, I hope that the pro T will be able to exercise. It is a pity that constitutional questions should be discussed on party lines. The Government, Two authorities cannot .function in submitting these proposals, has not acted in a partisan way. It desires power of one over everything that may restrain the trade or hamper the progress of this country. Australia is a great prize, and we should not -allow combines to strangle it . We do not wish to so hobble industry as to retard legitimate progress. Legislation that will stop any combination of America, persons, whether unionists or capitalists, As .examples, labourers or farmers, from operating detrimentally to the people is desirable. Mr Swift This is the people's Parliament, and it should govern. That is the only logical conclusion a true democrat can reach. I am not much concerned as to whether wages -boards or arbitration courts are the One of the reports stated means employed to settle industrial disputes. There seem to be many arguments in favour of wages boards, and some solid onesagainst them.; b u t one fact that appeals to honourable members from other States is that representatives of Victorian constituencies favour them. That would seem to indicate that experience of wages boards in this State has been satisfactory.. One example thatmade me think was the Hibble Commission, which is really a wages hoard in the coal in-, dustry. Mr Hibble was appointed an impartial chairman to meet the coal owners and coal workers. Those two sections had a difference of opinion, and the coal owners said to the coal workers, "" We can pay you so much if we receive so much for our coal."" The reply was. easy,"" and Mr Hibble only had to say, "" I give that my blessing."" But what about the people ? Has that transaction been am economically sound one 1 Not at all, for it has increased the cost of coal to the people, and has reduced their capacity to compete in the undertakings in which they use coal. That kind of wages board does not appeal very strongly to me. I hope that the new court w ill deal with industrial questions scientifically, so that all the people of Australia will benefit.

Provision was actually made in the Constitution done, and it was set out that if the Commonwealth revenue was not sufficient to pay the interest bills, the States should be levied on to make up the deficiency. This plainly indicates that nothing would be returned to the States. Commonwealth Constitution was a section that is commonly known as the "" Braddon blot,"" which provided that for a period of ten years after the consummation of federation, three-quarters of the Customs and excise revenue should be returned the States. In 1910, when the Braddon section ceased to operate, there was substituted for the return to the States of three-fourths of the total Customs and excise revenue a per capita payment of 25s. per head of population, which has continued ever since.

One member of the Parliament put the for that to be position in a few short words. He said that if it were found necessary for the Commonwealth to go into the field of direct taxation, that would be tantamount to taking the per capita payment back. The war spoken of, and possibly anticiIncluded in the pated, in those days, did occur, and it left behind it a largely unproductive debt of nearly £400,000,000. The unproductive debt is practically twice as great as the whole of the debts of the States at federation. The Commonwealth has been to forced into direct taxation because of that huge debt. It has actually raised in the field of direct taxation something, like £21,000,000 during some of the years of the past decade. On estimates based on the low rates of interest current before 1910 it was recognized that if the Commonwealth operated the constitutional section empowering it to take over State debts it would be possible for it to take over only £174,000,000 of those debts, and would have to depend upon the revenue of the States for interest on might be the balance. Now we have a debt which making is more than twice the amount of the to debts of the States prior to federation.",27,Second Readin G

100,Dr. Earle Page,"The position wasThe Commonwealth is carrying that debt and how, then, can it be said that we have surplus revenue out of which the -per capita payments can continue to be made ? An y one who considers the matter must realize that with a debt service of £400,000,000 to deal with there can be no true surplus in the accounts of the Commonwealth, to distribute to the States or any one else. The war did not merely bring into existence a huge unproductive war debt for Australia; in addition, it placed new duties on the Commonwealth. It brought about a new Australian outlook on many of our problems, and especially on the problems of development and migration. posed upon the Commonwealth new duties in connection with repatriation, provision for war service homes, and development, the necessity for the adoption of a national system of health and for dealing with the unification of railway gauges and with migration. is a remarkable thing that of all those activities in which the Commonwealth has been engaged since the war there is not one in which it has engaged on the same basis as that adopted in the making of per capita payments to the States; that is to say, the population basis. The reason, of course, is that the per cayrita basis has been v> ed by experience to rov be inequitable and unsatisfactory. In no other federation in the world is a similar system operating, because it has been found to be unworkable and impracticable. Every Commonwealth Government since the war has recognized, and quite definitely asserted, that the capitation system must go. It is impossible for us to continue it . right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) dealt with the matter at conferences with State Premiers. did the right honourable member for Worth Sydney( Mr Hughes) and Sir Joseph Cook when he was Treasurer. This Government has also dealt with the matter, and has pointed out the farcical nature of the position in which we are placed in raising money in direct taxation fields simply for the purpose of paying it to the States. It is true that the urgency of ending the matter was to some extent mitigated, for two reasons. One was that in 1920 the Massy Greene tariff was imposed, and markedly increased the revenue of the Commonwealth. The second was that the cost of national schemes of development, and other national activities, had not reached its peak during those earlier years. If one examines the present position of Commonwealth revenues and expenditure he will see that there is no possibility of returning anything to the States out of the Customs and excise revenue. If one compares the ensuing year with 1920-21, he w ill find an increase of expenditure on the following items:-Old-ag e pensions, £4,000,000; interest on railways and other works, £600,000; interest concession, soldier land settlement, £300,000; migration, £300,000; grants to TasThe war immania and Western Australia, £800,000; the increased interest payable on our war debt owing to the increased rates which had to be paid for the last two conversions, £800,000. These amounts together represent an inescapable additional expenditure of £6,800,000. This amount It roughly corresponds with the total increase in Customs and excise revenue between .the same years. Despite this, there has been a reduction of £6,000,000 in Commonwealth direct taxation, taking £14,600,000 as. the figures for 1925-26. It is clearly evident, therefore, that it is not possible now to use any supposititious surplus of Customs and excise revenue for the purpose of subsidizing the States. If we consider the commitments of the Commonwealth we shall find that many are essentially commitments which, if we were not federated, would have to be borne by the States, and would more than absorb the whole of the Customs and excise revenue at the present time. For war expendiDuring 1918-19, the ture and war pensions we pay approximately £29,000,000 a year. "" Of this amount £20,000,000, representing interest So and sinking fun d on war debts, cannot possibly be reduced for nearly 50 years under the terms of our debt reduction scheme. . It is a compound interest scheme designed to repay the debt in 50 years. There is a general impression that because' we pay off a certain amount of the debt each year the interest charge must automatically become less. That might be correct if we were not trying to pay off the debt as a whole, continuing to pay interest into the f u n d as we cancel the bonds we buy back.

It is incorrect to say that this tax was imposed' for the purpose of "" bursting up "" large estates. The main purpose of the tax was to levy an annual tax upon the owners of the Commonwealth the unimproved value of whose estates exceeded £5,000. Incidentally, it may have had tlie effect of bringing about the subdivision, either real or imaginary of certain estates, and following upon such subdivision the amount of fhe annual tax varied to a small extent. There is the statement of a responsible leader of the Labour party, that the purpose of the land tax was not to break up large estates.

The Government desires to treat the States equitably and as generously as possible, so that they may not be embarrassed during the period of financial re-adjustment. It accordingly The Commonembodied its views in a memorandum and invited the State Premiers to meet Federal Ministers in conference to discuss them.

At the conclusion of the conference the Prime Minister told them that they had not made good their claim to the possession of a legal, constitutional, or even moral right, to the' per capita payment, that the Commonwealth Government was determined to end the present system; but the Commonwealth Government was w ill i ng to come to an arrangement which would enable them to keep their finances in order during the transition period.

This basis of estimating the amount of tax has been adopted as the collections for 1024-25 and 1925-26 include arrears of the tax on Crown leaseholds. The actual collections in 1924-25 were £2,519,711, and the estimated receipts in 1925-26 total £2,800,000. The distribution amongst States is on the ""basis of the taxable lands in each State, <is shown in the assessments for 1922-23, which amounted to £2,143.343. Since 1922-23 the valuations have materially increased. At the present time, land taxes are imposed in all States except .New South Wales. The Commonwealth land tax was -first imposed in the Commonwealth's right to readjust these payments in any way.

We asked them to allow inner their officers to confer w it h the Federal officers in order to arrive at an equitable statistical basis for an arrangement. if the Commonwealth They declined to do that. The Commonwealth Government was, therefore, thrown back upon its own resources, and I think that the scheme that I am now proposing to the House meets adequately the difficulties which the State Premiers anticipate. Beyond the moral objection that was raised by the State Treasurers, they opposed the proposals mainly because the collection of tax from the various fields Commonwealth undertakes to of taxation which we were evacuating would make them unpopular.

There is no doubt that the pooling of the savings of the people in joint-stock companies engaged in industrial enterprises ought to be encouraged rather than discouraged, and in making the reduction the Government had that in view. The States have sovereign powers of direct taxation, and they can distribute their taxation in any way they like. If they distribute it so as to make a man's taxation three times as heavy as it was before, that w ill be their fault, not ours, for there is no State whose taxation will be trebled by the abolition of the per capita payments.

The general effect of the scheme will be that the Commonwealth will surrender £7,7S7,000 of taxation, and capitation payments amounting to £7,687,000 will be discontinued. Advances will be made to give each State a margin of £50,000 without allowing for special assistance to Western Australia and Tasmania.

They may ask us to continue the collection of the taxes for a time. until they call their Parliaments together. when they call their cabinets together. If they do not take time by the forelock, we cannot be blamed for that. wealth continue to collect taxation after 30th June, if the taxation acts are repealed. has given notice of motion for the introduction of bills to repeal certain acts, but some of them w ill continue in operation until the acts repealing them are proclaimed. If it takes a State Parliament three or four months to pass the necessary legislation, we can continue collecting these taxes in the meantime. There w ill be no interregnum during, which taxes w ill not be collected. Until the States have made up their minds we simply need a request from them not to proclaim the repeal of those acts whose repeal would result in loss of revenue to them. cannot make that request without the sanction of the State Parliaments. ments of the States can make it . That is what governments are for. The scheme will bring about the almost complete separation of Federal and State finances, and it is a step towards the complete separation of taxation activities. Commonwealth will cease to collect three taxes, and will retain portion of the income tax. It recognizes that the income tax is an elastic tax, from which the taxpayers may claim relief. The arrangement we are making will leave the way open for further relief when conditions are favorable. This meets the objection to the original scheme that the surrender of income taxation to the States would destroy the prospect of relief in the limited fields of taxation remaining. ation be surrendered for all time? there be another war we might have to reenter every field of taxation. No one can take from this Parliament the right to levy taxation. We desired to come to an agreement with the States, but when they refused to agree to anything, there was only one ffourse to follow, and that was to use our powers under the Constitution. Under this scheme two States w ill raise all their own requirements, and the other four-the less populous ones-wil l raise nearly all their requirements. South Australia, for instance, w ill raise within £22,000 of its needs. Payments to these four States is an essential part of the scheme, because of the unequal benefits to them that would result if any attempt were made to meet their needs by a further surrender of income tax. The scheme is on the lines of the recommendations by the Royal Commission on Taxation. The recommendations of the commission were as follows: For the sake of clearness, we repeat that, as the ultimate and permanent solution of the problem, in our opinion(a) An allocation of subjects of direct taxation between the Commonwealth and the States should be made, (ft) '.Hie power to impose income tax should be exclusively vested in the Commonwealth, (c) Tho power to impose other existing forms of direct taxation-land , probate, or succession, entertainmentsshould be exclusively vested in the States, subject only to the overriding powers of tlie Commonwealth in the case of Avar. It is pointed out in this connection that, under section 9fi of the Commonwealth Constitution, itlie Commonwealth Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as Parliament thinks lit. The only departure from that is that both the Commonwealth and the States w ill impose income taxes; but this deThe parture really favours the States. The commission pointed out that any scheme for harmonization or amalgamation which left the Commonwealth and State authorities both demanding revenue from the same people by the same mode of taxation could at best be only an i m perfect remedy for the existing disabilities.

155,Dr. Earlepage,"No . Shouldopinion among the witnesses -.the commission examined that a delimitation of spheres of taxation was desirable. The members of the commission were of the. opinion that only by a delimitation of the spheres or an allocation of subjects of taxation between the Commonwealth and the States could an orderly and satisfactory system of taxation be brought into operation in Australia. The new arrangement will be economical, because three taxes which the Commonwealth itself at present collects independently of tinued. Taxation staffs will not be required by the Commonwealth for land tax, estate duties, or entertainments tax. Practically all the States are collecting taxes in these fields, and the collection of somewhat higher amounts of tax will not he proportionately more costly. When the Commonwealth and State income tax staffs were amalgamated, it was possible to dispense with the services of several hundred Commonwealth officers. As a large number of offices was abolished in a short period hecause of a change in the Government's policy regarding taxation collection, the Government provided for compensation to officers whose services were no longer required. This was done under the provisions of the Income Tax Collection Act 1923-24. The change that is now to be made will also render the services of many officers unnecessary. As this will follow a change of Government policy, ' the Government has decided to grant compensation to officers who now become surplus under these arrangements, on a basis similar to that provided in the In disabilities of Western Australia or come Tax Collection Act. I wish now to refer to the collection of taxation on interest on loans. At present the States cannot tax interest on Commonwealth loans issued in Australia; but all loans issued since 1918 are subject to Commonwealth income taxation. It is recognized that the 40 per cent, of income tax surrendered by the Commonwealth includes a relatively small sum of tax on interest on loans which the States will not be able to collect from the object in mind that the Commonwealth bond owners. This, however, is compensated for by the fact that the estimates of the yield of the surrendered land taxes, estate duties, and entertainments tax may confidently be said to he on a Dr. Earle Page. conservative basis. That is to say, it may be expected that these taxes will yield more than the Commonwealth has set down in respect of them in the table showing the effect of the scheme. The land tax figures, for instance, which were falling in 1922-3, have since been continually increasing. that arrears are being collected. continual increase in the value of land in consequence of the increased population. the States, will be disconI turn now to the matter of the special assistance proposed to be granted to certain States under the provisions of the bill. Requests made to the Commonwealth by Western Australia and Tasmania compelled the Government to give consideration to the basis upon which the Commonwealth should assist a State. The Commonwealth, in the opinion of the Government, cannot assume responsibility for State difficulties that are due to geographical position. Before a State can reasonably expect assistance, it must point out definitely how the policy of the Commonwealth has been disadvantageous to it . The whole position of Tasmania and Western Australia has been very carefully examine.d, and it has not been demonstrated that those States have suffered any disadvantage that they would not have suffered had federation never been consummated. Advantages of federation must be set off against the alleged disadvantages, and every State has re.aped advantages. It is not possible to assess in money on a balance of account the alleged Federal Tasmania. But the Commonwealth is interested in securing the stability of each State, and it has considered the matter from that view-point. A deficit is not, in itself, ground for assistance; otherwise bad finance would be encouraged; and a money grant is not really a solution of the financial embarrassment of any State. The main essential in rendering useful aid is to ascertain the causes of trouble and to remedy them. It is with that Government has considered the requests of Western Australia and Tasmania. It must be remembered that the framers of the Constitution recogjnized the need for special financial treatment for Western",37,Assistance Th E Object Ol The Adjusting

157,Dr. Earle Page,"No; there is aAustralia, and that State was enabled to retain its own tariff on a sliding scale for five years. per capita arrangement was introduced in 19.10-11, Western Australia received a special grant of £250,000 , reducing annually by £10,000. In 1925-26 that grant was approximately £97,000. spite of this assistance, however, strong representations were made to the Government that Western Australia had suffered so severely under federation that she deserved still more consideration. The Government therefore appointed a royal commission in 1924 to inquire into the whole position. commendations of the commission were not unanimous either as to the disabilities or the remedies that should be applied. that secession was the only remedy. As an alternative, he joined in a majority recommendation that Western Australia should be granted its own Customs and excise tariff, and that in the meantime it should receive a special grant of £450,000 per annum. A thir d member opposed the tariff suggestion and recommended a grant of £300,000 for ten years. volved discontinuance of the present diminishing grant. made a temporary grant in 1925-26 of £450,000, less the present special grant of approximately £97,000. Since the royal commission proceedings, the Commonwealth Government has made an in vestigation of the matter. It has ascertained that Western Australia has made substantial progress under federation. Wonderful advances have been made in agriculture, and there has been a large increase in population. It appeared to the Government that the difficulties from which the State has suffered could be stated under three headings. The first of these was the war, which, of course, affected not only Western Australia, but the whole world. The second difficulty was the decline of the gold-mining industry, and the difficulty in establishing the agricultural industry on a proper basis. D u r in g the period of the changeover from gold mining to agriculture huge deficits accumulated on the State railways, which were operated at a tremendouB loss. deficits corresponded remarkably closely with the total deficit in the State finances. Now that agriculture has been established on a sound basis in Western AusWhen the tralia, the railways are netting a bigger volume of business, and in the last three years they have shown a satisfactory surplus over interest and working expenses. In MrA . GBEEN -That is not so. D r . EARLE PAGE -The surplus in 1923-24 was £90,000, and in 1924-25 it was about £150,000. last year. D r . EARLE PAGE -That may be Unfortunately, the reso; but the huge deficits of the past are not being incurred now. The Government believes that if Western Australia were relieved for a period from the One commissioner considered burden of this deficit the State budget could be readily stabilized. It therefore proposes to make a grant of £300,000 a year for five years. This grant w ill cover interest and sinking f u n d charges on £5,t000,000 of the deficit. The third factor which has been a difficulty to Western Australia has been the vastness of its territory. The north-west of Western Australia has an area Both recommendations in of 528,000 square miles, w it h a population of less than 6,000, which burdens The Government -the State to the extent of £150,000 a year. In the official case which the Hon. N . Reenan presented to the royal commission on behalf of the State he saidThe burden of rendering the present services . . . . falls entirely on Western -Australia, and the resources of Western Australia are incapable of standing further strain in this regard. He added that present servicesare not by any means sufficient to ensure their objective They fall far short of what can reasonably be expected if settlement is to progress at all, yet they far exceed what the State has available to spend. The Honourable J . Scaddan, a former Premier of the State, in giving evidence before the royal commission that I have mentionedemphatically expressed his opinion that the development of the present State of Western Australia, comprising, as it doss, an area of 975,920 square miles, "" is so tremendous that the task is too ranch for the State Government. The heaviest railway It is too enormous for one Parliament, and the parliamentary representatives generally, to have a complete knowledge of the whole"" State and its requirements, while, from the financial stand-point, the task is impossible as well.""",38,Assistance Th E Object Ol The Adjusting
158,Mr Mann,"The r e was no surplusSpeakingi n the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia on the 9 th December, 1924, the Honourable P. Collier, Premier, saidThe north-west requires special treatment. . . . There is an obligation devolving upon the Commonwealth Government to assist Western Australia financially in the development of that portion of our territory. It is almost beyond the financial powers of this State to provide for the necessary developmental works in the north-west, and, at the same time, to find the money required for . . . the more closelysettled portions of the State. It was the duty of the Federal Government to assist us in the development of the north-west, just as they have been finding money for the development of the Northern Territory. . . . I do not see much hope of the State affording any considerable financial assistance to the north-west for some years to come. Mr Collier, according to the press report of a civic farewell, referred to suggestions that Mr Theodore, when Premier of Queensland, had made for the development of Northern Australia. In the Daily News, he is reported to have said, mentioning the north-westSomething should be done to develop the hidden wealth of that land. It could only be done by the Governmenta national Government einbarking upon a scheme of railway construction. . . . That was the work of a national Government; in other words, the Federal Government. It was just as much their obligation to look after tlie north-west as was the Northern Territory, and it had to be remembered that nations could not keep on growing unless they had additional territory where people might settle. He is reported in tlie Western Australian to have saidI t is a national obligation for the Federal Government to attend to our north-west, just as much as it is for that Government to take the responsibility of governing and developing the Northern Territory. The Government of Western Australia cannot develop the south-western portion of the State unless they are given adequate assistance. It is the duty of this Parliament to assume responsibility for the north-west. vernment has offered to take over that territory. If that offer is accepted, the finances of Western Australia w ill be relieved to the extent of approximately £150,000 a year. We are awaiting an opportunity to discuss that proposal with the Government of Western Australia. I shall now refer to the case of Tasmania. That State has encountered difficulties ever since the inauguration Dr. Earle Page. federation. It did not benefit to the same extent as other States, on account of its isolated position. During the first period of ten years it believed that it suffered loss under the "" bookkeeping system then in operation, and during the second period of ten years it did not benefit to the same extent as other States from the per capita payments, because its population, did not increase as rapidly, the percentage increase since 1911 being 14 compared with the Commonwealth percentage of 34. In 1912-13 the Commonwealth made a grant to Tasmania of £900,000, to be distributed over a period of ten years. In 1922-23, and again in 1923-24, further grants amounting to £85,000 were made. In 1924 additional assistance was given by the Commonwealth refraining from the taxation of lottery prizes. Thati n volved a sum of £ l l l , 0 0 0 per annum. Provision was also made for a special grant of £85,000 per annum, to be diminished by an amount of £17,000 per annum. Yet this year the Tasmanian Government approached the Commonwealth with the plea that its position was desperate, and that it required assistance to the exent of £545,000 a year! Sir Nicholas Lockyer was appointed to investigate Tasmania's financial position. He found that a great deal of her trouble was due to internal disorganization, and inefficiency in many ways, but he recommended the granting of a certain amount of financial assistance to enable Tasmania to regain its stability, on the condition that the Commonwealth should control that expenditure. This Government, however, regards seriously the responsibility of supervising the affairs of a sovereign State. Having examined Tasmania's claim and investigated the whole position, we now put forward a provisional proposition to grant to Tasmania financial Consequently, this Goassistance to the extent of £378,000 annually during the next two years, after which the position can be reviewed. Tasmania's railway system has never been a payable proposition. During the last ten years the deficits have increased u n t i l they now amount to approximately £250,000 per annum. The Commonwealth Government has offered to Tasof mania for a period of two years a grant lo relieve the State of the interest and sinking f u n d payments upon the railway debt. years a tremendous sum of money has been invested in wu extensive hydroelectric undertaking, which has been a drag on the State revenue. pected that w it h in a period of two years this undertaking w ill be self-supporting. The Commonwealth Government proposes to assist the Statei n the meantime by allowing the grant of £68,000 to remain stable for two years instead of being diminished by £17,000 a year. We believe that the relief -which we proposo, combined w it h development along right lines, w ill considerably improve the position of Tasmania in the next two years. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth is making available to Tasmania the whole of its scientific resources, to enable it to reach that stage of prosperity which everybody in Australia desires it to enjoy. adjourned.

I propose to say that all criminals, even murderers, are entitled to a f a i r trial. They have a right to examine and cross-examine.
