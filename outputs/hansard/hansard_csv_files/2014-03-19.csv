0,"Wednesday, 19 March 2014 Acknowledgement Of Country And Read Prayers. Deregulation First Report On Red Tape And What We Are Doing To Reduce It. Next Week, The Parliament Will Have Its First Ever Repeal Day: To Abolish Regulation And Legislation That Has Outlived Its Usefulness Or Is Doing More Harm Than Good. Cutting Red Tape Is At The Heart Of This Government's Mission: To Build A Strong And Prosperous Economy For A Safe And Secure Australia. Red Tape Is What Officials Wrap People In When They Think That Government Knows Best. So, Cutting Red Tape Is A Sign That This Government And This Parliament Want Australians, Individually And In The Community, To Have More Control Over Their Own Lives. It Is An Acknowledgement Of The People, Our Masters. Next Week's Repeal Day Will Scrap More Than 9,500 Unnecessary Or Counterproductive Regulations And 1,000 Redundant Acts Of Parliament. More Than 50,000 Pages Will Disappear From The Statute Books. Added To Measures Already Announced, Repeal Day Initiatives Will Bring Total Red Tape Savings To $720 Million A Year Every Year. The First Repeal Day Will Abolish The Australian Charities And Not","for-Profits Commission because people serving our community do not deserve a new level of scrutiny. It will abolish the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor because all relevant legislation has already been reviewed and the former government ignored all the monitor's recommendations. Redundant acts regulating, for instance, the 1970s conversion from imperial to metric measurement, governing state naval divisions (that became part of the Royal Australian Navy 101 years ago) and facilitating the construction of the Snowy Mountains Scheme (that was completed in 1974) will all go. As a result of repeal day, films will only need to be classified once-not again and again when they are reissued in DVD, blu-ray or 3D. As a result of repeal day, businesses will not have to re-apply to use agricultural chemicals and veterinary medicines, because one approval should be enough. Universities will no longer have to submit capital asset management surveys in addition to other surveys which cover essentially the same thing. And jobs agencies will no longer be required to keep paper records of every applicant which, in one agency alone, occupied 336 filing cabinets. Businesses will no longer be required to administer the former government's paid parental leave scheme, saving them an estimated $48 million. Associated with repeal day, national",17,Setup

2,Mr Abbott (Warringah,"Prime Minister) (09:01): by leave-This is the government'sbusinesses will be allowed to operate under one workers compensation scheme right around our nation rather than having to operate in up to eight. Next week's repeal day will be the first of many. Under this government, there will be at least two a year, because we will make people's lives easier, not harder. It is worth recalling that the first parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia passed just 513 pages of legislation-that is just half a page of legislation per day. Mr Champion interjectinghalf an act of parliament every single day. Between 2007 and 2013, under the former government, some 21,000 new regulations found their way into national life. No doubt, some of these were good and necessary but some, clearly, were overkill at best. Why should a long day care centre with 15 staff and 75 places have to do paperwork, said to cost on average $140,000 a year which is $2,000 a child or nearly $10,000 a staff member? The result of this are fewer child care services and higher prices for the ones that exist. Why should a Sydney cafe that serves alcohol and has outdoor seating be subject to 21 local, 29 state and 25 Commonwealth regulations or sets of regulations? That is 75 different hoops to jump through that mean higher costs for businesses and fewer jobs for Australians. Why should Australian medical researchers collectively put 500 years of work into preparing grant applications of which only 20 per cent succeed? That is time not put into finding cures for disease. Likewise, why should every Australian university be required to report more than 50 sets of data to the Commonwealth Department of Education and a further 50 to other government entities? Again, this is time and money that is not directed to teaching and research. Of course, government should be confident that standards are maintained and that taxpayers' money is accounted for, but it is too easy for officials to do their job at others' expense in the name of safety or accountability. A reason why bricks and mortar retailing is losing out to online sales is the compliance costs that shops face, from planning regulations to product standards. A reason why our farmers find it hard to compete is that one dollar in every six of their earnings, the NFF says, is spent on compliance. Mr Champion: Let's repeal the real world! 94(a).

6,Mr Abbott,"About 60 per cent of Australian businesses are sole traders and 85 per centOn the World Economic Forum's global competitiveness ranking, Australia has slipped six places in four years to 21st. Australia's ranking on the burden of government regulation is 128th-yes, 128th in the world, nestled between Romania and Angola. On The Economist's productivity growth ranking, we come second last, just ahead of Botswana. The first instinct of democratic politicians, confronted with a problem, is to promise to make it go away. Like a fence at the top of a cliff, sometimes regulation is necessary, but there is a limit to what government should do to protect us from ourselves. More regulation is not the solution to every corporate, community or personal failing. Sometimes, we just have to accept that mistakes are inevitable and that misfortunes are unavoidable. When someone in authority gets it wrong, the best outcome might be a timely resignation rather than more regulation. When it comes to making us act responsibly, good example may be better than more rules. As Tony Blair has conceded, government cannot guarantee a risk-free life. 'Ambiguity, uncertainty, the wisdom that comes with failing and changing your mind', he says, 'are all essential to progress'; because 'a risk averse public sector will stifle creativity and deny to many the opportunities to be creative.' Since day one, this government has been cutting red tape. On day one, we began the process of scrapping the carbon tax. Repealing the carbon tax removes over 1,000 pages of primary and subordinate legislation and removes compliance costs from over 75,000 businesses. Repealing the carbon tax not only takes a $9 billion handbrake off our economy and gives a $550 bonus to households but will provide a direct red tape saving to business of $85 million a year. And repealing the mining tax will save businesses more than $10 million in compliance costs. Fifty-five announced but unlegislated tax measures will no longer proceed-including the previous government's $1.8 billion FBT hit on the car industry, and the cap on self-education expenses that would have hit tradies, nurses and teachers. Every cabinet submission now has a regulation impact statement so that its potential impact on business, community groups and households can more readily be identified. All Commonwealth government portfolios now have a dedicated deregulation unit, formed from existing staff, because it is sometimes more important to repeal old laws than to pass new ones. Each cabinet minister is expected to consult widely before finalising new policy because the first law of government should be: do no harm. At the December COAG meeting, all states and territories agreed to create one-stop shops for environmental approvals so that major projects will only need to be assessed once, not twice. There is already a one-stop shop for offshore environmental approvals which the Office of Best Practice Regulation estimates will save businesses $120 million a year. Soon, NHMRC grants will run for five years-not three-so that successful medical researchers will spend less time filling out forms. This government is making it easier for people to do business with government by reducing reporting requirements, by using credit cards more and by paying bills on time. This government has also scrapped the Aged Care Workforce Supplement that forced providers to sign up to union-dictated enterprise bargaining agreements. Mr Perrett: Rubbish! Rubbish! member for Wakefield-one more. and making it easier for people to go about their lives. But this is just the start, not the finish. Every department and agency is conducting a comprehensive audit of the costs it puts on individuals and entities so that it can put a dollar figure on the cost of compliance and reporting and start reducing it every year. Every department and agency will be required to contribute towards the $1 billion a year, every year, in red tape cost savings that the government is committed to deliver. The Productivity Commission is finalising the indicators that will make red tape reduction easier to judge. Not only will deregulation become a standing item on the COAG agenda but there will be less red tape within COAG, with the number of ministerial councils dropping from 22 to eight. The reviews that the government has in train into competition policy, workplace law, and the financial system-all have a deregulatory focus. The white papers that the government plans-into tax and into the federation-are both intended to reduce overlap and complexity. We are carefully considering the former government's changes to coastal shipping and its changes to trucking rates to ensure that they make doing business easier, not harder. For too long, governments have acted as if the Australian people work for them. People do not work for government; government should work for people. It is government's job to serve the people; not people's job to serve the government. In simple terms, we work for you. And we are working for you today by creating the biggest bonfire of regulations in our country's history. Our mission is not bigger government; it is bigger citizens with more opportunities. To the Australian people, I say: this is about saving you money, saving you time, and trusting your common sense to make more choices about your life. I am proud of the progress that the government has made to date-but it is only the start of what is to come.

I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition that those sitting behind him were far from respectful of the speech given earlier. competitive, productive and profitable enterprises-successful enterprises that provide good jobs, secure jobs, fair pay and decent conditions. We understand the importance of small business. We need no lecture from those opposite. We appreciate the massive contribution that nearly five million Australians who own and work in small businesses make to our economy. That is why when Labor was in power we established a minister for deregulation. That is why, previously, despite this sense of 'golly, gee, discovery' from the Prime Minister that somehow he is the first Prime Minister to ever talk about repealing legislation, we repealed more than 12,000 pieces of redundant legislation, including 7½ thousand in 2013. That is why Labor initiated the most comprehensive COAG deregulation process to remove much of the unnecessary constraints on our economy across different levels. Labor understand the importance of increasing productivity, increasing efficiency and helping put downward pressures on prices for small business. We are committed, in a bipartisan spirit, to the organised and ongoing effort to minimise, simplify and create costeffective regulation. But, indeed, I must say-and I do not believe the Prime Minister necessarily spoke to this point as much as I expected him to-that we balance against our desire for the goals which I have just outlined to ensure that through our regulatory system we improve competition in this country; that we have quality standards, that we have consumer protections, in particular against fraud; that information is sufficient for people in Australia to be able to operate and make informed decisions in our markets; that we have a clean environment where we tackle pollution; and that we have wide access to services across the whole of Australia not just our cities. We understand that we should have a regulatory system which encourages the start-ups of business, that when people are seeking construction development approvals they are not tied up in unnecessary green tape. We understand the importance of making sure that our utilities in very strategic parts of our economy provide services and opportunities for the businesses that have to deal with them, and the consumers. We are most committed to ensure that, in markets where there is some form of regulation, be it telecommunications, financial services or insurance, there are in fact proper information sets available for business-in particular, small business-so they can make the comparisons which allow them to benefit from the benefits of competition. We are very conscious of state regulations as well-property registration and the like-which can be an obstacle towards businesses succeeding. That can include a range of issues, from registration at state titles offices right through to retail tenancies. We understand the importance of credit being able to flow through our economy and making sure that that is not impeded by unnecessary regulation. We are most committed to reforms which will see people spending less time filling out their tax requirements, which will make sure that people can spend more time making a profit and less time filling in forms. This matter should not be about partisan point-scoring or ideology. We believe repeal should be diligent, not ideological. That is why this talk of bonfires and war is so remarkably overheated. Mr Joyce: Who's talking about war?",20,Ministerial Statements
14,The Speaker,That is quite right-the honourable member is not in his seat. It does,21,Ministerial Statements
15,Mr Shorten,"But they did make some good points. We have always believed inwant important protections to be lost under the guise of deregulation. We should have regulations to make sure that our consumers are safe. We should make sure that we have regulations that protect mum and dad investors-a point I will return to. We should have regulations that preserve our pristine natural environment. These are vital. On the substance of the bills before us as opposed to the high-blown rhetoric of the Prime Minister, the statement of motherhood principles, let me talk first of all about the government's proposition to abolish the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission. I am concerned that the government is proposing to repeal a body that not only has the support of the sector that it regulates but also reduces red tape. Mr Nikolic interjectingknow what is going on over there. charities sector would be calling for its removal and shouting about the red tape burden, but the reverse is true. Today the Abbott government has managed to unite 54 leaders from the charities sector. This government loves their charities; they will turn up at the opening of a charity. There is no doubt that when it comes to the photo opportunity, those opposite are charities' best friends. But when it comes to red tape and protection of charities: missing in action, no appearance. We have 54 leaders from the sector taking the unprecedented action of issuing an open letter to retain the current framework. Let me say that this is courageous by these charities. We know what a vindictive, critical, punishing mob those opposite are. Those 54 charities have dared to disagree with this mob opposite. We will be watching you to see if you punish them, because that is your form guide. Indeed, some opposite seem to think that the charities sector is in love with their propositions. Mr Andrews interjectingMinister for Social Services, say nothing. Let me go through what some of these 54 have said. The Minister for Social Services, who deals with them, so disrespects their right to have a separate opinion to his own. Tim Costello says: The commission is actually working for us and it gives the public confidence, it underpins the consumer benefit to charities. Watch out for World Vision's funding, I would say now, in light of that comment. Professor Myles McGregor-Lowndes, Director of the Australian Centre for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Studies at QUT, states: During its short history, the ACNC has played a positive role in the overall regulatory environment of charities, and it is well-placed to continue that role. In the short term, it provides the infrastructure for a ‘one stop shop’ for Commonwealth regulatory requirements, and a dedicated force to work with other Commonwealth agencies to streamline their present arrangements. Its stellar improvement in terms of timeliness, consistency of decision making and responsiveness to emerging issues of previous ATO functions, surpasses the sector’s original high expectations.",21,Ministerial Statements

20,Mr Shorten,"The Minister for Social Services says it is only 54 out of all of them.Then we have all sorts of other groups. David Crosbie, Chief Executive Officer of the Community Council for Australia, has said: The ACNC is more efficient than the government regulators it replaced, is doing good work and deserves a chance to achieve its three goals of reducing red tapea goal which the Prime Minister rhetorically dedicated himself to this morningincreasing public trust and strengthening the charities sector. I know the Prime Minister is a strong rhetorical supporter of our charity sector; I congratulate him on his Pollie Pedal. I should just say that David Crosbie did not congratulate him; that was me. David Crosbie continued: Axing the ACNC would be a very clear sign that government is not interested in the considered views of the charities sector. There we go. Louise Walsh, the CEO of Philanthropy Australia-no doubt another nest of Marxists, according to the ideologues over there-says: Since the ACNC’s establishment as an independent charities regulator, Philanthropy Australia has consistently supported the ACNC’s important role in our community. The ACNC has only existed for just over a year – so far the progress is promising and we want it to be given the opportunity to realise its full potential. There you have it. That is what the 54 people that the Minister for Social Services just dismisses. What did these people ever do to be dismissed by you, except dedicate their lives to looking after other people? What an arrogant chap you are! This ministerial statement on the charities commission goes on to show that, when it comes to this government evaluating the beauty parade between ideology and pragmatic, moderate common sense, pragmatic, moderate common sense never wins. In August 2013, a pro bono survey-Oh! There are more than just 54 here; this might change the random remark that the Minister for Social Services made before-of over 1,500 members of the not-for-profit sector found that 81 per cent supported the ACNC. That would be more than 1,200, Kevin. Only six per cent of the survey respondents in the charitablerespondents in the charitable sector supported a return to the ATO as a default regulator. The not-for-profit sector employs over one million Australians, turns over about $1 billion, involves almost five million volunteers and is the heart of all our communities. The Productivity Commission and the Henry tax review recommended a national charities commission. The Productivity Commission, so beloved of the government, declared the previous regulatory framework to be complex, lacking coherence and transparency and costly to charities. Abolishing the charities commission is an insult to taxpayers, who want to see where their donations go, and it is an insult to charities, who will lose their visibility and governance support. It is bad for the public, who will be vulnerable to more frauds and scams. So on the charities commission we have the government talking with high-blown rhetoric about how much it wants to cut red tape, but when it has a chance to turn its words into deeds they-the Abbott government and the Prime Minister-do not live up to their own rhetoric. But there is a second example of how the government is inconsistent with the rhetoric of the Prime Minister's opening speech. When it comes to turning good words into good actions",22,Ministerial Statements
21,The Speaker Interjecting,,23,Ministerial Statements
22,Mr Shorten,"Sorry, the member for Menzies. Only six per cent of the surveythey go missing. I talk of course about the future of financial advice legislation. What a disturbing proposition that is from the government. The Assistant Treasurer, with the support of the Prime Minister, is determined to reduce the protections of mum and dad investors. The Assistant Treasurer was up-front during Senate estimates about his game plan to prescribe new regulations to dismantle the current consumer protection laws, with immediate effect, as soon as the parliament rises next week so there will be no parliamentary scrutiny of these changes-none. Putting aside Labor's concerns about the substance of the Assistant Treasurer's changes, we are most aggrieved at the process. This is all about pulling the wool over the eyes of Australian investors. Just as bad, the financial services sector faces the very real prospect of having to deal in a short period of time with competing regulatory regimes: the regulations that take effect from 27 or 28 March; the current laws, if the regulations are disallowed in the Senate; and whatever legislative landscape we end up with after 1 July when the parliament has dealt with the government's legislation. This is a red-tape nightmare dreamt up by the fevered imagination of the Prime Minister of Australia. The Assistant Treasurer appears to be proceeding in a ham-fisted manner, without any regard to the outcomes. Labor went through numerous rounds of consultation when refining our policy. For the benefit of some of the new members of the coalition who might not have been in parliament at the time of the events that triggered this current round of consumer protection law that Labor put in place, it followed the collapse of Storm Financial. Bernie Ripoll's Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquired into that and put legislation into parliament that it debated, inquired into and passed. Having seen the lesson of Storm Financial, those people opposite turn their backs on the experience of history. I cannot say when the next financial disaster will happen and I cannot say who the victims will be, but I know one thing: because of what you are doing, you are guaranteeing another Storm Financial and upon your heads it will rest. We will hold you responsible for your abandonment of basic common sense when it comes to consumer protection. This is dodgy law done in a dodgy way which will lead to dodgy outcomes. If you want to make the changes, make the case via legislation. Front up and have a parliamentary inquiry. We saw what happened in Storm Financial; we saw what happened in Westpoint-highprofile collapses where in certain instances investors were lured into these investment products because financial planners were receiving hidden commissions to promote those products. Our financial laws, which you are seeking to dismantle, would protect consumers with a best-interest duty. There would be opt-in measures, requiring advisers to get their clients to opt in to receive ongoing service every two years, and annual disclosure-somehow annual disclosure is a bad idea. And then there is conflicted remuneration. We put the government on notice. They want to reduce red tape, and I have outlined why we think as a principle that is sound. We put this Abbott government on notice that we do not want to effectively decriminalise and deregulate financial fraud in this country. We are a constructive opposition. We will give the package they put forward careful consideration. We support the repeal of redundant 1901 legislation. We will not allow important protections to be recklessly cut. Labor stands for the protection of consumers, the protection of workers and the protection of investors. Markets are fundamental, but one economic lesson which we all know in this place is that markets periodically need the help of government. Regulations protect against abuses. We have a proud record of removing the unnecessary regulations, but we will be guided by the interests of all Australians, not just blind ideology. (Time expired) Omnibus Repeal Day (Autumn 2014) Bill 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Frydenberg. Bill read a first time. Second ReadingI move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Omnibus Repeal Day (Autumn 2014) Bill 2014 is the first bill in the government's 2014 repeal day package. In April 1946, Sir Robert Menzies's Liberal Party took out an advertisement in the Bulletin magazine. 'We want fewer forms and more reforms,' the headline screamed. Alongside a picture of a husband and wife drowning in paperwork, the advertisement went on to say: 'I'm fenced in with permits, licences, returns, regulations from every board, division and department under the sun. WhatI want is to control my own industry.' It was a message that strongly resonated then, as it still does today. In every facet of life, from aged care to agriculture, schools to small business, visas to veterans, we are facing an avalanche of regulation that is impeding investment and innovation and the creation of new jobs. In under six years, the previous, Labor government introduced an additional 21,000 regulations, including the carbon tax, with its 18 separate acts and 1,100 pages of legislation, and the mining tax, with 11 separate acts and 525 pages of legislation. This is despite Kevin Rudd's 2007 claim: The truth is business regulation is now right out of control. The quantity and complexity of business regulation today is eating away at the entrepreneurial spirit of Australian business. And Kevin Rudd's small business minister, Craig Emerson, said: We are promising to take a giant pair of scissors to the red tape that is strangling small businesses. Unfortunately, Labor did anything but. It is little wonder then, that given this poor performance by the Rudd and Gillard governments, the World Economic Forum ranked Australia a pitiful 128th out of 148 countries surveyed for 'burden of government regulation'. Or that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry surveyed its members in 2013 and found that 73 per cent of businesses felt the compliance burden had increased in the past two years. The Business Council of Australia too has documented the overwhelming compliance burden, highlighting that one environmental process took more than two years, cost millions of dollars, involved 4,000 meetings, required a 12,000-page report and, when the approval",23,Ministerial Statements
23,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (09:32):came back, it had 1,500 conditions attached, 300 at the federal level, 1,200 at the state level, and 8,000 subconditions. How can we expect any company to go through that process. Unfortunately, today too many of our business leaders share the sentiments of Jos de Bruin, CEO of the Master Grocers Association, who said 'many of our members feel they are in the business of compliance, and do a little bit of retailing on the side'. Comments such as these from an industry group representing firms employing more than 115,000 staff and contributing more than $14 billion each year to the economy are a call to action. And we need to respond. It is against this backdrop that the Abbott government is determined to turn back the tide of red and green tape and adopt a new approach. Questions must be asked first before any new regulations are passed. What is their purpose? Their cost? Their impact on new entrants? And their effectiveness in managing risk? Only then, when it is absolutely necessary, with no sensible alternatives available, should we proceed to regulate. We need a new concept of acceptable risk and we need to better understand the cumulative impact of regulation on business decision making. After all, business is not sentimental and capital is mobile. Politicians who support new regulation are, in the words of the former Productivity Commission chairman Gary Banks, 'often rewarded with public acclaim as tangible evidence that the government is ""doing something""'. Just look at the previous government's boast that it passed hundreds of pieces of legislation, as if that was an achievement in itself. As Banks describes, these 'uneven political pressures' are the 'antithesis of good regulatory process'. The incentives are simply all wrong. Their cumulative impact is to deter investment and innovation and stifle productivity. As part of the Abbott government's new approach, we are implementing a series of reforms which will hold both ministers and the bureaucracy to greater account. Cabinet submissions proposing legislative changes with a significant regulatory impact will no longer be exempted from the regulatory impact assessment processes. Ministers have been tasked to establish designated units within their own departments to advise on deregulation priorities, while each minister is appointing an advisory committee with outside representation to provide advice on where regulation can be cut. Senior members of the Public Service are having their remuneration directly linked to their performance in reducing red and green tape. Two parliamentary sitting days have been set for repealing legislation each year, with the first repeal day occurring next Wednesday. And we have committed to an annual target of reducing red tape by $1 billion. All this is being overseen by the Prime Minister and his department, which has subsumed the Office of Deregulation and the Office of Best Practice Regulation into the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet from its previous location in the Department of Finance. Regulators too are the subject of the new approach. The government is releasing today a Productivity Commission report which provides a framework for auditing the performance of regulatory agencies. The Commonwealth has 75 external and 65 internal regulators, each of which vary in size. When they do their job well, they effectively manage risk and advance the interests of stakeholders and the community at large. However, when their performance is subpar, it can lead to substantial delays, increased costs and complexity, and what can be politely described as a 'mission creep'. The perception today is that too many of our regulators are dominated by a culture of compliance and enforcement that stifles productivity. There is also a view that where regulators have the ability to cost recover their fees from industry it is industry that bears the impost of regulators' risk aversion. The Abbott government is implementing a series of measures to audit and to ultimately strengthen the performance of regulators in addition to the Productivity Commission's report, which covers four key indicators: advice and guidance, licensing and approvals, monitoring and compliance, and enforcement. Senior ministers in the Abbott government with portfolio responsibility for one or more Commonwealth regulators are now sending letters of expectation to the relevant regulatory head. These letters make clear that the strategic direction of the government is to deregulate and lift the compliance burden on stakeholders. Where appropriate, ministers call upon regulators to reduce any overlap between their functions and those of other regulators and to undertake an audit of the cost of regulatory compliance to their stakeholders. Where it can be done, the ministers are also requesting that regulators substitute mandatory reporting requirements with independent audits. The goal of these changes is to create a more practical, risk based approach to enforcement. Ahead of Repeal Day next Wednesday, today is also a historic moment for the Australian parliament. Today the government introduces legislation and tables documents to repeal more than 10,000 acts and regulations, the largest ever single bulk repeal in the history of the Commonwealth. Red and green tape is being cut across nearly every portfolio, slashing the compliance bill for business and the not-for-profit sectors by more than $700 million. Significantly, the broader economic impact will be larger than this-exponentially largeras jobs will be created and investments that may otherwise have been delayed or cancelled will now go ahead. In just over six months in government, this is a good start, but there is a long way to go. We are determined to see a cultural shift in Australia's approach to regulation. Regulation must never be the default option for government but only a means of last resort following genuine consultation with stakeholders. The Abbott government's deregulation initiatives, many of which are being introduced today, align with three key themes. The first is removing duplication between different levels of government and between different agencies of government. The government has already announced one-stop shops for environmental approvals to avoid overlap between state and federal regimes. Now one-stop shops will be extended to offshore petroleum activities in Commonwealth waters, with NOPSEMA-the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority-now empowered to make determinations required under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act without the need to get approval from a second, separate, Commonwealth regulator. David Byers, CEO of the Australian Petroleum Production Exploration Association, says that this move is essential should Australia be able to 'win extra market share' beyond the $200 billion already invested in local projects. We are also removing the requirement for aged-care building certification at the federal level, as this merely duplicates requirements at the state level. With an additional 74,000 aged-care places needed over the next 10 years, we need less regulation, not more, if we are going to provide the incentive for the required investment. In another significant change we are opening up the Comcare scheme to companies who operate in multiple states and want to self-insure. Instead of having to enter into separate workers’ compensation schemes in every state in which they operate, they can enter into a single scheme which is estimated to save industry over $30 million a year in compliance costs. Second is the need to streamline onerous and costly reporting requirements. Labor’s Future of Financial Advice laws imposed a whopping $700 million implementation cost on the financial services sector and needs to be pared back. The Personal Property Securities Act which mandates that small and large hire firms register serial numbered goods with a Commonwealth authority is more onerous than regimes in place in comparable jurisdictions such as New Zealand and Canada. Commonwealth grant and procurement guidelines also need to be amended to ensure greater use of template contracts and to increase the threshold for the Commonwealth to make payments with credit cards to assist the cash flow of small business. The education sector also needs relief, with universities no longer having to submit capital asset management surveys, which provide unnecessary levels of detailed information on the use of their lecture theatres, laboratories and academic offices. And the not-for-profit sector will also see savings, with the Brotherhood of St Laurence no longer having to report monthly, but instead quarterly, as it oversees the implementation of the Commonwealth’s Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters (HIPPY) program, an important educational service assisting disadvantaged young families. Third, the Abbott government will take a common-sense approach to regulation. There is no need for companies to seek separate classifications, for 2D, 3D, DVD or Bluray versions of a film like Kung Fu Panda when one classification should suffice. Job service providers should not be required to keep 336 file cabinets to hold paper copies of job applications when they could be otherwise stored electronically. It does not make sense for more than 30,000 retailers selling prepaid sim cards to take a photocopy of the purchaser’s ID when similar details are again taken when the phone is activated. So too for a potato farmer exporting to Korea; they should have the option to self-certify the origin of their produce and not go through the costly and time-consuming process of paying for a certificate of origin. These are just some of the many examples of over-regulation which we are seeking to correct with our initiatives announced in conjunction with repeal day-as the Prime Minister said, a bonfire of superfluous regulation. The Omnibus Repeal Day (Autumn 2014) Bill 2014, which is before the House, is part of a package of repeal measures, together with a series of other important bills including the Statute Law Revision Bill No. 1 2014 and the Amending Acts 1901-1969 Repeal Bill 2014. The Omnibus Bill makes a number of changes to:  streamline reporting and information provision requirements for telecommunications providers under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010  remove Telstra’s standard marketing plan and policy statement requirements, now redundant under the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999  streamline the Australian Communication and Media Authority’s (ACMA) discretion to investigate complaints under the Media Authority Act 2005, Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Broadcasting Act) and Interactive Gambling Act 2001  remove superseded standard form agreement provisions outlined in the Telecommunications Consumer Protection Code requiring carriers to maintain duplicate summaries for each product and service  grant the Australian Communication and Media Authority the power to exempt classes of licenses that do not have significant revenue from the requirement to provide audited accounts under the Broadcasting Act remove redundant permit provisions regarding the operation of sea installations under the Sea Installations Act 1987  remove requirements to undertake water studies in the Murray-Darling Basin for mining activities which have been superseded by provisions in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conversation Act 1999  repeal the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services Act 2009 following the decision announced in MYEFO and its function ceasing on 31 January 2014  remove the certification requirement under the Aged Care Act 1997 that replicates state, territory and local government building regulations for residential aged care facilities  exempt low volume importers from the licensing requirements of the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989. This Omnibus Repeal Day Bill also proposes the repeal of 43 spent and redundant acts, some of which have remained on the Commonwealth statute books despite fulfilling their purpose or being superseded, decades ago. For example, the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1947 was enacted to provide for the protection of approved defence projects by making it an offence to prevent, hinder or obstruct an approved defence project. This act applies to the Woomera Prohibited Area and the Nurrungar Joint Defence Facility. Woomera has been protected under the Defence Force Regulation 1952 since 1976 and the Nurrungar facility was decommissioned in 1999. Further, the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement (Service Personnel) Act 1990 was established to transfer property between the Commonwealth and individual states following the creation of the Defence Housing Authority in 1988. The act was fully spent after five years but remains on the Commonwealth statute book. Four acts from the Treasury portfolio remain on the statute book to implement increases to Australia’s quota at the International Monetary Fund in 1965, 1970, 1983 and 1991. These payments have long been made and the arrangements are no longer required. Furthermore, the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 was amended in 1991 to include standing arrangements to support any payment we are required to make to the IMF when quotas are changed. By allowing these spent and redundant acts to continue in force on the Commonwealth statute book, we are making it harder for businesses, individuals and community organisations to find out about the regulations that matter to them. Instead of being able to quickly and easily find and access the regulations they need to comply with, they have to sift through outdated, unnecessary regulations, to determine whether they still apply. Through our commitment to dedicated parliamentary repeal days and bills like the Omnibus Repeal Day Bill, and the Amending Acts 1901 to 1969 Repeal Bill 2014 and Statute Law Review Bill (No. 1) 2014, this government is taking decisive action to reduce this burden. In conclusion, if Australia does not act now to tackle this avalanche of red and green tape, we will be unnecessarily raising the risk on Australia’s $400-plus billion investment pipeline, and, in the process, endangering tens of thousands of potential new jobs. We must never forget in a competitive world, capital is mobile, and in the Asian century, where the opportunities are so large, we not only need to seize every advantage but we need to eliminate every disadvantage. This is why the deregulation agenda is so urgent and so important. We must act now, as the choice is ours. Sir Robert Menzies, Australia's longest serving and greatest Prime Minister, was right when he said, more than 60 years ago, that what was needed was 'less forms and more reforms'. The Abbott government has heeded these words and is now taking the lead. Australian families, businesses and community organisations all stand to be the great beneficiaries. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Amending Acts 1901 to 1969 Repeal Bill 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Frydenberg. Bill read a first time. Second ReadingI move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Amending Acts 1901 to 1969 Repeal Bill 2014 is the second bill in the government's 2014 Autumn Repeal Day package. The main purpose of the bill is to clean-up the statute books by removing over 1,000 amending and repeal acts. The bill repeals each act mentioned in its schedule. These acts are no longer required as the amendments and repeals that they provide for have already happened. If any application, saving or transitional provision is included in one of those acts, any ongoing operation of the provision will be preserved. The acts do not contain any other substantive provisions that are not already spent. Repealing these acts is important because it will make the statute book simpler and quicker to use by reducing the time it takes to locate current regulations. At present, the acts proposed to be repealed in the amending acts bill form part of the current law and it is not clear to everyone whether the acts have force in and of themselves. Repealing these acts will remove any confusion about the status of these laws. It will be easier for individuals, businesses and community organisations to find laws that impact them without needing to sift through redundant material, while people with a specific interest in the legislation can continue to access these acts as they will remain publically available on ComLaw as historical records. The earliest act being repealed in this bill is the Defence Act 1904. It made amendments that were themselves amended and overtaken multiple times since 1904. This is recorded in the legislative amendment history of the current Defence Act 1903. Indeed, so historic is the Defence Act 1904 that it references a State Division of the Naval Forces and not the Royal Australian Navy, which was formed in 1911. There are numerous other items contained in schedule 1 of the bill which were made in the decades shortly after the start of Federation but which are no longer necessary. The Dried Fruits Export Charges Act 1927 is an example of an act that is clearly outdated but has remained on the statute book for a significant period of time. It set the charge on export of dried fruits in the now repealed principal act of 1924 to one-eighth of a penny for each pound of dried fruits exported. It is now fully spent and redundant. Other acts being repealed amend principal acts which have already been repealed. For instance, the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric power acts from 1951, 1952, 1956 and 1958 amend parts of the principal act from 1949. The 1949 act was repealed over a decade ago by the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Act 1997 when the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority was corporatised. Amending acts made after 1969 will be repealed on future repeal days.",25,Bills

Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 1) 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Frydenberg. Bill read a first time. Second ReadingI move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 1) 2014 is the third bill in the government's 2014 Autumn Repeal Day package. The bill cleans up the statute books by repairing minor errors in Commonwealth consolidated acts, and repeals spent or redundant provisions and acts. While the bill does not make substantive changes to the law, it serves two important functions. First, it clarifies the status of laws by repealing obsolete legislation and, secondly, it removes confusion by amending incorrect or out of date provisions. The bill reduces the regulatory burden by improving the accuracy and useability of Commonwealth legislation. As a result, the bill will help to save individuals, businesses and community organisations time and money. Schedules 1 and 2 of the bill achieve two main ends:  correcting minor technical errors in principal acts, such as grammatical errors and errors in numbering, and  correcting amending acts which contain errors. For example, sometimes legislation refers to other acts incorrectly, or contains references to other parts of the same act which are not accurate. By correcting these unclear legislative provisions, this bill helps make the law easier to use. Schedules 3, 4 and 5 of the bill update language used in a range of legislation. These schedules make three sorts of changes:  Firstly, they amend acts to ensure that Commonwealth ministers are consistently mentioned by reference to the administration of particular legislation, rather than by title. This ensures that the provisions can still be understood and operate properly when the titles of ministers change.  Secondly, they amend terminology to consistently reflect terms now used in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and in current drafting practice. The Acts Interpretation Act is a dictionary and manual that provides rules for reading and interpreting Commonwealth legislation.  Thirdly, they correct various Commonwealth acts to reflect the correct title of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory under the Northern Territory (SelfGovernment) Act 1978.",31,Bills
25,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (09:58): By removing out-dated or unnecessary provisions and acts, this bill also makes Commonwealth legislation more efficient to use. Schedules 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the bill repeal spent or redundant provisions and acts. For example, the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 2005 regulated the use of indicia and images associated with the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. The Act provided that it ceased to have effect on 30 June 2006, so it can now be repealed. Other minor errors in Commonwealth consolidated acts will be corrected on future repeal days. I commend this bill to the chamber. Debate adjourned. Presentation For the information of honourable members, I present documents relating to the repeal of redundant instruments. The list of documents has been circulated to honourable members in the chamber. Corporations Amendment (Streamlining of Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Ciobo. Bill read a first time. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. Introduction This bill makes a number of amendments to address the significant regulatory overreach imposed by the former government's Future of Financial Advice legislation, or FOFA as it is commonly known. Unlike the opposition, the coalition government recognises the significant costs imposed on business and the broader community by poorly targeted, unnecessary and costly regulation. That is why we have committed to reducing the compliance cost of red and green tape by $1 billion per year. This bill fulfils the government's election commitment to reduce the regulatory burden on the financial services industry. The package of amendments contained in the bill will significantly reduce regulatory costs and provide greater certainty to industry in relation to their legal obligations.",32,Bills
26,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong,Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (10:02):,33,Bills
27,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (10:02): I move:This bill is aimed at clarifying the operation of FOFA to more effectively align the legislation with what was envisaged by the original parliamentary joint committee inquiry into financial products and services in Australia which was the genesis of the original FOFA legislation. Research tells us that only 20 to 40 per cent of Australians seek financial advice. Australia's ageing population means it is vital that all Australians have access to affordable advice. The amendments in this bill will place downward pressure on costs and ensure that consumers can better access affordable financial advice. There has been a lot of scaremongering by the opposition, and others, that the government's amendments will weaken the consumer protections currently afforded under FOFA. This is not the case. All of the essential protections of FOFA will stay, ensuring that consumers are protected from receiving poor financial advice. The requirement that advisers must act in the best interests of their client will remain. Advisers will also need to provide appropriate advice, warn the client if advice is based on incomplete or inaccurate information, and prioritise the client's interest ahead of their own. A ban on conflicted remuneration for benefits received in relation to personal advice will remain whilst allowing those advisers not providing personal advice to a client to more efficiently provide general advice. Clients will also continue to receive information about the fees they are paying, including fee disclosure statements for clients who entered into arrangements post 1 July 2013. The government has consulted extensively on the package of amendments. There is widespread support from industry stakeholders for these changes. The package of amendments to FOFA will result in a significant reduction in the regulatory burden across industry and will assist both small businesses as well as larger institutional stakeholders. The Department of the Treasury, in its regulation impact statement, estimated that the amendments would result in ongoing cost savings of approximately $190 million per year with one-off implementation cost savings of around $90 million. The government believes that high quality, affordable financial advice should be within reach of all Australians and that a strong financial services industry, unburdened by excessive regulation, is essential to ensuring that Australians have access to affordable advice. This package of amendments delivers these outcomes. Repeals Day The amendments to FOFA form part of the government's deregulation agenda. The unnecessary and heavy regulatory burden imposed on industry has caused business costs to rapidly increase. However, the government is taking action to make sure Australia's economy can make the most of opportunities and flourish in the years ahead. We have a broad-ranging deregulation agenda, aimed at boosting productivity by reducing the regulatory burden on business. Our goal is to restore certainty, predictability and effective and meaningful collaboration and consultation so that government policy serves to boost confidence, promote investment and encourage employment. As part of the deregulation agenda, the government is overhauling the process for creating, implementing and reviewing new regulations. An important part of the government's agenda is the setting aside of two parliamentary sitting days for repealing legislation each year. This step will ensure that the parliament takes time each year to expressly consider the repeal of excessive, unnecessary or redundant legislation and any associated regulations. Consistent with the government's view that the FOFA amendments will address the significant, and unnecessarily costly, regulatory overreach imposed by the former government, it is appropriate that they be considered as part of this first formal repeals day. FOFA time line Not only have opponents of these changes argued that the government has significantly weakened consumer protections; but there have also been calls that the amendments have been developed with undue haste. It might therefore be interesting to note that these amendments were first identified by the coalition more than two years ago. In February 2012, coalition members recommended 16 changes to FOFA in their dissenting report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services' inquiry into the original FOFA bills. The coalition then re-affirmed its commitment to make these changes in its July 2013 pre-election Policy to Boost Productivity and Reduce Regulation. Since coming to power, the government has publicly canvassed these reforms on numerous occasions culminating in the announcement of the package by the Assistant Treasurer on 20 December 2013. Draft regulations and legislation were then released for consultation in January 2014 for a three-week period, supplemented by a series of meetings with stakeholders. Over 50 submissions to this latest consultation process were received from a range of stakeholders, including financial advisers, industry associations, consumer advocacy groups, training and consultant businesses, academics, law firms and individuals. Key amendments As I noted earlier, the government's changes to FOFA will reduce unnecessary regulatory burden on business and make advice more affordable without weakening consumer protections. I wanted to briefly discuss several of the key changes being made by the government. Best interests duty One change which has attracted substantial attention is the amendment to the best interests duty. Under the current law, advisers must satisfy seven steps in order to meet the best interests duty. The seventh step requires advisers to take any other step which would reasonably be regarded as being in the client's best interests. This step is also known as the 'catch-all' provision. Industry has told us that the catch-all provision is unworkable as it creates uncertainty for advisers on how they can satisfy their best interests duty. This bill seeks to remove this uncertainty from the law. Let me be clear: this bill does not remove the requirement for advisers to act in the best interests of their clients. Without the catch-all provision, the best interests duty will continue to ensure that an adviser is taking the necessary steps to properly consider the client's circumstances, to conduct reasonable investigations into products that would meet the client's objectives and needs, and to exercise judgment in formulating the advice for their client. In addition, there are a number of other duties that an adviser must adhere to including that the advice is appropriate for the client and that the adviser must place their client's interests ahead of their own. Scaled advice Another important change to FOFA to support the delivery of affordable financial advice relates to better facilitating scaled advice. Scaled advice refers to the provision of advice which is limited in scope to some extent; for example, advice on superannuation products rather than on a holistic financial plan. We are told that the current legislation has resulted in increased costs and significant legal uncertainty for advisers, who do not feel that it truly allows them to provide scaled advice to their clients. At the moment, an adviser may still need to investigate all of the client's relevant financial circumstances, even when advice is sought on a specific issue. This bill will explicitly permit scaled advice. Advisers will be able to limit the scope of the advice to a particular area, as agreed with the client. This reform will facilitate the ability for advisers to provide low-cost advice services and enable more consumers to access advice. Importantly, the scaled advice provided on the specific topic must still have regard to the client's best interests and be appropriate for the client. Removal of the opt-in requirement FOFA currently requires all clients to renew their ongoing fee arrangement with their adviser every two years. This is known as the 'opt-in' requirement. The requirement to obtain a client's agreement at least every two years to continue an ongoing fee arrangement adds an unnecessary layer of red tape. This requirement offers very little consumer protection beyond that already afforded to clients and in any event, clients will still continue to have the ability to opt-out of their fee arrangements at any time. Removing the opt-in requirement is an important step in winding back some of the unnecessary regulatory burden imposed on industry by the former government. Fee Disclosure Statements Fee disclosure is another area where FOFA went too far. The government will remove the requirement to provide a yearly fee disclosure statement to clients who entered into their ongoing arrangement prior to 1 July 2013. The requirement to prepare a fee disclosure statement for pre-1 July 2013 clients is expensive given that the age of many legacy systems often requires advisers to manually collate and review data. Indeed, industry has estimated that it costs around twice as much to provide a fee disclosure statement to a pre-1 July 2013 client as it costs to provide one for a new client. In removing this costly obligation, the government notes that these clients will continue to receive disclosure statements directly from superannuation trustees and product manufacturers that identify the fees paid to an adviser. Of course, today's computer systems are specifically developed to prepare fee disclosure statements and can do so cost-effectively. As such, industry will continue to be required to provide post-1 July 2013 clients with a fee disclosure statement. Over time, an increasing portion of clients will receive a fee disclosure statement. General advice The current ban on conflicted remuneration captures a far wider range of circumstances than was originally intended, and has resulted in significant compliance costs for industry. For example, the ban captures employees involved in preparing and providing general advice (such as website designers or general information seminar providers) who are not in a product sales related area. The government initially proposed to exempt all general advice from the ban on conflicted remuneration. During the consultation process on the draft legislation, stakeholders raised concerns that consumers may not appreciate the difference between general and personal advice and that a broad exemption may create opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. The government has listened to these concerns. The bill limits the general advice exemption to employees only and under circumstances in which they have not provided personal advice to the client in the preceding 12-month period. In addition ASIC has indicated that it will monitor the use of these provisions as they relate to general advice on complex products and will provide a report to the government in the next 12 to 18 months. Life risk insurance The last change I wanted to canvass today relates to life risk insurance arrangements. This is another area in which the coalition government has responded to stakeholder feedback. Through consultation on the proposed amendments and broader industry engagement, the government became aware that, while the industry as a whole is well capitalised and profitable, certain business lines within the industry are currently facing a number of challenges, which is raising concerns about the sustainability of some existing industry practices. In light of these concerns, the government will undertake a separate process to engage with the life insurance industry on a broad range of issues affecting the sector. In order to ensure that the industry's regulatory environment is not subject to further change while this process is underway, the government does not propose to progress any legislative amendments in this space at this time. Associated Regulations The government has signalled that it will implement the time sensitive measures contained in this bill through regulations to the extent legally possible. The interim regulations (those made redundant by the legislative amendments) will be repealed following passage of the legislative amendments. By adopting this approach, the government will provide certainty for all stakeholders on the timing of these amendments, thereby reducing regulatory costs and encouraging more affordable financial advice. Consultation I talked earlier about the extensive consultation undertaken by the coalition in the development of these amendments. Whether it was through the initial deliberations of the parliamentary joint committee inquiry in 2009, the debate on the original FOFA bills in 2012, the release of the coalition's policy to boost productivity and reduce regulation in July 2013 prior to the election or the more recent consultation on the draft amendments, the government appreciates the input of all stakeholders. The views received by all stakeholders have informed and shaped the final form of this bill. I would like to thank all stakeholders for their valuable contribution into this process. Conclusion The bill fulfils the government's election commitment to unwind the regulatory overreach created by the FOFA legislation and provides certainty to the financial services industry. This is just one of many steps the government is taking to repeal and amend costly and excessive regulations which are crippling Australian business. In addition to listening to industry criticisms about regulatory costs and uncertainty with the current FOFA legislation, the government has also heard and addressed concerns raised by consumer advocates. Advice will continue to be in the best interests of the client, conflicted remuneration structures that have the ability to influence advice will continue to be banned and consumers will continue to have access to high quality financial advice. At the same time, unnecessary red tape which only serves to increase the costs faced by consumers will be removed. I commend this bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Removing Reapproval and Re-registration) Bill 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Joyce. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Nationals) (10:19): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Australia currently has around 11,700 separate agricultural chemicals and veterinary medicines (agvet chemicals) registered with the Australian Pesticide and Veterinary Medicines Authority, also known as the APVMA. Each of these products contains one or more of only 782 active constituents. Agvet chemicals protect crops and animals from pests and diseases and so help improve the productivity and competitiveness of Australia's rural industries. Agvet chemicals help to ensure the quality and safety of food production while protecting human and animal health and the environment. They are essential tools for managing weeds, vital to keep our pets healthy, and a necessary part of our indoor and outdoor lifestyle and looking after stock. Australia's gross value of farm production is worth an estimated $47.9 billion a year with an export value of farm commodities of around $38 billion. The agvet chemicals industry is vital to quality food and fibre production and makes essential tools for primary producers. The crop protection industry body CropLife Australia estimates in a recent report that: $17.6 billion of Australian agriculture output is attributable to the use of [crop protection products], or 68 per cent of the total value of crop production. This bill aims to reduce the unnecessary regulatory burden on this industry resulting in reduced costs to that industry that will eventually flow on to benefit primary producers. This may also lead to greater investment in newer, safer innovative products for the future. An efficient regulator is important to ensure timely and cost-effective registration of new chemistries and review of emerging risks in registered chemicals and to provide the best possible environment for companies to register products in Australia. The Australian government has committed to: easing the burden imposed on the Australian economy and agricultural sector by reducing red and green tape on business by at least $1 billion per year. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Removing Re-approval and Re-registration) Bill 2014 contributes to this commitment by implementing the government's election commitment to remove the requirement for agvet chemicals to be reregistered. The bill builds on earlier progress that has already been made through the National Registration Scheme, a partnership between the Commonwealth and all the states and",33,Bills
28,Mr Joyce (New England,"Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of Theterritories, and on elements of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Act 2013 (Amendment Act). These changes will improve the effectiveness of the regulatory system and reduce inefficiency at the APVMA while continuing to protect human and animal health and safety and protect the environment. This bill proposes amendments principally to the Agvet code-the schedule to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994. The bill also proposes amendments to the previous government's amendment act. This bill is divided into two schedules, both commencing immediately after schedule 1 to the amendment act -effective on 1 July 2014. Removing re-approval and re-registration Schedule1 implements the election commitment to remove re-registration. That schedule prevents the expiry of active constituent approvals and prevents the application of dates after which a registration cannot be renewed. Active constituent approvals are to continue in force so long as they are not cancelled. In the same way a person obtains a car drivers licence that then is subject to periodic renewal, under the new legislation agvet chemical registrations continue in force subject to periodic renewal. Schedule1 also removes provision for applications to be made to re-approve active constituents or re-register chemical products. Schedule1 further reduces red tape by allowing for less frequent renewal of registrations. The current process is for the renewal of registrations to occur annually. Again like your car licence, instead of an annual renewal, these amendments will allow longer time frames for renewal. The regulations will set the period, which could be up to seven years. Less frequent renewals will mean less red tape and less cost to business. Addressing concerns with chemical product quality To give the opportunity for the APVMA to confirm that chemical products supplied to the market are the same as the product evaluated and registered by the APVMA this bill includes amendments that improve the ability of the APVMA to require a person who supplies an agvet chemical product in Australia to provide information (for example, a chemical analysis) about the product they are supplying. The bill would provide that the APVMA may, by written notice, require a person to provide information about substances supplied or intended for supply as a chemical product (or an active constituent for a chemical product) if they have, will have, or have had possession of the substance. The information that may be required includes details of the composition of the substance, manufacturing details, packaging, labelling and advertising information and about conformance of the substance with any relevant standard. The APVMA is to be able to require a chemical analysis of the product and for the results of the analysis to be provided to the APVMA. The power is to apply only if the APVMA considers the information is necessary to protect human, animal and environmental health and safety or protect trade. Used appropriately, the power will improve community confidence that the APVMA is effectively managing risks to human, animal and environmental safety and to trade. Reducing red-tape by allowing for simpler variations to approvals and registrations The bill proposes to streamline simple variations to an approval, registration or label. For the simplest variations, schedule 2 of the bill provides that the APVMA will have to make the variation at the time the holder of registration or approval notifies the APVMA of the change. For some less simple variations, the APVMA will have to make the variation after a fixed period if it is a prescribed variation. Without these amendments to the code, the APVMA would have to complete a more onerous technical assessment of these variations with no benefit to improved chemical safety. This is another sensible reduction in red tape that makes the regulator more user-friendly without impacting health or safety. Obliging access to information about chemicals that the APVMA holds Currently, the APVMA is often asked to provide information to the company that is responsible for a chemical product about its registrations. This information is then provided under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act). Payments for information sought under the FOI Act are not covering the costs of providing the information. As a result, companies that do keep good records are subsidising the records costs of those that do not. The bill amendments will allow persons to apply to the APVMA for copies of documents it holds about a chemical for a fee. This provision will not allow release of confidential commercial information unless the recipient was entitled to the information. For example, because they were the person that provided the information. Schedule2 of the bill proposes to 'turn off' access under the FOI Act for these documents but will not prevent access to the information. The FOI Act anticipates this by allowing an exemption for access to documents (at paragraph 12(1) (b) of the FOI Act) that is open to public access in accordance with another enactment, where that access is subject to a fee or other charge. Other amendments consequential to existing reforms In preparing for implementation of the amendment act, the Department of Agriculture and the APVMA found further minor improvements that could be made. Several small technical amendments are added to the agvet code to improve the readability of the legislation and reduce the possibility of difficulties in implementing it. The bill also includes appropriate transitional measures to allow processing to continue for those products currently registered in the APVMA system. Conclusion The Australian government is implementing reforms to the regulation of agvet chemicals for the benefit of the community, manufacturers, importers, wholesalers, retailers and users of agvet chemicals. These reforms aim to reduce red tape for farmers and other businesses and encourage the development of new chemistry with a range of benefits for farmers and other users, the environment and the community. Overall, the bill will increase the efficiency of the regulator and provide greater clarity to stakeholders on the intent of the legislation. The measures in the bill are a good start towards easing the burden imposed on the Australian economy and agricultural sector by reducing red and green tape on business. The government will continue to work with industry to implement further improvements through legislation and administrative change. It is with great pleasure that I introduce this bill to make this important reform a reality. Debate adjourned. Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Pyne. Bill read a first time. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. Employers operating in multiple states deal with different workers' compensation schemes and work health and safety regulations in each jurisdiction around Australia. This increases red tape for employers and is confusing for workers who are subject to different regulation and benefits depending on which state or territory they are employed in. While in the past, certain private sector corporations have been able to self-insure for workers' compensation coverage through the Commonwealth's Comcare scheme, a moratorium on new corporations entering the Comcare scheme was imposed in 2007 by the former Labor government. This was despite evidence from the 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry into the National workers' compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks which found that the cost for multistate employers of complying with multiple state workers' compensation arrangements was considerable. Those costs could have been used more effectively to create new jobs and improve the safety standards within the enterprise. The Howard government responded to the Productivity Commission inquiry recommendations by allowing eligible private corporations that operated in multiple states to apply for a self-insurance license with the Comcare scheme. There are currently 30 licenced corporations who are benefiting from the reduced red tape and cost by having one set of workers' compensation arrangements for their national workforce. Ten of these are current or former Commonwealth authorities such as Australia Post and Telstra. The remaining 20 are private corporations such as Optus, TNT, the National Australia Bank and John Holland Corporation. The work health and safety performance of these companies since joining the Comcare scheme has been strong and in most cases has been better than it was under multiple state schemes. These companies have the benefit of significantly reduced red tape, cost and bureaucracy that frees them up to work more effectively with their employees to improve work health and safety in their organisations. Following a campaign from the union bosses, the previous Labor government banned multistate companies from joining the Comcare scheme. Labor refused to lift the ban despite a 2012 review of the Comcare scheme commissioned by Labor and led by Dr Allan Hawke AC, which recommended lifting the moratorium preventing multistate employers from joining the Comcare scheme, finding the requirement to insure in multiple states and",39,Bills
29,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (10:29): I move:territories to be inefficient and costly. The Leader of the Opposition sat on his hands and did not enact any recommendations of the report as workplace relations minister. On2 December 2013, the coalition government lifted the moratorium so that multistate employers, which meet rigorous financial and governance criteria and demonstrate suitable work health and safety performance, can apply for a license to self-insure in the Comcare scheme, rather than through multiple schemes. It is the government's intention to also allow the multistate employers, who choose to apply to self-insure for workers' compensation arrangements with Comcare, to also have one set of work, health and safety regulation rather than be subject to multiple state requirements and regulators. This bill seeks to amend the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (the SRC Act) and the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 to expand the eligibility of corporations to self-insure through the Commonwealth's Comcare scheme. The amendments:  remove the need for the minister to declare eligibility to apply for a self-insurance licence while maintaining the ability for the minister to issue directions to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. This will streamline the current two-stage approval process;  remove the out-dated requirement that a corporation must be in competition with a Commonwealth authority, or former Commonwealth authority, to enter the Comcare scheme; and  broaden the range of corporations that are eligible for a licence to self-insure under the Comcare scheme to 'national employers' defined as an employer that is required to meet workers' compensation obligations under the laws of two or more states or territories. This approach will reduce red tape while ensuring a strong and robust approval process by the independent Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. These important productivity reforms are critical for multistate employers. They will give these employers the option of continuing to operate under multilayered worker's compensation and work health and safety regimes, or to apply to have one set of national arrangements. It is anticipated that the reduction in red tape and significant savings that could be realised for business could be spent on creating jobs and reinvesting in the economy. Group licences Currently, corporations applying to be covered under the Comcare scheme must be assessed individually for eligibility. A feature that business has been seeking for some time is the introduction of group licences to the SRC Act. The bill provides for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to grant a licence to an eligible group of corporations that are owned by the same holding company, in line with the state schemes and the commercial reality of modern multicompany corporate structures. Introduction of group licences will reduce red tape and costs for corporations as it recognises that groups of interrelated corporations often share return-to-work and work health and safety systems within the group. It will also recognise that each entity that forms part of a group does not individually need to meet the definition of a national employer. This reform will be better for businesses, better for workers and better for the economy. Serious and wilful misconduct Currently under the SRC Act, workers' compensation can be claimed by a worker who is injured while involved in payable employment where an injury caused by the serious and wilful misconduct of the employee results in death or serious and permanent impairment. The bill removes access to compensation where any injury sustained by an employee is caused by their own serious and wilful misconduct. While claims in this category are rare, the Australian public rightly expects that employees should take personal responsibility for their actions. The government believes that the workers' compensation scheme should be geared towards people acting in a proper and safe manner and not include a safety net for people who break the rules and put at risk not just themselves but other employees as well. Offsite recess breaks Currently workers' compensation is payable for injuries that occur during recess breaks, even if the employee is not at the place of work when the injury occurs, contrary to the position in South Australia and Tasmania. The SRC Act as originally drafted provided compensation coverage for employees who were injured while absent from their place of work during an ordinary recess. This provision was removed by the coalition government in 2007, and then reintroduced by the Labor government in 2011. The effect of the previous government's change to the act is that workers' compensation could be payable, for example, where an employee sustains an injury while shopping, at a restaurant or playing sport away from the employee's place of employment during a lunch break. This is despite the employer having no control over the activities of the employee or the environment in which the employee engages in such activities. The proper avenue for people to seek recompense for injuries under such circumstances is through the owner of the premises where an injury occurred, not through their employer who has no control over the matter. This bill addresses this unfair arrangement. Workers who are injured at work, even while having a recess or lunch break, will remain fully covered. Injuries that occur while the worker is away from the workplace undertaking activities associated with the employee's employment or at the request or direction of the employer will also still be covered. Conclusion This bill will reduce red tape and help to build a stronger and more prosperous economy. The real savings to business that will be realised under this bill can be reinvested in jobs and in the economy. I recommend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Classification Tools and Other Measures) Bill 2014 First Reading Bill-by leave-and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Keenan. Bill read a first time. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. The classification regime in Australia is complex. The current National Classification Scheme has been in place since 1996 and technology and the sheer volume of content have evolved considerably since then. The current scheme is difficult for the community to understand and even more difficult for industry to comply with. This bill introduces changes which will provide consumers with more classification information and simplify the scheme by removing complexity and reducing costs for business. The National Classification Scheme (NCS) is a cooperative scheme under which the Classification Board classifies films, computer games and certain publications. The scheme is designed to provide consumers with information about publications, films and computer games to allow them to make informed decisions about appropriate entertainment material. It is based on the principle that adults should be able to read, hear, see and play what they want while recognising that minors should be protected from material likely to harm them and that everyone should be protected from unsolicited offensive material. Procedures for the classification of publications, films and computer games are set out in the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. States and territories are responsible for the enforcement of classification decisions and provisions regulating the sale, demonstration and advertising of this material are contained in state and territory legislation. Apart from the introduction of an R18+ classification for computer games, the National Classification Scheme has not had any significant changes made to it since it was established in 1996. Yet, since its introduction, classifiable content and the way in which it is delivered to consumers has changed dramatically. For example, consumers now have ready access to classifiable content on a variety of platforms, such as the delivery of computer games on mobile and other online devices. Given these developments in technology, media convergence and the global availability of media content, the National Classification Scheme was reviewed by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) in 2011. The commission handed down its report in March 2012 and made 57 recommendations for fundamental changes to the regulatory framework and structure of the scheme. Reform of the scheme is being approached in stages, commencing with a 'first tranche' of reforms that was agreed by classification ministers at a meeting of the Standing Council on Law and Justice. The first phase of agreed reforms includes:",42,Bills
30,Mr Keenan (Stirling,"Minister for Justice) (10:38): I move: broadening the scope of existing exempt film categories and streamlining exemption arrangements for festivals and cultural institutions;  enabling certain content to be classified using classification tools (such as online questionnaires that deliver automated decisions);  creating an explicit requirement in the Commonwealth classification act to display classification markings on all classified content;  expanding the exemptions to the modification rules so that films and computer games which are subject to certain types of modifications do not require classification again; and  enabling the Attorney-General's Department to notify law enforcement authorities of potential Refused Classification content without having the content classified first, to help expedite the removal of extremely offensive or illegal content from distribution. These reforms will deliver benefits to industry including streamlining administrative processes and reducing the regulatory burden whilst ensuring that consumers continue to receive useful and accurate classification information. Several of these reforms are particularly significant. The first significant reform is the introduction of classification tools. Classification tools, such as online questionnaires, might be developed by government, industry or other classification bodies overseas. These tools represent an effective and efficient way to classify the significant volume of unclassified online and mobile computer games that is available in the market today. Currently, the Classification Board does not have the capacity to classify the vast amount of content that is available on mobile devices and online. As an example, last year the Classification Board made over 6,000 classification decisions across all forms of content. However, the digital market offers hundreds of thousands of computer games to consumerswhich presents significant practical, logistical and compliance challenges for the current National Classification Scheme. This reform will facilitate innovative and technology-based solutions for classification in line with initiatives being considered elsewhere by classification bodies that are dealing with the same classification difficulties. Enabling the use of such instruments will support and complement the work of the Classification Board, provide certainty to industry and increase compliance with Australian classification laws. Most importantly, this reform will mean that the Australian public will have access to more classification information than is possible under the current system. There are a number of safeguards built into this reform. For example, a classification tool can only be implemented following its approval by the minister. In deciding whether to approve a particular tool, the minister will consider a range of matters, including whether it delivers decisions that are consistent with Australian classification requirements. The bill also provides the Classification Board with the opportunity to classify content, even after it has been classified by an approved tool, if it considers that the decision is problematic. As a final protection, if there are concerns about the effectiveness of a classification tool, its approval may be suspended or revoked at any time. Another important 'first tranche' reform includes changes to the current modification rules. This will reduce the regulatory and financial burden on industry, the theme of today's bills, by removing the need to have classified content classified again when certain modifications are made to the content, providing that the modification does not affect the original classification For example, currently 2D and 3D versions of the same film must be classified separately, incurring two classification fees, because the format change is considered to be a modification. It will no longer be necessary for both 2D and 3D versions to be classified where the only difference is the changed format. In these instances both films must carry the classification marking assigned to the original film classified by the board. Existing safeguards, such as the Classification Board director's power to call in content, will remain in place. This means that the director may call in content to be classified by the board where a modification has changed a product to the extent that it would likely change the classification, and the product is therefore unclassified. The third key reform will expand the definition and scope of exempt film categories and streamline exemption arrangements for festivals, special event operators and cultural institutions. Many of the existing exempt film categories currently state that a film must 'wholly comprise' particular content in order for it to be exempt from classification requirements. These categories have been expanded to include films that 'mainly comprise' particular content-similar to the New Zealand exempt film categories. Two new exempt film categories have also been added. Broadening the scope of existing exempt film categories to better reflect contemporary film content will improve the utility of these exemptions by accommodating a range of documentary-style content that it is appropriate to exempt. The reforms will also simplify exemption arrangements for festivals by establishing a consolidated set of rules in the Commonwealth Classification Act-replacing the convoluted and inconsistent provisions that are currently set out in each state and territory's classification regime. Most importantly, the reforms will rationalise the administrative and regulatory requirements for festivals and cultural institutions by removing the mandatory requirement to apply to the director of the Classification Board for formal exemption. Instead, exemptions will continue to be available to support the arts and cultural sector but on a self-assessed, deregulated basis. Safeguards, similar to those currently in place for festivals, will ensure that the public is being protected-in particular, children. For example, exemption conditions will include restrictions on the screening, exhibition or demonstration of unclassified content to particular age groups if it is strong or high impact. It will require that patrons be provided with warnings about the content that they are about to see and prohibit content that is likely to be classified X 18+ or refused classification. Training and registration facilities will be established to support officers of the Classification Liaison Scheme, who will monitor the operation of the reformed arrangements as part of their routine compliance and educational activities. This bill also makes a number of minor and technical amendments to the classification act to improve the clarity of certain provisions, address legislative anomalies and enhance the administrative efficiency of the National Classification Scheme. For example, amendments will be made to the classification act to align the provisions relating to the Authorised Assessors Scheme for Computer Games with the provisions relating to: the Additional Content Assessor Scheme; the Authorised Television Assessor Scheme and the Authorised Advertising Assessor Scheme. These amendments will ensure that there is a consistent approach in the regulation of these assessor schemes. In addition, the bill makes several minor consequential amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. These reforms represent the first step towards modernising the classification scheme and demonstrate the government's commitment to a scheme that is better equipped to meet the needs of industry and consumers in the digital age. Consistent with the government's broader deregulation agenda, these reforms will help to ensure that our classification system continues to be effective, efficient and relevant in the 21st century. Debate adjourned. Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Repeal) (No. 1) Bill 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Andrews. Bill read a first time. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. This is the first of two bills to implement the government's election commitment to repeal the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. The commission is established under the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act 2012 and commenced operation on 3 December 2012 under legislation introduced by the previous government. An organisation must be registered as a charity by the commission before it can receive charity tax concessions and other Commonwealth exemptions and benefits from the Australian Taxation Office. However, the process has resulted in an increased red tape burden for many organisations. The commission was established with the intention of it being a single reporting point for charities. However, this has not eventuated-the majority of charities continue to provide information to multiple jurisdictions in the course of conducting their business as charities. Establishing the commission has introduced new powers in information collection, monitoring and compliance that are not available to Commonwealth bodies with comparable powers in relation to enforcement and removing responsible persons (such as the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority). The additional oversight and reporting burdens on the charitable sector are particularly onerous given the absence of harmonisation across all jurisdictions.",45,Bills
31,Mr Andrews (Menzies,"Minister for Social Services) (10:50): I move: The majority of the sector which are unincorporated organisations (approximately 21,000 of whom are registered charities) are now subject to this new regulatory regime, whereas they previously fell largely outside of the sector's regulatory framework.  The large number of incorporated associations (approximately 136,000, around 6,000 of which are charities) already regulated under relevant state and territory acts now have duplicated reporting requirements.  Charitable trusts, accountable to the state Attorneys-General, are now regulated at the Commonwealth level, with obligations or compliance activity they were not subject to previously. Given that the regulators in place before the commission was established can provide similar regulatory oversight at a lesser cost-both in terms of administrative costs to government and in terms of costs imposed on regulated entities-the introduction of a specialist regulator to monitor and enforce a codification of generally applicable laws has not proven to be the best use of Commonwealth funding. The government made a clear commitment during the recent election campaign to abolish the commission. With this bill, we are taking the first step towards implementing this election commitment-and we want to remove the regulatory impost on the sector as soon as possible, to ensure that organisations are not reporting unnecessarily. Repealing the commission will remove unnecessary regulatory control over the civil sector, and move instead towards Commonwealth support for the sector to self-manage. The repeal is consistent with the broader deregulation agenda to boost productivity by removing any excessive, unnecessary and overly complex red and green tape imposed on business, community organisations and individuals. Vesting powers in a separate entity to oversee and regulate charities runs counter to the deregulation approach, which takes a risk-based approach to oversight of the institutions of civil society, whether they are for-profit or not-for-profit. This bill will repeal the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act 2012, thereby abolishing the commission. However, this bill will not take effect until the enactment of a later bill, which will provide the details of the arrangements replacing the commission. This two-stage approach allows the government to affirm its intention to repeal the commission, while working through the legislative and administrative issues involved in winding down the commission's operations and establishing the National Centre for Excellence for civil society. This bill allows the minister to determine, by legislative instrument, a successor agency to deal with certain transitional matters. The bill will provide transitional arrangements for matters such as transferring to the successor agency records held by the commission, any outstanding Ombudsman investigations, and annual reporting requirements. There will be continued protection for information disclosed for the purposes of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act 2012. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Paid Parental Leave Amendment Bill 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Billson. Bill read a first time. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. This bill will implement the government's commitment, foreshadowed during the 2013 election campaign, to reduce the red tape burden and compliance costs on business by ensuring that they are not required to be the paymaster for the government's paid parental leave scheme. To ease this burden, the paid parental leave legislation will be amended to remove the mandatory requirement for employers to administer government-funded parental leave pay to their eligible long-term employees. From1 July 2014, employees will be paid directly by the Department of Human Services, unless an employer opts in to provide parental leave pay to its employees and an employee agrees for their employer to pay them. Importantly, this measure will generate a significant compliance cost saving for Australian businesses, especially small businesses. Small businesses are particularly impacted by regulations, as they often do not have the resources or specialised staff to deal with compliance requirements. It is estimated that the average annual reduction in compliance costs on business will be $44 million, strongly delivering on the government's commitment to reduce red tape on businesses. This measure put forward by the government is strongly supported by the business community. In a member survey conducted by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in May 2013, 84.3 per cent of businesses agreed or strongly agreed that the government should not require employers to be paymasters for the Paid Parental Leave scheme. The government is committed to continuing to reduce red tape burdens for business, including new and established businesses, as a critical step towards improving Australia's productivity-unnecessary red tape hinders innovation, investment and job creation. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Baldwin. Bill read a first time.",48,Bills
32,Mr Billson (Dunkley,"Minister for Small Business) (10:56): I move:Second ReadingI move: That this bill be now read a second time. The continuing success of the Australian economy depends to a large extent on our ability to innovate, adopt new technologies and capitalise on new markets. The intellectual property system is crucial to this success because it encourages invention and investment and provides business and consumers with access to valuable new technologies, products and services. This government is determined to reduce the regulatory burden on business that is holding back Australia's economic prosperity and development. Therefore, the intellectual property system needs to fulfil its important role in the most efficient way possible and lower red-tape costs for businesses. The intellectual property system must also enable Australia to be a good global citizen and help less fortunate countries to access vital technologies essential to their health and well-being. The Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 2014 contains a package of measures, many of which will reduce red tape for those wishing to obtain or enforce their intellectual property rights and will provide more support for other countries facing health emergencies. Firstly, schedules 1 and 2 to the bill amend the Patents Act to implement the protocol amending the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, also known as the TRIPS protocol. The Howard government accepted the The TRIPS protocol helps developing countries that are suffering health crises, such as malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, to obtain essential medicines from other countries at affordable prices. Millions of people die from such diseases every year. At present, elements of our patent system can make it harder for Australian business to provide assistance to such countries. To address this, the bill will enable Australian pharmaceutical manufacturers to obtain a licence from the Federal Court to make generic versions of patented medicines and to export these medicines to countries with a demonstrated need. The scheme will ensure that patents can only be used under strict conditions and that patent owners are fairly compensated. The scheme is also designed to be as easy to use as possible, while ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place and consistency with Australia's broader international obligations. Secondly, schedule 3 to the bill will make amendments to the Plant Breeder's Rights Act to extend the jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit Court to include plant breeders' rights. Plant varieties are very important to the success of the Australian agricultural industry. Plant breeders' rights encourage breeders-many of whom are small businesses-to invest in developing new, improved varieties.",50,Bills
33,Mr Baldwin (Paterson,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry) (10:59):At present, breeders can only enforce their rights against alleged infringers by commencing proceedings in the Federal Court. This can be a very expensive path. The bill will give plant breeders the option of using the faster, more cost-effective and more accessible Federal Circuit Court for less complex matters. Thirdly, schedule 4 to the bill allows for a single patent application and examination process for Australia and New Zealand; and a single trans-Tasman patent attorney regime. These measures build on the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations free trade agreement by further integrating trans-Tasman regulation. At present, most patent applications filed in New Zealand are also filed in Australia, but undergo separate examination processes in each country. In what I understand to be a world first, the bill allows patent applications for the same invention to be examined by a single examiner in either country. The regime will take account of differences in national laws and will result in two separate patents for Australia and New Zealand. A single, more efficient patent application process will remove duplication and make it easier for businesses to protect their intellectual property in both countries. This has the potential to save Australian business and exporters thousands of dollars in professional advice costs. To support this change, the bill will allow for an address for service of documents, which is required when parties wish to challenge patents in the relevant courts, to be in either Australia or New Zealand. It will also move the rules relating to addresses for service to the regulations. These amendments will not change in any way the existing requirement of a physical address for the service of documents. The bill will also introduce a single trans-Tasman regulatory framework for Australian and New Zealand patent attorneys. As the majority of Australian and New Zealand patent attorneys are registered in both countries, a single regulatory body will remove barriers, encourage competition and save time and money for the profession. The framework will include a single register of patent attorneys, a single IP attorneys board and a single IP attorneys disciplinary tribunal. The Australian government has worked closely with New Zealand to establish this framework. This is a small but significant step forward for our economic relationship with an important trading partner and the creation of a seamless trans-Tasman business environment. I thank the New Zealand government for its cooperation in this endeavour. Finally, schedule 5 makes a number of minor administrative changes to the patents, trade marks and the designs acts. These changes will repeal unnecessary provisions that require the government to keep intellectual property documents for longer than they are needed. This will remove unnecessary red tape and help to reduce the government's warehousing costs. The bill also makes a number of technical corrections to the legislation. In summary, this bill makes a number of important improvements to Australia's intellectual property system to streamline the processes, to reduce the barriers and regulatory costs for Australian businesses. I note that, when in government, the opposition supported the progression of these matters. Therefore, I look forward to the opposition's support for this bill. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Repeal Bill 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Frydenberg. Bill read a first time. Second ReadingI move: That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to repeal the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act 2010 and to abolish the Office of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. This is part of the government's strong commitment to reduce bureaucracy and streamline government. The government is working to remove, as far as possible, duplication of responsibilities across Commonwealth agencies and between different levels of government. The government remains firmly in support of independent oversight of counter-terrorism and national security legislation, however, multiple independent oversight mechanisms already exist which perform this role. These include the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, the joint parliamentary committees on law enforcement and intelligence and security, and the parliament itself. The executive also has powers to appoint ad hoc reviews. The position of the monitor was created in 2010 and Mr Bret Walker SC was appointed the first monitor on 21 April 2011. He has published three annual reports, which were tabled in parliament on 19 March 2012, 14 May 2013, and 12 December 2013, and is proposing to publish another report before his term expires on 20 April 2014. Together these four reports are expected to cover the extensive list of key issues in Australian national security laws that the monitor indicated in his first annual report would be considered and reviewed during his term. The end of the monitor's term brings to an end this thorough review and the government would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Bret Walker SC for his service. The government considers the best way forward is to work through the large number of recommendations made by the monitor and to continue engaging with the extensive range of existing independent oversight bodies. The Attorney-General's Department leads the development of the government's response and ensures a coordinated response to overlapping recommendations of the COAG Review of Counter-Terrorism Legislation.",51,Trips Protocol In 2007 And Its Implementation In Australia Is Well Overdue
34,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:07):A number of counter-terrorism provisions will sunset in 2015 and 2016, which will also provide further opportunities for review of the relevant provisions. Together, there has been, and will remain, a comprehensive body of independent reviews of the government's counter-terrorism and national security legislation. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Personal Property Securities Amendment (Deregulatory Measures) Bill 2014 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Frydenberg. Bill read a first time. Second ReadingI move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Personal Property Securities Amendment (Deregulatory Measures) Bill 2014 aims to continue the reforms of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 while decreasing the administrative burden the PPS regime places on Australian businesses. The Personal Property Securities Act was introduced with bipartisan support in 2009. A main reform of the PPS Act was that it established the Personal Property Securities Register and introduced a single national system for the creation, registration, priority and enforcement of security interests in personal property. This regime fundamentally altered the way in which businesses, especially small businesses, are able to borrow, while providing greater confidence to lenders and securing their interests. The PPS regime replaced 23 state, territory and Commonwealth property and securities registers and over 70 pieces of supporting legislation. This alone involved the migration of 4.7 million registrations to the new, national Personal Property Securities Register. However, reform on this scale is not without its challenges. As with all reforms of this scale, ongoing assessment and adjustment where necessary is important to ensure that the PPS system meet the needs of all Australian businesses. In consultation with Australian businesses and particularly the hire and rental industry it was clear that although the PPS Act was a significant initiative it has created several issues including a significant administrative burden and substantial compliance costs and needs to be reformed. This is why the government proposes to simplify the rules on when a lease will be deemed to be a security interest for the purpose of the PPS Act and to clarify the definition of a motor vehicle in the Personal Property Securities Regulations 2010. The PPS Act deemed certain arrangements to be security interests for the purpose of that act. This includes the lease of goods where the lease term is for more than 12 months or an",53,Trips Protocol In 2007 And Its Implementation In Australia Is Well Overdue
35,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:10):indefinite term, and the lease of serial numbered goods (for example, motor vehicles) for 90 days or more. However, since the commencement of the act, it has become clear that the two deeming provisions can be a source of confusion and additional cost to business, as the lease of serial numbered goods can give rise to the need to make multiple registrations on the register in relation to the same lease. The bill will repeal the provision deeming leases of serial numbered goods of 90 days or more to be security interests for the purposes of the act. In addition to this amendment, the government will amend the PPS Regulations to clarify the definition of a motor vehicle. The current definition of a motor vehicle includes an item capable of travelling at speeds of at least 10 kilometres an hour or which has one or more motors with a total power greater than 200 watts. As a result it has become clear that some items have been captured by this definition which would not, in an ordinary commercial sense, be considered to be motor vehicles. An example includes a vibrating plate, or wacker packer, as it may otherwise be known, that only travels at a speed of 0.5 kilometres per hour but which has a 3,700-watt motor and is therefore covered by the definition. This definition will be amended to provide that a motor vehicle will now be something capable of travelling at speeds of at least 10 kilometres per hour and which has one or more motors with a total power greater than 200 watts. Finally, the Attorney-General will announce the statutory review of the PPS Act to consider whether the entirety of that act creates an efficient and effective consolidation system governing personal property and securities ownership in Australia. The regulatory burden imposed on the industry by the PPS Act in its current form, is more than is necessary for the achievement of effective and certain secured lending against personal property in Australia and therefore this burden should be lifted. The Personal Property Securities Amendment (Deregulatory Measures) Bill 2014 and associated changes will provide relief to industries captured by the PPS Act and, in particular, the hire and rental industry, an important industry with a total turnover of around $6.6 billion, that employs over 18,000 Australians and provides essential support to the building and construction sectors. It is expected to reduce the number of registrations that may need to be made and save business over $11 million per annum, most of which will be to the benefit of small businesses. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights Report Committee on Human RightsI present the committee's fourth report of the 44th Parliament entitled Examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011; Bills introduced 3 to 6 March 2014; Legislative instruments received 22 to 28 February 2014.",54,Trips Protocol In 2007 And Its Implementation In Australia Is Well Overdue
36,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Werriwa) (11:16,"On behalf of the Parliamentary JointReport made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e). March and 49 legislative instruments received in the period 22 to 28 February The report also includes the committee's comments on 12 responses to matters raised in previous committee reports. The committee's function is to assess legislation for compatibility with the seven international human rights treaties to which Australia is a party. In broad terms, these treaties cover the range of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights expressed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its relatively brief existence, the committee has established a non-partisan and consensus-based approach to its work, and this approach is an appropriate foundation for the committee's mandate to report to both houses of the parliament on the compatibility of legislation with human rights. To do that, where legislation engages and would appear to limit human rights, the committee's assessment of its compatibility with relevant rights is based on three core questions These are: whether the limitation is aimed at achieving a legitimate objective, whether there is a rational connection between the limitation and that objective, and whether the limitation is proportionate to that objective. I know that members in this place will recognise that these core questions are-although perhaps not in the same terms-the same questions we are asked to consider when we come to this chamber to consider the necessity and merits of any legislation proposed or already in operation. The value of the committee's assessment of the compatibility of legislation with human rights is therefore its capacity to inform our consideration of both proposed and operating laws, and in that spirit I draw members' attention to the contents of the current report. Of the bills considered in this report, I note the following are scheduled for debate during this sitting period commencing 17 March 2014. They are the Farm Household Support Bill 2014 and a related consequential bill; the Quarantine Charges (Collection) Bill 2014 and three related bills; the Export Market Development Grants Bill 2014; and the Civil Aviation Amendment (CASA Board) Bill 2014. The committee also considered the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill 2014 which is currently before the Senate and was introduced to, and passed by, the House on 6 March 2014. Of the 49 instruments considered by the committee for this report, I am pleased to advise that none appear to raise any human rights concerns and all of them are accompanied by adequate statements of compatibility. However, the committee notes that a number of instruments exempt from disallowance under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 were not accompanied by a statement of compatibility. While such instruments are not required to be accompanied by such a statement under the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011, the committee is required to assess all legislative instruments for compatibility with human rights. The committee therefore regards the preparation of a statement of compatibility for exempt instruments as a best practice approach in support of the work of committee.",55,Committees
37,Mr Laurie Ferguson,"This report examines 17 bills introduced in the period 3 to 6In relation to responses to matters previously raised by the committee, the report contains consideration of 12 such ministerial responses. Of these, responses relating to one bill and one instrument have adequately addressed the committee's concerns, and the committee has concluded its interest in these matters. However, the committee retains concerns and has sought further information or the inclusion of safeguards in relation to three bills and seven instruments. This includes a package of amendments to various pieces of migration legislation. I note for the benefit of members that the committee will write again to the relevant ministers in relation to these matters. With these comments I commend the committee's fourth report of the 44th Parliament to the House. Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Membership from the chief government whip that he has nominated Mr Irons to be a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme in place of Mr Wyatt Roy. move: That Mr Wyatt Roy be discharged from the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme and that, in his place, Mr Irons be appointed a member of the committee. Question agreed to. Amendments to Standing Orders 131(b) and 207(b) That standing orders 131 paragraph (b) and 207 paragraph (b) be amended to read as follows: 131 Successive divisions (b) If there is a successive division, Members who wish to vote in the same way as in the previous division must remain seated until the result of the division is announced. The tellers shall take each Member’s vote as being the same as it was in the previous division unless a Member reports to them. A Member must report to the tellers if he or she: (i) wishes to vote differently to his or her vote in the previous division; or (ii) voted in the previous division and does not wish to vote in the current division; or (iii) did not vote in the previous division and wishes to vote in the current division. 207 Presenting a petition (b) A Member may present a petition during: (i) the period of Members’ statements in the House or in the Federation Chamber, in accordance with standing order 43; (ii) the period of Members’ constituency statements in the Federation Chamber, in accordance with standing order 193; (iii) adjournment debate in the House in accordance with standing order 31, and in the Federation Chamber in accordance with standing order 191; and (iv) grievance debate in accordance with standing order 192B.",56,Committees

40,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (11:21): I move:Briefly, these amendments are designed to smooth the running of the parliament. Because they relate to different aspects of the standing orders, they will be moved in three separate lots. I had placed different motions on the Notice Paper. Members will be well aware that in cases of successive divisions a significant amount of time is taken up in counting votes, even though in almost all cases the results are identical. This amendment substitutes the word 'take' for 'record' in standing order 131(b). It clarifies that the tellers should consider votes in such divisions to be identical to the preceding vote unless members have reported to the tellers. It will decrease the amount of time spent on counting divisions, meaning that there will be more time for debate in the chamber. This also includes a consequential amendment to standing order 207. Members will recall that I recently extended 90-second statements significantly, including in the Federation Chamber. There has been a large take-up of this and members have raised a variety of issues in 90-second statements. This amendment clarifies that petitions can be presented during 90second statements in the Federation Chamber as well as in the House. Question agreed to. Amendment to Standing Order1 That standing order 1 be amended to read as follows: 1 Maximum speaking times (addition to existing subjects, as follows) Suspension of standing or other orders on notice relating to the programming of government business Whole debate 25 mins Mover 15 mins Member next speaking 10 mins Any other Member5 mins (standing order 47) This amendment to standing order 1-maximum speaking times, creates programming of government business as a type of motion. To ensure the smooth running of the House and timely passage of the government's agenda it has often been necessary to limit debate on certain legislation. Both governments, Labor and coalition, have done this over many years. Where possible, of course, it is my preference to use debate management motions to do this rather than the guillotine. This means that members on both sides are aware that debate will be limited in advance of it happening. This amendment creates debate management motions as a type of motion and limits debate on that to 25 minutes in total, with 15 minutes for the mover, 10 minutes for the member next speaking and five minutes for any other member. It is very similar to the suspension of standing orders provisions that currently exist. This limits the time taken in the House on such debate management routine motions to ensure that the limited government business time is taken up with debate about the content of legislation, not just debating how such legislation will be debated. To explain this in layman's terms: currently a debate management motion needs to be moved in the House as a suspension of standing orders, debate is held about that and then the",57,Motions
41,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (11:23): I move:debate is held about the debate management motion, which is an open-ended debate and can obviously take a substantial amount of time. This motion will allow the debate management motion to be treated as though it were a suspension of standing orders in itself. There will be a 25-minute debate, the House will decide whether it supports it and then the debate on legislation will ensue as prescribed by the debate management motion. Question agreed to. Amendment to Standing Order 131(a) That standing order 131(a) be amended to read as follows: 131 Successive divisions (a) If a division is called no more than three minutes following a division, the Speaker shall appoint tellers immediately and the bells shall be rung for one minute. Members will note that there is a lack of clarity existing surrounding successive divisions where the bells are rung for only one minute. This motion is my favourite of the day, Madam Speaker. Generally all members are in the chamber anyway and the ringing of the bells for four minutes unnecessarily delays all members. Currently the standing orders specify that the bells may be rung for one minute unless there is 'intervening debate'. This term is not defined and it is not often clear if a four-minute or a one-minute division is required. This amendment places a time limit on successive divisions. If another division is called three minutes after a division or less, the bells will be rung for only one minute. I chose three minutes as a compromise to ensure that proceedings would move rapidly whilst preventing members who have left the chamber from getting too far away. Hopefully, this will speed up successive divisions and enable us to get back to the business of debating legislation. To sum up: not much will change in terms of the period when oppositions are calling many divisions, so people probably will not leave the chamber. This will simply take out the 'intervening debate' provision that requires the bells to be rung for four minutes every time there is intervening debate. In effect, most people will still be in the chamber and will not have returned to their offices. I think it will work much better and still allow the opposition to make their point, which they should, about government policy or the government's agenda that they do not support while not delaying us in the House for four minutes while the bells are being rung when we are already all here. I think this is a very practical change. It is probably one that should have been made a very long time ago. Happily, we are making it today. I thank the opposition, who have supported all of these measures, in a very cooperative and sensible way. I think they recognise that it does not reduce their capacity to hold the government to account but at the same time it is a common-sense approach to these proceedings. Question agreed to. Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion:",58,Motions
42,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (11:25): I move:That this bill be now read a second time. Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014, what is most important to Tasmania is Bass Strait. It is a critical link to the mainland and it is a critical link currently to international shipping services, which in the last five years have been absolutely decimated. In fact, they have been removed completely. One of the reasons for that is the cabotage arrangements that were in place by the previous federal government. I welcome wholeheartedly the comments made by the Prime Minister in this place this morning in announcing the repeal day next Wednesday and in relation to taking a serious look at the current cabotage provisions. This has hurt my state enormously, more than any other place in Australia. A regional community that depends on shipping to move goods on and off the island has been hurt enormously. Unfortunately, the previous Minister for Infrastructure in my state, Minister O'Byrne, who was dealt a very harsh blow on the weekend and was not able to retain his seat of Franklin, spent three years doing nothing whilst exporters and businesses in my state were hurting. So anything we can do to support exporters is a good thing for my state. I echo the words of Sally Chandler, who has spent much of her life advocating on behalf of and working with exporters in my state as a consultant. Sally Chandler suggests anything that supports exporters is very much welcomed. As she also point out, the export industry is not for the faint-hearted. It does come with challenges. Those people who are prepared to look beyond our shores, to take our goods and services to foreign climes-it is not for the fainthearted and does involve risk. It involves risk every day, but their success ultimately becomes local success and ultimately their community's success. This is why exports are so important to our nation and to my state. Governments can provide their support by supporting the export industries in a number of practical and tangible ways. I referred earlier in my speech to the free trade agreement with South Korea that was recently signed by the Minister for Trade and Investment. This is indeed an enormous benefit to many businesses and service providers within this country. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014 also does that in a practical way; it is indeed welcome. It goes beyond the $50 million election commitment that we made. We are a government that will keep our promises, and this is another indication that we are doing exactly that. It is indeed welcomed. It also proposes increasing from seven to eight the maximum number of export market development grants that can be applied for by one organisation, business or individual. This is a very practical enhancement of the existing scheme. Having worked for many years with customers in Asia-Japan, China and South Korea-I know relationships are important and that building relationships is critical. Unless the price is wrong, business never occurs on the first, second or third instance. Often it takes repeated visits and it takes repeated efforts. This practical extension of the scheme from seven to eight potential grants is indeed welcome. Similarly, in terms of small businesses, reducing the threshold for eligible expenditure from $20,000 to $15,000 is indeed an enhancement that will help small business. It will help small business that is the backbone of our economy. It will help small business to be able to access these grants in a far more practical way. These are the people who fly economy; these are the people who do not spend their money on business class airfares. This practical reduction is another way that this bill will be an advantage to them. It reduces the current",59,Bills
43,Mr Hutchinson (Lyons) (11:28,"As I was saying yesterday evening on this Export$5,000 deduction from the applicant's provisional grants to $2,500, and it provides for quicker payments of the grants in years of low scheme demand or where additional funding has been provided. For an understanding of that, I would refer the House to explanatory item No. 7 within the notes attached to this piece of legislation. Where the department is quite aware of the fact that all of the money will be paid out in that particular year, it has the provision to be able to bring that balanced distribution date forward. This is a really big advantage for small business. This is about cash flow. This is a practical way to help businesses. These grants have been in place for 30 years, and, indeed, they are a practical way of supporting small businesses. They often are supporting businesses that are getting into this space, that are looking to expand their businesses beyond our shores into the export market. It is really about helping businesses that are helping themselves, and this is very much something that is dear to my heart and dear to my party's philosophy around how governments should support businesses. They can use these funds for attending international trade fairs, for marketing products overseas or to bring potential buyers to Australia to see their product in its own environment. Obviously, product origin of food is increasingly important, but I have seen it also in the field in which I worked for many years-that is, exporting wool products. WhilstI spent that time in the market talking to customers, more often than not when I got those customers to come back to Tasmania, it was the producers themselves who were very best salesmen. They were the people who got the deal over the line. These are people like Julian and Annabelle Von Bibra, Peter and Ann Downie, Julian Cotton from the east coast, Adam and Granyre Greenhill, Jon and Isabelle Atkinson, Will and Nina Bennett and Frank and Prue O’Connor from Avoca. Anyone who has been in business will know that if you do not have a marketing budget for international sales then you are way behind the eight ball. A diverse range of businesses in my electorate have benefited from this in the past 12 months. They include tourist businesses, agricultural businesses and pharmaceutical processing businesses such as TPI. Indeed, we are about to embark on another part of exporting our food produce. I am very excited and I know exporters within my state are celebrating the fact that we have a government in place that understands small business, that understands the importance of exports. I commend the bill to the House. Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014. This is a scheme that is widely supported and used by many businesses in the community that I represent in Kingsford Smith. It is a scheme that generally has good support and it is a scheme that provides opportunities in export markets, particularly for smallto medium-sized enterprises. The scheme was initiated in 1997 under the Howard government. It was supported by Labor whilst in office. In 2008, Labor introduced a number of reforms to the scheme. These have seen the reach and expanse of the scheme improved, and made it much more efficient and effective in supporting smallto medium-sized businesses in opening up new markets throughout the world. In 2013, Labor sought again to amend the scheme. Due to the proroguing of parliament, those measures were not put before the parliament, but it is pleasing to see that some of the measures detailed in the proposals at the time have been picked up in this legislation.",60,Bills
44,Mr Thistlethwaite (Kingsford Smith) (11:36,"I am pleased to speak on theHowever, there are others which were not picked up and we would encourage the government to have a look at those measures in the future. This scheme is administered by Austrade, a wonderful arm of government, which is doing great work internationally, supporting growth and development of export markets, particularly for Australian smallto medium-size businesses. I was recently speaking to a young entrepreneur in my community who had set up a business involved in the exchange of gold and silver. He was keen to open new endeavours in the Asian market, particularly in China, where the expanding middle-class is providing opportunities for services such as those his business is delivering. He told me that on the first occasion he went to China he basically cold-called other businesses. He went to many of the capital cities and sought to speak to the heads of various businesses to promote the work he was intending to do, but he did not get a very good reception. He had not done the necessary groundwork or made contacts to effectively convert his approaches into opportunities for his business. Before he went to China a second time, he went to Austrade. Austrade officials worked out the opportunities and assistance they could give him in Asia and, through their contacts in China, he had much greater success. As a result of Austrade's work, he converted some of those opportunities into solid business proposals and has created jobs here in Australia and in our community. That is the role Austrade should play and that is the role that export market development grants can play in assisting smallto medium-size businesses to open opportunities. The purpose of this bill is, firstly, to amend the Export Market Development Grants Act 1997 to increase the number of grants able to be received by an applicant from seven to eight, with no change to the rules for approved bodies and for approved joint ventures. Secondly, it is to reduce the minimum expenses threshold required to be incurred by an applicant from $20,000 to $15,000. Thirdly, it is to reduce the current $5,000 deduction from the applicant's provisional grant amount to $2,500. The final two elements are to prevent the payment of grants to applicants who EMDG consultants have assessed are not a fit and proper person under the act. The EMDG scheme has fit and proper person rules under section 87AA of the act to provide for the non-payment of a grant if the CEO of Austrade has formed an opinion that the person or an associate of the person is not fit and proper to receive a grant. This provision has been activated since 2004 and has generally worked well. However, under the current rules where an applicant engages an EMDG consultant to prepare a claim and the EMDG consultant is not a fit and proper person, the applicant is not subject to the provisions of 87AA, which obviously is an anomaly that needs to be fixed. This item extends the fit and proper person provisions of the EMDG Act to consultants who engage in false and misleading behaviour, or whose behaviour is considered to be inconsistent with accepted community standards of commercial and personal property. The item provides the legislative framework to enable the CEO of Austrade to decide whether a person should be assessed as an excluded consultant, similar to the provisions that apply generally to applicants and their associates in respect of the fit and proper person test. The item provides that the consultant or the associates of the consultant who are not fit and proper will be subject to the rules. The rules for determining an associate of an EMDG consultant will be a legislative instrument made by the Minister for Trade and Investment, as provided for in this particular bill. The instrument will also contain assessment criteria to be used by the CEO of Austrade to determine whether or not a person or an associate of that person is fit and proper and that will be done in accordance with the guidelines. Importantly, this part of the bill also provides for consultation and for Austrade to seek further information about the associate or about the consultant. The provisions allow for a request that a person provide Austrade with specific information-books, records, documents and/or written consent-to enable the CEO of Austrade to obtain relevant information to assist in the formation of an opinion. The final element of this bill is to enable a grant to be paid more quickly, where a grant is determined before 1 July, following the balance distribution date. This relates to section 67 of the act where, essentially, applicants entitled to a grant of less than the initial payment ceiling amount are paid their grant at the time the claim is determined. Applicants entitled to an amount exceeding the initial payment ceiling amount are paid the initial payment ceiling amount and then, often many months later and following the settling of the balance distribution date, are paid the balance of their entitlement. This balance amount will depend on an assessed value of the applicant's entitlement and will be paid to applicants entitled to a second tranche amount on a pro rata basis. Under the two-tranche arrangement, Austrade is unable to pay the full amount of assessed grants to applicants as quickly as desirable when scheme demand is lower than expected or when additional money is appropriated for the scheme. In these circumstances, it would be preferable to bring forward the balance distribution date and this is what these provisions do. This item looks to amend section 82 of the Market Export Development Grant Act to provide that if Austrade determines the amount of a grant after the balance distribution date the grant becomes payable immediately. There is no additional cost associated with this change. It is interesting to note that in 2011-12, the last reported figures for the uptake of the EMDG Scheme grants, 2,933 businesses throughout Australia benefited from export market development grants with a total value of $125.6 million. This scheme encourages smallto medium-sized Australian businesses to develop export markets and receive some form of reimbursement of the expenses incurred on eligible export promotion activities. It is a wonderful example of a partnership between government and smallto medium-sized businesses. It opens doors for businesses, it provides opportunities to businesses to grow their markets, and it ensures those businesses have opportunities into the future and, importantly, are employing Australians. In 2008 the Labor government delivered in full on its commitment to better tailor the EMDG Scheme to the needs of exporting businesses. It was Labor's intention, following a period of some stagnation, to revitalise Australia's trade performance and to ensure that our trading sector once again became a positive contributor to economic growth and that the Australian economy was sustainable beyond the resources boom-that we looked to diversify our economy by providing new opportunities, beyond mining, in support of smallto medium-sized enterprises. We took a twin pillars approach to our trade policy for sustainable economic growth-trade liberalisation at the border was complemented by economic and trade reform behind the border. Labor worked through bilateral and regional agreements consistent with our multinational objectives to ensure that trade liberalisation occurred, but also that new opportunities were opened up. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme has been a key Australian government financial assistance program for aspiring and current exporters, and under Labor it was a huge success. Companies to benefit from the scheme include Opengear, which designs, manufactures and delivers secure remote infrastructure management solutions. They have seen their sales grow 40 to 50 per cent annually for each of the past three years. Opengear has graduated from being a business supported by the Export Market Development Grants Scheme to a business with $10 million in revenues, branches located in the US and Europe, and 90 per cent export sales. Other beneficiaries of EMDG Scheme grants include Bartco Traffic Equipment, an Australian manufacturer of portable traffic management equipment-full-matrix LED displays, portable traffic signals, message signs, directional arrow boards and other road safety equipment. Bartco has seen a remarkable growth in its export sales over the past few years and there is growth in the pipeline in Eastern Europe, the UAE, South America, India, the UK, Hong Kong and the USA. There are a whole host of examples of great Australian companiessmallto medium-sized enterprises, many of them in my community-that have benefited from export market development grants. Labor took the approach of supporting this scheme while ensuring that the operation of the act effectively and efficiently assisted Australian businesses. It is pleasing to see this bill continue that tradition of supporting Australian smallto medium-sized businesses. I am pleased to commend the bill to the House. Dr HENDY (Eden-Monaro) (11:50): I rise in support of the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill. As we said in our election policy, the coalition believe exports are the basis for a successful economy in services, agriculture and manufacturing. We said that we would progressively restore funding for the Export Market Development Grants Scheme with an initial $50 million boost and look to further increases as the budget improves. We noted that over one in five Australians are linked to trade, and an increased export capacity will allow Australian businesses to grow by accessing new and emerging markets. The EMDG Scheme assists in encouraging smalland medium-sized Australian businesses to develop export markets, particularly those who specialise in unique and high-value manufacturing operations. The government has a well thought through trade agenda and I am pleased that I was able to help draft the coalition's trade policy before we came to government. Today's bill is an integral part of that policy. Rather than assisting Australia's vital export sector, the RuddGillard-Rudd government severely weakened Australia's trade position. The catastrophic decision to ban live cattle exports to Indonesia without warning significantly damaged not only Australia's valuable cattle export trade to Indonesia but also our reputation as a trusted and reliable trade partner. It was a huge blow and it will take years to repair that part of our relationship with Indonesia. It was the iconic issue displaying the previous government's attitude to the export sector-they were ever ready to bow before the Greens despite the damage to Australia's national interest. The last government's frequent changes to the EMDG Scheme created unnecessary business uncertainty at a time of global economic instability. In the 2012 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the Labor government took the decision to make annual cuts of $25 million to this scheme. That was the second significant budget cut to the scheme following their 2007 election promise to actually expand the scheme. Soon after taking office in 2007, Labor expanded the scheme by lowering the eligible expenditure threshold from $15,000 to $10,000, increasing the number of grants that an applicant could receive from seven to eight and increasing the maximum grant from $150,000 to $200,000. The cost of these changes was estimated at $50 million a year, but-and this is the key-Labor increased funding only for a bit over a year. In June 2010, Labor amended the scheme to reverse the 2008 implementation of their election commitments. The EMDG Scheme, administered by Austrade, partly supports the export promotion expenses of eligible enterprises in order to boost exports and to grow our economy through Australian produced goods and services. The scheme began operation in financial year 197475, which would mean that it was started under the Whitlam government. Given the hit to small business caused by that government, it is quite ironic that this scheme has that pedigree, but credit should go where it is due. It has proven to be a successful policy that has helped many businesses over the years. When I was the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry we regarded the EMDG Scheme as one of the most successful small business programs around. The added bonus is that it is an export assistance scheme that fully accords with the rules of the World Trade Organisation. According to the Austrade website, claims are reimbursed retrospectively for expenditure incurred in the previous financial year, pro rata up to the cap. I understand that about 5,000 enterprises per year apply for grants. As the minister noted in his second reading speech for the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014, the changes proposed in this bill deliver on the coalition's pre-election commitment. As promised, after the election the 2013 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook allocated an additional $50 million over four years. The associated policy changes required to give effect to this provision, as well as some additional administrative enhancements to the scheme, are contained in this bill. In summary, the bill increases the maximum number of grants per applicant from seven to eight and reduces the required expenditure threshold to qualify for a grant from $20,000 to $15,000. According to the minister, based on the profile of last year's applicants, this will enable hundreds of extra small businesses to benefit from the scheme. Currently the export market development grant does not reimburse the first $5,000 of an eligible claim. With this bill, this figure will drop to $2,500, and around 85 per cent of export market development grant recipients will receive an extra $2,500 per grant as a result. The improvements the coalition is making will benefit many small business exporters in rural and regional areas, such as in my electorate of Eden-Monaro. Last financial year, 201213, I note that there were two recipients in Eden-Monaro. One recipient was Campbell Foods Australia Pty Ltd, which deals in meat, poultry and smallgoods wholesaling and is based in Narrabarba, south of the town of Eden. They export to five-star hotels and restaurants around the world. The other recipient was Found Enterprises Australasia Pty Ltd, based in Jerrabomberra in my electorate, which undertakes a grocery wholesaling business. They export organic pomegranate juice, watermelon juice and other products. Our EMDG policy is only part of a larger trade policy. The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government was a disappointment to Australia's exporters, especially in its failure to conclude bilateral trade agreements with key regional partners. The failure to conclude free trade agreements with Australia's major trading partners has resulted in a loss of real export income. Since the launch of Australia's free trade agreement negotiations with China in 2005, over 20 rounds of discussions have been held without result. This lack of action stands in stark contrast to New Zealand, which concluded a free trade agreement with China in 2008 after three years of negotiations. Indeed, they started the negotiations the same year we didin 2005. Since then, New Zealand's goods exports to China have trebled, with more than 90 per cent of its goods now entering China duty-free. New Zealand has also finalised a free trade agreement with Taiwan. The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government's disregard for bilateral free trade agreements and the benefits they provide to Australian exporters and investors is exemplified by former trade minister Craig Emerson's statement that a free trade agreement with China was 'overrated'. This is despite a joint feasibility study finding that a free trade agreement with China could boost Australia's real gross domestic product by approximately $24 billion over the period 2006 to 2015. We have a vastly different attitude. The Prime Minister has put a deadline on the China free trade agreement negotiations and has asked that they be concluded by the end of the year. Similarly the Chinese Prime Minister has backed an accelerated timetable. I am sure our Minister for Trade and Investment is up to the task, given his great performance in relation to trade with Korea. Labor's refusal to consider a proposal for an investor-state dispute settlement clause in a free trade agreement with South Korea placed Australian exporters at a direct disadvantage compared to their competitors in other countries. The Korean-United States free trade agreement, which entered into force on 15 March 2012, has enabled the USA to capture a significant part of Korea's lucrative beef market at the expense of Australian beef producers, who are still subject to higher tariffs. When the competitiveness of our exports is lost, so too are Australian jobs. I am glad to say that the Minister for Trade and Investment and his team have been able to pull off a great win with the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement, KAFTA. It is a worldclass, comprehensive agreement that substantially liberalises our trade with a major market. services and substantially improves investment protections. I understand that when KAFTA comes into force 84 per cent of Australia's exports, by value, to Korea will enter duty free, rising to 99.8 per cent on full implementation of the agreement. As part of our commitments, Australia will be removing its remaining tariffs on Korean goods over several years. For rural and regional Australia, where my electorate sits, I note that in the agriculture sector, the KAFTA will see Korea eliminate tariffs immediately on entry into force for raw sugar, wheat, wine, and some horticulture. Tariffs of up to 550 per cent on most other agricultural products will be eliminated within short time frames. Importantly, Korea will eliminate its 40 per cent tariff on beef progressively over 15 years, which will help to level the playing field for Australian beef exporters. And with a large dairy industry in my electorate, I should note that duty-free quotas for cheese, butter and infant formula and high tariffs will be eliminated on many dairy products between three and 20 years. KAFTA will also provide Australian services exporters with the best treatment Korea has agreed to with any trading partner. Key outcomes include: expanded markets for Australian law firms, Australian accountants, telecommunications providers, Australian financial services providers, education, engineering and other professional services. Of course it would be preferable that more progress was made in the multilateral negotiations area. Despite the current the World Trade Organisation impasse on negotiations, the coalition remains committed to the Doha Round of negotiations as the best way to improve global economic growth and remove the barriers that restrict trade and investment. With its global framework of agreed trade rules, the WTO remains crucial in preserving the openness of markets around the world. As an export-oriented economy, Australia has much to gain in pushing for further international trade reform. Over the last 20 years, multilateral trade liberalisation has boosted real family incomes by between $2,700 and $3,900 per year. However, the current impasse in the Doha Round increases the need for Australia to pursue bilateral agreements that expand trade and investment opportunities for Australian businesses. The government is devoting increased resources to fast-tracking the conclusion of free trade agreements not only with China-which I was talking about before-but also with Japan, India, the Gulf Cooperation Council and Indonesia. We will also explore the feasibility of free trade agreements with other trading partners including the European Union, Brazil, Hong Kong, Papua New Guinea, South Africa and Taiwan. We are also committed to the negotiation of a Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement as a stepping stone to a longer term goal of an Asia-Pacific free trade area. The TPP negotiations have been progressing well and I have heard encouraging reports out of recent negotiations in Singapore. We also support negotiations for a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership centred on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, and the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations or, as it is called, PACER Plus. This bill is part of our small business policy as much as being part of our trade policy. It is therefore part of our jobs policy. Over the last 14 years the EMDG scheme has helped support small and medium business exports worth more than $60 billion. On average, those exporters employed 97,000 employees each year, thus, strengthening the EMDG scheme is also about boosting jobs. I conclude by again noting that I support the bill before the House as it further strengthens the EMDG scheme. Dr CHALMERS (Rankin) (12:03): I rise today to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014. As other speakers have noted, the bill amends the EMDG Act to increase the number of grants available per applicant, to reduce the minimum expenses threshold for a grant, and to halve the current deduction from the applicant's provisional grant, among other quite technical amendments. We will be voting in favour of these amendments, several of which were proposed by Labor prior to the election last year, but we do voice our concern about the omission of some important measures which were proposed in Labor's EMDG Amendment Bill, and I will come back to that concern in a moment. The export market development grants are an important incentive for small and medium businesses, as the member for Eden-Monaro just mentioned, to promote Australian-made products overseas. Goods made in Australia, or overseas from primarily Australian products, are eligible for this scheme as are tourism services and conferences and events held in Australia. Eligible applicants are reimbursed up to half of their expenses related to export promotion as long as their export costs are over a certain threshold. This program does make it easier for Australian producers to place their product in foreign markets and it was worth, I think, just over $120 million in the last financial year. Foreign trade has been in the headlines a lot recently. We have had stories at least weekly about the Australia-China FTA, the Japan FTA, the TPP, the RCEP and the KAFTA. What all these high-level technical discussions and all these acronyms often conceal-and it is pleasing to see both sides of the House recognising this in this debate-is that it is Australian producers and Australian industries who can be the key beneficiaries of trade liberalisation between Australia and its regional partners if and when the agreements are in our national interests. When the governments go into discussions with our foreign neighbours and deliver tangible outcomes, that should not be the end of the discussion when it comes to trade. The next key step is for Australian producers and industries to win market share in our trading partners. In a world where bilateral and preferential trading agreements are becoming increasingly commonplace, it is critically important for us to support Australian producers to win contracts and earn sales overseas. That is ultimately what this EMDG scheme is aboutgiving our small and medium businesses a leg-up in touting their wares in marketplaces overseas. It is true that the nature of international trade is constantly evolving, and the trading environment today is remarkably different from what existed 50 or 20 or even 10 years ago. The nature of production has changed so that huge global value chains have become the norm in many industries. To take just one example, a recent study has found that the Apple iPhone that many of us carry around in our pockets has components from at least nine companies from five countries-the screen built in Japan, the processor in Korea, the camera in Germany, the Bluetooth in the US and assembly in China. That is just one example of the types of global value chains which have become possible and viable only as a result of the liberalisation of the international trade environment. It is vitally important in this context for Australia to stake out its place in these global value chains, and schemes like the EMDG program allow this government and this country to help Australian businesses get in on the action. Staking out our claim in global value chains is also important in the face of structural changes in the domestic economy, particularly in the labour market. Every member in this place would be aware that the current unemployment rate, at six per cent, is higher than at any time in the global financial crisis. What this figure does not include is the job losses that have been announced but not carried out over the last six months. At Qantas, Holden, Toyota, Rio, Electrolux, Caterpillar and another 22 major Australian employers, a total of 27,300 job losses have been announced since the election. The reality of the situation is that the vast majority of these jobs are likely now gone for good, at least in their most recent form. Finding a place for Australians at the good, technological end of global value chains is therefore absolutely critical for the goal of future employment. Getting the conditions right in trade and the Australian market for exports, including the best possible scheme for incentivising export promotion, is a critical step towards achieving that goal. So, in the face of a changing environment for world trade, the opposition will be supporting the amendments to the EMDG scheme. We are particularly supportive of the amendments in this legislation that were suggested by Labor in last year's proposed bill, including the increase in the number of grants available per applicant and technical amendments to enable the grant to be paid more quickly and to ensure that grants are not paid to companies engaging an EMDG consultant found not to be a fit and proper person. The member for Kingsford Smith talked at length about that particular measure. The decrease in the minimum expenses threshold is also welcome, as it allows even smaller players in Australia assistance for access to foreign markets. This will be particularly useful for niche producers to become part of the global value chains that I was talking about earlier. Unfortunately, the bill does walk back some of Labor's proposed amendments from last year, and that risks Australia missing some opportunities. Before the election, Labor had proposed special incentives in the EMDG scheme for Australian producers to seek market share and promote exports in our Asian neighbours in particular. Everybody knows that in this Asian century our region will become the powerhouse both for production and for consumption. To see this, consider some statistics presented by my colleague the member for Lilley on Sunday, when he said that 60 years ago, in 1950 or so, just 15 per cent of the world's GDP fell within 10,000 kilometres of Australia's shores. Today this share has more than doubled and by 2030, with the continued expansion of China and India in particular, close to 60 per cent of the world GDP is projected to fall within 10,000 kilometres of Australia. This is the biggest story in the world economy in our lifetime-the shift in weight and heft from west to east and the tremendous opportunities flowing to smart countries from the middleclassing of Asia. It is disappointing in that context that the government has ditched the more specific incentives for Australian businesses to take advantage of these spikes in production and consumption, and in doing so we risk missing out on some of that huge growth in opportunity in the world's most dynamic region. So we are disappointed but not entirely surprised that the government has put Australia at risk of missing the boat in the Asian century. Ever since the days of the Whitlam government and then again under Hawke and Keating, Labor has been the party of engagement with Asia, and the member for Sydney discussed some of this in her contribution to the debate last night. It was widely reported when the Abbott government officially dumped the Labor government's white paper on the Asian century from the Internet, doing their best to banish all traces of it from departmental websites. I commend the Australia in the Asian century report. There are still ways to access it, and anyone listening to this debate should familiarise themselves with this very important document. If the government had bothered to read the Asian century white paper before they deleted it and removed traces of it from their own websites, they would understand some of the opportunities that we risk missing out on. By 2025, more than two billion people will be living in Asia's cities. By 2050, this number will be more like three billion, close to double the number living in an urban environment now. With Asia's rapid urbanisation and population growth, we will see greater demand from the emerging middle class. After 60 years of trade history with Asia, Australia is perfectly placed to capitalise on Asia's rapidly developing needs for transport, infrastructure, health care, housing, agribusiness, education and more. As the authors of the white paper put it, the tyranny of distance to Europe is being replaced this century by the power of proximity to Asia. Australia needs to get the domestic environment right for trade promotion so that we can use this power of proximity to its full advantage. The opportunities for Australia for trade in the Asian century are extraordinary and we need to grab them. In agribusiness Australia will be able to take advantage of Asia's growing share of food demand, with more than 60 per cent of international demand to be driven by Asia by 2050. My colleague the member for Hunter was talking in this place yesterday on another bill about the 'dining boom' that Asia presents for Australia, and I think the opportunities in agribusiness and the related sectors in particular are extraordinary. In advanced manufacturing Australia has opportunities in pharmaceuticals and aerospace technology exports to Asia. In biotech Australia will provide services and healthcare products for Asia's rapidly ageing population, with almost 700 million people aged over 60 in Asia by 2030. In infrastructure Australia can play a key role in the financial markets and design services of the estimated $8 trillion worth of infrastructure investments in Asia by 2020. And in energy Australia is well placed to provide both the resources and the sustainable energy skills for our regional partners. All in all, across each and every industry, Australia's trade with Asia will only grow over the course of this century. But these opportunities are going to escape us unless our small and medium businesses become part of the international global value chains that characterise world trade today. To work towards this goal the EMDG scheme should be tailored in the way recommended by the previous Labor government so that exports of goods and services to Asia are given the priority that they need and deserve. With the large number of regional and bilateral trade agreements currently under negotiation, it is a bit disappointing that the government has not taken full advantage of this opportunity in this bill to help domestic producers take advantage of the biggest economic and demographic shift in our lifetime. This is the big omission from an otherwise commendable bill. important debate around supporting the export potential of small and medium-size businesses in Australia, particularly in my electorate of Barker. Few of the elected members in this place could claim to represent electorates as reliant on exports as the seat of Barker. As such, I am very much in favour of this bill, which I believe will significantly improve the Export Market Development Grants scheme. The work the coalition government is undertaking to enhance the way the EMDG scheme is administered is even more significant given that the scheme was cut by $25 million a year by the previous Labor administration. I think that funding cut is another sad reminder of the lack of understanding Labor has for the small and medium-size business sector, particularly in agriculture. I am proud to be a member of a broad political organization which understands the mechanics of our economy and is willing to support its engine room-private enterpriserather than get in the way of the business community and job creation. I am proud to be a member of this coalition government, because this bill will progressively restore funding to export market development grants, starting with an initial $50 million boost When I was growing up, my father produced, packed and exported onions to the world. Though his business enjoyed much success, I saw first hand how the profound lack of support from government for export businesses such as his ultimately drove my father to pursue other business and farming opportunities. Whilst he has enjoyed those other business and farming opportunities, the sad reality is that he employs far fewer than he did when he was operating a large-scale exporting business. That is the reality that we hear today: this is a program that is",61,Bills
45,Mr Pasin (Barker) (12:15,"I am pleased to speak today and contribute to this verynot focused on providing jobs and opportunity for Australians in, as the previous speaker indicated, the Asian sector during the Asian century. That sort of first hand experience means that I know how important it is for the government to play a positive role in helping small and medium businesses help themselves when it comes to export growth. That is why EMDG scheme grants, which assist small and medium-size enterprises to enter new export markets and become self-sustaining exporters, are just so important. I know that the allocation of an addition $50 million over the forward estimates in the 2013 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook will be very much welcomed by my constituents in Barker. I want to ensure that Barker is one of the best places to start and grow a business, and these grants assist small and medium-size businesses to enter new export markets and become selfsustaining. What is more, the bill clearly shows the coalition is delivering on its election promises by driving real growth and innovation in our economy. The improvements the coalition is making will benefit many small business exporters in rural and regional areas across Barker, whether they are based in the south-east, the Mallee, the Riverland, the Murraylands or the Barossa. All of these regions in Barker boast very proud export histories, and their local economies are all major beneficiaries of a range of sectors such as grain, red meat, dairy and wine. In fact, local businesses are already benefiting from this program, with some 15 recipients across Barker sharing in $565,370 from the 2012-13 round of funding. Some of those businesses include: the De Bruin family near Millicent, who are involved in wagyu production; the Almond Board of Australia at Berri; the Barossa Grape and Wine Association, based at Tanunda; BMD Wines at Berri; Farmer's Leap at Padthaway; First Drop Wines at Nurioopta; Hobbs Vintners at Angaston; International Timber Solutions at Mount Gambier; Irvine Wines at Eden Valley; John Duval Wines at Nurioopta; Koonara Wines at Penola; Ringbolt at Angaston; and State Peters Investments (SA) at Renmark. The breadth of the agricultural production and export potential in Barker is on show in that list. I am sure these and other recipient businesses in Barker echo my strong endorsement of this bill and would speak very highly of the positives they have derived through the EMDG scheme. I believe very strongly that strong export markets are the key to generating economic wealth and job creation in Barker and the nation more generally; and, as such, I know these grants will help small businesses with market access which may not otherwise have been possible. This provides an opportunity for me to place on record my thanks and the thanks of the constituents in Barker for the very good work that was done and finalised late last year by the Minister for Trade and Investment, the Hon. Andrew Robb, in securing the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement. This is a significant development in Australia's trade relations with Asia. I note with interest that negotiations with respect to the agreement meandered and ultimately stagnated under the former administration but were finalised thanks to the very diligent hard work of the minister. Why is the achievement of this agreement so important to the people of Barker? It is so important because of the following. For those in my electorate involved in the sheepmeat industry-like my father, producing lamb, sheepmeat and goatmeat products-a tariff of 22.5 per cent will be phased to zero over 10 years. For those involved in the dairy sector, the current eight per cent tariff on Australian dairy spreads into Korea will be eliminated over three years. In this regard, I think of Kraft International in Mt Gambier. Australian table grape growers in my electorate currently face a 45 per cent tariff into Korea. This will be cut by half on day one and then phased to zero over five years. Growers of chipping potatoes face, wait for it, a 304 per cent tariff into Korea. This will be cut to zero when the FTA enters into force. I should say that my electorate includes the single largest producer of chipping potatoes in the nation. Oranges will benefit from a reduction of a tariff of 50 per cent to zero over seven years. That of course comes as good news to those blockies in the Riverland who have faced the vicissitudes of drought over recent years. Korea's 24 per cent tariff on Australian cherries will be eliminated when the FTA enters into force. Cherry producers at Kalangadoo have hailed that a great success. Australia's $10 million wine exports into Korea face tariffs of between 15 and 30 per cent. These will be eliminated. Exporters of crayfish fished off the rugged coast of my electorate face a 20 per cent tariff, which will be reduced to zero over three years. I take this opportunity to remind the House that this agreement is critical and it is critical that it is finalised so it can come into force in advance of 1 January 2015, so that we can enjoy the first step down in tariffs for these various commodity groups on that date. Any delay will effectively increase the competitiveness of other countries relative to ours, and will also delay the reductions that I have just outlined that are of such importance to primary producers throughout Barker. Again, I place on record my thanks to the hard working achievements of the Minister for Trade and Investment on behalf not of myself but of the primary producers in my electorate. Returning to the bill before the House, an important aspect of the legislation is also to make the scheme more accessible to businesses looking to export. As anyone who has experience in the smalland medium-business sector knows, time is often the most precious commodity. This improved accessibility will also be welcome. For example, regional businesses in Barker looking to pursue their first export sales will now be eligible for a $5,000 grant if they spend $15,000 on export promotion. This is a significant improvement on the existing settings where such businesses would have received nothing and would have had to spend a minimum of $20,000 before they were eligible for any EMDGS funding assistance. I understand that in the past some exporters chose not to apply because they were not confident of meeting the grant threshold, which is why we are lowering that threshold. I believe this will be a catalyst for many small and medium enterprises to think about exporting for the first time or exporting into a novel market. I note that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's Director, Trade and International Affairs, Mr Bryan Clark, praised the initiative and in particular the minister for trade for his commitment to opening up new markets through market visitation and through advancing talks on trade liberalisation in our region. I share the view of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry that these changes to the EMDGS will provide direct assistance to companies seeking to secure more commercial contracts, underpinning their viability and profitability, and ultimately providing more jobs and investment to our country. I enthusiastically commend this bill to the House. Amendment Bill 2014 is quite simple: it is to amend the Export Market Development Grants",70,Kafta Gives Australian Exporters Significantly Improved Market Access In Goods And
46,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (12:27,"The purpose of the Export Market Development GrantsAct 1997-a good act, one that does a great job for small business. It has changed only slightly over preceding years and is one that is supported very much by the Labor Party, by Labor in government and by Labor in opposition as well. It is an essential scheme that assists small business in being able to deliver to export markets in a more efficient and effective manner and, possibly further than that, being able to access export markets for the first time, or being confident that they have a hand-up rather than a handout when exporting. Through my electorate and through other electorates, I know of the good work that individual small businesses and enterprises have undertaken and the value of this assistance to them. I am very much in support of anything that improves this scheme. The EMDGS is administered by Austrade. The scheme is generally regarded by everyone as a successful measure to support Australian small to medium exporters and business. The act has been amended over the years, largely for efficiency reasons. I do not think anyone would argue about the good quality of the work and the development of markets that can be achieved through some government assistance. On the face of that, this would just seem like common sense. While the government are moving these amendments and we support them, it does fly in the face of a lot of what the government say on other matters. The government say, 'We'll just get out of the way and you can get on with doing your own things.' They do not want to intervene. They do not want to help. They are dismantling all sorts of assistance measures, including direct small business assistance lines and, very importantly, some very good consumer protection measures that were put in place by the previous government specifically to support small business. We are seeing this develop and come out under the cloak of getting rid of red tape and regulation-which everyone supports. Why wouldn't you? You would be mad if you did not support getting rid of red tape. It drives us all crazy and we should get rid of more of it. And that is exactly what Labor did in government. We actually had a minister for deregulation. We took this so seriously that we repealed thousands and thousands of regulations and got rid of red tape. We went further. We did not just do the easy lifting. We did not just pick the lowhanging fruit-while we are talking about export markets. We actually did some serious stuff, some reforms. Whether it was in the charitable sector or the small business sector, with business names registration and a whole range of other measures we went a very long way to reduce red tape, regulation, costs and paperwork. We did all the things that you would expect any good government to do. What we are going to see develop out of this week and the coming weeks, unfortunately, is the government operating under the cloak of red tape reduction and all of that-that nice big cloak they are going to put over all this. Everything that is red tape and regulation must be bad; that is what the government says. But it is just not that simple. Every time. I meet with small business groups, with farmers, with exporters, with anyone, they do not come to me saying, 'Get rid of stuff.' They say: 'Can you just give us a bit more protection in this area? Can you just give us a bit of a hand here? Can you help us to compete better? Can you protect us? Can you help us?' This is what they say to me about things that are happening to them. We agree with them, and we agree on both fronts. We should reduce red tape and regulatory burdens and make it as affordable and easy as possible for small businesses to flourish, because they are at the core of creating jobs in this country. Small business is not just the bastion of the Liberal Party or the National Party. We get it. We put programs in place to support and develop small business. There are many things we did. I am going to list them, because there are some people in this place, on the other side, who just happen to think they are the only ones who have ever had an idea. But so far all we are seeing of their ideas is: 'How much can we cut from small business? How much can we take away from small business protections and consumer protections? How much can we make life harder for them? How much direct assistance can we take away from them?' What they will say is, 'We can't afford it.' Well, they can afford the things they like or the things that ideologically suit them. If it is a rolled gold paid parental leave system for some of the wealthiest people in this country, of course, that is fine-$5½ billion or $6 billion. But when it comes to supporting small business with real funds, about $4 billion has just been taken away from them. SoI would say to every small business owner: 'Who got the $4 billion that just got taken off you? Who got your money? I will tell you who got your money: the government did. They just want to put it in their coffers. That is who took your money.' This bill does not cost a lot. It is only $50 million over the forward estimates. It is only $12½ million per year. How generous, and we welcome it. We welcome it because, in government, these were the sorts of things we did, because we wanted to go out there and support small business and support market development, and the EMDGS is a great scheme and a great way to do it. But I can imagine right now-I can almost hear the crescendo of screams from the other side-if we had done this in government in those last days, when we had a bill that would have gotten through but the parliament was prorogued for the election. They would have said: 'We can't afford this. It's just more money, more waste.' The Liberal Party and National Party, every time you spent a dollar, said that it was debt, that it was a debt dollar. Every single dollar that the government has, according to the Liberals and Nationals, is just debt. They forget that you actually have government revenues as well. Which one is debt and which one is revenue? Which one are you taking out of which pile? They just dumb down the debates here. They simplify and dumb them down, thinking that Australians will not be smart enough to get the nuances. They come in here and they go, 'Here is $12½ million per year for a great, revolutionary program.' Well, it is simply not. It is a small, modest increase. But it is absolutely supported, because you would be mad not to. This will be a cost to the budget, but we are not going to carry on about a cost to the budget on something that is a really good measure, that does good things. You get a return on investment. There are some new words for the Liberal Party: 'return on investment'. You will actually get value back. The more you help small business, the more they will return, through revenues, directly to government. That should be a focus of the Liberal Party-I am not going to talk about the National Party-who say they are the best friend of small business. If you are the best friend of small business and you rip at the heart of small business assistance and take away $4 billion of direct assistance, I would hate to see what you would do if you were their enemy. Let us just talk about simple facts. What did we do in government-what actually took place and happened?-and what did the Liberal Party do when it got to government? It ain't a great story, let me tell you that. Let us just walk through a couple of the things. I am very proud of Labor's record in government. Labor introduced a Small Business Commissioner for the first time. For the first time, we have got a direct voice, a business voice, directly at the highest level of government, representing small business interests and concerns. I am glad to see that the Small Business Commissioner has survived. I am glad to see we still have the Small Business Commissioner, because it is a good idea and it actually works well for small business. It gives them a focal point. It is a direct link into government. The new government are keeping it. They are keeping Labor's policy They are keeping Labor's Small Business Commissioner because it is a good idea and we ought to support it. SoI thank the government for being so generous. We also went to the heart of trying to deal with the costs for small business. One of the big costs for small business was business names registration. In the modern world in the 21st century, we had this curious system that was different in every state and territory, that was very expensive and time consuming. If you wanted to register your business nationally, you had to do some online, some by paper, some by visiting an office nine to five. And, if you got there, the cost was usually over $1,000. That was not good enough. What Labor did in government was say: 'We can fix that. We can reduce your costs.' At the time, we reduced it down from $1,000 down to $30; one system, online. This was a massive undertaking by government, criticised the whole time by the Liberals because they thought somehow this might not benefit small business. Let me tell you, as the years march on, small business will realise and they will look back and think, 'Can you believe we once did it the other way and that it used to cost us that much?' It was Labor that introduced it, and this government will have to keep it-and they will keep it-because small business names registration was a bureaucratic burden for small business. We changed it. We made it easy. We made it seven days a week, 24 hours a day, online, cheap and accessible. That is what governments ought to do. That is what governments ought to do for small business; real red-tape reduction, not just coming in here and going to some department and saying to the department: 'Look, find us anything, something from 1902 and something from 1910 that no-one even remembers exists, and we will just get rid of those bits of red tape and regulation because it will make it look like we are doing a lot.' But we are not fooled by that. You are doing a lot of nothing. The areas where they are actually doing something are the areas that involve a little bit of pain. There is a little bit of a sting in the tail, a little bit more cost. You have to remember that this is how it works in this place: every time the government talks about saving, they are talking about saving for them. Every time they talk about saving, it is a cost to you. Everybody listening understands that every time the government says 'We're saving X million dollars', they are actually taking it from you. It is going to cost you. The Liberal Party think it is their money. They think the savings are for them.

47,Mr Ripoll,"The Liberal Party are a bunch of insiders. Let's get this straight. I amwhether it is coming out of your education for your kids, out of your schoolkids bonus, which has disappeared, whether it is coming out of the low-income pockets of people earning less than $37,500 a year. Let's think about this for a minute. Put your hand up in here if you are earning less than $37,500 a year. It is not a lot of money. But, if you were going to get more savings for government, who would you target first? Let me tell you who the Liberals and Nationals target: very low income earners. About two-thirds of those are women, working part time. What this government has done is save themselves $500 measly dollars a year and taken it off them. They have taken it directly out of their back pockets. Even if it was just that measly $500 a year out of your salary, that would be one thing; but it is worse than that, because they are taking it out of their long-term retirement savings future. It is a low-income superannuation contribution. That is where they are taking it from. Labor introduced the low-income superannuation contribution to do something really specific: to give low-income earners just a little bit of assistance. It is only $500 a year but it goes a long way to ensuring that, when people come to retirement-particularly women, who we all acknowledge in this place have lower superannuation balances and less opportunity to build their super balances because of time out of the workforce for family reasons-why would you target them? Why would you make them the victims of your callous behaviour? Why do they have to bear the brunt of what government wants to save while you charge it to the lowest income earners in this country? That is my question back to the government, to the Liberal Party and the National Party. They come in here full of confidenceMr Nikolic interjecting Mr Nikolic: Under standing order 66, you asked a question and I would like to respond to it via an intervention. seconds in this place is cheap. I do not need the extra 15 seconds to make the points that I am making-whether it comes to export market development grants, whether it comes to supporting small business, whether it comes to how they treat ordinary people and workers in this country-low-income workers-whether it is superannuation. We moved superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent and that has been delayed. We all know what a delay is: it is stuck at 9.25 per cent. It is not going to budge. Here is my challenge to the Liberal Party: move it from 9.25 per cent; move it and move it soon. Move it as soon as you can. But of course who pays?

But it is about cutting support for low-income Australians; it is about cutting your schoolkids bonus-cost-of-living pressures. How do you relieve cost-of-living pressures for ordinary families? You help them with schoolkids bonus; you help them with a range of things; you help them with their schools; you actually try to improve their schools; you try to help them with their health costs; you try to help them with small business; you really actually do something about the bureaucracy. That is what Labor did. We are getting to see exactly what the Liberals are doing. Ms SCOTT (Lindsay) (12:43): I am pleased to rise today in support of the Export Market Development Grants Amendment 2014 introduced by the Minister for Trade and Investment this morning. This amendment delivers on the coalition's pre-election commitment to not only progressively restore funding to the Export Market Development Grants scheme but to also provide an initial $50 million boost. Of course as other speakers have noted, the previous Labor government cut these grants by $25 million per year, resulting in a disastrous effect on small and medium export business across our great nation. For Australia to maintain our international competitiveness, it is essential we find, nurture and support our innovative entrepreneurs, in turn enhancing the nation's export base across agriculture, services and manufacturing, the three economic pillars essential to the future employment of workers across Australia and crucial to the economic viability of the people in Western Sydney who look to such sectors for their future job security. Unfortunately, cuts by the former RuddGillard-Rudd governments say much about their lack of understanding in regard to Australia's small and medium businesses. They are clear examples of the misalignment of Labor's priorities and demonstrate their interest in meeting a target rather than supporting these important sectors. We often hear that small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. In the private sector in Australia, small business employs some 43.3 per cent of workers, and I would like to remind the House that all businesses were once small. In order to secure the economic sustainability of our nation, the Australian economy must diversify. We must find new trade opportunities and ensure our place in new and emerging markets. This scheme works to do just that, thus enhancing Australia's manufacturing, services and agricultural export base. This is the primary goal of the EMDG Scheme and why I rise today to speak in support of this bill. As such, I welcome this $50 million increase to this important scheme. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme helps potential small and medium Australian exporters develop their export markets to become sustainable exporters by reimbursing up to 50 per cent of eligible marketing expenditure. As someone who had a marketing background before entering this place, I applaud the investment in marketing, because marketing is where we find the potential markets that will buy our goods and services. If we are not proactively looking to find new customers for our goods and services, we do not make products that will find a place overseas. The scheme is a key Australian government financial assistance program for aspiring and current exporters. Administered by Austrade, the scheme supports a wide range of industry sectors and products, including inbound tourism and the export of intellectual property outside Australia. This legislation gives effect to changes which will make the scheme more accessible to businesses looking to export, and, therefore, I anticipate that the sector will grow in leaps and bounds. In addition to the increase of $50 million in funding, this amendment also proposes three changes to the way the scheme will be administered. It will increase the number of grants available to be received by an applicant from seven to eight. As a result of this change, it is estimated that an additional 138 exporters will be able to claim an additional allowance each year. This will allow more experienced exporters to claim an additional grant and will allow previously successful recipients to further develop their goods and services in existing markets, re-enter markets that are now commercially viable due to the reduced exchange rate and diversify into new and emerging markets. This amendment will reduce the minimum expenses threshold required to be incurred by an applicant by $20,000 to $15,000. This will benefit an additional 143 exporters who are projected to be able to make a new claim each year. Essentially, reducing the minimum expenses threshold decreases the marketing budget small exporters are required to invest in their export marketing programs before they can claim an export marketing development grant. This in particular is expected to be well received by the smalland medium-enterprise community as well as industry associations. Finally, it will reduce the current $5,000 deduction from the applicant's provisional grant to $2,500, resulting in all grant recipients receiving an additional $2½ thousand per grant. In the current difficult international trading conditions, exporters have faced several years of pressure on their marketing budgets from higher exchange rates and weak international markets. The ability to have even a modest increase in marketing funds is expected to be welcomed. This increase in grant funding will be particularly relevant now that many small and medium enterprises are increasingly eyeing their potential for increased international sales as exchange rates ease and international markets increasingly recover. These three administrative changes are excellent news for Australian smalland mediumsized businesses who want to continue to be competitive and innovative-they want to find the products for tomorrow; find the new iPhones and the new iPads and find the new automotive technology-such as those I see in my electorate. BeforeI move on to talk about my electorate and how I see these grants working locally, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the interesting comments made by the members for Sydney and Oxley. There was a pre-election assertion that Labor's proposed bill, which would have decreased grants for exporters in developed markets such as Europe and the USA and would have focused more on development, was a sign that they were recognising the importance of Asia and other exporters. I quote the speech by the honourable member for Sydney where she asserted these claims and then went on to say: The Labor amendment bill introduced in the last parliament sought to realign the Export Market Development Grants Scheme to support small businesses exporting to East Asian and frontier and emerging markets. It is disappointing to see that the Abbott government has walked away from these proposed changes. I certainly believe that it must be possible to find a way to leverage this public investment to further the nation's strategic objective of a much deeper engagement with our region. Not only has the realignment of the scheme … The important point to recognise is that small and medium enterprises who export are participating in global supply chains. Exporting to Europe and to the USA may well be of ultimate benefit to end-markets in Asia or in developing markets-for example, exports of fine wool to Italy end up in suits created and sold in Shanghai-so I do not think the opposition have much form in this space. Then we had the member for Rankin say that Labor got rid of red tape to help small business. I would like to remind the House that it was the previous Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government that provided 21,000 new regulations. SoI look forward to our first repeal day when we will start rolling back the red tape that has been inflicted on the Australian economy by those opposite. I move to my electorate of Lindsay. I can appreciate that from a helicopter view these changes may be viewed as technical or as only beneficial to large Australian exporters, which is just simply not true. This is why I am so pleased to note the previous recipients in my electorate of Lindsay, who have used these grants as an opportunity to increase their market share internationally. I am also happy to note that these companies welcomed the coalition government's additional support in this important area of their business. For starters, Concept Paints in St Marys is a business that I know quite well. Not only did my own family's small business get involved with its technology-it is a wonderful technology-but I have also visited its manufacturing plant in St Marys. This is a medium sized business. It employs a lot of local people out of Western Sydney. It needs to be conscious of how it spends its money. It needs to be thrifty. It needs to weigh up the risks and the opportunities. To export a product overseas is not simply a matter of one or two meetings but rather, as Concept Paints describes it, it is a two-year pipeline of regular meetings, supplying and shipping of samples as well as contracting technicians to support the sale of the product. Because its product is new and innovative, it has to do a lot of work in marketing to explain to emerging markets how its product will improve productivity for people overseas. It is quite a long process, and any type of process like this comes with costs. The primary competitors for Concept Paints are multinational companies, who have far bigger budgets that can be used to drive sales. Under the Export Market Development Grants scheme, Concept Paints will continue to be competitive. The grants will enable the company to push and promote its products into foreign markets and increase its global footprint, which is great news for Concept Paints and is a real success story about how these grants boost manufacturing, boost Australian products and boost the industry as a whole. Good news for the automotive industry! GPC Electronics, located on Blaikie Road in Penrith, has also benefited from the Export Market Development Grants scheme. In the previous financial year, it received $150,000 under the scheme. For more than 20 years, GPC Electronics has successfully manufactured complex electronic equipment for leading global organisations, such as Toshiba, Nortel, Alcatel, Siemens and NEC. It is now one of the largest contract manufacturers in Australia, exporting to over 40 countries. The list goes on: Packwest, in Jamisontown, is yet another local recipient. It is located in my electorate and it has received $10,495 under the export market development scheme. This is a fabulous local organisation that has strong ties with customers and suppliers to develop innovative packaging, products and solutions. There are so many other businesses that have benefited. Australian Natural Health, based in Emu Plains, specialises in pharmaceutical and toiletry goods. It is a wholesale company that has received $19,706. Epitomy Pty Ltd is an electronic equipment manufacturing company, based in St Marys, that received $10,689. Oz Trails, a tourism business, and Sydney Executive Tours, a fantastic travel and tourism company based in Penrith, received $30,000 from the scheme. Spiller Industrial Supplies, located on Batt Street Penrith, is a sole export distributor for Apollo Cleaning Systems. This year, they will receive $15,534. Finally, Sud-Chemie Australia is a fantastic international company which has its Australian offices based, once again, in Penrith. In the previous financial year, it received $18,137 in grants. The reason that these grants are so important to areas like Western Sydney is that two-thirds of my workforce have to commute every single day for jobs. Grants like these create local jobs, help my local community and are the reason that I stand here today to fight for the people of Western Sydney. I appreciate that this money was administered under the previous government, but I encourage the House to consider how much longer this list will be with the administrative and financial boost introduced by the coalition government today. I encourage the House to consider how much stronger our small and medium sized business export markets will be under these changes. Let us not forget it was the Labor government who continued to make cuts in this important sector, who continued to cut the Export Market Development Grants scheme, who continued to cut into the opportunities that we as a government provide to this vital sector. I am proud to be part of a government who seeks to support this sector and to continue to give small and medium sized enterprises a hand up. We want to make Australia one of the best places to start and grow a business. We want to be a smart economy. We want smart jobs. We want our local manufacturing, agricultural and service businesses to be exporting internationally. Small business and medium business are the engine room of our economy, and it is time we supported them. They need to be unshackled by this reckless opposition, who in government did all they could to burden them with regulation and more taxation. I commend this bill to the House. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (12:58): I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014, because I understand the importance of export market development grants. The EMDGs provide assistance to aspiring and current exporters. They are a key measure in supporting Australia's small and medium sized businesses who want to develop export markets. As a former small business owner, I know that these kinds of decisions can be heavy indeed. Deciding to export involves a great deal of risk. The research, promotion and travel required to identify markets and to build relationships to begin exporting are incredibly costly, time-consuming and rewarding. But they involve years of effort. The EMDGs reimburse a significant amount of eligible export promotion expenses, and the financial support available through them is often fundamental in providing business owners with the assurance that they need to begin exporting. I will single out two fabulous organisations in my electorate who are doing amazing work in exporting overseas. The first is Aspen Medical, which last year won the ACT Exporter of the Year award. Aspen Medical's story is phenomenal. It is quite well-known right throughout Australia because of its extraordinary work. For those who do not know it, like so many successful small businesses it began at a kitchen table with a husband and wife team. And now Aspen Medical delivers world-class health care in remote, challenging and underresourced environments. In 2012-13 Aspen Medical's exports grew to $44 million-an increase of 16 per cent over 2011-12-and accounted for almost 20 per cent of total turnover. During this time worldwide revenue more than doubled, and its team doubled in size. Growth is expected to continue as Aspen Medical leverages relationships with government departments, the resources sector, Indigenous partners and humanitarian organisations in the US, UK and UAE. They are an extraordinary outfit that I am very proud to have in my electorate. They just keep winning export awards and business awards-award after award. They are an extraordinary organisation. The other organisation I would like to talk about today is CEA Technologies, which is located in Fyshwick in my electorate-again, an extraordinary outfit. They have been going for many, many years, and they do amazing work in terms of Defence contracts. They export throughout the world in very highly technical and innovative areas, particularly for shipsthey do a lot of ICT and other work on ships, and their work is extraordinary. Again, I am very proud to have such an innovative, cutting-edge, world-class organisation in my electorate. For some businesses, the assurance needed to begin exporting for the very first time comes from the EMDG scheme. For businesses already in the exporting game, EMDGs can provide support to investigate new markets, to maintain visibility in overseas markets and, most importantly, to develop key relationships. Those opposite are often critical of governments providing financial assistance to business, and this is demonstrated not only in their rhetoric but in their actions. But these grants are a wonderful example of how providing financial assistance to organisations can be instrumental in supporting jobs and growth right here in Australia. I am glad that, on this occasion at least, those opposite can see this benefit. Some of the comments that have been made by businesses that have received these grants include: 'The EMDG program has been a huge help for our company, and we have grown in size and credibility'; 'The EMDG has been instrumental in assisting our company's growth'; and 'Since signing on to the EMDG program our employment numbers have grown from 19 to 40 people, and we have had 10 years of double digit growth', which is an extraordinary achievement. Many aspects of the amendments we are debating here today are good. They will help simplify the EMDGs and make the program more efficient. Labor is pleased that the government has adopted several of the measures contained in the amendment bill that we introduced last year. These include increasing the maximum number of grants per applicant to eight, preventing the payment of grants to applicants engaging an EMDG consultant who is assessed as not being a fit and proper person, and enabling grants to be paid more quickly where a grant is determined before 1 July following the balance distribution. However, there are other amendments that Labor would have liked to see included in this amendment bill. Key amongst them is Labor's previously proposed incentive to export to Asia-to our region-especially in light of proposed new FTAs in the Asian region that have the potential to open up markets for existing and new export businesses. The government has abandoned these incentives, as it has so many other aspects of Labor's Australia in the Asian century white paper. When the then Prime Minister released the Australia in the Asian century white paper on 28 October 2012, I, like many Australians, was excited. I was excited about the many prospects and opportunities the Asian century offered Australians. I was excited that we were making a strategic and forward-thinking decision to make the most of those opportunities. AndI was excited on behalf of the young boys and girls in my electorate who will grow up being Asia-literate, who will be fully engaged in our region, who will have multiple opportunities to study, to live and to work in Asia. And here I want to talk about a couple of schools in my electorate that are already very Asia-literate. Mawson Primary has next to it an early childhood centre where children from basically one year old right through to school age are learning Chinese at the same time as they learn English. It is a fantastic program. I have been to a number of concerts at the school-all sung in Chinese, with everyone dressed up in little outfits; they are gorgeous. I have also been to a number of their working bees as well as their celebrations of other events. So, we have a fantastic program right here in Canberra-in Mawson, in my electorate-where children from the age of one are learning to be bilingual. It is an incredibly impressive program, and I applaud the work they are doing there. I know the staff are incredibly committed, as are the parents. It is not just a case of these children becoming bilingual; as a result of these small children learning Chinese from a very young age, the parents are encouraged to then go and study Chinese themselves. I have tried to learn Mandarin in the past, as I have tried to learn Arabic and a number of other languages. An honourable member: Your English isn't too bad! Ms BRODTMANN: My English is not too bad, no-I won't go there! But I know that Mandarin is incredibly challenging, and so I take my hat off to the parents who do make that effort-although there is no way they are going to keep pace with their children-to try to converse with their children in Mandarin as they learn to become completely bilingual from a very young age. There is also a school in Farrer in my electorate that has a very impressive Japanese language program, and there are a number of other schools in my electorate where the students are learning Indonesian-that is, across Catholic schools, public schools and independent schools. SoI would like to think that Canberra is at the cutting edge of bilingualism when it comes to Asian languages, and I know that it is going to set these children up for life in terms of being able to converse freely. The beauty of learning another language-and, as I said, I am not fully conversant in any language-is that, when you are learning another language you gain a good understanding of the culture. So it is not just a case of learning a language and being able to converse with people in the street or with people in business environments; it also gives you an insight into the culture and the history of a country. It gives you a richness that you simply cannot get from just having a visit there or even going to some business meetings there. It gives you, in a way, a window to the soul of the country. That is why I applaud the range of schools in my electorate who are doing amazing work in Bahasa, in Mandarin, in Korean, in Japanese, and in Hindi-my Hindi is not too bad after living in India, but with the others, it was a bad attempt. However, I do fear that as a result of the shift in this bill, that these opportunities will be lost under an Abbott government-in terms of engagement with and a focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Labor recognises that Australia's future prosperity will be underpinned by our engagement with our region, and I wonder about those opposite. BeforeI entered parliament I had my own public relations outfit, and I had a particular interest in looking at how Australia promoted itself in the region. In 1989 I was awarded a Royce Fellowship to study northern Asian perceptions of Australia's strengths as a manufacturing nation. This provided me with a fantastic opportunity. I was with Austrade for about four or five months, just looking at what they were doing here in Canberra. ThenI travelled up to northern Asia: to Japan, to Korea, to Taiwan, to China, and to Hong Kong. I spent time meeting with Austrade officials there, with Australian embassy officials, with Asian business people, with journalists, with universities and with think tanks, getting an understanding of what they thought of Australia as a manufacturing nation. The reason I wanted to study this particular area, as some in this hall might remember, was because of a study Ross Garnaut did, Australia and the Northeast Asian Ascendancy, which looked at trying to boost Australia's presence in the region in terms of manufacturing-to both elaborately and simply transform manufacturers. AfterI read that study I thought, 'that may be the case, and it is a great aspiration', but I was particularly keen to look at what the actual perceptions of Australia as a manufacturing nation were. At that stage the perception in northern Asia was that we were essentially a quarry and a farm. We wanted to broaden that perception. So, I just wanted to get a baseline of what the perception was among those opinion makers, business people, journalists, think tanks, and academics. I continued with my interest in this particular area when I worked with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and was posted to India, in 1996. That year we had a major promotion, right throughout India, that was incredibly complex. We were showcasing Australia as a sophisticated, modern, manufacturing nation that produced significant technological work and major innovation. It was designed to show that we were more than just a quarry and a farm, and to broaden the perception that the Indian community had of Australia. It was designed to deepen the perception and understanding that the Indian community had of Australia, and it was highly successful in changing attitudes. That yearlong program, which was very extensive and comprehensive, built on a program we ran in Indonesia in 1994 that I had also participated in. It was also designed to showcase the modern, innovative and technologically advanced Australia-the Australia that was producing world class research, technology and products. That program also worked very well in broadening and deepening the understanding of Indonesians about what Australia was, beyond just being a quarry and a farm. Those years of my career in DFAT, and working on the Royce study, have highlighted to me how important it is to help out our exporters in the region. That is why this EMDG is so important. Those years also highlighted to me the significant and beneficial role that Austrade does, not just in researching potential markets for exporters, but also in getting a sense of where they will succeed. Trying to export requires a significant investment, so you need to know that your product is going to succeed before you make that big leap of faith, because it is a high risk operation. I take my hat off to those Austrade officials, here in Australia and around the world, who are providing significant support to our exporters, and I thank them for their work. I know that they are incredibly committed to broadening, deepening and growing Australia's export base. Labor supports this bill, we support these amendments, and we support the EMDGs, because we believe there is a role for government to contribute to Australia's successful engagement with the world-through exporting the remarkable skills and innovation, and the goods of our hard working men and women. However, we do not support the government's indifference to our region. Ignoring the incentives to focus on our region is a mistake. The Asian century is here, it cannot be sent to the archives, and we need to be ready. Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014. This bill is another coalition promise delivered, and delivered in full. Before the election we promised that we would reinstate an extra $50 million to this export development grants scheme, and that is what we are delivering in the parliament today. I have been very pleased to sit here and listen to the contributions from the member for Sydney, the member for Canberra, and the member for Oxley, all saying how they support this scheme, how wonderful it is, and how it assists our exports. They are 100 per cent correct. However, it is worth contrasting how the coalition is delivering on our promise to increase funding under this scheme with what the members of the Labor party did when they were in government. Now let us go back to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013, which the member for Canberra actually voted for. What that bill proposed to do was cut $25 million from the export development grants for one year. The former Labor government wanted to take away $25 million worth of funding. We here in the new government are doing the exact opposite. We are putting $50 million back in over the forward estimates. We also should note the comments from our Minister for Trade and Investment in which he noted that our commitment was not only to make this one $50 million hit but that we would progressively restore the funding to the export market development schemes. This was a scheme that, under the former Labor government, they completely ignored. In fact, if we go back to 2006-07, in the last years of the Howard government, this scheme was funded to the tune of $154.4 million. But in the Export Market Development Grants bill of 2013, which the former Labor government members all voted for, by then they wanted to cut it from $150 million. So in their six years of government they had not even put one extra cent in-it was still at the same level as 2006=07-and they wanted to rip $25 million away. This is the complete nonsense that we hear from that side. It is worthwhile mentioning the absolute nonsense from the opposition in this debate. The other thing that they tried to do was to reduce the number of grant years under the previous scheme for exports promotion to the USA, Canada and the European Union. Previously, the Export Market Development Grants Scheme allowed an exporter to apply for grants on a seven-year basis. In their last proposal for the scheme, the previous Labor government actually knocked out year 6 and year 7 for exporters exporting to the USA, Canada and the European Union and made a tokenistic one-year increase of an eighth year to Asia. They have a terrible record-a shameful record-of neglect of this scheme. This is in complete contrast to the coalition. What this bill does, firstly, is commit an extra $50 million over the forward estimates period that will be paid to our small exporters that engage in export development. Secondly, and most importantly, it lowers the threshold. Previously, there was a threshold of $5,000 for an exporter's eligible expenditure that was not accounted. What we have done is reduce that to $2,500. That incentivises our small businesses-even down to our microbusinesses. In just one example, a business that had spent $15,000 on export promotion under the previous Labor government would have received a duck egg-zero; nothing. By the change that we are",76,Kafta Gives Australian Exporters Significantly Improved Market Access In Goods And
55,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (13:13,"It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Exportmaking to this scheme, that exporter would get back $5,000. Again, we are realigning this more to small businesses. The second thing we are doing in the change to this scheme is increasing the number of grant years from seven to eight, irrespective of what market you export to. That is a very important step. I would hope in years to come, as the economy improves and our financial situation allows it, that we could increase that to extra years. That is important because exporters do not have just one product or one market that they export to. Over a period of five, six, seven or eight years, the market changes. The market that was eight years ago, compared to the market that exists today for exporters, is a completely different world. Exporters have to have new products; they have to go and seek new markets. Markets fall away and markets come back. That grants should be knocked out after a certain number of years is not good for the scheme. The fact that we have been able to increase this from seven years to eight years is a very positive step in the right direction. As I said, this bill is all about backing small business. We are sending the message to our small business community out there: 'Go out and have a go in the export market,' because 99 per cent of the world's economy lies beyond our shores. So we are sending a message to those small businesses in Australia: 'Get out there; have a go in the export market; if you take that risk, the government is there and the government will back you up.' That is what we need to drive this economy. We need to encourage those entrepreneurs, those creative innovators in this country, to go out there, put their own money on the line and take a risk, because that is what drives the growth, drives the employment and creates the prosperity in our nation. That is what exactly this bill encourages. Export markets are tricky and they are complicated. I know for myself. BeforeI entered this parliament I sat around in boardrooms in New York, in Singapore, in Dubai and in the UK, trying to sell things from small Australian companies into those markets. One thing I found was that, no matter what part of the world that I travelled, when they knew that I was from Australia they gave me a fair hearing. That is the message that I would like to send to every potential exporter in the country-'Get out there and have a go.' That is what this bill assists. I would like to touch on one thing quickly. For our exporters, one thing that is important to them is to be able to transport their goods to those export markets. In this parliament there is a lot of debate about our airline industry. We need a strong Qantas, but we also need a strong and expanding number of international flights in and out of this country, because those passenger aircrafts do not only move passengers. In the belly of the aircraft they also move export air freight. That is so important to our nation because so many of the products that we have a competitive advantage in are perishable goods that need to be exported quickly by air to overseas markets. So the more air traffic we have-the greater the number of planes flying into Australia from international destinations-the more that opens up the volume, allows greater capacity and keeps the price down for our air freight exports. So we need to be very careful when we have the opposition not supporting the government and blocking changes to the Qantas Sale Act that would enable Qantas to compete on a more level playing field. The opposition are not only harming Qantas; they risk harming the thousands and thousands of Australian exporters and the tens if not hundreds of thousands of jobs that rely on the export of goods into world markets through airfreight. I am also very, very concerned about some of the statements by opposition members during this debate. It would appear that either they have not read the legislation or they do not understand the legislation. There is nothing that we are doing that adversely affects our exports to Asia. Previously, there was an eight-year allowance: you could claim a grant for eight consecutive years for export promotion to Asia. What we have done is extend that eight years to Europe, the USA and UK markets. The great concern I have when I read the speech by the member for Sydney in this debate, where she criticised the reform, is that she thought the government should somehow come in and say, 'This export market is more important than this export market and therefore you should have different rules for different markets.' This is what we see, unfortunately, from the Labor opposition. They have a complete desire and tendency to want to micromanage everything, to centralised planning. We should leave it to the exporters to decide where they believe they have the greatest chance of making export sales. It should not be up to members of the bureaucracy or members of the government to say, 'Isn't it wonderful, all this expansion to Asia is wonderful-that's where exporters should go.' Exporters understand that; they know that. There is a scene from The Lego Movie, which is being released in the coming weeks in Sydney, that I want to mention here. In that movie the evil robots are called the 'micromanagers'. What the micro managers try and do is ensure that everyone in Bricksville adheres to the government's plan about what should be done. In the final scene the micro-managers go to war against what are called the 'master builders', the creative ones, the entrepreneurs. I bet when members of the opposition are sitting there watching that movie and see that final scene they will be cheering for the micro-managers, because that is what we see from their comments about this legislation. The other concern we have about the government trying to decide which export market it would be best for marketers to sell to, rather than leaving it to the exporters, is that we need to be careful about the idea of giving Asia some priority. Yes, every exporter in the nation understands that there are many opportunities in Asia, just like there are many opportunities elsewhere around the world. But we have to be careful that we do not overrely on any one region in the world for our exports to go to. We have the example of the Woolworths and Coles effect on many small businesses, where small suppliers find that their market share of customer they sell to icontrols 40, 50 or more per cent of the market, so they simply become hostage to that customer. That is what we have to be very careful about with our exports. We currently have a situation where more than 25 per cent of our nation's exports go to one country. That exposes our nation to external risks. If something ever happens with that market, or some centralised control in that market decides they no longer like Australia goods for some reason, we have put ourselves at risk. What the opposition propose is to have greater emphasis, with some centralised plan, on encouraging exporters to go to Asia. Not only is that a flawed idea; it could have many adverse, unintended consequences. SoI am very pleased that this bill wipes that out. It levels the playing field. Under these coalition amendments, it will not matter where you export to the world, you get that eight years. There are some very successful exporters in my electorate of Hughes who received export development grants over the last financial year. I would like to mention them, congratulate them and thank them for the wonderful work that they do to drive prosperity, to create jobs and wealth in our nation. They are: Abel Metal Services of Moorebank, Beverly Hills Trading of Revesby, Control Systems Technology of Revesby, DV Import& Export Pty Ltd of Illawong, Deb Australia of Chipping Norton, Destination Consulting of Alfords Point, Orion Art of Engadine, Sphere Healthcare of Moorebank and W & S Plastics of Moorebank. I hope that I can stand in this parliament in 12 months time and be able to add a great number of companies in my electorate to that list. That is what we all should do as members of parliament. We should all be out talking about this amendment, talking it up in our electorates, saying, 'We as the government support you to go out and have a crack in the export market.' Every member of parliament should be doing this because that is what is going to drive prosperity. We need those small businesses out there taking the risks. That is exactly what this bill does. I commend it wholeheartedly to the House. Amendment Bill 2014. These changes will support manufacturers and producers in the Bendigo electorate and central Victoria. This scheme-which, I might add, was introduced by the Labor government many, many years ago, under Gough Whitlam-will not only offer financial assistance for aspiring exporters, it will offer support for current exporters. In my region, central Victoria, it has helped many over the years. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme encourages small and medium Australian businesses to develop their export markets. In the current period of economic transition it is critical that we continue to support these businesses, manufacturers and producers, in creating new opportunities to export their goods overseas. Bendigo, as I have said, is an area where we have a number of these small to medium enterprises. One of the strengths of our local manufacturing and producing community is its diversity, yet they come together to work well together under such organisations as the Bendigo Manufacturing Group. In Bendigo we are one of the major contributors to the Loddon-Mallee south region, with regional product estimated to be worth about $5 billion. Some of the big exporters are from the manufacturing sector in our region as well as food, financial and insurance services. We are in the Asian century, and Australia's futureaccordance with standing order no 43. The debate may resume at a later hour and the honourable will have leave to continue her remarks when the debate is resumed. Richmond Electorate: Margaret Olley Art Centre on Saturday. We opened the Margaret Olley Art Centre at the Tweed Regional Gallery at Murwillumbah-a remarkable event with more than 800 people and a wonderful tribute to a remarkable woman and a remarkable artist. Of course, Margaret Olley had many links with the Tweed. She spent some of her early years in Murwillumbah. It was also the last official function of the Governor General so it was a truly remarkable occasion. The centre has been constructed as an extension of the gallery and includes recreations of three of the rooms in Margaret's famous Sydney home, including the hat factory and the yellow room, where she spent many hours painting. It is an absolutely sensational centre. In 2011, the Margaret Olley Art Trust announced that the artist had bequeathed $1 million to establish a recreation of her studio and elements of her home.

58,Mrs Elliot (Richmond) (13:30,"I rise to speak about a great opening in my electorateTweed, where she had so many links. I was very proud, as the local MP, to have also delivered $1 million in federal funding for this wonderful project. I acknowledge the great support of the former arts minister, Simon Crean, and the previous Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, both of whom supported this project and committed the $1 million to the funding for it. It was a great occasion with so many people attending. I also acknowledge funding of more than $620,000 from the Tweed Gallery Foundation, $200,000 from the New South Wales government, $100,000 from the Friends of the Tweed Regional Gallery, and $1.2 million from the Tweed Shire Council. I acknowledge the remarkable work, in particular, of the Tweed Shire Council in ensuring this project was constructed and completed, and I also acknowledge the gallery director, Susi Muddiman. (Time expired) Capricornia Electorate: Catholic Diocese of Rockhampton Ms LANDRY (Capricornia) (13:33): I acknowledge the contribution of everyone helping drought-stricken communities in Queensland, where 80 per cent of the state are suffering. In particular, I acknowledge the Catholic Diocese of Rockhampton. Since January, the diocese has been running a drought relief appeal. So far it has raised $90,000 to help people affected by drought. On top of this, students at Catholic schools and colleges within the Rockhampton diocese have raised $10,000 towards the appeal. Father Matthew Moloney, the parish priest at Longreach, said around 220 families have so far received drought relief packages through this appeal while a further 100 families are awaiting their package. Families who have received packages live near Birdsville, Aramac, Barcaldine, Blackall, Jericho, Longreach, Muttaburra and a number of other communities worse hit by the drought. The Rockhampton Catholic diocese covers a huge part of central and western Queensland. At the heart of its headquarters is Rockhampton's historic St Joseph's Cathedral. It is here on May 29 that a new bishop will take up his role. Father Michael McCarthy was recently appointed the 10th Bishop of Rockhampton by Pope Francis in Rome. He is replacing long term bishop, Brian Heenan, who retired last year. Scullin Electorate: Employment Australian workers. In June of last year a leaked confidential document outlined ANZ Australia's intention to offshore 590 jobs from its Melbourne call centres to New Zealand and to the Philippines. These workers assist thousands of customers with their day-to-day banking. In response, staff established a working group, holding weekly meetings, and instigated a 'save our jobs' campaign. Employees displayed 'save our jobs' flags on their desks and other campaign materials in the workplace. Lunchtime barbecues were held to collect signatures on a petition, and employees secured the support of colleagues both within ANZ and across the wider finance sector. I note that Victoria's Opposition Leader, Daniel Andrews, assisted at community events and gathered signatures for the petition. In October, ANZ announced that the jobs would remain onshore.",87,Statements By Members
59,Mr Giles (Scullin) (13:33,"I rise to pay tribute to a brave and resourceful group ofI make particular mention of the work of Sandra Mikulandra and Christine Murray, who I am pleased to say still work for the ANZ in Melbourne, and Janelle Harris, who is now with the Finance Sector Union. I also acknowledge the efforts of Leon Carter, Carlton supporter Darren Martin, Mark Gepp and the finance sector union members who stood up for a fair go. I congratulate the members for their win today at the ACTU's Campaign of the Year Award. It is well-deserved. Since the GFC the finance sector has haemorrhaged tens of thousands of jobs. The workers whose jobs have been offshore live in our communities. They are our neighbours, our family members and our friends. This has all taken place while financial institutions have turned record profits. The fight for well-paid, secure jobs continues, but the workers at ANZ have showed us how to win. Lyons Electorate: Local Radio TYGA-FM, has been on air less than five years but is already a national award winner. TYGA-FM made its first transmission in 2009 to the people of the Derwent Valley and southern highlands area of my electorate of Lyons. The station operates 24 hours a day, with programs delivered by a diverse range of local volunteers overseen by a dedicated board of management. None of them get paid for their work, including Station Manager, Roz Chapman, who says she spends 40 hours a week on radio business on top of the small business that she runs in the main street of New Norfolk. She is supported by six other volunteer board members led by President, Steve 'Slabs' O'Halloran: they are locals Bruce Lamb, Cheryl McIntosh and Katrina and Scott Shaw. The volunteer base of announcers numbers 50, and is growing. TYGA-FM is an outstanding example of a community taking care of itself. Roz Chapman said that it was set up by the community to keep this rural region of Tasmania informed about what is happening in the Derwent Valley. Fundraising is currently underway to raise $25,000 to boost the station's transmission power. This will extend its reach to places like Molesworth and Ellendale that presently have no coverage. The TYGA-FM team recently won the 2013 Community Broadcasting Association of Australia's award for Excellence in Technical/IT Services. 98.9 FM is indeed the station to listen to when next in the Derwent Valley. Bendigo Electorate: Veteran Vintage and Classic Club Bendigo Parliament House the Veteran Vintage and Classic Club Bendigo. They have a passion for vintage cars, motorbikes, trailers and caravans. Currently, they are on their 45th anniversary rally to Canberra. Thirty-four members of the Bendigo based club are in Canberra on a 14-day rally to many sites around our nation's capital. Many of the vintage cars drove the 600 kilometres from Bendigo, whilst others came on trailers. So far the Veteran Vintage and Classic Club Bendigo have visited local sites, historic bridges and railway stations. They drove to the Tucker Box, which is a famous stop between Bendigo and Canberra.

I wish the veteran and classic club of Bendigo well and hope to catch them on their 55th anniversary rally to Canberra. Eden-Monaro Electorate: Country Shows Dr HENDY (Eden-Monaro) (13:37): I rise today to sing the praises of the various country shows held within my electorate of Eden-Monaro over the last four months. I think they have a great deal to offer families and the community in this internet age. Here is a chance for local communities to come together to show their wares and skills across a host of activities, ranging from art competitions and dressage events to cooking and baking competitions. All shows give locals the chance to show off the quality of their livestock and produce in competitions. It is also a chance for city folk to experience a slice of country life. As the local member it has been terrific getting out and about across my electorate. The show circuit started with Queanbeyan before Christmas. That was followed by Pambula, Candelo, Moruya, Nimmitabel, Cobargo, Bega, Braidwood, Bungendore, Dalgety, Delegate, Cooma, Bombala and Bemboka. I have managed to get to almost all those shows. That is a lot of sausage sandwiches! Last SaturdayI went to the Bombala show. Interestingly, there was a display of new technology. There was a drone in operation that took a video and photos from 100 metres above the showground. It has potential for both firefighting and farming applications. Bombala show is the last of our shows in Eden-Monaro before the Sydney Easter show. Every one of the various show organising committees and all the volunteers deserve our thanks. They are the lifeblood of their communities. Campania Sports and Social Club history room at the Campania Sports and Social Club in the electorate of Makin. The event was attended by hundreds of people, including many local dignitaries and club sponsors. The new library was officially opened by the Italian Ambassador, His Excellency Pier Francesco Zazo. The Campania club was built in the 1970s by the Italian community of Adelaide, many of whom originate from the Campania region of Italy. It is a major community facility for the broader community, particularly for the north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide. Facilities at the club include function rooms, newly constructed indoor bocce courts, a gaming room, a kids entertainment area and a very popular licensed bar and bistro. The club is run entirely by volunteers, who do a magnificent job in managing the centre, preparing meals, maintaining the facilities and providing a range of services to members. The library, which is one of several upgrades to the Campania club in recent times, was made possible through a grant of nearly $10,000 provided by the previous Labor government and will serve as both a library and a history and memorabilia display room. I congratulate the",89,Statements By Members

National Day of Action against Bullying and Violence a cause, campaign or service that is important to us and that helps our communities. TodayI am wearing a pin that champions a cause I am particularly passionate about. Friday's National Day of Action against Bullying and Violence is one of Australia's important antibullying events and is a chance to take a stand and promote the important work being done to stop bullying and violence in our schools, workplaces, sporting clubs and community groups. The Bully Zero Australia Foundation says that one in five Australians are bullied. Part of the day of action will be making our nation safer for every generation. Last week I visited Henry Kendall High School, in Gosford. This school is an outstanding example of one of my local schools getting behind this initiative. Principal Andrew Backhouse told me that Henry Kendall educates around 800 students from a range of backgrounds. It has an effective antibullying strategy that involves teachers, students and parents to change the culture for the better. School Captain Tahmyna Rad and Vice-Captain Abbey Willcox spoke with me and gave fantastic examples of how they work together with the school community to help stamp out any instance of bullying and work together to build a better culture of tolerance, respect and appreciation of others. They said that, as a result, the school feels more like a family than a set of classrooms. Hundreds of schools, including many on the coast, will be participating in the national day of action on Friday. I thank all schools in my electorate of Robertson for their role in taking a stand against bullying and violence. SPC Ardmona Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle) (13:42): I rise today to congratulate a constituent of mine whose social media campaign helped save a great Australian company that this government was prepared to abandon. On Thursday, 6 February, Linda Drummond, a resident of Merewether in my electorate of Newcastle, tweeted: Guys, to support SPC let's have a Twitter Peaches and Ice Cream night this Sunday Feb nine. And with that tweet, the grassroots SPC Sunday movement was born. I suspect few people would have predicted the avalanche of support that was to follow. SPC Sunday had more than 20 million mentions on Twitter and more than 10,000 Facebook likes. Support came from families and individuals alike, celebrities and even members of this House. Thousands of people around the country celebrated the contribution that SPC and their products make to our national fabric over breakfast, lunch and dinner. Shelves emptied, sales boomed and, thankfully, the Victorian government took notice when others failed to do so. Knowing that SPC's future in Australia was secure, Woolworths signed a $70 million deal with SPC Ardmona to supply 24,000 extra tonnes of produce. SPC Ardmona's managing director acknowledged that without Linda's support those deals could not have happened. Next time you sit down to a breakfast of baked beans, pack a fruit snack for your child's lunch box or mix some crushed tomatoes into your family pasta, think about Linda Drummond and thank her and the thousands of supporters of SPC Sunday for their faith in the power of people to make a difference.

63,Mrs Wicks (Robertson) (13:40,"Often in the House we wear lapel pins in recognition ofOcean Grove Primary School Ms HENDERSON (Corangamite) (13:44): I rise to express how pleased I was to visit Ocean Grove Primary School recently at the invitation of Principal Darryl Diment to present the school's leadership badges for 2014. Special congratulations must go to school captains Gabi Phillips and Charlie Hirst, who I am sure will do a great job, ably assisted by vicecaptains Kaia Young and Ted Murphy. The school's leadership team also includes Lily Drake, Ned Hicks, Taia Young, Sam Witherden, Aikie William, Noah Lever, Emily Henry, Chris McMahon, Erica Crawford, Angus Buchanan-Turnour, Tamsyn Staehr, Scott Campbell, Penny Wytkamp, Harrison Clark, Lilly Copperwaite, Oliver Bowers, Indigo Crawley and Lucy Carpenter. Recognising the fantastic work that schools do to foster leadership and good citizenship in their students is so important. That is why I am launching the Corangamite medal. In every participating school across my electorate, this program recognises one student in each primary and secondary school for outstanding citizenship. This is an important initiative, which I am hoping all schools in my electorate will embrace. As I said to the children of Ocean Grove Primary School, they are all leaders in their own way. As a government, we are working hard across every community to recognise the great work that schools do and to encourage our leaders of tomorrow. Indi Electorate: Benalla Art Gallery Ms McGOWAN (Indi) (13:45): Next month, the Benalla Art Gallery will uncover the bare truth of art in lndi when the winner of the 2014 Benalla Nude art prize is revealed. This award is for artwork depicting a naked human figure. With a prize of $50,000, the entries are sure to be blushingly good. Open only to Australian artists, the award is one of the most valuable in the art world and exposes the exciting arts and culture initiatives in the rural and regional art scene. The exhibition of the shortlisted entries will be open from 11 April until 27 June. I encourage all members to make the trip down the Hume Highway to Benalla to see for themselves the raw talent in the Australian art world, as well as the gallery's outstanding collection of Australian and international art. Situated on the Broken River, the gallery also has a tapestry of Sidney Nolan's Glenrowan, from his Ned Kelly series on permanent display. After the 2002 bushfires, artist Rick Amor was commissioned to create a work which responded to the blackened landscape. The result, The Arc aftermath of bushfires in the North East is well worth seeing. Congratulations to the Benalla Art Gallery for its work in bringing quality artistic experiences to Indi and neighbouring electorates. I thank the staff of the gallery for daring to hold such an innovative and prestigious event as the Benalla Nude.

Of course I have welcomed all requests for flags over my first six months as the member for Barker. In my role as member of this place, I am pleased to be able to provide Australian flags for notfor-profit organisations, schools, sporting organisations and other community groups in my electorate. It has been a great pleasure to present flags to the likes of Bedford-Heritage over the past six months, and I look forward to many more opportunities. Heritage is renowned for designing and manufacturing a diverse range of quality timber products for clients around Australia and the world. It produces an impressive range of services and products like presentation wine boxes, pallets, packing cases, screen-printing, building products, children's toys, plaques and other custom-made wooden products. Bedford's Australian Disability Enterprises are accredited to recognised industry standards. Being located in Mt Gambier, in the heart of the South Australia's pine tree and blue gum plantation timber forests, affords Heritage the ability to choose fine quality wood from some of the world's best timber mills to craft a large range of products. Youth Connections Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (13:48): TodayI rise to speak about a wonderful program that many of my colleagues have spoken about over the last few weeks-that is, Youth Connections. Youth Connections helps disengaged young people, generally aged between 13 to 19, to reconnect with education, training or employment. Youth Connections helps over 30,000 young Australians each year, around 20 per cent of whom are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. A recent study of the program found that 62 per cent of young people entering the program were generally completely disengaged from education, but that six months after exiting Youth Connections, 94.2 per cent were engaged in either education or employment, so the program works. Although a national program, it is run locally. In the ACT Youth Connections is run by Anglicare ACT, and helps over 1,000 young Canberrans each year. On the eve of Christmas last year, I received a letter from Anglicare ACT expressing extreme concern that the Abbott government was planning to cut funding for Youth Connections from the end of this year. RecentlyI visited Youth Connections and saw the impressive work they are doing in educating and counselling young Canberrans and making a difference. TodayI call on those opposite to go and meet with the Youth Connections operations in your electorates to see first hand the great work they are doing and to commit to funding the program beyond this year. There is nothing more important for the future of our economy than ensuring our young people-all young people-have access to education, training and work. Northern Territory expanding the Territory's horticultural industry and its capacity to be a major revenue source in the Top End. While there is a lot of talk about developing north Australia as the nation's food bowl, the jury is out on the Territory's capacity for development of broadacre crops such as rice and wheat. But what is well known in our part of the world is the wonderful work a number of hard-working pioneers have done over many years in developing the foundations of our thriving horticulture industry. The Territory is widely recognised for its mangoes, which is its largest horticultural product, with more than $62 million worth produced annually. To quote the Northern Territory mango industry, 'We are fast becoming the major",92,Statements By Members

Tindale, Mr Terry constituent and former southern New South Wales MUA branch secretary and legend of the Illawarra seafaring industry, who passed away last Monday after a long battle with illness. Terry first went to sea on 16 April 1947; he was only 14 years of age. He soon developed an enormous reputation for his seafaring skills and political and industrial commitment. He worked aboard many ships during his long career, most famously working on the iron boats the Iron Master and the Iron Yampi. Terry's achievements were legendary on the iron boats and in the land of the 'long red cloud', the name he gave to his home town, Port Kembla. He was also famous for his involvement in the South Coast Labour Council and as the official and branch secretary of the MUA. No problem was ever too big or small to take to Terry. No matter what it was, he was always happy to sit down and have a yack and make sure his men were well looked after. He was particularly proud of his grandson Ben, who followed his grandfather to sea and is a respected, active trade unionist and is known as an esteemed delegate. There are no two ways about it-Terry has left an indelible mark on the Illawarra seafaring landscape. My thoughts are with his wife Annette and three daughters Renay, Tracey and my colleague Danielle and their families at home. Vale Terry Tindale. You will be sadly missed mate. Ipswich Karate Club two of my young constituents-Jenae and Nathan Wilkinson from Mount Crosby. Jenae and Nathan are members of the Ipswich Karate Club who had just returned from competing at the National Seminar/Championships in Melbourne organised by the Japan Karate Association World Federation of Australia held earlier in March. Jenae and Nathan trained for three days with the top Japanese and Australian senseis before the tournament was held on the final day. Jenae received a bronze medal in the 11to 12-year-old girls kumite sixth to fourth kyu competition. Kumite is a form of sparring and is one of the three main sections for karate training. Nathan received a bronze medal for up to eight-year-old boys kumite sixth to fourth kyu competition. A team of 10 members in the Ipswich Karate Club competed at the event including six juniors and four seniors. The team brought home 14 medals between them, including by Jenae and Nathan's mum, Wendy, who received a silver medal in the open women's kumite. The team is now planning for their next trip which will include training in Tokyo in preparation for the 2015 Australian titles. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I know, you will join me as a fellow Queenslander in welcoming our friend Bruce McIver, who is in the gallery today.

68,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (13:54,"I have recently been approached by the Jointdelegation. This delegation is a well-established tradition, having visited various cities across Australia since 1978. Over that time and up until 2010, the military delegation was recognised as an official visit and received consequential support from the federal government. Unfortunately, due to the global financial crisis, they did not visit in 2011 and, therefore, that support has ceased. In Australia there are more than 350,000 people of Greek descent and the commemoration at the Battle of Crete and the Greek campaign is most relevant for those with this heritage, as well as for many other Australians who have ANZAC ancestry. During the First World War, nearly 60 Australians of Greek origin served overseas with the Australian armed forces, many of whom lost their lives. These men were from a range of towns and cities such as Tamworth, Melbourne, Mackay, Adelaide and Bendigo. These ANZACs, along with many other Australians, are buried in Crete and in Athens, something the Hellenic military delegation seeks to commemorate this visit. This is an important acknowledgement of the ties between Australia and Greece. I believe they should receive federal government support. I have written to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, asking that the support be reinstated. I believe that everyone in this House would support such a measure. Penrith City Festival Ms SCOTT (Lindsay) (13:56): This Saturday Penrith will come alive with between 15,000 and 20,000 people taking to the streets to enjoy the Penrith City Festival. The festival is firmly entrenched in the community calendar as a family fun event bringing valuable tourism dollars to the region. This year, for the first time, the festival has added a schools business challenge, where four local schools will face off in a block styled competition to build a sustainable home. There will be over 100 food and business stalls. The parade, which I will be participating in, starts at 12.30 pm and will feature local schools, the best dressed vintage queen, stilt walkers, astronauts promoting the much-awaited iFLY Downunder, an indoor sky-diving facility which will be the first in Australia, free community games including noughts and crosses, snakes and ladders, bowling and much more. Local businesses and charities will be on show. The festival promises to be a fun-filled day for families across our region. To add harmony and colour to the festival, the NRL will be at Jamison Park from 10 am, featuring football games and stalls as part of its Harmony Day activities. I look forward to catching up again with my good friend Nathan Pentecost and his wheel chair rugby league team. I encourage you all to make your way to the foot of the mountains this Saturday because we have it all happening in Penrith. And if there is still not enough for you to do, at 4.30 pm the mighty Panthers will take on the Canterbury Bulldogs. Re-Engineering Australia Foundation Ms MacTIERNAN (Perth) (13:57): The Re-Engineering Australia Foundation is a fantastic, not-for-profit organisation which is unleashing in school students a passion and facility for engineering, science and maths. Today it was very energising to visit their school technology challenge in Canberra Exhibition Centre and to see the Western Australian teams from Balga Senior High School and from Wesley College and the model Formula One cars they have designed and built. Balga senior high school team is made up of young people from refugee backgrounds. I met members from Burma, Thailand and Vietnam. They said that their cultural diversity really powers them and unites them in a common goal. They have come to Canberra as a team with the goal of competing against the best and to make themselves, their school and their families proud. Indeed, they have done that. Wesley College is fielding two teams-the quantum racing team and the fusion team. Quantum have told me that they strive to do what some deem impossible. We endeavour to push the boundaries, to do what has never been done before, just as in the quantum world. I want to congratulate Doctor Michael Myers, the founder and chair, and all of the committed teachers who are ensuring that Australia will have a great economic future. Greater Western Sydney Giants Well there's a big, big sound from the west of the town. It is the sound of the Mighty Giants. It was great on Saturday night to attend the game with the member for Blaxland. The member for McMahon is over there and he is a great fan as well. I am sure he was there with his children. It was great to join them with the Mighty Giants. It was not a thunderstorm we heard Madam Speaker; it was the sound of the boys becoming men has to turn the tables on their cross-city rivals, the Sydney Swans. To give you an idea of the magnitude of what they achieved, the last time these two teams met the Swans triumphed by 130 points. So to win by 30 points was indeed a great achievement.

Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places. Australian Water Holdings Prime Minister. When did the Prime Minister become aware of the issues that have caused Senator Sinodinos to stand aside today? statement a few moments ago. Deregulation Ms HENDERSON (Corangamite) (14:02): My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that businesses like Kerr's Hire in Geelong are currently burdened with registering short-term hire leases, a process that is costly and unnecessary. How will the government's $720 million red tape repeal day help Kerr's Hire and all small businesses across the nation? for her question and I understand her interest. I also understand Kerr's Hire's concerns because, under the rules as they stand, many short-term leases have to be registered-this means more form filling, more time wasting and more unnecessary expense. Red tape repeal day will fix this, as it will tackle many other instances of redundant and unnecessary regulation. No-one likes filling in forms-it costs time, it costs money and it costs jobs. That is why red tape repeal day is so important. I can advise the House that red tape repeal day will involve the attempt to scrap about 1,000 redundant acts of parliament, it will seek to remove almost 10,000 unnecessary or counterproductive regulations-it will seek to take 50,000 pages off the statute book-and it will deliver $720 million in red tape cost reductions this year and every year. This is good news for the businesses, the consumers and the workers of our country. It is at the heart of this government's agenda to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. And don't we need to get red tape down! Under the former government Australia's world competitiveness ranking slipped six places in just four years to 21. Under the former government, our burden of government regulation ranking sunk to No. 128 in the world-we are behind Romania but don't worry, we are still better than Angola. Under the former government, our productivity growth ranking slipped to second-last in the world-the only country we beat when it came to productivity growth was Botswana. This government will tackle the red tape which is suffocating Australian businesses by lighting the biggest bonfire of regulation in our history. Australian Water Holdings Prime Minister.

Infrastructure Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. How is the government building the infrastructure Western Australia needs to ensure the state's productivity and economic growth into the future, especially in my electorate of Hasluck? What hurdles are standing in the way of that goal? Regional Development) (14:07): I thank the honourable member for his question, because he knows that the only way that Western Australians will get the infrastructure that they need and deserve is from a coalition government. If Western Australia is to get world-class infrastructure it will be a coalition government that will provide it. Yesterday, the member for Grayndler claimed that the Gateway project in Western Australia was a 'fully funded $1 billion project under the previous Labor government', but the money was going to come from the mining tax, and the mining tax has not raised any money-so it was not a fully funded project. When he was speaking on 20 November about the repeal of the mining tax he also listed another lot of Western Australian projects, all of which he said were funded by the mining tax, such as the Great Northern Highway stage 2, $152 million to the North West Coastal Highway and the Swan Valley bypass. The reality is that the mining tax has not raised any money. Now, if the member for Grayndler does not think that is a problem, perhaps he should talk to the member for Lilley, the former Treasurer, because the member for Lilley said on Perth radio on 25 March 2011, 'Revenue from the mining resource rent tax goes to investment in infrastructure projects, like the Gateway project in Western Australia around the airport.' Then he went on to say, 'If we don't have the revenue from the tax, we can't make the investments.' So the then Treasurer belled the cat. He made it absolutely clear that if you do not raise any money from the mining tax you do not get the projects. So Western Australians need to be aware of the fact that no money from the mining tax meant no Gateway project for Perth, no North West Highway projects. The money was not there. It was not fully funded. The mining tax has failed to deliver the revenue that would enable these projects to be built. Mr Albanese: Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order, which goes to relevance. The Gateway WA project is under construction right now. Mr Albanese: It is not an apparition. He is misleading parliament. It is under construction. There are trucks and roads. more soil with his shovel than they ever did with bulldozers.

Deregulation Treasurer outline the importance of freeing business and reducing regulation, and how will red tape repeal day help the constituents of Bennelong? Bennelong for his question and recognise his previous experience as a senior business person and as a leading global athlete. An honourable member interjectingit is to free the shackles from business and enterprise, remove regulation, reduce the burden of red and green tape and get rid of taxes. As the Prime Minister said a little bit earlier-it is graphic but it is real-today, we have a bonfire of regulation. Fifty thousand pages from the statute books are being brought to an endMr Perrett interjectingparliament. That is a huge amount. It is a massive burden on business, and the best way to help business is to lift that burden. The best way to help the economy is to free it up to give people the chance to get on with their lives without Canberra telling them how they should behave and what they should do. Of course, there is a financial benefit as well. It has already been identified that the FOFA reforms alone will benefit the Australian economy by over $700 million. There is a $90 million one-off implementation save, and $190 million will be saved every year. Those savings alone help to make it easier for business to do its business and simplify the process for consumers. The member for McMahon said that this is all a stunt. Getting rid of regulation, according to the Labor Party, is a stunt; it is meaningless. That is because the Labor Party is the best friend of regulation. The Labor Party is the best friend of control over business. The fact is that the Labor Party not only introduced 22,000 new regulations in just five years but they also left behind a burden of 92 announced but never legislated taxation initiatives, which added to the complexity of the taxation system for business. SoI say to the Labor Party: do not do the damage in opposition that you did in government; get out of the way and help us to get rid of bad regulation. Australian Water Holdings Prime Minister.

Agriculture the minister that Hinkler cane farmers have told me that, due to high energy prices, they are on the brink of collapse. What is the government doing to address the high cost of irrigation in Hinkler and elsewhere? Nationals) (14:18): I thank the member for Hinkler. We were up in the member for Hinkler's area not that long ago and had to deal with cane farmers. One of them is spending $135,000 a quarter-over $540,000 a year-on power. One of the major reasons that they are spending that sort of money is because of an issue that is being debated over in the other place at this moment, which is, of course, the carbon tax. It is just like how the member for Blair keeps his people poor. They are trying to keep them poor up in Central Queensland as well. What we are trying to do, obviously, is remove the carbon tax and, by removing the carbon tax, start letting more money go back through the farm gate-back to those families, back to those mums and dads-and put dignity back in these farmers' lives. The cane industry is a very important industry. It is one of the major industries in Queensland. Seventy per cent of Australia's sugar canegrowers rely on irrigation to produce a crop, and so much of the time irrigation relies on power. That is the only way you can do it. But what we have seen hereMr Perrett interjectinggetting there. I will tell you where the journey started. I can remember when Peter Garrett told us that we were going to have six-metre sea rises by 2100. Remember that? I felt like buying a case of beer and going down to Coogee Beach to wait for the show, but it never happened. I read up on Bjorn Lomborg, who said we have had 30 centimetres in the last 150 years, but they are punting on six metres by the end of the century. It is quite spectacular. But it does not stop there. The member for Isaacs talked about what was 'routinely called the greatest market failure the world has ever seen'.

Deregulation How will universities benefit from the red tape repeal day, which will reduce the burden of regulation and red tape in the higher education system? pleased to get a question from the member for Macarthur about red tape repeal day, because the higher education sector-the university sector-are the big winners from red tape repeal day, from deregulation and from the cutting of reporting requirements and red tape that surrounds the university sector. Red tape repeal day next week will have a major impact on the cost base of universities in terms of their interface with government. For example, red tape repeal day, and other decisions that we have already taken in the tertiary education sector in relation to the Australian Research Council or the tertiary education regulator, will see the elimination of unnecessary red tape and reporting requirements that have required universities to tell the government detail about the size, condition, rooms and utilisation of their buildings. We trust universities to know where their buildings are and that they have them and how to utilise them.

There will be a single national database for university reporting, so government departments will coordinate with each other, rather than putting that burden of coordination on the university sector. We will abolish the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. This is a whole new level of regulation and red tape on the university sector, which the university sector themselves said in their submission to the Commission of Audit. They said: The Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission (ACNC) has imposed a new, inefficient and unnecessary layer of regulatory and reporting burden on universities. They went on to say: Universities are now required to provide detailed annual financial reports to the ACNC, notwithstanding universities are already required to supply such information to at least 6 other Government Departments. We are going to abolish that level of regulation and red tape. The Australian Research Council has streamlined their guidelines for application, and the tertiary education regulator, TEQSA, has been directed to return to its core business of registering providers and accrediting courses, rather than its thematic, sector-wide investigations into quality, which was never its core business. So it is getting on with its core business and letting universities use their resources to get on with their core business. We are unambiguously students first, unlike the Labor party which has always been for regulation and administration. Assistant Treasurer Prime Minister.

The member for Moreton then left the chamber. turning the paradigm of government on its head. The previous government, every day, boasted of how many laws they had passed. For the first time, we have a government that is committed to repealing laws, to removing that regulation and red tape. I want to give honourable members some examples in my own portfolio of practical changes being made today that are very important for businesses. For example: at the moment, under the law, every radio station-no matter how small-has to provide audited accounts every year. We have changed the law so that ACMA, the regulator, has the discretion to not require that with smaller stations. Steve Everett of ACE radio in Victoria, which has six stations in that category, says that this will not only reduce his workload but also cut his audit fees in half. These are real practical savings for business. Another example relating to the television industry: at the moment ACMA, the regulator, has no discretion-when a complaint is made, it has to investigate it. A good example: WIN TV in Queensland broadcast an article in 2002 and 2005. There was a complaint about it in 2009-seven years after the first broadcast and four years after the second. ACMA had no choice-it had to investigate it, and duly found in August 2010 that there had been no breaches. That is the sort of red tape that we are removing, and there are many other examples in the telecommunications sector as well. Another key difference between our approach and that of our predecessor is the way we are dealing with industry. My predecessor, Senator Conroy, used to talk to industry leaders one at a time-privately, so he could always tell each one what they wanted to hear. And these episodes of sycophancy-private sycophancy-then of course resulted in collective belligerence when they realised he had told each of them something different. What we are doing is dealing with the industry leaders openly. We met with the broadcasting chief executives and the telecom chief executives-dealing with industry openly so the public can see what we are doing and so they know that what we are doing is freeing business to do its job of delivering services more cost-effectively to all Australians.

Child CareI refer the minister to the report in the Australian on 3 March 2014 indicating that hundreds of childcare centres across the nation are being forced to break the former government's childcare regulations just to remain open. How will the government's red tape repeal agenda help to address this issue? Ms LEY (Farrer-Assistant Minister for Education) (14:35): Thank you to the member for Barton, in whose electorate I spent some time last week-at the Kogarah RSL, having a round table discussion with childcare providers and services. From the member for Barton's electorate I heard the same things I have been hearing from members on this side of the House for a long time now. We know that the new framework under which the childcare sector operates contains more than 1,000 pages of regulation and more than 1,000 pages of guidelines and is often described by those who have to comply with it as 'overwhelming', 'terrifying', and 'drowning in regulation'. The Labor Party always comes back to us with the same line. They say that regulation and red tape keep children safe. Well, I have news for the Labor Party-red tape does not keep children safe. In fact, it may well do the opposite. Every day I speak to educators who say things like this: 'Why did we become educators in the child care system? Because we love children, because we connect with them, we have a bond with them, and we want to care for and nurture them.' What we do not want to doMs LEY: is spend hours and hours of our time filling out reports. For example, if a childcare centre has an assessment it has to produce on demand a report card about a particular child. I am told that takes 22 hours to write. In fact, directors of centres are giving educators extra time to do the paperwork. So, when you meet these wonderful, caring women Ms LEY: and some men-who nurture the next generation, where are they? Are they on the floor engaging with the children, or reading, or teaching? No, they are locked in the director's office doing the paperwork. The member for Barton talked about breaking regulations to open centres, because Labor was so inflexible when it introduced this regime. It said, 'if we do not have the exact ratios complied with for every second of the day, then you cannot stay open'. So, if I am a centre director who gets to work to find one of my preschool teachers called in sick and I cannot find another on short notice, I cannot replace that person with a qualified educator who is not a preschool teacher, but who might still be qualified with an Certificate III in Education. InsteadI have to ring the department and get permission to open my centre. This is ridiculous. This is madness.

151,Mr Hogan (Page) (14:41,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business. I remindmember for Page, not only for his question but for the outstanding work he does as an advocate for small businesses, family enterprises and farming businesses throughout his electorate. It is great that they have such a strong advocate here. We are getting on with the job of creating the right environment, so that businesses in Page and right across Australia can grow and prosper. That is why we keep bringing forward opportunities to cut the red tape that is strangling so many enterprises in this economy. That is why we are seeking to have this parliament support the government's measure to save business $44 million by removing the compulsory pay-clerk burden that is imposed on them under the former government's Paid Parental Leave scheme. That is $44 million of savings for businesses, and for those interested in the not-for-profit community it is a $4 million dollar saving for them as well. Not only do we, and the electorate, think that is a good idea, but ACCI surveyed its members and found 84.3 per cent of those businesses either agreed or strongly agreed that the government should not be requiring employers to be the paymaster for the Paid Parental Leave scheme. I would hope that message is getting through to those opposite. We have tried before to get this burden lifted. There has been no credible policy argument about why this cost and compliance imposition need be there. Yet, Labor has rejected those efforts on every occasion. Now we have seen all the state chambers of commerce come out and tell them to get behind what the government is doing. There is a chorus of support across the small business community. But what will Labor actually do? Like small business people, I am perpetually optimistic. I am hoping that with 'repeal day' Labor will now come and join with the small businesses in Page and in the wider community to repeal this burden. There is some cause for optimism. Earlier today the Leader of the Opposition said, 'We are committed, in a bipartisan spirit, to the organised and ongoing effort to minimise and simplify, and create cost effective regulation.' Well, I heard the words, but I am particularly unconvinced, and we must see what actually happens. Small businesses know that there is a cost to compliance. They know that compliance tasks are not cheap, but will the Leader of the Opposition's words be cheap? We are not sure. The form is not good and it is not encouraging. It was as far back as 2008 that a former small business minister-and yes, there were six of them under Labor-Craig Emerson came out and said Labor was, 'promising to take a giant pair of scissors to red tape that is strangling small business'. He went on to say, 'it has accumulated around the necks of small business for the best part of 20 years'. Well, what did they do? They added 21,000 new or amended regulations. You have seen us fall down the ladder of the government's regulatory impact on business. Let us see if Labor walks the talk.

153,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Leader of the Opposition) (14:44): My question is to theis determined to uphold high standards in public life. Senator Sinodinos stepping aside this morning is in the best Westminster tradition. Ukraine situation in Ukraine is of deep concern in my electorate of the La Trobe. Will the minister update the House on Australia's response to recent developments in the Ukraine? Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Minister for Foreign Affairs) (14:45): I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I note his deep interest in this issue. I can confirm to the House that, overnight, Russian President Vladimir Putin took action to annex Crimea. TodayI announce the Australian government will impose targeted financial sanctions and travel bans against those who have been instrumental in the Russian threat to Ukraine's sovereignty. The actions taken by Russia are a clear violation of international rules prohibiting the use of force and protecting the territorial integrity of states. International law does not allow one state to steal the territory of another on the basis of a referendum that cannot be considered free or fair. The referendum carried out in Crimea on 16 March was not authorised by Ukraine and was carried out while Russian forces were, effectively, in control of the territory. It cannot form the legitimate basis of any alteration to the status of Crimea. I condemn in the strongest possible terms the use of violence against Ukraine and its citizens. The situation in Ukraine remains serious, with the potential for military confrontation. The fatal attack on a Ukrainian serviceman in Crimea is to be deplored and underlines the volatility of the crisis that Russia is fuelling. Australia has stood with the international community in condemning Russia's actions in Crimea. We joined with 12 other nations in the United Nations Security Council voting on a resolution that declared the referendum could have no validity. No member opposed this resolution, except Russia. Australia's response to Russia's actions is aligned with the action taken by the EU, the United States and Canada, who have also implemented a number of targeted sanctions and travel bans. Measures have been taken in close coordination with our friends and allies, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan. Overnight, I spoke with foreign secretary William Hague, who acknowledged Australia's support in his speech to the House of Commons last night. I have also spoken with the interim Ukrainian foreign minister. Australia has taken these actions in solidarity and support for a rules based international order. This is in our core national interest to promote peace, stability and security. I reaffirm in unequivocal terms Australia's support for Ukraine's territorial integrity. I continue to urge Russia to abide by its international obligations and behave as a responsible member of the international community. I urge Russia to return to constructive diplomatic dialogue. parliaments who are with us today. I make them welcome. We also have the Mayor of the Northern Grampians Shire. You are most welcome.

Australia has a special responsibility as a member of the Security Council to join the international community in taking strong action to make clear our condemnation of the moves by Russia to annex Crimea and of the fatal attack on the Ukrainian serviceman in Crimea. We urge Russia to reconsider its actions. Australian Water Holdings Prime Minister. I refer to his previous answers in today's question time about ministerial standards.

It is my job to ensure that standards of decency in public life are upheld. And that is precisely what has happened today. Senator Sinodinos has done the right and honourable thing. I am proud of him and I am looking forward to his return to the ministry. Asylum Seekers Border Protection. Will the minister update the House on implementation of the full range of the government's border protection policies and any impediments that exist to their implementation? thank the member for Canning for his question. Those on this side of the House could not be more supportive of strong measures on our borders. But with the member for Canning, I think there is no member in this House on this side who is a stronger supporter of our border protection measures-not just now but over a long period of time. Dr Chalmers interjectingor leave-one or the other. the Senate in Western Australia, the now Minister for Defence, the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Linda Reynolds, who has 30 years experience in the ADF, know-the importance of strong border protection measures.

162,Mr Morrison,"The reason for that is he knows-like the Liberals who are running forI can report to the member for Canning that we are getting results because we are doing what we said we would do. We went to the election with a strong commitment to put in policies that we knew worked, that did work and that are working again. The result of that is 90 days since we have had a successful people-smuggling venture to this country. It was three months ago, on 19 December last year, when we last saw a successful venture; in the same three-month period 12 months ago, 2,591 people turned up on 47 vessels under the previous government's policies. As a result of this we have been able to establish another 4,000 places in the Special Humanitarian Program to give visas to people who were waiting under their laws and their failures. There are four centres that we have been able to close, and we will be closing more on the mainland because of the success of our policies. But there are frustrations-and those frustrations sit opposite. They still want to give permanent visas to the more than 30,000 people who turned up on their watch and still sit here in this country today. That is their policy. Yesterday in the Senate they teamed up with the Greens again and they voted against the restoration of temporary protection visas. Some leaders of the opposition are referred to as small targets. This Leader of the Opposition is just small. He is not big enough to rise above his union background, and he is not big enough to let go of the policy failures of the Labor Party when they were in government. He should free himself from the shackles of Labor's policy failures on border protection and he should support the policies of this government that are delivering stronger borders and are stopping the boats. Assistant Treasurer Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's previous answers today. The New South Wales ICAC confirmed it was investigating Australian Water Holdings in early February. Why did it take more than a month before Senator Sinodinos stood aside and what has changed between today and the last 40 days? Sinodinos has decided to step aside for the good of the government. He has done the right and the honourable thing and he should be given credit by members opposite.

I refer the minister to reports in the Moree Champion of 4 March 2014 that at least 20 units of public housing are sinking into the ground. What caused the situation, and what is the government's response? Parkes for his question. I acknowledge his great representation in this place of that large area of central and western New South Wales. Indeed, I have seen the report that the honourable member refers to about public housing built in Moree under the previous Labor government's so-called Nation Building Program. That report indicated that many of these 62 units are actually falling apart. They are falling apart. The foundations are collapsing into the drainage and sewerage systems, windows are cracking-so much so that many of the 62 residents of those new units, funded by the previous Labor government, are having to move away from Moree to towns all over New South Wales because there is insufficient public housing. In fact, why did this happen? This happened becauseMr Brendan O'Connor interjectingMoree's notoriously shifty black soil. That is why it occurred.

Australia has also prescribed the al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant as terrorist organisations under our Criminal Code listing regime. We are concerned about the radicalisation of Australians as a result of the Syrian conflict, particularly those who travel to Syria and return to Australia with capabilities acquired through fighting or training with extremist groups. I am aware of reports of the death of an Australian ADF member in Syria. I can inform the House that the individual was not a serving ADF member. The individual joined the Australian Army in February 2009 and was discharged in September 2010, following around three months absence without leave. He held the rank of sapper and had basic engineering training. We do remain deeply concerned for the safety of Australians in Syria. The security situation is extremely dangerous, with ongoing military conflict, kidnapping and terrorist attacks. We will continue to review the cancellation of passports to prevent breaches of the arms embargo. Foreign ministers current and former have exercised their discretionary power under the Australian Passports Act to cancel passports. I also remind the House that Australia co-authored UN Security Council resolution 2139 on the humanitarian situation in Syria. This was supported by all members of the Security Council. In addition, Australia has provided around $111 million in humanitarian assistance. We have also provided $2 million to assist with the work on the elimination of chemical weapons in Syria.

Ms LANDRY: I rise to inform the House that I have been defamed and wrongly accused in a letter to the editor published on page 10 of today's Bundaberg NewsMail. The letter was written by Stephen Beiger of Burnett Heads. I quote directly from the letter: Will Keith Pitt ask Tony Abbott whether he can get the $20,000 Michelle Landry spent on travel rorts for her family using taxpayers' money? After all, her website declares she is a ""firm believer in giving back to the community"" and it will not be new money being spent, just refunded public monies illegally used by a politician. The author then goes on to suggest that the $20,000 would be better spent on a memorial in Bundaberg. The author, Stephen Beiger of Burnett Heads, and the Bundaberg NewsMail have completely got the wrong person. This statement is untrue and defamatory. I table this newspaper letter and make these points. Point 1: I have never been involved, investigated nor accused of a travel rort. Point 2: I have never spent $20,000 on travel expenses for my family.

The first claim was that this scheme, which is taxpayer subsidised to provide low-rental dwellings for the low-paid workers of Australia, in this particular case had not been used to house low-income workers of Australia but had been used for up to 1,500 international students.

Ms PLIBERSEK: Madam Speaker, I will move to the next claim that the minister made yesterday.

I call upon those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places-",125,Private Members Business
261,Dr Leigh,5 minutes.,126,Matters Of Public Importance
262,The Speaker (15:23,"I have received a letter from the honourable the member forgovernment to release the National Commission of Audit report before the Western Australia Senate election. Members will be aware that, as of yesterday, Western Australians began voting in the biggest by-election in the history of our nation. From Rockingham to Marble Bar, from Esperance to Broome, Western Australians began voting yesterday. The election day is not until 5 April, but Western Australians has already begun voting. But as they vote, they do not know the content of the Commission of Audit report, which is in the hands of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. They do not know what cuts are in store, what services will be removed or what infrastructure will not be funded. They do not know what the impact of the Commission of Audit report will be on their families, on their communities and on their business, yet they are being asked to vote. WhatI find even more curious about that is that yesterday the Western Australian Liberal Party circulated to all Western Australian voters a how to vote card. That how to vote card directed Western Australians to vote for the Liberal Party. The how to vote card was circulated as a simple election campaigning technique and it invites Western Australians to vote for the Liberal Party in box 'R'. Here is the point: when Western Australians do not know the cuts that are in store for them, when Western Australians do not know the services that will be removed, I know that Western Australians will kick the Liberal Party right in the arse. They will do that because Western Australians do not appreciate being taken for granted by this government. Western Australians do not appreciate that they should be asked one more time to turn up at the polling booths, one more time to cast their votes, one more time to cast their votes for a Liberal Party and for a Prime Minister who do not treat Western Australians with the regard that all Australians demand and that all Australians should reasonably expect. We were told before the election that there would be a Commission of Audit, that that Commission of Audit report would be published and that that Commission of Audit report would be available before the budget in May. What we now discover is that 1¼ million Western Australians will be turning up to vote without knowing the impact of the cuts to education, to health, to pensions, to the ABC or to the SBS. We do not know the impact of those cuts on the tourism industry or on the resources sector. We do not know the impact of those costs in a state with an economy that desperately needs infrastructure. Yet Western Australians from Wyndham to Eucla, from Esperance to Marble Bar, are being asked to turn up to vote-and they should vote. When they vote, they will kick the Liberal Party in the arse. We know that because the Western Australians will not be taken for granted. It is simply unacceptable that Mr Hockey says that the government hopes to adopt a great majority of the recommendations from the Commission of Audit, while the government keeps the Commission of Audit report and the cuts under wraps. The issue does demand enough time and it deserves the consideration of the Western Australian people. They should be able to understand the cuts that are before them in the Commission of Audit. It seems to me to be reasonable, to be transparent. It seems to me that it is about openness and about certainty. But the only certainty is that the Commission of Audit's draft report has been in the hands of the Prime Minister and of the Treasurer now for many weeks. We are told that it is 900 pages. We are told that it represents a lot of thinking. But we also know it is cloaked in secrecy. We can only then assume that it is hiding wrong priorities and nasty cuts because we have not been told of the contents of this Commission of Audit report before the election.",126,Matters Of Public Importance
263,Mr Gray (Brand) (15:23,"The MPI today notes the urgent need for the AbbottWestern Australians know all too well that Liberals often say one thing before an election and then do quite the opposite afterwards. They have seen Colin Barnett's broken promises on health, on education and on road and rail. They should be rightly worried about what the current Prime Minister's secret Commission of Audit has in store for them in their health and education services. This time last year the Prime Minister said how much he respects the Premier of state of Western Australia. He said how much he has learnt from the Premier of Western Australia. The current Prime Minister also said how much he wished to model himself on Colin Barnett, should he be elected to lead our country. The Prime Minister said that on 17 February last year. Colin Barnett lost Western Australia's AAA credit rating-actually lost it is not true, he gave it away. He gave it away with wrong spending priorities, with imprudent budgeting manners and with an incompetent approach to budget management which is reminiscent of what we see now in the secrecy that cloaks the Commission of Audit report. An example of the cuts made by Premier Barnett in Western Australia, fully endorsed by the federal Liberal party-by every single federal Liberal in both chambers of parliament-was the $185 million cut from WA schools, including the sacking of 350 teachers and education assistants and the 30 per cent cut in support to school programs for children with learning difficulties and literacy and numeracy programs. All of this came from a Premier who did not tell the people of Western Australia about the cuts that he had in mind. I remind members of this chamber that the existence of a secret document purporting to make cuts to spending in the state of Western Australia is a serious matter. We know of the Western Australian government's own incompetence, losing their AAA credit rating, and that the Fiona Stanley Hospital is being delivered a year late after mismanagement from the Barnett government. We know that the promised $180 million redevelopment of the Royal Perth Hospital has been shelved. We know that 40 hospital beds and 200 staff will be cut from the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth. These are all major public hospitals in Western Australia. One hundred and eighty-eight million dollars has been cut from hospital upgrades in regional Western Australia, including in Karratha, Tom Price, Newman, Collie, Northam, Katanning, Merredin, Narrogin and Manjimup. These are communities that do not simply contribute to the great wealth of Western Australia; they are communities that contribute to the great wealth of our nation. They are communities that contribute to the well-being of our nation. They are being to asked to vote today but have not been told of the content and the nature of the cuts that are in store in the Commission of Audit report that is currently cloaked in secrecy in the Prime Minister's office and in the Treasurer's office. We have seen this before. Tony Abbott says one thing before the people vote but he plans to do exactly the opposite after the election. The Western Australia Senate election is on 5 April and early voters are out there voting now. Do we, in this place, think it is reasonable that they should cast their votes without knowing the content of the report of the Commission of Audit? Of course we don't. It is a disgrace. It is an outrage. It is actually an embarrassment and an affront to our parliament and to our democratic system that people should be asked to vote without knowing what this government has in store for them. We do know the government has received the report, we know the report is 900 pages long, we know it is cloaked in secrecy and we know it goes to every area of federal government operations-we know it goes to schools; we know it goes to health care; we know it goes to hospitals; we know it goes to roads; we know it goes to grain rail infrastructure in Western Australia. As our farmers are once again seeding their crops in the dry farming wheat belt of Western Australia, they will not know the circumstances that underpin the funding of grain rail infrastructure by this Commonwealth government, because this government will not tell them. Western Australians will be required to turn up to vote, and they should vote. And when they vote, Western Australians will carefully consider that ballot paper. The ballot paper is one metre in length and contains more political candidates than we have ever seen in Western Australia. It provides the perfect opportunity for Western Australians to treat this government with the contempt that they deserve-for Western Australia is to kick this government in the Rs. withdrawn from the Hansard. because that is where they are on the ballot paper. on this side of the chamber were sitting, listening and waiting for the killer punch from the Labor Party. Perhaps we were a little misled because, as is traditionally the case with the Australian Labor Party, there was no knockout blow. All we got was wet lettuce, a bit of whiffle and a bit of waffle on how the coalition government should be held to task by the electors of Western Australia. The fact is that the people of Western Australia have spoken once and they will speak again. The Australian Labor Party may need reminding of what the message was at the last federal election from the people Western Australia. I have got every confidence, knowing the quality of Western Australian representation on this side of the chamber, that the people will deliver a clear and consistent message once again to the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party simply is not listening. The message they delivered at the last election, and the message that I am very confident Western Australians will deliver again on 5 April, is that they want anti-Western Australian taxes like the carbon tax and the mining tax to go. They clearly said to the Australian Labor Party 'We do not want your mining tax and we do not want your carbon tax.' Those two taxes, more than any other crazy notion that the Australian Labor Party put forward over their six years of government taxes, have been positively working against the Western Australian economy. When I see the shadow minister stand up at the dispatch box and when I hear the shadow minister from Western Australia say, 'Well, do you know what, Western Australians do not like a government that says one thing before the election and then does something completely different afterwards', I scratch my head. I remind the Labor Party, I do not think that it was too long ago that this was exactly what Western Australians got from the Australian Labor Party. Who can forget Julia Gillard who, down the barrel of the camera, said 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Then the Australian Labor Party was elected and it introduced a carbon tax. Who could forget the Australian Labor Party wanting to burden one of the pinnacle industries of Western Australia, the mining industry, with its so-called resource super profits tax. They sent off more money through the minerals resource rent tax. We know that the Australian Labor Party liked to do all kinds of modelling saying that this mining tax was going to generate some $15 billion or $16 billion worth of revenue, only to",127,Matters Of Public Importance

265,Mr Gray,"No, the last word I used was taking the letter R and making it a plural-Rs",129,Matters Of Public Importance
266,The Deputy Speaker,I read it differently so I thank you for the clarification.,129,Matters Of Public Importance
267,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (15:34): Those of usfind that in reality it delivered a miserly $300 million or $400 million and at the expense of imposing huge amounts of red tape, driving down investment, increasing sovereign risk and, ultimately, increasing unemployment. All of this was as a consequence of Labor's mining tax. The other interesting thing that I heard the Western Australian shadow minister say was, 'Western Australians should be concerned because they don’t know what the impact is going to be for tourism, they don’t know what the Commission of Audit's impact will be on education and they don’t know what the Commission of Audit's impact will be on the resources industry.' I say to the Australian Labor Party that I guarantee that the impact will be less than that of the six-year debacle we saw under the Australian Labor Party, because we have to start the fiscal repair job. We have started that walk, but it is going to be a long journey. Western Australians know that it takes a coalition government to make the tough decisions that will put this nation back on the right path to restore fiscal credibilitysomething that the Australian Labor Party was willing to sacrifice on the altar of a quick political fix. The reality is that when I sit in this chamber and hear a Western Australian say to me, 'We're very concerned about tourism,' I think, 'Why don't you walk the talk?' When the Labor Party were in government, why did they materially disadvantage, for example, the tourism industry by imposing $2 billion of new tourism taxes? Why did the Australian Labor Party increase-by something like 30 per cent or 40 per cent-the passenger movement charge, so the Australian tourism industry and in particular tourism operators in Western Australia were materially disadvantaged? Why did the Australian Labor Party, when they were in power for six years, introduce policies which saw the domestic tourism industry materially disadvantaged because of the carbon tax, where if travellers chose to go overseas they did not have to pay a carbon tax? So, do not lecture the coalition about policies in relation to the tourism industry. What about education? It takes an incredible amount of hide-you would have to have the thickest hide in the industry-to stand up, earnestly rub your hands together and say: 'I am very concerned about education in Western Australia. What are the secret cuts in relation to education?' You know what? Western Australians remember it was your government that ripped $1.2 billion out of the education budget and that it materially affected Western Australia and Queensland. Mr Gray interjectingof the chamber can see straight through you, mate. I know that the voters of Western Australia will see straight through the Australian Labor Party as well, because they know that, when it comes to delivery of good policy, it is the coalition that will deliver, not the Australian Labor Party. What is more, they know that faux concern from shadow ministers about cuts to education means nothing when that minister was part of a government that ripped-with only weeks to go to the election-$1.2 billion out of education. So, do not have the audacity to stand up in this chamber and try to pretend to Western Australians that they have something to fear, because the only real fear that they had was a continuation of the former Labor government. Thank goodness they saw the light. We have seen an addition to this parliament of quality people that will make a material difference to the representation of Western Australia. I only wish that there had been another vote for the",129,Matters Of Public Importance
268,Mr Ciobo,"So do not come here with your faux concern, because everyone on this sideHouse of Representatives, because frankly I think it would have been good for us to pick up that seat as well. It certainly would have been in the best interest of Western Australians, instead of the ridiculous MPI discussions that we have seen. I also found it incredible that the shadow minister railed against the fact that there were 'wrong spending priorities and imprudent budget decisions'. They were his actual words. He said that Western Australians were concerned about 'wrong spending priorities and imprudent budget decisions'. What kind of wrong spending priorities would you be referring to? Would it be grandiose promises of six GP superclinics and only delivering one? Would it be the kinds of decisions that said, 'We are going to attach some $16 billion worth of expenditure to a mining tax that only raised $400 million'? Are they the kinds of wrong decisions that you are referring to, Shadow Minister? I think Western Australians know that Labor's record in WA is a dismal record. That is why we are very confident that Western Australians will understand our key message. Our key message is this: if they want to see the back of the mining tax and if they want to see the back of the carbon tax, then they have to make sure they support the coalition, and they have to make sure that we remove the log jam that is in the chamber just over there. That is the only way we can do it. With their support, we will be able to make sure that we have senators that are not going to continue to stand in the way of removing the carbon tax and the mining tax-anti-Western Australian taxes. That is the reason why I am supremely confident that they will come on board and support us. Labor's carbon tax cost Western Australia's economy $626 million in 2012-13. We know what the carbon tax cost some of the biggest industries in WA: Woodside, $172 million; BHP Billiton Worsley Alumina, $56 million; BHP Burrup, $55 million; Yara Pilbara, $35 million. These are the consequences of bad policy that was introduced by the former Labor government. We stand steadfastly opposed to those kinds of ridiculous policies. The reason why we were joined by so many coalition representatives from Western Australia in this House is that the Western Australians sent a clear message to the Australian Labor Party, but you are just not listening. It is time to clear your ears, and it is time to start to hear the message. The final matter I raise that demonstrates the reason Labor cannot be trusted with the West is that the Labor Party committed some $482 million to two very important road projects in WA: the upgrades of the Great Northern Highway and the North West Coastal Highway, but Labor did not provide any funding. They promise big but deliver nothing at all in relation to the funding. Why? Because the funding was contingent upon the mining tax raising the revenue. So, on every level, Labor has been a failure. That is the reason that the people of Western Australia sent a clear message with excellent coalition representation off the back of the last election. That is why they will reject you once again. (Time expired) now Prime Minister stood at this very despatch box and hectored and lectured us about the importance of being honest with the Australian people. Then he crosses to the other side of the floor and now as Prime Minister refuses to be honest with the people of Western Australia. That is what this debate is about. It is about seeking a bit of honesty from this government, a bit of openness from this government, asking for just one simple thing: release the Commission of Audit report before the election. The parliamentary secretary took 10",130,Matters Of Public Importance
269,Mr Clare (Blaxland) (15:44,"There is a great irony here. For the last three years theminutes to talk about that and in the 10 minutes could not even utter the words 'Commission of Audit', which tells you everything that you need to know. In the Prime Minister's first press conference on becoming Prime Minister he said these important words: I'm not going to make up promises that I don't end up keeping. Only a couple of weeks ago on YouTube, he said: We are honouring our commitments. Indeed that will be the theme of this government this year. Unfortunately, that is not the case. It is not happening. This government is already breaking promises. This government has broken its promise on the NBN. It promised that everyone would have access to 25 megabits per second by 2016. He broke that promise in December last year. They have broken their promise on education as well, and the promise of a million jobs in five years is looking shaky already as well. That is why this report is important. The people of Western Australia deserve to know if this government is going to break its promise on health or on education or, God forbid, on pensions or the ABC or SBS. They deserve to know that before they go to the polls in two weeks time. It is important that members remember what the Prime Minister said the night before the election. Mr Hawke: Which Prime Minister? No cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS. Well, I will bet that is not what the Commission of Audit says. What does it say? What is in it? Why are you refusing to release it? Why are you delaying releasing this report? Is it because it is 900 pages of nasties? Is it because it is full of broken promises? Remember, this is a Prime Minister who said on the 7.30 Report that you could not believe anything he said unless it was written down. This is written down-900 pages of it. It is on his desk and he refuses to release it. If he wants the people of Australia to trust him and trust his word that he will do everything he says, then he needs to release the report now to prove to the people of Australia, and prove to the people of Western Australia in particular, that he is a man of his word. I am particularly concerned about potential cuts to the ABC and what that means for regional Australia. This Prime Minister has said that he will not cut the ABC. In Senate estimates, the head of the ABC was asked if the ABC is cut whether he could guarantee that there would be no cuts to regional radio. The head of the ABC said no, he could not guarantee that. That is what is at stake here for National Party members in Western Australia and right across Australia, and why they need to stand up to this Prime Minister now, and why we need to know what is in this report. Regional radio provided by the ABC provides important local news, important sports news and important emergency broadcasts when there are cyclones or bushfires in places like Karratha and Broome or right across Australia. If there are cuts to the ABC, then potentially there will be cuts to regional radio. That is why I am saying to Liberal members and National Party members: grow a spine and stand up to this Prime Minister. Release the report and tell us whether there are going to be cuts to ABC regional radio.",131,Matters Of Public Importance
270,Mr Clare,"This Prime Minister. This Prime Minister on World News SBS said:It is an issue for ABC regional radio, but it is bigger than that. It is an issue of integrity. This is what the now Minister for Communications said of the now Prime Minister after he was rolled by him only a couple of years ago: … there is a major issue of integrity at stake here and Liberals should reflect very deeply on it ... Many Liberals are rightly dismayed that …we are now without integrity. We have given our opponents the irrefutable, undeniable evidence that we cannot be trusted … If they cut in these areas, that will be more proof again. (Time expired) forward by the member for Brand. In his MPI he spoke of 'the urgent need for the Abbott Government to release the National Commission of Audit report before the Western Australian Senate election.' As a Western Australian and along with other members from Western Australia, it should read: 'the urgent need for the Abbott government to repeal the carbon tax and the mining tax before the Western Australian Senate election.' That is what the opposition should be doing. It should be going to the people in the Senate and saying, 'If you want to help Western Australia, repeal the carbon tax and repeal the mining tax.' We heard the member for Brand talking about the fact that the people are already voting. I would say that most of the people in Western Australia have already made their minds up about how they are going to vote and they are just going to repeat the success that the Liberal Party had at the last Senate election. Ms Burke: How demeaning to the voters! support the mining tax and does not support the carbon tax. Not once in the six years he has been here has he stood up before on an MPI in this place. But two weeks before an election, he decides to stand up for Western Australia. He stood up in the MPI the other week and made it quite plain what these MPIs are about. He said that Western Australians should know what it is before them when they cast that most important vote in the biggest-ever by-election in Western Australia in Australia's constitutional history and he said he was taking the opportunity before our parliament to ask that. So all he is doing is pleading for votes for the Labor Party Mr Hawke: It is not going to work! Ms Burke interjectingMs Burke: No, it is the member for Chisholm. making statements before elections, and that is what we heard from the former member for Lalor when she made the statement, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.'

276,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bc Scott,Out of her place in the chamber too!,133,Matters Of Public Importance
277,Mr Irons,"Yes. But we heard the member for Blaxland talking about memory andinfrastructure fund, which we never saw. So, if Western Australians want to know where their voting direction should be, they should keep their memories wide open and say, 'This is the history of the Labor Party and how they treat Western Australians.' Everyone knows in Western Australia-you can see it in the result of the last electionwhat Labor think of Western Australians and how Labor treat them. I will just remind them of that. According to the Clean Energy Regulator, Labor's carbon tax cost the Western Australian economy $626 million in 2012-13. Ms MacTiernan: We doubled the expenditure on roads-$700 million a year. something she said back in November 2006 in an extract from Hansard in the Western Australian parliament. Alannah MacTiernan, who last week introduced an MPI that there should be more funding for infrastructure in Western Australia, was at that time the Minister for Planning and Infrastructure in Western Australia. She responded to a question from the member for South Perth, John McGrath, on the Manning Road on-ramp. She said: I understand that the on-ramp would be very desirable for the residents of his electorate. Technically, of course, it can be done. It can actually be done. From an engineering point of view it is not a challenging project and it certainly could be done. Indeed, the planning for this project was undertaken in the 1980scan you believe?and the metropolitan region scheme was amended to make provision for it.' These are all terrific words, but she went on to say: This is not a project that the government believes would reach the top of the priority list over the next five years. In fact, the government is keen to find the reserves to provide for the member’s electorate a train station at South Perthwhich no-one in South Perth wants; everyone wants the on-rampwhich would be a far more useful exercise for the member's constituents. So there we have an opportunity. We have seen the member for Perth is not prepared to provide any infrastructure, and that is another example of how Labor treats Western Australia. That is another example of how Labor treats Western Australia. Labor also saddled Western Australians with a mining tax that raised a fraction of what was promised. Ms MacTiernan interjectingthe mining tax burdened business with millions of dollars of red tape, as well as costing jobs and driving away investment. So, if we need to say anything to the voters in Western Australia, we need to say to them: 'Be reminded about how federal Labor, over the last six years, treated Western Australians. They imposed a mining tax and a carbon tax, and they will continue to do so.' So what Western Australians need to do is give their support to the Liberals and tell Labor to go to the Senate and repeal those taxes. (Time expired) Ms COLLINS (Franklin) (15:55): I rise to talk about the Commission of Audit and why its report should be released urgently.",133,Matters Of Public Importance
278,Mr Irons,"NowI do hear the member for Perth interjecting, and I would like to quote",134,Matters Of Public Importance
279,Mr Irons,"Yes, okay. I am waiting for the 'sweetheart' comment to come back now. YetMr Buchholz: Tell us about Tasmania! Ms COLLINS: I will actually talk about Tasmania a bit later on, but this is about Western Australia and the 1.3 million Western Australians who are starting to vote from yesterday and are voting in the dark, without the Commission of Audit's report. Interestingly, we have already had two speakers from those opposite, and they do not mention the Commission of Audit at all. What are they hiding? Why don't they want to talk about it? We are not really surprised that they do not want to talk about it-900 pages, and we have had a few leaks about what is in this Commission of Audit report. No wonder they do not want it out there: a GP tax, $6 to go to the GP, which will cost Western Australians $59 million each and every year, going up, to go and visit their GP. There are nervous pensioners on the disability support pension in Western Australia, waiting and wondering what is in the Commission's of Audit's report as they go to vote. There are age pensioners wondering what is going to happen when they go to vote. There are people with disability wondering about the NDIS before they go to vote. And why are they so concerned? They are concerned because they have already seen cuts from this Abbott government. They have seen $500 million cut from public rail infrastructure that was to be built in Western Australia. They have already seen cuts to the Regional Development Australia Fund, cuts to the tennis sporting hub at Busselton, cuts to the surf club for the Secret Harbour community and other cuts right around the community in Western Australia. There have been cuts to the Building Multicultural Communities Program, cuts of $140,000 to the Multicultural Services Centre of Western Australia, cuts of $26,000 to the Shire of Mount Magnet, and a whole range of cuts from this government right across the community in Western Australia. People are worried about what is next, what this government is hiding and what they will see in this Commission of Audit report, and they have a right to know before they go and place their vote. As we have heard, Western Australians are voting already. Pre-poll voting started yesterday, and 1.3 million Western Australians are going to cast their vote without any idea about what this government will do with the Commission of Audit's recommendations. We have heard from Treasurer Joe Hockey that many of the recommendations are likely to be implemented, so why not tell Western Australians what you are planning? Because you do not want them to know before they go to cast their votes, because there will be a whole range of cuts recommended by the Commission of Audit. Interestingly, this Commission of Audit was considered urgent after the September election, but we have had the release of the report put off three times: before the Griffith by-election and before the Tasmanian and South Australian elections and now, surprisingly, there is a Senate election in Western Australia, and what have we seen? It is sat on again. It is sitting on desks of ministers in this government, and they should be releasing this document urgently to the people of Western Australia. Tony Abbott promised that he would lead a government of no surprises. The Prime Minister also promised that his would be a government of no excuses. There are plenty of excuses about why this Commission of Audit report is not going to be released, and we know that there are going to be plenty of surprises in it when it turns up. We have seen many surprises and excuses so far from those opposite, and the fact that they are sitting on this report just demonstrates that there is so much more pain and there are so many more cuts to come. Pre election, we heard Mr Abbott say there would be no cuts to education or health, no change to pensions or the GST and no cuts to the ABC or the SBS. What we have seen in government, of course, is a very different thing. We have seen cuts of $10 million of cancer workforce money to Western Australia; that was a cut to health last time. I checked. We have seen winding back of Gonski right across the country; that, of course, is a cut to education. We are hearing all sorts of things about the DSP changes that may be coming; that, of course, is a cut. We heard today from the shadow minister for communications that there are plans to cut radio in regional Australia. People in regional Western Australia have a right to know what is coming from this government. They have a right to know what is in that 900 pages, and the government should be releasing that 900 pages of the Commission of Audit urgently so that the people of Western Australia, as they go to vote in coming weeks up to and including 5 April, actually have information before them on what is going to happen. (Time expired) those opposite I see confected outrage, that unembarrassable quality, and Western Australian voters, of course, have seen it before. You would think from listening to them that Western Australian voters are going to forget that the two biggest issues in that state at the election just over six months ago were the carbon tax and the mining tax. The voters of Western Australia sent a message loud and clear to the Labor Party, and your response back to those voters in Western Australia is that they got it wrong. We saw this confected outrage start with the member for Brand, who moved this matter of public importance on the Commission of Audit and the state of Western Australia. He and those other speakers conveniently forget their approach in government to weighty documents. As the Prime Minister has outlined, the government has received phase 1 of the Commission of Audit. He has not received phase 2, and it is right and proper that government ministers consider a weighty document and what is to come before making decisions. This is a report to government, not of government. For those opposite to come in here with confected outrage to try to whip up fear amongst Western Australian voters to cover their policy failures on the carbon tax and the mining tax is to be expected. With the exception of the member for Perth, who I will come to during my contribution, they all sat there through the last parliament; and Wayne Swan, the member for Lilley, as the Treasurer received the Australia's future tax system review a couple of days before Christmas. He had this to say: As I have been saying for some time, the Government will consider the review and release it in early 2010, along with an initial response. One hundred and thirty days went by. The member for Brand, who has obviously had an irony bypass, did not seem at all concerned that, when it was finally released a week before the budget-we went through January, February, March, April and into May-it of course contained what new tax? It contained the mining tax. What did the member for Brand say publicly at that point? What did other Western Australian members say about that mining tax and the damage it would do to their state? Where were they standing up for Western",134,Matters Of Public Importance
280,Mr Tony Smith (Casey) (16:00,"As I have listened to the three contributions fromAustralian voters at that time? You heard complete silence. It was as if they had been muted by a TV remote control. You heard nothing from the member for Brand. The member for Perth, we were told a few weeks ago, told the Labor caucus that the mining tax was damaging. I am not getting any shaking of the heads. I am presuming I am right. Ms Brodtmann: We do not say what happens in caucus. in the House of Representatives that the member for Perth was opposed to the mining tax. Like so many other members of the Labor Party, it appears the member for Perth has been reprogrammed. My friend the Minister for Communications might know what software was used! But today the member for Perth said, 'It is complete nonsense to say that the carbon tax or, indeed, the mining tax has in fact had a negative impact on the Western Australian economy' in complete contradiction to her earlier point and in complete denial of the fact that last year, as we have heard from speakers on this side, the carbon tax cost Western Australia alone more than $600 million. Those opposite are doing two things. They will run a scare campaign and they will do it to try to cover the fact that they are defying the will of the electorate, particularly in Western Australia, on the carbon tax and the mining tax. For those voters in Western Australia, every time they hear a Labor scare it is confirmation that Labor is ignoring them and Labor is still attached to two damaging taxes that have damaged their economy and, if Labor has their way, will continue to do so. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (16:05): The confected outrage that the former speaker just mentioned reflects the genuine outrage that exists in the community. What we are doing today is calling on the Abbott government to end the uncertainty, to come clean on what is contained in the Commission of Audit before the WA election, to come clean on their plans for public servants, for Defence personnel, for DMO personnel, for those on pensions, for the ABC. After the election last year the Treasurer said on 22 October 2013: Every area of government will be examined. There are no restrictions. Every area. I send this message to Canberrans, to all Australian and, most importantly, to Western Australians. Remember: 'Every area of government will be examined. There are no restrictions.' I am calling on the Abbott government to end the uncertainty, to come clean. You have also said that there are no cuts to pensions. Why is it that since the election you have had leaked reports of four or five different positions on the disability support pension? I have members of my electorate ringing me up in tears, fearful about what is actually going to happen to them-women, single mothers who are battling on their own with multiple sclerosis, wondering what their future is. I am also asking you to end the uncertainty about what is going to happen with the ABC and SBS. Prior to the election the now Prime Minister said there would be no cuts to the ABC or SBS. There are very strong rumours that the Australia Network is going to be abolished by the Abbott government. The Australia Network is an important arm of our public diplomacy. I can imagine those sitting opposite will all be there tonight, hugging B1 and B2-in between the two of them hugging them. Are you going to tell B1 and B2? Are you going to tell the",136,Matters Of Public Importance
281,Mr Tony Smith,"'We do not say what happens in caucus.' There is confirmation hereassembled ABC members tonight what their future is, given you have made this commitment that there will be no cuts to the ABC and SBS? There is very strong talk of the Australia Network going. The member for Wannon knows the importance of the Australia Network. He is a former foreign affairs and trade official. He knows the importance of public diplomacy. He knows the importance of having a footprint in the Asia-Pacific region. Those opposite are doing nothing about standing up for the Australia Network. I am also wanting the Abbott government to come clean on the Commission of Audit, to end the uncertainty around the Public Service. According to the Parliamentary Library, there are about 7½ thousand Commonwealth public servants in Western Australia. What is their future? What is contained in the Commission of Audit about their future? Coalition governments have form in terms of axing public servants. In 1996, they got rid of 30,000 public servants nationally-15,000 in the ACT. What is the plan for the 7½ thousand public servants in Western Australia? What is the plan for their future? What is the plan for their families' future? Come clean on what is in the Commission of Audit. Finally, I am asking the Abbott government to come clean, end the uncertainty and release the Commission of Audit to let Defence public servants know what is going on and, importantly, DMO public servants. According to the defence annual report, in Western Australia there are about 3½ thousand ADF personnel, nearly 400 Defence public servants and over 200 DMO public servants, totalling nearly 7,000 ADF and Public Service workers in Western Australia. What is their future? What is the future for those public servants, particularly the partners of ADF personnel who have been posted to Western Australia and are working in civilian jobs there for the DMO and for the Public Service? Come clean on what your plans are for the Public Service, for defence, for the ABC, for pensioners, for disability pensioners and for women like the single mothers in my electorate who are battling on their own, trying to get through but are faced with the great uncertainty surrounding the disability support pension. You have to stop hiding behind this Commission of Audit. If you have nothing to hide then why don't you release it? Why don't you just do that and come clean? because I think she eloquently summed up everything that is wrong with the Labor Party in relation to Western Australia. The fact that in the last half an hour we have had about 25 minutes of discussion about the ABC tells me that they do not understand Western Australians and the reason why there are only three Labor members in this place and only one Labor member elected at the last Senate election. The member for Brand in particular made an eloquent case when he made fun of the Liberal-National coalition drawing box R-the box we have drawn for the ballot coming up at the next election. I can inform the House he did miss something which I think is important and relevant to this discussion. The Labor Party have also drawn a box on the ballot for this election and they have drawn box F. It does sum up a lot of things about the Labor Party's approach to Western Australia. BoxF is quite appropriate. The only danger for Labor at this election will be if voters give them a score on their performance. That will be the only danger at this election. The member for Brand talked about Rs, but we can talk about Fs. Let us talk about some of the failures of the previous government. The Labor Party committed $482 million to two road projects, but of course failed to provide the money from the mining tax. Fail. On GP",137,Matters Of Public Importance

The GP superclinics policy from the last Labor governmentMr Simpkins: F-minus. colleagues. And there have been the border protection failures by those opposite which impacted so many of the communities in Western Australia in particular. This government has corrected that. It is ironic, as the member for Swan eloquently pointed out, that the member for Brand can come into this place as a Western Australian member and tell us that his concern is with this government not keeping its promises. The member for Brand was right about one thing: we do have a program of cuts. That is very true. He said we have a program of cuts but that we cannot quantify them. We can quantify those cuts and we can identify what they mean. We are going to cut the carbon tax. We are going to cut the mining tax. We are going to cut red tape and regulation. These are quantifiable cuts and they will save Western Australia hundreds of millions of dollars in productivity, time spent working for the government, carbon tax payments and flawed mining tax payments. That will result in greater productivity and boost investment and growth in our key state. It is funny that the Labor Party stump-up the member for Canberra to talk about public servant job losses in Canberra and somehow that is relevant to people in Western Australia. It is also funny that they stump-up a Tasmanian-a state that is basically subsidised by the hard work and productivity of Western Australia-to come in here and complain about Western Australia and our approach to Western Australia. The coalition government have a plan for Western Australia-that is, to take the shackles off that Labor was so intent on putting on. In fact, it would not be unfair to characterise the last Labor administration as perhaps the most unfair to WA in the history of the Commonwealth. Most of the measures that it took, whether it be the carbon tax or the mining tax, triply impacted on Western Australia. They have impacted so much that voters were not fooled by the last government. That is why they only elected one Labor senator at the last election. If only the members opposite would get a signal from that. One senator is an awfully low proportion of the vote in Western Australia. Mr Simpkins: That is an F-minus. reasons why people did not vote Labor at the last election. It was because of the Labor-Greens alliance, which resulted in the world's highest carbon tax, punishing Western Australians in particular. It was because of the unusual superprofits tax and then the mining resource rent tax that were personally negotiated by a Labor Prime Minister and a Labor Treasurer. That was a personal package from the Labor Party for Western Australia, designed by a Labor Prime Minister and a Labor Treasurer. It was personally negotiated by them for the state of Western Australia. No wonder Western Australians have emphatically rejected the Labor Party at the last few elections. No wonder we stand here today in this debate hearing from Western Australian members like the member for Moore, who is also about to explain why Western Australians do not want a return to Labor government.",138,Matters Of Public Importance

284,Mr Hawke,"Yes, that is an F-minus from the voters at the last election. There areThere is a way that voters can help at this coming election, and that is to vote box R. Do not, as much as you want to, give the Labor Party an F. We all understand that instinct, but box R is the way to give the Labor Party an F. Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle) (16:15): I will reflect very briefly on some of the previous contributions today on this matter of public importance, which were extraordinary in respect of their complete unwillingness to address the issue of the National Commission of Audit report. Members opposite had a range of opinions about a range of topics but certainly not the topic that is currently before us today, and that is the urgent need for the Abbott government to release the National Commission of Audit report before the Western Australian Senate election. It would seem that members opposite do not think that the people of Western Australia deserve to know what is going to happen prior to an election. They do not seem to think that the people of Western Australia would want to know. There are some members opposite who indeed suggest that the Senate by-election is almost a pointless exercise, because people are going to go in and do exactly what they did before. I heard one member suggest that. Well, I might suggest that members opposite are taking the people of Western Australia for granted, and I do not think the people of Western Australia are, for one moment, going to cop that silently. I echo the call from the member for Brand earlier, on behalf of all Western Australian people, for the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, Senator Cormann, Senator Johnston and all other WA federal executive members to end this game of secrecy and to make good on the promise that this government had to release the Commission of Audit report to the public and to release it now. We have already seen, as speakers prior to me argued, that this report has been delayed at each and every by-election. This will be the fourth delay, if we do not see the report released prior to 5 April. Unfortunately some Western Australians have already missed out on what is potentially vital information for them, as voting in the Senate by-election started yesterday. It is beyond belief that members opposite do not have a high enough regard for the people of Western Australia to enable them to make an informed decision before going into a polling booth to cast a vote. It is extraordinary that there would be an expectation that people do not need that information, that they are somehow just going to rubber-stamp an exercise from last September. Those who have voted do, however, have a taste of what is to come, because the conservative state government has already embarked on a very broad range of cuts in Western Australia that are eating into jobs and services in WA. What voters can be sure about with the Abbott government is that it cannot be trusted, and that is a profound problem-a profound lack of trust. What is the Abbott government hiding? In particular, what is it hiding from Western Australians? Is it hiding further cuts to education, health, pensions, the ABC or SBS? This report, which has been sitting on the Treasurer's desk since January, represents some 900 pages of deep thought, we are led to believe, from this government. We can only assume that the failure to release it is because of the cloak of secrecy that this government continues to operate under. It is hiding what we believe to be very wrong priorities for this government and the nasty cuts that we were not privy to prior to the election. It is unacceptable that the Treasurer says that the government hopes to adopt the 'great majority' of recommendations from the Commission of Audit but keeps those findings and cuts completely under wraps and away from the public. It is unacceptable that he can make an assertion that the great majority of recommendations would be adopted before even seeing the report. I will say it again: this government cannot be trusted. The people of WA deserve much better. essential step in addressing Labor's record of waste and mismanagement. The Commission of Audit was a key election commitment of the coalition. It will assess the role and scope of government, as well as ensuring taxpayers' money is spent wisely and in an efficient manner. The Prime Minister has set the tone of how this government will go about the business of governing in a purposeful, methodical and logical way, without making hasty or rash decisions. Labor has left a legacy of $123 billion in budget deficits, the largest budget deficits in Australia's history, and national debt approaching $667 billion. This government will make the difficult fiscal decisions to get the budget under control and Australia back on track to economic prosperity. The Western Australian Senate election has nothing whatsoever to do with the timing of the Commission of Audit report being released. So important is this issue to those opposite that there is not one opposition member from Western Australia present in the chamber! The Commission of Audit's final report will form part of the 2014-15 budget process which is due in May and should not be rushed. The commission's work is very complex and addresses issues such as the division of responsibilities between local, state and federal governments. It is a process that has involved public and private hearings, submissions from stakeholders and input from government departments. It is a considered and robust process which should not be rushed. The Western Australian Senate election has nothing to do with the Commission of Audit report. It is a mere distraction, a red herring, a smoke screen. If those opposite wish to question the commitment of this government in Western Australia, let us first consider Labor's record in when in government. Based on information from the Clean Energy Regulator, between 2012 and 2013 Labor's carbon tax cost the Western Australian economy $626 million. Western Australian power companies were hit with a $260 million impact from the carbon tax, affecting all sectors of industry, the economy and consumers. Western Australia's mining industry, which has seen a slowdown in activity affecting many mining workers and allied industries, has been particularly burdened by the carbon tax, for example: Woodside Energy, $172 million; BHP Worsley Alumina, $56 million; BHP Burrup, $55 million; Yara Pilbara, $35 million. On top of the carbon tax, Labor burdened Western Australians with a mining tax that raised a fraction of what it promised yet saddled business with millions of dollars in compliance costs and red tape-costing jobs and discouraging investment. Labor committed $482 million to two very important road projects in Western Australiathe upgrades of the Great Northern Highway and the North Coastal Highway-but did not fund these projects, because funding was contingent on the mining tax which did not raise sufficient revenue.",139,Matters Of Public Importance

Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014 before the debate was interrupted. The reality is that these grants will help the manufacturers and producers in the Bendigo electorate. Exporting brings jobs and security to the local community in Bendigo and in central Victoria and helps the long-term economic viability of the region. Innovation, quality and diversity are the driving forces behind our region's successful manufacturing and mining sectors. This has seen the emergence of a wide variety of small to medium businesses-the exact group that these grants aim to target-many of which operate in niche markets, or are hoping to. The manufacturing and mining sectors produce financial rewards in the City of Greater Bendigo area worth $2.8 billion annually, or 27.5 per cent of the city's total economic output. To say they are important is an understatement; they employ almost 7,000 people. Seven",142,Bills

291,Ms Chesters (Bendigo) (16:29,"I will continue the remarks I was making about thethousand people work in our local manufacturing areas, so to say that it is a dark day in manufacturing in Bendigo would be wrong. The doom and gloom that we often hear about manufacturing is not happening in my city or in my region. However, this success did not happen overnight. In fact, it had its beginnings as far back as the gold rush days in the middle of the 19th century. We have been producing mining equipment in Bendigo since the very early days of mining in this country. Bendigo-based manufacturers provide a wide diversity of products from armoured vehicles like our famous Bushmaster-and, hopefully, the son of Bushmaster, the Hawkei-to residential, commercial and industry turntables. These turntables travel from Kangaroo Flat to the great cities of the world to be used in restaurants, car dealerships or everywhere and anywhere that will purchase them. They produce everything from diesel locomotives to drill rigs, stone crushers and even the body armour that our troops wear in combat overseas. I should also mention the fantastic fresh produce that is produced locally, as well as our beverage products such as wine, cider and craft beer, which are all manufactured and produced locally by our small to medium businesses. These products are currently being exported, and we hope to have more exported which is why these grants are so important. An example of excellence in metal and engineering manufacturing is Keech castings. Keech castings is a company based in East Bendigo that produces 3-D technologies and 3-D printing which, I am told, is unusual for a city like Bendigo. I was at a breakfast this morning with the CSIRO where they were talking about this being a cutting-edge new niche industry and the future of manufacturing. I am so proud to be able to say that we already have these facilities, this capability and this technology in Bendigo. Keech's chief executive, Herbert Hermens, said that these printers would allow objects to be created quickly and cheaply and sourced in Australia. They are currently exporting this product all over the world. This company is exporting more and more produce every day, which is exciting for Bendigo, exciting for Keech castings and exciting for our country. The technology works by making a solid 3-D model of an object designed by a computer program. The printers can be used to create car parts, aeroplanes, prosthetic hands and even the smallest of screws. We are told that this is the future of manufacturing-it is the revolution. Some are saying that it is the new industrial revolution of manufacturing. We are proud to say that Bendigo is one of the first places in the world to do it. As I have flagged, another major area of manufacturing and production in our region is food and beverages. Whilst some know Bendigo for its poultry industry, we have some other major producers in dairy and bread-related products. Bendigo also has many businesses and manufacturers in wine, baking, coffee roasting, olive oil processing, honey, preserves, sauces and the list goes on. One that I would like to highlight to the House is B&B Basil. A father and daughter team got together in 2000 and noticed a lack of locally grown herbs at the local markets. George Bobin and Susie Young decided that they would get together and start growing their own hydroponic basil. This quickly grew to be an expanding market that included many micro herbs. Today, B&B Basil export to China, Japan and Hong Kong and they have been able to do this through the support of their local Austrade representative and through these export market development grants. These grants helped them establish their markets overseas. Outside Bendigo, we have a number of other successful producers and manufacturers in the Macedon Ranges and Mount Alexander, which are shires that are known for their wine, craft beer, olives, cheese and other small produce. Right now, their markets strong locally and nationally, but they need that extra support to make it into the international markets. I am quite often reminded by our local manufacturers that it needs to be the choice and the call of a manufacturer to take the plunge to step outside our own economy and step into the global economy. It is something that people do not take lightly. It is a challenge for a manufacturer to say, 'Yep, I'm going to compete globally.' It is important that they do though. It is important that we do see our manufacturers do that because, when they are successful overseas, it creates more jobs in our region and means that these businesses will continue to prosper and grow and create more wealth for our regions. That is why it is important that we support them at every step, including through these grants, so that if they choose to make that choice they have the support. Labor has a proud record of supporting trade and boosting economic growth for our local industries. In fact, as I mentioned earlier in my speech, the Export Market Development Grants Scheme was a Labor initiative started back in the Whitlam days. Many of the manufacturers in my electorate have taken advantage of these opportunities already, with every year a number of organisations, of manufacturers, of producers and of businesses putting their hands up and receiving these grants. In May last year, a company called Southern Cross Feeds, who prepares animal and bird feed, received a grant of about $9,000. A motion picture and video production company in Malmsbury received a grant of just under $40,000. Malmsbury is an area which is just north of Kyneton. It is usually known for its juvenile justice facility, but it is also known for its railway station. It is great to see another industry starting to grow in that area-that is, a motion picture and video production company that is now exporting overseas thanks to these grants. The Davidson Brothers in Bendigo is another creative arts organisation that received a grant, of just under $20,000k for creative arts musicians, writers and performers. This is another example of a growing industry in Bendigo-that is, our cultural economy. If we are serious about seeing people employed in the cultural economy, then we need to get behind them just as much as we get behind our manufacturers. Keech castings, whom I mentioned before, received a grant of just over $50,000. The Edge Equine received a grant for professional and scientific goods wholesaling. There is a lot that goes on in my electorate when it comes to manufacturing, producing and exporting our goods. That is why it is important that we continue to support these industries through the grants that we are speaking about today. In conclusion, whilst I support the bill, I also want to express my disappointment that all references towards the Asian century have been dropped. All of these companies that I have spoken about who have been successful in their grants-whether it be B&B Basil, working with the paddock to the plate; Keech castings with their castings or with their 3D imaging; or our cultural economy-are exporting to Asia. We are in the Asian century, so it is disappointing to see any reference to the Asian century dropped-dropped not just from this bill but entirely from the new government's focus and priority. Labor recognises that our future prosperity is underpinned by our engagement in our region. We cannot ignore our neighbours. They are our closest trading partners, and we should continue to engage with them. This is why it is so important that the new government pick back up the Asian century paper and we continue on that path. By the end of the decade, our region is expected to overtake the combined economic output of North America and Europe. We have a unique opportunity that other countries in the world do not have. We are in the region that will boom, and it is important for us to take the opportunity to be engaged. Our businesses will have access to expanded and emerging markets, with Asia set to become the world's largest consumption zone by 2030. That is why it is so important that we maintain a policy agenda in which Australia supports our manufacturers getting into Asia. Labor's amendments introduced last week sought to realign these grants to support small businesses exporting to the emerging markets in East Asia. It is important to be at the front of this. It is important that we support our manufacturers and companies that wish to trade and export to Asia. Many of the manufacturers in my electorate have taken the opportunity in the past-and I know that they wish to do so in the future. This is why it is so important that we continue to support the manufacturers, particularly in the regions. As I have said throughout my contribution today, manufacturing and production and producers are still a major employer in my area. These are Australian businesses based in our electorates that are keeping local people employed. We want to continue to see these local people employed. It is not just about having a strong local economy, nor about having a strong national economy; it is also about having involvement and engagement overseas. Ms HENDERSON (Corangamite) (16:42): I rise to speak Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014. I know that the member for Bendigo was wanting to say that she commends the bill to the House. This important bill will help small and medium sized businesses such as those in my electorate of Corangamite to reach their export potential and to become self-sustaining exporters. This is another part of our strong plan to grow jobs, to drive investment, to build a strong and prosperous economy and a safe, secure Australia. I might just reflect on the contribution by the member for Bendigo. I do commend the member for Bendigo for being so upbeat about manufacturing and the opportunities for jobs in her electorate. She spoke about the many different, exciting industry sectors in her electorate in defence, horticulture, wine, olives, cheese and even television production. She talked about growth and prosperity and about the future of more jobs in her electorate, and I have to say that it is terrific to see a member on the other side talking up the economy and being positive about jobs, manufacturing and the future of manufacturing. Some of her colleagues-and her more senior colleagues-might take a lesson from the member for Bendigo, because I think we have seen far too much spin and deception and far too much negativity about the very bright future that we have in manufacturing in this country. The scheme before the House today helps small businesses by refunding up to 50 per cent of export market expenditure to help bring export markets within reach, as well as by supporting innovation. That is what we must encourage-innovation, investment, support for small business and the opening up of new export markets. I have one issue with the member for Bendigo in relation to comments about the Asian century. She obviously is not cognisant of the fact that our opportunities with Asia and the Asian century is one of the five pillars of what we see as our economy. Our links with Asia and our capacity to grow our markets with Asia are fundamental to the growth of our economy. We recognise how important new export markets are to our economy, particularly in Asia; to business; to jobs; to investment; and to innovation. And in just a matter of months our government has finalised a free trade agreement with Korea. Under the Korean FTA, tariffs of up to 300 per cent will be eliminated on key Australian agricultural exports, such as beef, wheat, sugar, dairy, wine, horticulture and seafood, as well as in the resources and energy sector and across other aspects of manufactured goods. This is a great indication of how hard we are working, and it is unfortunate that the previous Labor government was not able to conclude such an important agreement with Korea, which opens up so much opportunity. I have joined a coalition task force on supporting horticulture, which is a great initiative by the member for Casey. Several weeks ago we met with various sectors of the horticultural industry, and I am very pleased to report to the House that there was incredible enthusiasm for our free trade agreement with Korea, and of course for the work of the member for Goldstein, the Minister for Trade and Investment. Our minister did what Labor failed to do year after year: he concluded the negotiations, he secured a deal and he ensured that Australia is open for business across the nation and, importantly, to the critically important market of Korea. Independent modelling by the Centre for International Economics shows that agricultural exports to Korea would be 73 per cent higher after 15 years of the free trade agreement's operation. And we are also well advanced in progressing negotiations on a free trade agreement with China as well as with Japan-further evidence of our determination to ensure that as a nation we are open for business across Australia and throughout the world. As we have heard from the Minister for Trade and Investment, the changes proposed in this bill will do a number of important things. They will provide an additional $50 million to this program over four years, giving effect to the funding boost we outlined in the 2013 Mid-year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. This comes after Labor slashed the Export Market Development Grants scheme by $25 million when in government. That is a sorry reflection on the previous Labor government's commitment to exports, and I am very pleased to say that we are reversing that and we are investing in exporters, because we understand how important exporters are to our economy. Of course, this was the decision of an utterly dysfunctional government-a government that spent much of its six years in office undermining each other, dragging down two prime ministers, and racking up debt and deficit like we have never seen in the history of Australia. Just to remind the House-and we have heard this mentioned plenty of times before-let us not forget these figures. Over the forward estimates we are heading towards cumulative deficits of $123 billion, and we are $667 billion in debt. And we are paying the price for Labor's policies: we have now hit six per cent unemployment, which was forecast by Labor. The bill will also see the threshold of expenses required before a firm becomes eligible for a grant reduced from $20,000 to $15,000-making it much more accessible-and the number of grants available to eligible companies will be increased from seven to eight. So what we are seeing with this additional investment in the scheme is new pathways to sustainable jobs and long-term job creation. In my electorate of Corangamite we have seen some great examples of the EMDG scheme at work. Carbon Revolution, based at Deakin University in Waurn Ponds in the heart of my electorate, is a wonderful example of an exporter that has benefited from a grant under this program. Carbon Revolution received a $40,000 grant under the EMDG program and is now taking its innovation in carbon fibre wheels to the world. It was with great pride that several weeks ago I joined industry minister Macfarlane, Premier Napthine and manufacturing minister Hodges in Victoria to announce a $5 million grant under the Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund as part of a $23 million project delivering 150 new jobs. Here is an example of a company investing in advanced manufacturing and taking its innovation to the world-and it is a wonderful plan they have. They are currently producing about 4,000 carbon fibre wheels, and their projections are that that will move to producing 50,000 wheels per year. Their foresight in developing this incredible technology has been buoyed by the pronouncement of one German auto manufacturer, which has declared that the future in auto manufacturing-and certainly in wheels-is in carbon fibre, because they assist in producing more fuel-efficient cars. So what we are seeing in my electorate of Geelong, assisted by the wonderful innovation and the strong industry links that Deakin University is building right across the region, is a great story in advanced manufacturing. So, when Labor talks about our government not supporting manufacturing, I do not think they are doing their homework. It was wonderful to hear the member for Bendigo talking about the great things that are happening in jobs and manufacturing in her electorate. The Geelong region has a proud history as a manufacturing hub, and yes we have been hit hard by job losses in recent times, but we have a very bright future. We are working very hard to bring new, emerging industries and advanced manufacturing opportunities to our region. Building our capacity in exports is a very big part of that story. There are other very important Corangamite exporters who have benefitted from the EMDG scheme. They include the Victoria Centre for Advanced Materials Manufacturing, in Waurn Ponds, which received some $98,000; POD Active, in Torquay, which received $46,000; Hard Technologies, in Waurn Ponds, which received $30,000; Rake Clothing, in Torquay, which received $5,500-and of course we know that Torquay is the wonderful home of Rip Curl, a fantastic business in my electorate; Anyhow Pty Ltd, in Torquay, which received $5,500; and ARMS Reliability, in Ocean Grove, which received $1,500. We have many wonderful businesses in my electorate, right across agriculture, in advanced manufacturing and in services. Deakin University is at the centre of so much of what we are doing now in industry and manufacturing. The Prime Minister will visit three very important nations in April: South Korea, China and Japan. As we know, the negotiations on the South Korean free trade agreement are at an end, and that is a wonderful story. The negotiations with China and Japan are also progressing very well. These countries represent 40 per cent of Australia's total two-way trade in goods and services, valued at some $250 billion. The future prosperity of Australia, and other countries in our region, depends on increased trade and investments. And, of course, our exports are so critical to how we develop these markets in the future. As a government we are working very hard to develop these export markets to give exporters these important opportunities, to open up new markets, to increase trade, and to take our innovation, products and services to the world. I commend this bill to the House. previous Labor governments did not, and that is delivering on its election commitments. This",143,Bills
292,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (16:55,"I rise today noting that this government is doing whatbill gives effect to the coalition's trade policy, and the subsequent 2013 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook decision, to provide an additional $50 million over four years for the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. The coalition government wants Australia to be a country that makes sense. The measures in this bill, combined with the repeal of the carbon and mining taxes, a company tax cut, cuts to regulation, road building, and workplace law reform, will benefit all manufacturers. This government pledged to provide an additional $50 million in Export Market Development Grants, and put an additional $50 million into a Manufacturing Transition Fund. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme is an integral part of the export promotion strategy of many Australian exporters, especially smaller to medium sized businesses. For many exporters the scheme plays a significant role in their decision as to whether or not to export, which markets to tackle, and their export orientation-that is, what proportion of production to export. At the same time, Export Market Development Grants Scheme support accounted for more than one-third of the export income for smaller to medium sized firms participating in the program back in 2003. Even today, without this support many of these firms would reduce their export efforts. The objective of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme is to bring benefits to Australia by encouraging the creation of foreign markets for Australian goods, services, intellectual property and know-how. This objective can be achieved by assisting with the development of an export culture, creating new exporters, assisting with the diversification of exporters into new markets, assisting with the generation of additional exports and jobs within Australia, and creating greater innovation within Australian businesses. More specifically, the Export Market Development Grant Scheme is intended to encourage small and medium Australian businesses to develop overseas markets through the 50 per cent reimbursement of expenditure incurred on export promotional activities above $10,000, provided that the total expenses are at least $20,000. The agency which administers the advice on prospective markets and opportunities, on the ground support in target countries, trade exhibitions and assistance in finding potential investors. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme is an effective way of assisting the work of would be exporters, and is a crucial investment program for existing exporters. I well remember back when I was running an event management company that many of my major events that were trying to attract delegates from overseas particularly benefitted from the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. What it meant was that we could enhance our publicity and promotion, not just of the event but for Australia as a destination, enhancing the tourism sector. An important part of that aspect was a business matching program for many of our major events, where the client probably would not have gone to that expense if the export grant had not been available. It is appropriate that Australian businesses are awarded Export Market Development Grants funds according to commercial realities as opposed to a decision by some politician or bureaucrat in Canberra, who is invariably far removed from what is happening on the ground. Yet that is exactly what the previous Labor government has done since 2007. They have meddled with the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, and, frankly, they have made a complete mess of it. Soon after taking office Labor expanded the scheme by lowering the eligible expenditure threshold from $15,000 to $10,000, increasing the number of grants from seven to eight, and increasing the maximum grant from $150,000 to $200,000. This does not, on the face of it, sound like a bad idea. But, while the cost of these changes was estimated at $50 million a year, the previous, Labor government only provided increased funding for the 2009-10 year. Then, in June 2010, Labor amended the scheme to essentially reverse the 2008 implementation of their own election commitments. This was yet another example of the previous government saying one thing publicly and then deciding to break promises and election commitments. All the while, small and medium-sized enterprises in this case had absolutely no idea what was going on. I have heard from the industry that from year to year they essentially did not know what the government would do with the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. We do know that tourism is one of the key export industries in this country. It is a growing one and certainly event promotion falls under this category. Some of the very important work is to promote events and exhibitions held in Australia, as well as destination marketing for international tourists. By cutting funds available through the EMDG Scheme, Labor made a bad situation worse for an industry already struggling from the high Australian dollar and the whole-ofeconomy carbon tax. Of course, the government is not responsible itself for the success and growth of tourism. That is being done by hard working tourist operators. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme forms an integral part of any government's approach to supporting small and medium-sized operators to get a foothold in foreign markets, whether that be Asia or our more traditional markets in the USA, Europe and Canada. However, what the Labor government did was to take a very piecemeal approach to the tourism industry. They did not have a coherent strategy, nor did they ever plan one. The cut of $25 million last year was yet another example of how they damaged tourism. Now the adults are back in charge. Exporters now have the certainty that an additional $50 million will be provided over four years to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. The coalition took a strong plan for economic growth to the last election, and, now, in government the coalition is delivering. Amendment Bill 2014. The bill delivers on the coalition's election commitment to progressively restore funding to the export market development grants program, which was cut by the previous Labor government. The 2013-14 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook allocated an additional $50 million over four years to the scheme from which Labor had cut $25 million per year. The bill also broadens the eligibility requirements to ensure a greater number of small and medium-sized enterprises receive a greater level of assistance to enter new markets. The bill increases the maximum number of grants per applicant from seven to eight, and reduces the required expenditure threshold to qualify for a grant from $20,000 to $15,000. It reduces the current $5,000 deduction from the applicant's provisional grant amount to $2,500, and about 85 per cent of recipients will receive an extra $2,500 per grant as a result.",148,Bills
293,Mr Pitt (Hinkler) (17:02,"I rise to speak on the Export Market Development GrantsWhat this means is that a new business which has a unique product that only has a market overseas and which is looking for its first sale and is spending just $15,000 on export promotion will now get a $5,000 grant. Previously, they would have received nothing. An experienced exporter who has received seven grants but whose business is suffering due to the high exchange rate will get an extra grant to help try and recover these markets now that the exchange rate is improving. They can receive a grant of up $150,000. Previously, they would have received nothing. This bill will facilitate quicker payment of EMDG in years of low scheme demand or where additional funding is provided. Enhancing the scheme will benefit many small businesses in regional areas like Hinkler. In the last financial year, two businesses in Hervey Bay, which is at the southern end of my electorate, one involving tourism and the other in the fishing industry, received assistance under this program totalling $17,616. I would encourage more of my local businesses to apply. Expanding into new markets is good not only for the business concerned but for the local economy, and it creates jobs. They only need to look at some of their fellow Hinkler businesses to see the opportunities that exports can create. Hinkler has a proud history of exporting. Last year, Bundaberg Brewed Drinks, the makers of the famous ginger beer, was named Queensland exporter of the year. Regarded as one of Australia's most diverse food bowls, we export fruit and vegetables, seafood and sugar. As household incomes increase in India and Asia, so too will the demand for reliable, safe and fresh Australian produce. They are all things that we do well in Hinkler-safe, reliable and fresh. Named after the great aviator Bert Hinkler, the Hinkler electorate is also known for its innovation. From the mechanical cane harvester, to the recreational aircraft built by Jabiru, to beverages like Bundaberg Rum, manufacturing, processing and value-adding is alive and well in Hinkler with the likes of Jakes Candy, Mammino Gourmet Ice Cream and Urangan Fisheries. We also have some large exporters that started out as small local businesses. Bundaberg Walkers Engineering Ltd was established in 1888. Back then it was known as the Bundaberg Foundry. Today, the business is a dynamic organisation servicing the needs of sugar, power generation, mining, marine and general engineering industries in both the domestic and the international market. They export their engineering, technical and design services, and have manufactured equipment to more than 20 countries, including Thailand, Indonesia, Argentina, the US and Sudan. With recent International Women's Day celebrations in mind, I note that Bundaberg Walkers Engineering Ltd now has a female general manager. Leone Aslett is leading the team of 130 workers in a field that is typically dominated by men. With two daughters of my own, it gives me great comfort to see more women forging careers in the major exporting business. I congratulate Leone. She is a local girl that married a local boy, attended university, raised a family and now has a highly successful career. Hinkler, with its access to quality produce and its proximity to Brisbane, has a manufacturing sector that is facing a period of enormous potential. This bill will ensure that local businesses looking to enter new markets get the marketing support that they need. We on this side of the House recognise that small businesses are the backbone of regional Australia. They employ about 50 per cent of all Australians working in the private sector. In Queensland, small businesses account for 96 per cent of all businesses in the state. Yet under Labor they were subjected to an ever-growing list of costly and time-consuming red tape, endless rule changes and 43 new or increased taxes. In a period of just three years, the RuddGillard-Rudd government gave us two Prime Ministers, two Treasurers, five Assistant Treasurers and six small-business ministers. This bill seeks to give businesses certainty so they can begin planning their expansion into new markets. Exporting is a very tough business, and I can give you one example. In my electorate of Hinkler, AustChilli and AvoFresh, which are owned by the local De Paoli family, employ between 80 and 100 people and they inject more than $10 million per annum into the local community through employment, products and services. They supply food ingredients, fresh produce and value added products to supermarkets in Australia and multinational food companies. They are innovative, they are forward thinking and they are continually looking for new markets and product opportunities. At present, exports make up just a small portion of their revenue. Director Trent De Paoli recently outlined for me some of the challenges they face in exporting from Australia and why their success to date has largely been in domestic growth. The cost of developing and servicing export markets is high. The expense of travelling to your target country is often in excess of $50,000, and that is before you have even started receiving an income from that market. Often with new markets the up-take is slow; it takes years to build viable and financially sustainable returns that reflect the investment made. To be successful in today's fast-paced world you need to have your own people on the ground to ensure the business trade is accurately supported-again, a high expense that is critical. Import duties can often significantly affect potential success. Australian goods are very expensive due to the high costs of production, including labour, electricity and water. This impacts our ability to compete globally. However, Mr De Paoli still views the glass as being half full. He says the exchange rate is helping exports. The demand is there. As I stated previously, emerging middle classes globally want high-value products, and Australia is regarded globally as a stable country that produces quality. The export market development grants will help businesses get a foot in the door. They are just one of the things that this government is doing to help smallto medium-sized businesses. Of particular benefit to my electorate, and as promised, we have also suspended Labor's flawed marine management plans. We will create a new plan in consultation with stakeholders, one that is based on science. We are providing $6.5 million for 25 research projects to ensure the continued sustainability of Australian fisheries, including expanding the Status of key Australian fish stocks report to include more species. We are producing an agriculture competitiveness white paper to identify ways to grow farm profits and enhance agriculture's contribution to economic growth, trade, innovation and productivity. Repealing the carbon tax will begin the process of restoring Australia's global competitiveness. Even Virgin Australia head John Borghetti has indicated the best assistance the parliament can provide to business is the removal of Labor's carbon tax, which has cost the aviation industry hundreds of millions of dollars. The carbon tax cost Qantas $106 million in 2012-13. That money would have paid the wages of at least a thousand staff. For my local businesses, the costs of electricity and refrigerant gases, for example, skyrocketed with the introduction of the tax. We are cutting red and green tape to save businesses time and money. We are dedicating days in parliament to slashing unnecessary red and green tape to lift productivity and boost economic growth. And we recently released full details of the free trade agreement we negotiated with South Korea. The removal of tariffs will benefit a range of Hinkler exporters, including those in the sugar, horticulture and seafood industries. When the agreement is fully implemented, 99.8 per cent of Australian exports will enter Korea duty free, resulting in agricultural exports increasing by 73 per cent by 2030. Korea is Australia's third largest export market, our fourth largest trading partner and an economy with an above average growth outlook. It is Australia's largest market for raw sugar. Importantly, this agreement protects our competitive position in the Korean market. With one in five Australian jobs linked to trade, this agreement will provide an important boost to Australia's economy. Economic modelling estimates that that agreement will boost our economy by about $653 million after 15 years. And we are working to conclude agreements with other trading partners to boost Australia's competitiveness in the global economy. This includes the TransPacific Partnership, which involves 12 countries including Australia and represents a staggering 39 per cent of global gross domestic product. Our exports to member countries are worth almost $100 billion a year, accounting for about 34 per cent of our trade overall. I also welcome the Prime Minister's announcement that he will visit Japan, Korea and China next month with premiers and chief ministers to strengthen diplomatic and trade ties. He hopes to sign the free trade agreement with Korea while he is there and progress negotiations with China and Japan. The three countries together represent 40 per cent of Australia's total two-way trade in goods and services, valued at a total of $250 billion. While China is Australia's largest two-way trading partner, 123 countries around the world are in the same boat. Competition is fierce. A free trade agreement will protect our relationship with China. With that in mind, I note comments made recently by China's Premier Li that they will seek to accelerate negotiations with Australia. Unfortunately, the negotiations had stalled badly under the previous Labor government. While Labor dithered for eight years, New Zealand beat us to it, reaching an agreement with China four years ago. Since then, New Zealand's dairy sales to China have increased by $2.2 billion. We have every reason to believe an agreement will be reached with China this year. This bill ensures the export market development grants program complements the trade agreements and partnerships that we are putting in place, making it easier, not harder, to do business in Australia. This will grow the economy and create jobs for current and future generations-further proof that the coalition is focused on trade, not trade unions. (17:13): I welcome this bill and wholeheartedly support the changes to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme that the bill will achieve. The bill delivers practical yet important changes to the Export Market Development Grants, EMDG, Scheme to assist small and medium enterprises to gain access to new markets or to enhance their engagement with existing markets. As we have heard from previous coalition speakers, small to medium enterprises certainly are the backbone of the Australian economy. In fact, they are very much the engine room of the Australian economy, as we just heard from the member for Hinkler. As the minister highlighted in his introductory speech, this bill delivers on yet another coalition election commitment to progressively restore, and increase, funding to support our exporters which was removed by the previous government. I recall speaking against Labor's bill on 12 March last year which cut funding from this very scheme when Labor shamelessly",150,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
294,Mr Mccormack (Riverina,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance)ripped $25 million a year out of the EMDG to fill its ever-growing budget black hole at the time. It was so shameless because it came at a time when our exporters were struggling under the weight-the very weight-of a high Australian dollar, the weight of a new carbon tax and the burden of significant red tape. In my electorate of the Riverina exporters were also facing the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which Labor made so very difficult for those people. Ms Rishworth: It is a good plan! good plan. It is now, because New South Wales has just signed up and, as the member for Kingston would well know, because it was a bad plan they held out until the coalition came to power and offered a good plan. Her South Australian Liberal colleague Senator Simon Birmingham has offered 10 gigalitres of environmental flows to be sold to productive growers in the Gwydir Valley in the north of New South Wales and, hopefully, when that works-as it will-water will be offered in the rice-growing season to my irrigators in the southern end of the basin in the Riverina. For our livestock industry, these cuts by Labor also came in the wake of Labor's kneejerk decision to ban the live cattle trade overnight in reaction to a television program. There is no doubt that Australia needs to export the goods that we produce and the knowledge we create. This is vital not only to ensure the future viability of our manufacturing sector but to create jobs and to build prosperity right across the economy, whether that be in mining and resources-so important in Western Australia-agriculture services or in research and education. This is in line with the coalition's strong commitment to building a five-pillar economy. To help Western Australia, we want to get rid of the mining and carbon taxes which have been so crippling and so job destroying in that state. The Abbott-Truss government recognises that we need to support our small to medium enterprises to break into new markets and to expand existing markets. This will not happen by accident. While many of Australia's industry sectors produce some of the best quality and most sought-after products and commodities in the world, it is still a huge challenge to secure overseas markets to sell to. While Australia's terms of trade have risen by an unprecedented 75 per cent between 1998 and 2008-a period of time dominated by a coalition federal government-that has been driven largely by a rise in commodity prices, and particularly iron ore exports. It demonstrates that we still have significant opportunities for our non-resources sectors to pursue in enhancing our engagement with foreign markets. Just this week, we had a delegation here from Mongolia. I visited Mongolia, and I know the great iron ore industry that Mongolia has. Certainly, Australian companies and Australian expertise are helping Mongolia to extract the wealth of their iron ore. But they do not have a job-destroying carbon tax placed over their industry. The opportunities presented by a growing Asian middle class, with ever growing demand for Australia's high-quality products, need to be seized and need to be seized now. The EMDG has been an extremely effective mechanism which has enabled hundreds of Australian smallto medium-sized businesses to better promote their products and to seek new markets overseas for more than two decades now. Evaluations of the EMDG consistently confirm the value of the scheme to our exporters and demonstrate that the scheme directly",153,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
295,Mr Mccormack,"I can hear my South Australian opponent opposite say that it is aincreases Australia's exports. For every dollar spent in EMDG for capital constrained firms it generates a boost to exports of up to $20, and as high as $220 in some cases. I know the member for Paterson here, who is very conscious of improving our tourism exports, will certainly agree with me there. The changes to the EMDG contained in this bill will make it even easier for businesses to qualify for the grant. Firstly, the bill increases the number of times a firm can access EMDG funding from seven to eight. The bill now reduces the amount firms have to spend on export promotion from $20,000 to $15,000 and reduces the deduction from an applicant's provisional grant amount by half from $5,000 to $2,500. So for example, if an eligible business spends $20,000 on export promotion, under these changes the business can apply for EMDG funding of up to $7,500 rather than the $5,000 it can claim currently. The bill will also provide for faster payment of grant funding to successful applicants, to provide certainty to their business-and certainty is really important. You get certainty under the coalition. All we got under Labor was uncertainty. Finally, the bill will also prevent grants being paid where a firm has engaged an EMDG consultant who is considered not to be a fit and proper person. In my own electorate, the Riverina, we boast a number of small and medium enterprises across a diverse range of industries and which are well placed to take advantage of this scheme. Being the food bowl of Australia. I unashamedly say that because the Riverina is the food bowl of Australia because of all the good water policy that the coalition is introducing-it has strategically significant horticultural and livestock industries well placed to meet international demand. We have the best wheat, the best beef and the best lamb of anywhere in the world. And certainly when it comes to wineMr Baldwin: Ah, yes! wine. An export success story from my own electorate is SunRice, based in Leeton, which has developed over six decades from a single rice mill to become Australia's largest rice exporter, exporting 80 per cent of Australia's rice output to more than 60 countries. But it is not just food and fibre that the Riverina produces. We have sophisticated manufacturing, processing, viticulture and services sectors which would like to take advantage of the Asian century-and indeed they can under a coalition government which is open for business. With ongoing support of schemes such as the EMDG, I am confident that through our small and medium businesses promoting their businesses and products overseas we will increase Australian exports. While Labor cut export promotion funding, the coalition is restoring it. This will boost exports, support critical industries, create jobs and build prosperity for all Australians. The difference in priorities between this coalition government and the former Labor government could not be more stark. This bill delivers on another key election commitment, and I very much commend it to the House. And as I do, I would like to talk about several Riverina businesses which are really winning in export markets. I speak of Hyne Timber at Tumbarumba, Murrumbidgee Irrigation Ltd and Coleambally Irrigation Co-operative Ltd. They may not be seen as great exporters,",154,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
296,Mr Mccormack,"AndI hear the member for Paterson agreeing! We also have the bestbut the water they provide and the businesses that they run certainly underpin the whole economy of the western end of the Riverina. Those irrigation communities are providing enormous export benefits and balance of trade boosts to the Riverina, to New South Wales and indeed to our nation. Then there is Advanced Communications and Southern Oil Refining. Last Wednesday I was very privileged to join the Minister for Industry, the member for Groom; the Queensland Minister for Environment and Heritage Protection, the Hon. Andrew Powell; and my good friend and colleague the member for Flynn, Ken O'Dowd; at the opening of the Northern Oil Refinery in Gladstone, which is in Ken O'Dowd's electorate. It was a wonderful occasion. While much of Australian manufacturing is going down the gurgler unfortunately, a new, innovative and environmentally-friendly industry was officially launched in Yarwun on Wednesday. The $55 million Northern Oil Refinery, which will provide valuable exports, is the biggest of its kind in Australia and it sits right in Gladstone's backyard. It brings 40 new operational jobs and so many more indirect jobs to the region. It is a joint-venture project. Southern Oil Refining based in Wagga Wagga started when a few environmentally-friendly farmers came together because they wanted the means to create new oil out of the used sump oil on their farms. They came together and Southern Oil came about as a result. From that little idea of the few farmers in Wagga Wagga in New South Wales we now have a $55 million plant in Central Queensland. Southern Oil Refining joined with JJ Richards& Sons, another great environmentallyfriendly company. The project was officially launched by Minister Powell, who said that the value of the materials in commercial and industrial waste was estimated at $26.5 billion a year. In Australia about 350 million litres of waste oil is created annually, with 60 per cent of that burned and 24 per cent exported overseas to be burned. Once fully operational this rerefinery will reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by 290,000 tonnes per year. Southern Oil Refining Managing Director Tim Rose said that the plant was the next generation of waste oil management. He is so right. He gave a tremendous speech in which he said it was a unique event and hoped it was going to be something to be remembered. This is the start of a new industrial enterprise. Tim Rose said, 'At a time in Australia when much of the news is about how tough it is, particularly in manufacturing, we have stood up and committed to a significant investment in the future.' He said they are very proud of that, and so they should be. He said: To the uninitiated 'lube oil' may not sound too sexy, but it is essential … it keeps your cars running, our planes in the air, mining and farming equipment going-it literally lubricates the wheels of commerce and industry. This export industry started in Wagga Wagga and there is now a $55 million refinery in Central Queensland. I am very proud, like Tim Rose. Lubricating oil does not wear out; it just gets dirty and the additives in the oil lose effectiveness over time. They are going to re-refine it. The re-refining plant can process 100 per cent-every single drop-of Queensland's annual used lube oil. This represents a fantastic environmental opportunity for the state and for the industry. I want to promote some more industries in the Riverina that are doing great export marketing things. We can talk about De Bortoli Wines, Warburn Estate, Westend Estate and Byrne Trailers. Byrne Trailers have been hard hit by the terrible shutdown of the live cattle export industry. They make fantastic trailers in Wagga Wagga and are getting things back on track after that hard hit. Then there is SunRice, which I mentioned before. Casella Wines last October toasted the success of bottling its billionth bottle of Yellow Tail wine. The Yenda based winery has gone from strength to strength after signing a multimillion dollar partnership with Coca-Cola Amatil, and has announced the release of two new products to the Australian market. In December last year they posted a $29 billion loss-and that hurt. That was the biggest loss in the company's history. That loss was brought about by the high Australian dollar but was not helped by the carbon tax-they use a lot of power at Casella Wines. Despite that loss, the family winery has seen a surge in positivity since the Australian dollar dipped. Casella's Managing Director, John Casella, said that the one billionth bottle milestone was one his family never envisaged would happen so quickly. Yellow Tail was released in 2001. One billion bottles means that 10 billion glasses of Yellow Tail wine have been enjoyed around the world. Yellow Tail has held its position as the No. 1 imported wine and the No. 1 red wine in the United States-and to know that that comes from the Riverina! John Casella, his team, his family and all the grape growers right around the Riverina should feel very proud of that. As John Casella said: Our success is testament to the commitment and hard work of all of our staff, and the support of our distributors, trade partners and our loyal fans. We’re continuing to see growth year-on-year and this is a result of the quality, consistency and value proposition that we offer. It also shows exactly what can be done when we get the water to be able to grow those fine grapes and all the fine things we do in the Riverina. That is why I fought so hard to get a better water deal for my growers in the Riverina. We all need our water. I appreciate that South Australia needs water, but so does the Riverina to be able to grow the food and fibre that is the very best in the world. Ms Rishworth: We grow grapes too! Kingston. And you do make great wine. You also need water to be able to do that. That is why it cannot all go to the environment; it has to go to productive use. That is why the coalition is getting on with the job. We are also getting on with the job with this very important bill, which I commend to the House. I rise to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2014. This is a refreshing bill that delivers on our election commitment to actually increase the funding for export market development grants. This bill increases the funding to the EMDG Scheme by $50 million over four years. In contrast, the former Labor government in their first bill on export market development grants in 2010-and I spoke on that matter on 16 June 2010reduced the export market development grants from $200 million to $150 million. Just to show that they could be outdone, when I spoke on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013 on 14 March last year they cut it from $150 million to $125 billion. When I hear speakers from the opposition speaking on this bill saying how good export market development grants are-how they are going to increase local businesses' opportunities to get into overseas markets and how they will bring great economic benefit to this nation-I often wonder if these are the same people who sat there very quietly when it",155,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
297,Mr Mccormack,"I know you grow grapes too. That is fantastic, member for",157,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
298,Mr Baldwin (Paterson,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry) (17:28):was cut from $200 million to $50 million, when their plan was to cut it from $150 million to $125 million. Over the reign of their government, they reduced funding for export market development grants from $200 million per annum down to $125 million per annum at the very time when we needed to grow our export markets. There are some measures in this bill that will be well received by all industry sectors, but most importantly by smallto medium-sized enterprises. This bill will increase the number of grants an applicant can receive from seven to eight. That is good news. What the former government wanted to do was not only restrict the number of applications but also direct where those applications could be spent. Now we all understand that we are right at the cusp of a rapidly emerging Asian market, and, yes, we should be doing everything we can to embrace that market and capitalise on our efforts. But at the end of the day, it is actually up to individuals in business to put their own money on the line to attract markets, and then have government support. It is not for governments to dictate where markets should and should not be. If you believe in free enterprise, if you believe in return on investment for the risk that you take, then you should allow individuals to determine which markets they think they will get the best return on. In a former role I held in this House-that is, as the shadow minister for tourism-I held a number of roundtables with the tourism industry. At each and every roundtable, the issue of export market development grants came up. Tourism operators in particular need access to those grants, because tourism operators in particular are usually very small-sized businesses, and access to that supporting capital can mean the difference between those businesses surviving and crashing. If those businesses survive and grow, that means more jobs for Australians. That is why this is good. What is particularly impressive about these amendments put forward by Minister Andrew Robb is that they will reduce the minimum expenses threshold to be incurred by an applicant from $20,000 down to $15,000. That means smaller operators will be able to go overseas, will have financial support for printing brochures in different languages to make sure that those new customers can read in their own language what they want, will be able to attend trade shows, will be able to beat down the doors and will be able to bring new business to Australia. This is good news. The other thing that is particularly good for businesses sharing the love, as I call it, is to reduce the $5,000 deduction from the applicant's provisional grant to $2,500. To give you an understanding of how that works, currently on an eligible expenditure for $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 there is no rebate proposed, no export market development grant. But what will happen now is at $15,000 there will be a $5,000 proposed rule. Then at $20,000, the current grant rule of $5,000 goes up to $7,500. All the way through it provides a great benefit, but it caps out with eligible expenditure of $305,000 at $150,000. So up to 50 per cent of what you spend marketing your business opportunities for Australians in overseas markets-you have the ability to have that rebated by this government. There are two other aspects of this bill which are worthy of consideration and show an understanding and an engagement with industry. One is the prevention of payments of grants to applicants engaging in EMDG consulting assessed to be not a fit and proper person. The one that really is impressive and will win small business in particular, is to enable a grant to be paid more quickly where a grant is determined before 1 July following the balance of distribution date. Small businesses run on very tight cash flows at times. The opportunity to have these grants to promote their business and to get that money in a timely manner is critically important. Some of the people in my electorate who accessed these grants in previous rounds are companies like Moonshadow Cruises, who win national tourism awards for taking people out whale watching and dolphin watching. I have watched that business grow from one boat to a number of boats. They are now operating out of my home port of Port Stephens, and they are also expanding into Newcastle. What is really good is that when I go down there to the waterfront, I see the numbers of tourist buses with people from the Asian region just lining up. They are lining up, spending money in my electorate, and that is great. I encourage them and other operators like Tamboi Queen Cruises, who have also accessed the EMDG Scheme. But it is not limited to tourism operators. As the previous speaker said, winery operatorsthere is no doubt we have the best wine in the world in the Hunter Valley. You would often wonder why you would need export market development grants to compete when you have the best wine such as comes from the Hunter Valley, but you actually do. Mr Sukkar: The Yarra Valley! what is important is that we provide the support for people to export our agricultural product. This is not only our wines but also some of our fresh foods. New markets, particularly Asian markets, are to be encouraged and supported. One of the other companies in my region who accessed export market development grants in previous rounds is Weathertex, who took an old product like masonite, took that technology and turned it into weatherboard sidings. They have not only saved an old factory and kept workers on, they have also expanded into international markets, particularly into the European markets, with their pre-painted weatherboard siding. The Hunter Valley is also becoming the home to the mining support services industry. A lot of those technologies and products are exported. If people in other countries do not know what you have on offer, how can they buy it? So it is about going to the trade shows, it is about having the displays, it is about making sure people can see and understand. The essence of building an international business is actually the relationship, and that relationship needs to be addressed face to face. You need to build the relationship before you can build the business and that is where these grants come in. This is not only limited to, as I said, tourism, wine, wood products or mining industries. Even industries in our region like music and software have accessed the export market development grants and built businesses on the back of them. When you live in a country that has roughly 23 million people, your market is limited. You need to expand globally, to pick up more markets, to increase the economies of scale of your business. We need to encourage small business. As I said earlier, the last two bills brought in during the reign of the previous Labor government saw the money for export market development grants cut from $200 million to $150 million. Just when we thought that this was as bad as it could be, they cut it from $150 million to $125 million and put more conditions on the small to medium enterprises in particular that wanted to access the grants to grow their business. They should be condemned for that. Yet we heard a number of speakers on the Labor side stand up and talk about how wonderful export market development grants are and how great they are for manufacturing. I would like to ask them: why did they not speak up when their own government was cutting the budget?",157,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
299,Mr Baldwin,"I know there is a dispute on the quality of wines all over Australia, but I commend this bill to the House because, while I support all industry, I support small to medium enterprises in particular. They put their own skin in the game, determined to take the risk, and when government supports them and gives them a hand-up and access to those markets, they can achieve their maximum potential. I commend this bill to the House. Grants Amendment Bill 2014. In doing so, I quote my good friend and colleague the member for Longman, who said this is all about a 'hand up' not a 'handout'. This bill delivers an extra $50 million over four years for export market development grants and fulfils an election promise to increase the funding. One thing we have been very good at since the election is doing what we said before the election we would do. Before the election, we said we would do this; now we are delivering. The city of Townsville is home to me and my family. The export market development grants will help small and medium businesses reach their export potential. Townsville has over 10,000 small-sized businesses and over 700 medium-sized businesses. Townsville is trying to build itself as a major exporter to South-East Asia. One of my goals in this term of parliament is to truly internationalise my city, and international flights in and out of Townsville are the most important thing. We have a great, progressive port with a very good board on it now. We are looking to expand the services of the port. Additionally, one of the things previous administrations have done for Townsville is that over 30 years ago we became a sister city with Port Moresby. The previous Labor Mayor of Townsville, Tony Mooney, has always said, 'I sign on the line and I make it my own.' The closest capital city to Townsville is not Brisbane; it is in fact Port Moresby. We are very close to Port Moresby. We need to develop our closer ties. We are also home to the North Queensland Cowboys. The Intrust Super Cup is the next tier down competition. The Papua New Guinean Hunters are in the Intrust Super Cup. They play against Mackay, Cairns and teams from Brisbane, as well as Rockhampton. They are going pretty good at the moment, too. Papua New Guinea loves Rugby League. It is the only country in the world that has Rugby League as its international sport. We need to increase our cultural, sporting and economic ties with our closest neighbour, Papua New Guinea. It makes sense. I am very proud to say that the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, will be going to Port Moresby this weekend with a business delegation, of which I will be a part, along with the member for Ryan. We will make sure that we are putting our best foot forward. We will be going there as the Australian business delegation, but I am going there with one thought and one thought only-that is, to make sure that Townsville gets its fair bite of the cherry. The Minister for Trade and Investment, Andrew Robb, has been very upfront about and very proud of this bill because he understands the need to get into export markets. He understands the need to invest time and energy into new markets. When Andrew Robb was in Townsville during the campaign last year, he addressed a large audience at breakfast in Townsville. One of the telling statistics of the tropical world-that is, between the tropics of Capricorn and Cancer-is that there are currently 500 million people around the world who would be classified as middle class. Andrew Robb told that gathering that by 2035 the number of people who will be considered middle class will grow to 3.6 billion people-and most of them will be directly north of Australia. So the development of Northern Australia is key to the development of Asia, the delivery of services, the delivery of food and the delivery of",159,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
300,Mr Ewen Jones (Herbert) (17:39,"I rise to speak on the Export Market Developmenteducation, and Townsville will be front and centre. We must make sure, when we are talking about the development of Northern Australia, we are talking about our relationship with Papua New Guinea. Townsville invests heavily in Papua New Guinea. We have people in Townsville like Sir Mick Curtain, who has significant infrastructure projects and significant investments in Papua New Guinea. We must ensure we maintain those close ties. We have a wide-ranging engagement with Papua New Guinea. These EMDGs will make sure that we are able to further develop that. One of the YWAM ships, which takes medical treatments upriver in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea, spreading medical services around the country, was in Port Moresby. I was able to take a delegation from the Townsville Chamber of Commerce to Port Moresby, and the high commission was kind enough to organise a reception for us and the people of YWAM. All the people who came were from Townsville. So, we are in this space. Two-way trade between our two countries was over $5.7 billion in 2012-13. Deepening our economic ties is a major focus. Trade from Papua New Guinea to Australia is also a major focus. Peter O'Neill, the Papua New Guinean Prime Minister, spoke about the need to develop those micro business ties between the two countries to facilitate trade. That is how the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea saw it, that is how I see it, as the member for Herbert, and I know that is how the Prime Minister and the minister for trade want this to develop. Townsville will play a major role in that, not only in direct trade but in the delivery of services. Townsville has James Cook University, a teaching hospital at the Townsville Hospital, military services through Australian Defence Force capabilities and training out of Lavarack Barracks, and vocational and educational training sectors and other professional services sectors. It is important not to think about trade as simply being about building something here and shifting it. Trade is about the exchange of money for the exchange of services or products. Townsville is a great base for a lot of fantastic professional people, from town planning and engineering through to solicitors and accountants. We should be able to export those sorts of services. The grants about which we are speaking are about helping us to get started. If a business were to spend $20,000 trying to establish themselves in an overseas market, they would be able to get back $7,500 on one of these grants. That is up from $5,000. The other big thing is that we have speeded up the process of getting that money back. That is the key to it. It is one thing to say that these grants are available but-and it does not matter to which sector we are referring-we need to speed up the processing of the grants. My dad's family started exporting pigs to Singapore and Malaysia in the late 1960s-that is how long the international live animal trade has been going on. They understood what it was like to go overseas to establish a new business. They knew the importance of understanding their customer. In Australia, a person who wants to sell something generally understands the road to the sale-meet and greet, establish a rapport, qualify the customer, examine the features, advantages and benefits of the sale, complete a trial close-'How does that sound?'-handle an objection in the trial close, handle any actual objections and close. That is how it works in Australia. When going overseas it is imperative to understand how they do business. When my family went to China for the first time, or even the first six or seven times, they did not even mention business. The trip was about establishing bona fides; it was about understanding your customer. That is where you need to understand what trade is all about. That is why this bill is important and that is why these EDMGs are so very important, because so much of the sales process is about establishing trust and establishing a relationship with that new client by letting them know that you are not just in there for the dollar; you are in there for the long haul. It takes guts to start up a business in Australia. It takes guts for a person to believe that they have a good idea and that they are capable of being in command of their own destiny. I wish I had had the guts to do it myself, but I never did. I was a good manager but I never had the guts to back my talent and put everything on the line. If you can imagine how tough it is to start up a business in Australia, imagine how hard it is for someone to start a new part of their business in another country, where the only thing they know is that their product is goodthey understand their product and they know that it is needed by the overseas market. It is necessary to establish a relationship with those customers from scratch and understand the way they do business. It takes time to develop those networks. As the member for Paterson was saying, we have to understand that these things take time and time is money. There are little bits and pieces that we can and should do to help businesses over that hump. Whether we are talking about emerging markets, such as Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, India and China, or our mature markets, such as the US, Canada, Great Britain and other First World countries in the EU, we have to understand that it does take time to develop these relationships. We have to understand what it is that we are trying to do here. We have to back our business people and accept that they do understand what they are doing. We have to back these people because they have to spend a little to make a little-that is the key to this. I am very proud to say that this government is serious about the development of Northern Australia. There will be a major forum held in Townsville at the end of this financial year and we will bring investors, heads of government departments and ministers together to make sure that we are talking about the development of Northern Australia, because that leads into what we are trying to do here. These small and medium businesses need help to get across that hump. That is all they need, because they have the products, they have the services, they have the work ethic and they have the people. This is what this government is doing-this government is backing business in Australia. When Tony Abbott said on the night of 7 September that Australia is open for business, he meant it. With this bill, Andrew Robb, the Minister for Trade and Investment, is delivering on that promise. I thank the House. Debate adjourned. Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill. As members will know, I am an extremely enthusiastic advocate for nation building. I understand the way in which a lack of adequate infrastructure can smother an economy and cost jobs. I saw it with my own eyes during the 12 wasted Howard years which landed the Labor government that followed it with the largest infrastructure deficit in this nation's history. Equally, I understand what can happen when",160,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
301,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (17:51,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Landgovernments invest wisely in infrastructure. Astute investment can drive major productivity gains that create jobs. It can be truly transformative for an economy. Labor's investments while in government, like rebuilding or upgrading 7,500 kilometres of road and 4,000 kilometres of railway lines, will deliver positive economic outcomes for many years to come. They represent the economic gift that keeps on giving. However, by its very nature, infrastructure planning and delivery is a long-term business requiring long lead times, careful planning and political courage. I have often said that the key challenge for infrastructure is to break the nexus that exists between the political cycle-which is by definition very short-term, in the federal sphere a maximum of just three years-and the infrastructure investment cycle, which is, by its very nature, longer term. Infrastructure development also requires imagination and creativity. If you can imagine the future, you can assemble the building blocks to deliver your vision. That is the Labor way. We are the party of nation building. We built the transcontinental railway and the Snowy Mountains scheme. When we were in government, we did the hard planning work for the high-speed rail link between Brisbane and Melbourne. The coalition has a different approach. Its investments are usually geared towards its shortterm political interests, rather than the longer term national interest. As I mentioned earlier, the Howard government underinvested in infrastructure. This was despite the fact that it collected a bonanza in tax revenue, driven by the mining boom. The Howard government was much higher taxing as a proportion of GDP than Labor governments, yet, in terms of infrastructure investment, it failed to deliver. Remember those photographs of freighters lined up for days outside the nation's ports because the coalition lacked the nous to understand that the increasing demand for Australian minerals required investment-not just in port facilities but also in the land freight network that fed into those port facilities. So, by the 2007 election, the then Prime Minister John Howard and his National Party colleagues, like the member for Wide Bay, were simply unable to refute the charge that they had underinvested. This was part of the reason why they lost government. They talked a good game from time to time but were found wanting when it came to actually investing in our roads, in our railways and in our ports. Now that the coalition is back in government it has inherited a Labor legacy in infrastructure investment of the type that I could have only dreamed about in 2007. In six years in office we delivered record investment into the land transport system, including doubling the roads budget to $46.5 billion, which allowed us to build or upgrade 7,500 kilometres of road; boosting Commonwealth roads grants to councils by 20 per cent; and pumping historic, record levels of investment into the rail system, which allowed the repair or reconstruction of nearly 4,000 kilometres of track between Parkes and Broken Hill. To give one example: I was very proud to be in Parkes, where we laid the one millionth new concrete sleeper on that upgraded track. Indeed, our investment through the Australian Rail Track Corporation will see some six hours taken off the journey from Brisbane through to Melbourne and nine hours taken off the journey from the east to west coast. That makes it far more competitive to put freight onto rail, thereby taking pressure off the road system. Of course, we also began the planning work for the Brisbane to Melbourne inland freight project, and we allocated $300 million to it. We completed planning for a high-speed rail link between Brisbane and Melbourne via Sydney and Canberra. In fact, I have a private member's bill before this parliament to create an authority that would begin to set aside the corridor for this important and visionary project. Mr Deputy Speaker Kelly, addressing one of the big bottlenecks that you would be aware of in Sydney's transport system is, of course, the Moorebank Intermodal project. It was initially opposed by the coalition, including the member for Hughes. The member for Hughes campaigned very strongly against it-a position which is now rejected by his party, who understand how important the Moorebank Intermodal project is for Sydney in taking trucks off the road and providing a productivity benefit. As a result of this record of achievement, Australia now tops the list of 25 OECD industrialised countries in terms of infrastructure investment as a p-ro-ortion of GDP. When we took office in 2007, the nation was 20th on this list. Think about that. When Labor came to office and I was sworn in as infrastructure minister, Australia ranked 20th out of 25 OECD countries. In 2013, when I ceased to be the infrastructure minister, we were ranked first. I can be very proud of that record, and the Labor Party is very proud of that record. We got things done. Just ask the second ever appointed minister for infrastructure, the member for Wide Bay, who complained for years that the Cooroy to Curra section of the Bruce Highway was, in his own words, 'the most dangerous road in the country'. He was the transport minister as well as the member for Wide Bay when he said this, but he did nothing to fix it. Cooroy to Curra section B was promised, funded, built and opened by the former Labor government and me, as the infrastructure minister. Construction of section B was jointly promised and funded with the Queensland state government. It is under construction as we speak. When I first examined the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill, I found it difficult to understand why a government that talks a little bit from time to time about eliminating waste would waste so much time on a bill that appears to do little more than change the name of the existing legislation. SoI listened very carefully to the minister's second reading speech as he explained that the bill would change the name of the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 to the Land Transport Act 2014. The bill also formalises the decision made in the Labor government's 2013 budget to continue the existing Roads to Recovery program beyond 30 June this year. It also eliminates some out-ofdate provisions in existing legislation. When the minister presented these changes, he said that it was about delivering the government's 'ambitious land transport infrastructure agenda'. This is really just spin. This just removes the term 'nation building' from the statute books, which, I think, is a recognition that the minister perhaps understands that nation building is associated with Labor, because it is Labor that has always been the political party in this country concerned with the building of our nation. I think this is also consistent with the minister's attempts to remove any hint of the former Labor government from the infrastructure debate. We know that when the Howard government was in office they had the AusLink program that had signs everywhere in exactly the same colours as the National Party. So the National Party ministers out thereMr Chester interjectingand say, 'Yes, that is right.' There they were: the National Party signs next to the signs in their",162,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
302,Mr Albanese,"At least the member for Gippsland has the honesty to put his hand upcolours paid for by the taxpayers. They may as well have tried to put the logo on them. I sought assurances in writing from the new minister that there would be no additional cost to taxpayers because of this change of name. He has given that assurance, and I intend to ensure that it is complied with, because that would be an absolute outrage in terms of taxpayers funds. But the minister is in the business of rewriting history; he is a propagandist. In fact, the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development reminds me of Winston Smith, the central character in the George Orwell novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Working under the yoke of a totalitarian regime, Winston's job was to literally rewrite history. He would sit at his desk waiting for written advice from the regime and then find any piece of written history or source material that was at odds with its current version of history. Then, he would just change the records-hey presto, history is changed. That is exactly the role of the minister for infrastructure in the Abbott government. Since last year, Mr Truss, as the transport minister, and his errand boy, the member for Mayo, have re-announced literally dozens of Labor infrastructure projects across the nation. They have named these investments as coalition projects despite the fact that these projects were designed, funded and either completed or are on their way to completion as a result of decisions made by the former Labor government. We saw it here again today with the Gateway WA project: fully funded; a billion dollars; a joint media release from me and the former WA Treasurer, Troy Buswell, on 1 February 2013 when construction began on that project. And the coalition's member for Swan was there at the beginning of construction. I know that Wide Bay is a long way from Perth, it is a long way from where this construction is occurring, but I can assure the member for Wide Bay that there are diggers and heavy road machinery in operation there. There are people working on the Gateway WA project, and he is trying to tell the people of WA that this project began this week, last week or whenever it was that he visited Western Australia. This is absolutely extraordinary behaviour that, frankly, a mature political discourse should rule out. In many cases, this dynamic duo-the member for Wide Bay and the member for Mayo, his errand boy-have the cheek to seek a claim for projects which they voted against when Labor put the funding bills through the parliament. We know that they voted against the economic stimulus plan where many of these projects were funded. They have no shame and no imagination. Let us take a look at the evidence. On Sunday, we were treated to the embarrassing spectacle of the Prime Minister and the member for Wide Bay's errand boy purporting to announce a new road link between the F3 and the M2 in Sydney. The problem with that is that that followed years of negotiation between the federal and state governments, who worked in partnership. Duncan Gay, the New South Wales roads minister and a National Party member, worked very cooperatively with me as the federal minister. That is what people want to see occur-governments of different persuasions working together constructively. In this case, we worked constructively with Transurban who run a lot of the Sydney road network, including the M2 and M7. This project completes the missing link that is there, allows significant congestion to be avoided-21 sets of traffic lights-and makes sure that people who are travelling around Sydney do not have to go through Sydney, which makes a big difference to productivity. We agreed on it. We put it in the 2013 budget-the agreement from each level of government was $400 million originally. Then after the budget, I had to go back after a request from Minister Gay from New South Wales and get an additional $5 million, because it was agreed that each level of government would put in $5 million and Transurban $10 million so that there would be $20 million for the early works, the planning provisions. We did that. We signed an agreement in the government party room-of the coalition, actually-in New South Wales Parliament House on 21 June last year. There were cameras there. It was a media event. At that time, as a result, money started flowing in the 2012-13 financial year. It flowed again in the current financial year. Yet, you have the Prime Minister and the member for Wide Bay, along with Barry O'Farrell, pretending that somehow there was something different happening on Sunday. There was no news on Sunday. The current government did not pay one extra dollar, because the work had all been done. The Prime Minister, looking as he was, the great pretender of Australian politics, presenting the old as new again, even though there was not a single dollar flowing. But we see that right around the country. It will be interesting on Friday when the minister for infrastructure and his state counterpart open the Hunter Expressway. Labor funded this in 2009. It cost the Commonwealth $1.5 billion and the state government $200 million. It was a part of our economic stimulus program to address the effects of the global financial crisis. It was recommended by Infrastructure Australia because of what it will do for the freight network. It will be a huge bonus for the people of Cessnock, Maitland, Newcastle and the upper Hunter. It will be a great day for the community, which campaigned very strongly for it, and in particular for the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon, who can be very proud of his efforts in ensuring that this occurred. I am sure that on Friday there will be another attempt to pretend that this whole project has been built in the last six weeks, if the government is true to form. The government has been going around the country doing this. In Queensland, the Cape York infrastructure package of 16 January, announced last year, was included fully in the 2013 budget. We had the errand boy, the assistant minister, claiming credit for the Gateway Motorway North at the Brisbane River, out there inspecting the works, which are the extra lanes that have been opened. During the election campaign, they kept promising the money as if this was a new project. It is a project that is so new that one section of it is open already. We also committed additional funds to extend that area. We are seeing no additional money and no new projects in Queensland, not even for the Bruce Highway, the most important road for Queensland. One of the things that they are doing is saying that they will fund 80 per cent of the road, even though existing projects like Cooroy to Curra SectionA already have fifty-fifty funding in them. This means that state governments will not have to put any money into the highway for some time. In New South Wales we are seeing the result of that already, on the Pacific Highway. The New South Wales government, in its mini-budget at the end of last year, reduced money from the Pacific Highway and said, 'We cannot spend all of the money that has been allocated by the former government for the Pacific Highway.' In the Northern Territory, we saw a re-announcement of projects. The current government re-announced the Regional Roads Productivity Package, worth $90 million, and the additional Tiger Brennan Drive commitments worth about $70 million. All of these projects were already happening. They were in the budget. In Western Australia, as part of the Senate election campaign, the coalition are claiming as their own five projects. These are the Gateway WA project, the Leach Highway project upgrades, the Swan Valley Bypass, North West Coastal Highway and Great Northern highway. All of them were included in the 2013 budget, and the Gateway WA has been in the budget for two years already, with construction well underway. In Tasmania, they re-announced our entire nation-building package, including the same funding for the freight rail revitalisation, for the Brooker Highway and for the Huon Highway. There is only one difference, which is the Midland Highway, where they announced a $100 million cut. In New South Wales, they have announced the following projects as if they were new: the $40 million for the Port Botany upgrade and the $75 million for the Port Botany rail line to support access to the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal. I have mentioned already the F3 to M2 project. The other projects include more than $195 million for upgrades of the F3, renamed the M1, the Bolivia Hill project in the New England region, the Tourle Street Bridge in Newcastle and the Mount Ousley upgrades. All of these projects are fully in the budget, but announced as if they were new. Similarly, in South Australia, we had money allocated for South Road. They are saying that rather than do the Torrens to Torrens section, which is ready to go, they will spend less money on another section, without saying how it will all be paid for-taking money, though, off the Tonsley Park public transport project and taking money off the Managed Motorways Program. Right around the country, we see a government that is not committed to nation building. In Victoria, we have the widening of the Western Ring Road-the M80 project-which will be completed in the coming 12 months from the $788 million that was allocated for that project. It will be interesting to see whether the government pretends that they have done that in just the last couple of months. And of course there is the Regional Rail Link, to which the Commonwealth contributed $3.2 billion, with benefits for Geelong, Bendigo, Ballarat as well as for the Melbourne network. This is an absolutely critical project that at one stage had 3,500 people working on it. Compare that with the government's approach, which is to rip money out of the Melbourne Metro project, where $3 billion has been allocated, and to refuse to fund a project that was also in the budget-the Ballarat freight hub, at $9 million. Right around the country we are seeing a failure to invest. When the Majura Parkway here in the ACT and just across the border in New South Wales-a jointly funded project between the ACT government and the federal government-is completed, I am sure we will see the current government trying to claim credit for that as well. These are just some of the government's re-announcements-if I had unlimited time. I could keep going for a considerable period. The member for Gippsland is aware that there are many of these-including in his own area-but we will let that go. It does remind me of the French Revolution. After the abolition of the French monarchy in 1792, the National Convention insisted that the day after the revolution would be the first day of the new republic and the beginning of year 1. The new regime not only took control but did its best to pretend that all history to that point was irrelevant. The bill we are debating is a manifestation of the same approach. It is also evidence of the Prime Minister's seething disregard for anyone who is not a part of his political operation. It is also the case that they spent so much time in opposition being negative and saying what they were opposed to that they do not actually know what they are in favour of. It is said that imitation is a form of flattery. Well, if that is true, then the minister for infrastructure and his errand boy, the member for Mayo, have taken to flattering me to levels I am starting to find embarrassing. Levity aside, I can see their problem: having come to office without policies, they have to steal ours. At least good infrastructure projects are there as a result of what we put in the budget. We will seek to amend this bill to require the government to ensure that all infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million are the subject of costbenefit analysis, which the coalition promised during last year's election campaign. We will also seek to require the government to consult with Infrastructure Australia for all major infrastructure projects covered under this act and to ensure that the public can access Infrastructure Australia's assessments of government proposals-proper transparency; that is what you promised, and that is what should happen. We cannot stop the government rewriting history, but we can at least seek to hold it to its own policy promises. We will also seek approval for an amendment that would formalise the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Programme as a program under the act. This is vitalproviding rest stops for truck drivers and greater assistance in terms of safety. We could easily deal with extending the life of the Roads to Recovery program beyond 30 June and eliminating out-of-date provisions without changing the name of the act; the minister only wants a name change so he can bury memories of Labor and pretend that projects are somehow coalition initiatives. There is a concern with regard to the re-badging of these projects, and I remind the House that I will ensure that the government is held to account in not making expenditure for its own sake. I notice that the Prime Minister has bravely attempted to curb the Nationals' worse excesses by appointing the member for Mayo as his junior, as his errand boy, in this critical portfolio area. AndI say, 'Good luck!' because the minister for infrastructure is off to a very bad start indeed. We saw the Prime Minister endorse that approach with the extraordinary press conference with no new news that was held on Sunday. The fact is that the National Party has a history of just making political decisions when it comes to infrastructure. Infrastructure is too important for that; it is about the national economic interest. (Time expired) support of the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill. I have just sat through half an hour of the member for Grayndler patting himself on the back for the so-called work that he did, but I think the member for Grayndler was caught out in question time today. It is not good enough to have a line item in the budget to fund a so-called infrastructure project if the proceeds of the mining tax-which are supposed to fund that project-are not realised. I understand that the member for Grayndler was probably a bit embarrassed about that in today's question time, but I think half an hour of patting yourself on the back, Member for Grayndler, was probably a bit excessive. In contrast to the former government, we are committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century, and this bill will help us achieve that goal. The amendments contained in this bill are necessary to facilitate the government's ambitious land transport infrastructure agenda. Today's bill also cements our commitment to",164,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
303,Mr Sukkar (Deakin) (18:21,"It gives me great pleasure to rise today to speak in the Roads to Recovery program, a critical program that funds local governments to maintain the nation's local road infrastructure. The bill secures the Roads to Recovery program for another five years, with $1.75 billion in funding, and commits $300 million to the Black Spot Program. The government is committed to investing in productivity enhancing infrastructure that will help ensure our cities, including my city of Melbourne, and the regions, continue to develop and prosper. Infrastructure investment is critical to Australia's economic growth and productivity, and on this side of the House we understand that. It opens up opportunities for jobs, access to markets, and it improves the efficiency and safety of our transport and freight networks. In total, our government has committed $35 billion to fund key road, rail and intermodal projects, between 2013-14 and 2018-19. These projects include things such as $6.7 billion to upgrade the Bruce Highway, $5.6 billion to finish the duplication of the Pacific Highway, $1.5 billion to WestConnex in Sydney, $1 billion to the Gateway Motorway North upgrade in Brisbane, $405 million for the F3 to M2 link project in Sydney, and most importantly to me the $1.5 billion commitment to the East West Link in Melbourne. Being the member for Deakin, I of course want to focus on that project-the $1.5 billion that we have already committed to the East West Link, which will provide huge benefits to people living in my home state and, more importantly to me, the people of Deakin. The East West Link project involves an 18-kilometre link between the Eastern Freeway and the Western Ring Road, including an eight-kilometre section linking the Eastern Freeway to the Tullamarine Freeway, with a connection to the Port of Melbourne. The coalition's pre-election commitment of $1.5 billion to the East West Link will ensure that construction will be able to commence this year. Not on the never-never as we saw from the former government, and have seen from former state Labor governments-this project will happen. The East West Link is a vital and necessary component of Melbourne's road network, and will provide significant travel, economic, business and employment benefits for residents and businesses in my electorate of Deakin. I must give credit to the Victorian government, which has developed a business case that demonstrates the East West Link will deliver $1.40 in benefits for every dollar spent on the project-an outstanding return. Infrastructure Australia also supports the East West Link, and has identified it as a project that 'clearly addresses a nationally significant issue or problem'. The member for Grayndler talks of Infrastructure Australia incessantly, but he ignores a statement like that from the body he is constantly referencing. During the election campaign I was bombarded by countless Deakin residents who shared their frustrations with me that traffic congestion was an ever increasing problem in their lives. All of us accept traffic congestion, within limits, but in Deakin we are reaching our absolute limits, with the traffic congestion we are suffering on the Eastern Freeway. They told me time and again that the worsening situation on the Eastern Freeway means that they spend more time commuting to and from work and spend less time with their families. One of the reasons I am so proud of our $1.5 billion commitment is that for many mothers and fathers who work in the city, who are effectively forced to commute to work from the other side of the city via car, that extra time is the difference between giving your children a bath at the end of the day, or a kiss before they get to sleep, and getting home after they have already gone to bed. This is a real life issue. It is not just an ideological or other type of problem we are addressing. The rubber hits the road for everyday mums and dads in the most personal way-in the way they interact with their families. One of my other constituents-a bit of a character-put it pretty succinctly. She was driving past my campaign office, and her car still had the Jeff Kennett era slogan on her carwhich she had not re-registered-which said 'Victoria on the move'. I must say they were the good old days, when Victoria was on the move. But unfortunately she highlighted the fact that her car was not often on the move when she was on the Eastern Freeway. Rather, it was at a standstill. The irony was not lost on her, and it was not lost on me when she mentioned it. I listen to these people, and that is why I fought so hard to support the East West Link with our $1.5 billion commitment. Luckily, with our 'infrastructure Prime Minister', I did not have to fight very hard. His support of the East West Link has been outstanding, and when construction commences later this year all Victorians, particularly the residents of the Deakin electorate, will thank the PM and this government for their dedication and commitment to Victorians generally, and to Deakin residents more particularly. By contrast, we have to note the breathtaking hypocrisy of Labor in opposing the East West Link, because the East West Link was first highlighted as a crucial infrastructure project by the former state Labor government, in 2008, with their Eddington Transport Study. The Eddington Transport Study provided an explicit recommendation to build the East West Link. Indeed, it is worth noting what Sir Rod Eddington said in his introduction to the report with respect to the East West road link: The evidence is clear: doing nothing is not an option. Melbourne needs better east-west transport connections to address core congestion problems within the transport network, to meet rapidly increasing travel demand, to support a growing population and to keep pace with the changes taking place in the city's economic and urban structure. That is not a Liberal Party member's words. That is Sir Rod Eddington in his report commissioned by a state Labor government. Given that independent advice, I was, perhaps naively, very hopeful that the Labor Party would put Victorians ahead of their tawdry political interests by providing bipartisan support for our commitment of $1.5 billion to enable the East West Link to be built. I do not think that was too much to ask. Unfortunately, though, the Labor Party deserted the residents of the eastern suburbs and, in particular, the residents of Deakin. Instead, they sought to placate their inner-city green constituency by opposing this landmark piece of infrastructure. So there you have it-it was a choice between the residents of Deakin and all of those living in the eastern suburbs, or their inner-city constituency that they were very frightened of losing to the Greens. And who won? The Greens' constituency. In doing so, the Labor Party deprived the Deakin electorate. The approach was shamefully adopted by the former Labor member for Deakin, who sold out his electorate to please his party bosses. Well, the people of Deakin spoke, and I am now their representative and I am fighting every single day to make sure they get what they need. Even more shameful is that the Labor Party have now aligned themselves with the antidevelopment protesters who are now trying to slow the progress of the East West Link project through costly attempted vandalism and disruption. That highlights the difference again. We are standing with the residents of Deakin-the people who want to get home to see their children before they go to bed. The Labor Party is standing with the rabble who are blocking traffic on the Eastern Freeway to make a tawdry political point. They are protesters like Anthony Maine, who was recently reported as being charged with wilful damage and boasting publicly that his protests had cost police in excess of $2 million. On what basis would the Labor Party seek to align themselves with a rabble who are making life even more difficult? I have had residents from my electorate ring me asking, 'On what basis would the Labor Party want to align themselves with a group that makes me stuck on the Eastern Freeway for two hours instead of the obligatory one hour, because their protest activities are making life even that much harder?' SoI suppose the difference is very stark. I also laughed when I saw the Labor Party aligning themselves with this rabble of a protest group and that one of the protesters out there now protesting against the East West Link is a man who proudly claimed that he was also one of the protesters in the seventies protesting against the construction of the Eastern Freeway. SoI say to all of my Deakin residents: 'Imagine our electorate without the Eastern Freeway.' The same people who were protesting against that are protesting against the East West Link, and it seems very obvious to my constituents that those people do not have the interests of the Deakin electorate at heart. I doubt that anyone could imagine living in our electorate without the Eastern Freeway, and I think, in future, people will not be able to imagine living in my electorate without the East West Link. The East West Link project is not just a very worthy project based on Sir Rod Eddington's report, Infrastructure Australia and all independent analysis; it will also create 3,200 jobs during the construction phase and have a significant multiplier effect in business investment and indirect job creation throughout the eastern suburbs. As the Prime Minister recently explained on Melbourne radio, the Commonwealth commitment to this project will also make it easier for the state government to proceed with other projects for Victorians, such as Metro rail. I do not know on what basis you could have Labor members from Victoria arguing that we should not commit $1.5 billion to this project, which will free up money for all other infrastructure projects in Victoria. Our $1.5 billion investment is proof that we will stop the former Labor, government's bickering and we will make it happen. We have a state and federal government working hand in glove to deliver this project for my constituents. We have a range of other road infrastructure projects in my electorate that will also be assisted by the Roads to Recovery program-and there were two really important projects that I want to outline quickly now. The first is the upgraded intersection of Bedford Road and Great Ryrie Street in Ringwood. Both of these projects I have spoken about in detail with my electorate. Both have huge community support. Unlike the Labor Party, we will deliver them. We will not have line items in the budget that are not funded because they are tied to sources of revenue that are never realised. People of Deakin and Australians, more broadly, can have confidence that when we commit to a project it will be done. It is for these reasons that I am proud to be supporting the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill, which will help me deliver road projects in Deakin and throughout Australia. (Time expired) on the important issue of infrastructure, and transport infrastructure in particular. When it comes to land transport infrastructure, the government has not got off to a very good start. I do not blame the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. He is probably a pretty good bloke, but he has got one of the toughest jobs in government. His job is to try and",168,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
304,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (18:36,"I am very pleased to be in the debate tonightput some truth into the slogan that the Prime Minister is somehow going to be the 'infrastructure Prime Minister'. That is the toughest job in parliament because he does not have a lot to work with. One minute you have the government out there saying that everything that Labor have done in this space is a disaster, that in fact we have done nothing at all. The next minute you have members and the minister himself running around the country taking credit for Labor projects, reannouncing Labor projects and, best of all, cutting the ribbon on Labor projects. We know that cutting is in the Liberal Party DNA. Quite clearly, infrastructure is not in the Liberal Party DNA at all, because you have to go a long way back in history before you can find a conservative Prime Minister who has been serious about investing in infrastructure. That is in stark contrast to Labor prime ministers, because history is resplendent with Labor prime ministers who have been committed to nation building and to improving the productive capacity of this country by investing in infrastructure. I have in mind the contribution made by Andrew Fisher, an early Labor Prime Minister, who was responsible for pushing through his cabinet and then through a very difficult parliament the proposition to build the transnational rail link. It was Andrew Fisher and a Labor government that ensured work could commence on the project and that we have a rail link to Perth today. Move forward and have a look at one of our most famous icons, the Opera House in Sydney. We would not have had that Opera House, probably one of the most famous symbols in all of Australia and a critical piece of economic and cultural infrastructure, if it had not been pushed through the Labor caucus and the parliament by a former Labor Premier, Joe Cahill, who was also responsible for calling for the designs for a dedicated opera house in Sydney. I also have in mind a project that is oft debated in this House, and I know a new member of this place has a grandfather who had a very senior role in overseeing the building of this project, and that is the Snowy Mountains Hydro. Deputy Speaker Scott, you would know that if it had not been for the decision of the Chifley Labor government, the Snowy Mountains scheme would never have got off the ground. It was a key post-war nationbuilding infrastructure project conceived and made possible by a Labor caucus and a Labor Prime Minister. I will go into some detail on the contributions of the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments. The National Broadband Network stands out. It is a testament to the importance and the popularity of the National Broadband Network that the coalition do not have it within them to say that they want to dismantle the project. They say that we will still have a National Broadband Network, but they are trying to dismantle it by stealth. I see that the member for Gellibrand is in the chamber tonight. I know that in a former life he had a key role in conceiving of the National Broadband Network and doing the hard policy work to ensure that it got off the ground. That is the calibre of the people we have in our caucus and the ideas we have when it comes to Labor governments and Labor members of parliament. Let's contrast that with the performance of the Liberal Party in government. When Labor came into government in 2007 we were left with a massive infrastructure black hole-in the freight rail network, in our major interstate rail network, in our telecommunications infrastructure. I believe we had in the order of 19-was it 19? Mr Watts: Yes. of planning and lots of announcement, but not much in the way of improving the broadband in this country. Under the Howard government, infrastructure spending and infrastructure delivery was at all-time historic low. Tony Abbott was a senior minister in the government at that time, so we can only conclude that that is where he has got his lessons from because he has not had a very good start. What have we seen in the first six months? Prior to the election and immediately after it, we had the Prime Minister say that the Commonwealth should 'stick to its knitting' when it comes to investing in infrastructure. Well, it is all needles and no wool, because there is not a lot knitting going on at all. We have seen significant cuts to infrastructure spending. Important, nation-building, critical economic transport infrastructure has been cancelled or put on hold. I have in mind the Melbourne Metro. The member for Deakin got up and spoke at great length about the importance of the road projects; he had nothing to say about rail networks within the broader Melbourne metropolitan area. As any transport planner knows, unless you look at these things as a system-that is, the interaction of the road network and the public transport systemsyou are not to solve road congestion. All you are going to do is build new roads that will very quickly become parking lots because you have not dealt with the underlying systems issues. It is the same thing with Brisbane's Cross River Rail, Hobart's light rail, the Tonsley Park public transport project, the Perth public transport package, the Gawler rail line electrification, the Adelaide transport movement study and the Perth airport rail link. When the Prime Minister uses the word 'infrastructure' he obviously defines out of the concept of infrastructure anything to do with rail and urban public transport. As anybody who knows anything about transport infrastructure will tell you, if you try and deal with one mode of infrastructure in isolation from all the rest you are not going to solve transport issues. There is a bit of focus on Western Australia at the moment, and it is appropriate in this debate that we have something to say about the government's plans for Western Australia. Unlike the Liberals and the National Party, Labor supports a proper mix of infrastructure spending. The Australasian Railway Association report, The value of action versus the cost of inaction, found that investing in rail over roads will get the same result in terms of freeing up congestion, and would cost 57 per cent less in Brisbane and 38 per cent less in Perth. So there you have expert opinion saying that investment in rail is the most cost-effective transport solution to reduce road congestion in Australia's two fastest-growing cities, Brisbane and Perth. Is it any wonder that when the announcements were made about major road infrastructure projects in Melbourne and the WestConnex in Sydney that there was no cost-benefit analysis-a clear breach of pre-election promises? No cost-benefit analysis, and the reason there was no cost-benefit analysis is because they would not have liked the answer. The answer would have given them those sorts of cost differentials. Do not get me wrong; we support further investment by the Commonwealth into roads. In fact, in government Labor doubled the roads spending, but you need a mix of both. Infrastructure Australia has urged the government not to invest only in certain kinds of projects-a veiled warning to government not to ignore the importance of the rail sector. The expert advice from inside and outside government is clearly to avoid investing in roads to the exclusion of rail because we need a mix of both.",171,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
305,Mr Stephen Jones,"broadband plans over a period of 12 years. There had been lotsBut what do you think the government's plan for Western Australian commuters is? Mr Abbott's plan for Western Australia is for them to spend more time in their cars, because that is the consequence of his policy. His cuts to important urban public transport projects have the consequence of ensuring that people spend more time in their cars. He is on target to deliver that by cutting $500 million from public transport projects in Perth-so that is exactly what they will be doing. There are Liberal senators who are so embarrassed by their own record after almost six months in government that they have been photoshopping photos of the Prime Minister out of their how-to-vote cards. They are photoshopping-removing his photo from their how-to-vote cards because they know that he is a net negative for them when it comes to facing the voters in Western Australia. We saw something very similar in the Griffith by-election. Mr Chester: You did similar with Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd! am quite certain that when the voters go to the polls in Victoria later this year the very clear message from whoever the Premier of Victoria is this week that Tony Abbott will not be too welcome on the campaign trail. Let's have a contrast: let's compare the record of the Liberal Party in government with Labor's record. We have, as I said, doubled the roads budget to $46.5 billion, and a significant amount of this spending was in National Party seats. Far from the pork-barrelling that we saw in previous coalition governments, we put the money into where it was most needed. Labor upgraded over 7,500 kilometres of roads. We had a commitment to regional areas and supported working people by shortening commutes. We improved the safety of the roads around the nation and boosted productivity by reducing congestion. Labor boosted local government grants for infrastructure by over 20 per cent through strategic investments in local communities. There were over 17,000 projects funded in towns and villages around the country. The Liberals and the Nationals know that these projects have been necessary. They know that they are important and they know that they are critical to the economies of these regions, and that is why they are rushing around with a pair of scissors trying to cut the ribbons and claim credit for all these projects around the regions. The Minister for Infrastructure may as well be known as the 'minister for xerox' because in his second reading speech on this very legislation before the House he mentioned almost a dozen projects that were Labor initiatives: the $6.7 billion to upgrade the Bruce Highway, a Labor initiative; the $5.6 billion to finish the duplication of the Pacific Highway, a Labor initiative; the $1 billion to continue the Gateway Motorway North upgrade in Brisbane, a Labor initiative; the $6.8 million to finish the Gateway Western Australia project in Perth, a Labor initiative; the $615 million to build the Swan Valley Bypass on the Perth to Darwin highway, again a Labor initiative; $500 million to upgrade the South Road Superway in Adelaide; $405 million for the F3 to M2 link; $500 million dollars to continue the Midland Highway upgrade in Tasmania; $300 million to finalise planning for the Melbourne to Brisbane inland rail, a project that I know you are a big fan of Mr Deputy Speaker; and the $1.8 billion allocated to the WestConnex project in Sydney, subject to conditions-including a proper business case analysis. These were all Labor initiatives; all Labor projects. So on the one hand they are out there bagging Labor for inaction, or for overspending and overinvesting or for investing in the",173,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
306,Mr Stephen Jones,"I hear the member for Gippsland make some observations, and Iwrong projects, and on the other hand they are standing here in parliament at every opportunity that they can with the liquid paper out trying to scratch out our name across those projects and ensuring that they are taking credit for them themselves. There is little wonder, because this Prime Minister has no plan for infrastructure in this country. Amendment Bill 2014 is to amend the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 and to repeal the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988, the Roads to Recovery Act 2000 and the Railway Standardization (New South Wales and Victoria) Agreement Act 1958. For too long Australia has been without the infrastructure we need to meet the challenges and opportunities ahead. This government is committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century and this bill maps out the government's infrastructure priorities while repealing and amending Labor's legacy of failed policies. We are working together with our state and territory government colleagues to deliver nationally significant infrastructure projects to support our country's growth. We are also partnering with the private sector to maximise private capital investment in infrastructure. Through the Infrastructure Investment program the coalition government has committed $35.5 billion over six years to road and rail projects. Of particular importance to the people of the city of Brisbane is the $1 billion commitment to continue the Gateway Motorway North upgrade. The government has also committed $300 million to finalise plans, engineering design and environmental assessments for the Melbourne to Brisbane inland rail project. Amendments to the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 are necessary to facilitate the government's ambitious land transport infrastructure agenda. Importantly, this bill enables the continuation of the successful Roads to Recovery program, which provides vital funding to local governments for the maintenance of the nation's local road infrastructure beyond 30 June 2014. This change is needed as the act currently specifies that the Roads to Recovery funding period is ending on 30 June 2014. This bill will remove the specification of the funding period from the act and place it in the Roads to Recovery list. This removes the need to amend the act every time the Roads to Recovery funding period changes and ensures that this very important program will continue. The objective of Roads to Recovery is to contribute to the infrastructure investment program through supporting maintenance of the nation's local road infrastructure asset, which facilitates greater access for Australians and improves safety as well as economic and social outcomes. Indeed, what is the history of the Roads to Recovery program? Our local governments are responsible for planning, developing and maintaining a significant amount of the key infrastructure for their communities. This includes local roads, bridges and footpaths. In this context, of the nation's 810,000 kilometres of public roads, almost 650,000 kilometres, 80 per cent, are local roads. Approximately one-third of these roads are sealed, with the remainder unsealed. However, local government is not included in the legislative powers of the Commonwealth specified by section 51 of the Constitution. As a consequence, local government remains the responsibility of state governments. In this respect local government bodies are established under state legislation and are subject to state government oversight. Nevertheless, since 1974-75 successive Australian governments have provided general purpose funding for local",174,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
307,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (18:51,"The purpose of the Land Transport Infrastructuregovernment through specific purpose payments to the states and territories. In November 2000 then Prime Minister John Howard stated: One of the greatest strength of the Roads to Recovery Programme is that the funding will go direct to Local Government and allow councils to spend the money according to their priorities. The initial program commenced in early 2001 as a single intervention to address the problem that a significant amount of local government road infrastructure was about to reach the end of its economic life and its replacement was well beyond the capacity of local government. A total of $1.2 billion was paid to more than 730 local government authorities between March 2001 and June 2005. In this respect the program is unusual in that funds were provided directly to local government rather than through the states and territories. The Roads to Recovery program was of such importance to local government that the Australian Local Government Association, ALGA, along with its member associations conducted a campaign during 2002 and 2003 to have Roads to Recovery renewed beyond June 2005. According to ALGA, the key step was a review conducted jointly by ALGA and the Department of Transport and Regional Services to assess the first two years of the Roads to Recovery program. The review concluded that, notwithstanding the contribution Roads to Recovery funds had made, there remained deficiencies in both the existing road system and the need to upgrade, and in some cases extend, it. Given the review's clear endorsement of the program, ALGA has coordinated a national campaign to renew Roads to Recovery. This included assisting and encouraging local government associations to write to their local members as well as to relevant ministers. Apparently it worked and is still working, because from 2009-10 to 2013-14 the government will have provided $1.75 billion, including $373.5 million in 2013-14, under the Roads to Recovery program to be distributed directly to Australia's local councils, state and territory governments responsible for local roads in the unincorporated land and the Indian Ocean territories. More than $40 million has been allocated to the Brisbane City Council under the program, enabling the council to spend it on the priorities identified by their local communities. The Australian Local Government Association has said: The Australian Governments Roads to Recovery… program has become an essential element in local government's ability to maintain and upgrade the local roads network. It is an outstanding example of a partnership between the national and local governments and of providing direct funding to local communities. In recognition of the growing backlog in local road maintenance, the Howard federal government established the Roads to Recovery program. This much-needed funding has helped local government begin to address the backlog of local road maintenance, improving safety, transport efficiency and stimulating economic development across the country. The government is also committed to the continuation of the Black Spot Program, which provides funding to address road sites that are high-risk areas for serious crashes. My electorate of Ryan has benefited from funding in this area over previous years. This is in addition to the coalition's new $300 million Bridges Renewal Program to restore dilapidated local bridges. We are also allowing for funding of a new type of project within transport development and innovation projects for research to inform and enhance the management of the Infrastructure Investment program. As well, the coalition government is streamlining the operation of the act by combining national projects and off-network projects into a new part for investment projects. This removes unnecessary duplication from within the act-red-tape reduction. We must be able to deliver more appropriate, more efficient and more effective infrastructure to facilitate Australia's future growth and prosperity. The amendments in this bill will enable the coalition government to better deliver crucial infrastructure projects as part of our plan to deliver Australia's 21st century infrastructure agenda. Amendment Bill 2014. While there are many elements of the bill that warrant Labor's support, it is what the bill omits that is most concerning. The previous Labor government believed in investment in our nation's infrastructure. It believed that Australia as a nation will grow most efficiently when we plan for our future, when we ensure both our cities and our regions have the infrastructure in place that the nation needs. That is why Labor created Infrastructure Australia as an independent body that would recommend funding for projects based on need, not politics. Infrastructure Australia assess requests for funding of infrastructure projects from around Australia according to strict criteria. These projects that were independently assessed by Infrastructure Australia as being ready to proceed were the gold standard. These included the Pacific Highway upgrades in New South Wales, the national managed motorway program and stage 1 of the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Labor made investment in these infrastructure projects the highest priority for government. We announced the projects, allocated the funding and started the process of getting this crucial infrastructure built. Despite this, it seems that Minister Truss thinks that simply naming the Pacific Highway upgrades in his second reading speech for the bill under consideration makes them coalition initiatives. Minister Truss has made something of a habit of claiming credit for Labor projects in recent times. In fact, he has become a modern-day Colonel Francis de Groot of late, at the last minute charging in front of those who have done the hard work to cut the red ribbon and claim the projects in the name of the Abbott government. While the minister might not quite have the style of Francis de Groot-no horse and sword for the member for Wide Bay-he certainly matches him for chutzpah, because it was Labor who did the hard yards on these projects. Investment in these kinds of projects was part of a wider Labor government strategy of investment in roads and rail. Labor doubled the roads budget to $46 billion and upgraded 7,500 kilometres of road. It lifted local government road grants by 20 per cent, so that all Australian drivers could enjoy a safe and smooth journey. I am glad to see this bill continues to invest in Australia's roads. But the changes that the bill proposes are in sharp contrast with Labor's track record of investing in infrastructure across all modes of transport. Within this bill, we see the act renamed and references to the program as 'nation building' being taken away. We should not forget the importance of symbols like this. The very act of renaming something demonstrates a subtle shift in the program's aims, so it has to be wondered what the Abbott government is trying to achieve by changing the name of Labor's road program from the Nation Building Program. Perhaps the fact that Minister Truss is a member of the National Party, the green and gold of which was proudly displayed on the former Roads to Recovery signs in the Howard years, gives us a clue as to what we can expect in this regard. In light of this, the opposition has sought an assurance from Minister Truss that no additional Commonwealth expenditure will be incurred as a result of this name change. This bill ought not to be a rebranding exercise for",175,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
308,Mr Watts (Gellibrand) (19:00,"I rise to speak on the Land Transport Infrastructurethe National Party. After all, the government has been telling us for months that the Commonwealth has extremely limited resources. Surely it cannot justify spending taxpayers' money on driving out to roads across the nation merely to place National Party stickers over the Nation Building Program signs of the Labor Party. We shall soon see. The previous Labor government not only saw the benefits of investing in roads, but also believed in investing in rail. For in our wide brown land, both roads and rail are essential to ensuring that people and goods are moved around efficiently and effectively. Labor followed through on this principle by investing in rail infrastructure in record numbers. It invested $3.4 billion into Australia's freight rail network over six years of government, vastly improving the speed of our freight trains across the nation. And it invested more in urban rail infrastructure than every preceding parliament combined. It committed over $13.6 billion to urban public transport infrastructure projects throughout Australia. A prime example of this commitment was the Regional Rail Link project, which is currently being built in my electorate in Melbourne. With $3.2 billion contributed by the federal Labor government, it is the biggest Commonwealth investment in urban rail infrastructure in our history. In my electorate of Gellibrand, we have already seen the benefits of this investment in urban rail. In my electorate alone we have seen the redevelopment of the Footscray, Tottenham, Sunshine and West Footscray stations into dynamic hubs of public transport. We will soon see the benefits of regional trains being taken off metropolitan train tracks as new train tracks are laid every day. When this project is finished, there will be the capacity for an extra 23 metropolitan trains to run in morning and peak hours in Melbourne every day. An investment in rail infrastructure is a long-term investment in the future liveability of our cities: it is looking at our urban infrastructure network and understanding where it is beginning to reach its capacity; it is planning for that increase in demand by examining this hard data and determining the projects required for a world-class transportation system; and it is getting these projects independently assessed so that infrastructure for the nation's future can be progressively put in place. These are the criteria that Labor believes are necessary to consider when building our nation's infrastructure, and nowhere are these criteria more readily satisfied that in the Melbourne Metro rail project. The Melbourne Metro rail project is critical to addressing growth in Melbourne's metropolitan rail patronage. Current data suggest that rail patronage has grown by more than 70 per cent in the last 10 years alone. At this rate of growth, Melbourne's metropolitan rail network, that carries 415,000 Melburnians every day, will reach capacity in a few short years. The effect of this on Melbourne's existing infrastructure is unthinkable. According to experts in the rail industry, what is needed to counter this growth is an additional metro rail tunnel travelling from Melbourne's inner west to Melbourne's inner south through the Melbourne CBD. This tunnel would free up the crowded city loop, allowing more trains to run on all lines during peak hour. In addition, the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel would open five new underground stations located in North Melbourne, Parkville, CBD north, CBD south and the Domain. This will take more passengers off the heavily congested trams running down St Kilda Road and onto the more efficient railway system. Importantly, it will also take commuter traffic off our roads, improving the efficiency of our broader transport network. As the member for Throsby indicated earlier, it is impossible to evaluate infrastructure projects in Australia in a single mode. All infrastructure needs to be assessed jointly. The impact that this would have on liveability throughout Melbourne would be tremendous, but Labor still believed that an independent analysis was required before the project should receive the go-ahead. So these proposals were assessed by an independent bodyInfrastructure Australia. In 2012, Infrastructure Australia classified stage 1 of the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel as ready to proceed-the highest level of priority for infrastructure spending. In fact, the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel was assessed by Infrastructure Australia to be the highest priority project of any considered by it in the state of Victoria. With this independent assessment of the merits of the project, and the hard data suggesting that the project was sorely needed, Labor announced that it would invest $3 billion of federal funding into this vital project. However, with the election of the Abbott government, sensible policymaking took a backseat to the ideological obsessions of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister's objection to public transport is well known. In his book Battlelines-I admit I have read it-he described public transport as, 'generally slow, expensive, not especially reliable and a hideous drain on the public purse'. His primitive perception of what is part of daily life for millions of Australians has unfortunately not been altered in the transition from opposition to government. Despite the Prime Minister's duty to govern in the interests of all, he has refused point blank to invest in any form of urban rail infrastructure. This is the absence in the bill, as I mentioned earlier. It is the omission of any funding for urban rail infrastructure that condemns the Abbott government as one whose ideological blinkers prevent it from seeing the real needs of the Australian people. In this respect, the Prime Minister is little better than the Greens, whose ideological extremism prevents them from supporting investment in urban road infrastructure. If the Australian public wants a party that will take a mature, adult approach to investment in our infrastructure, the Labor Party is the only cab leaving the rank. The Liberal Party will not invest in rail, the Greens will not invest in road; the Labor Party are the only grown-ups in this conversation. The Prime Minister's position on rail and investment is even out of step with his state Liberal colleagues, with the Victorian Premier Denis Napthine voicing support for the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel before being spectacularly slapped down by his out-of-touch superior during the last federal election campaign. Not only has the Abbott government abandoned a project that was sensible and independently assessed, it has also ignored the principles of good policymaking when choosing its infrastructure alternative. I speak of the East West Link-we call it the 'East East Link' in my electorate in western Melbourne because the road does not reach anywhere near where I live-a road project that seems to have been accelerated for no reason other than the Prime Minister's belief, as stated in his book Battlelines, that a person is a 'king in his own car'. Like many of the Prime Minister's policy announcements, it came as something of a surprise to those in the infrastructure world. While proposals for a tunnel connecting Melbourne's east and west existed for some time, this iteration of the East West Link has not been independently assessed at all. In fact it is unclear if a detailed evaluation of the project has ever been done by the Napthine or Abbott governments, as no such evaluation has been published. The former head of Infrastructure Australia, Michael Deegan, recently confirmed these suspicions when he informed the Senate committee that 'no robust business case had been prepared'. Indeed, he also suggested that, on a standard analysis of the Victorian government's unpublished project assessment, the project would return just 80c to the public for every dollar spent. Moreover, the project was fast tracked, with very little community consultation, which may explain the multitude of protestors at the East West Link site every day, one of whom I read was run over by Victorian Premier Denis Napthine today. Despite this uncertain business case and the community backlash, the Prime Minister seems to think that this project is more important than funding the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel. Indeed, in a radio interview on ABC 774 with Jon Faine last Friday, he called it 'the single most important infrastructure project in Victoria'. He committed $1.5 billion to the project in the last federal election with no strings attached. He guaranteed this money despite no figures being known even of the cost of the first stage, let alone the second stage. No figures were known of the toll we would be expected to pay on this road. The total cost of the project was estimated to be anywhere between $6 billion and $8 billion. The Prime Minister has spent week after week in parliament blasting the previous Labor government for what he terms 'wasteful spending'. If committing to a project where the budget is already projected to swell by 25 per cent is not wasteful spending, then I do not know what is. The Prime Minister clearly has a questionable grasp of the amount of funding needed for this project. He also seems to have trouble understanding where funding for infrastructure projects should be sourced. In his recent radio interview with Jon Faine, he refused once again to commit any federal government funding for Melbourne Metro. He claimed that this was because the Melbourne Metro rail systems are owned and operated by the state governments, as opposed to toll roads, which are owned by private corporations. It is comforting to know that the Prime Minister trusts Premier Denis Napthine less with federal government funding than the private consortiums running our toll roads. Metro Trains Melbourne, the private operators of the Melbourne Metropolitan train network, may also be surprised to find out that they are now an arm of the state government. Under the Prime Minister's logic, then, the state government should not be investing at all in the East West Link as it is not owned and operated by the state government. Yet before the East West Link stage 1 went ahead, the Abbott government required the Napthine government to provide at least 50 per cent of the funding for the project. So not only does the Prime Minister believe in government funding for privately run roads but he requires a large proportion of the Jon Faine's program money to come from state government coffers. The Prime Minister claimed on Jon Faine's program last Friday that Commonwealth funding for the East West Link would actually help investment in urban rail infrastructure. Why? Because it would, 'free up the government to work on the rail projects'. Yet in the same breath, he advocated building the next stage of the East West Link. This would force the state government to commit funding for at least 50 per cent of the further total cost of this project, stealing further billions away from the state government funds. Despite the Prime Minister's superficial assertions to the contrary, all he can really understand is roads, roads, roads. I believe that we need a long-term vision for Australia's infrastructure needs. I believe in investing in both roads and rail and I support the funding for the Roads to Recovery program contained in this bill. But planning for Australia's infrastructure future encapsulates the key requirements of good policymaking: it requires hard data, independent assessment and thinking past the optics of an impending election. The Melbourne Metro rail tunnel was conceived and approved using this criteria. The Melbourne Metro rail tunnel is a key example of where our infrastructure funding should be spent. Instead it has been abandoned by the Abbott government because of a sentimental attachment to cars and a wilful blindness to the needs of the Australian community. If the Prime Minister wants to see the difference that investment in urban rail infrastructure makes, he should visit my electorate, as the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for infrastructure did in January of this year. He should visit the new stations, built under the Regional Rail Link project, and see the benefits that investment in rail infrastructure brings not only to those using trains but to the areas surrounding the stations-new houses, businesses, investment and people. In fact, it was hard to hear the shadow minister for infrastructure when he visited the West Footscray station due to the construction surrounding the general area, construction inspired by the Regional Rail Link project. I find it hard to believe that the East West Link will have the same benefits in revitalising communities in Melbourne. I also find it hard to believe that the East West Link will have the same impact on liveability in Melbourne's west as an investment in the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel would. This lack of vision is another key example of the Abbott government's failure to transition from opposition to government. It is another policy that sounds good in an election rally from opposition but fails to translate smoothly into the real life and real world of government. The Prime Minister needs to stop acting like an opposition leader, look at the real needs of the communities around Australia and make a grown-up decision. He needs to justify his infrastructure policy using independent assessment and advice. He needs to stop funding the white elephant that is the East West Link and transfer this money into a sensible long-term vision for Australia's future-the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel. (19:15): The previous speaker, the member for Gellibrand, should have a bit more respect for the Deputy Prime Minister. The member's predecessor, Nicola Roxon, had a deep interest in the Riverina. I have acknowledged, in this place and publicly, the role that she played in helping to fund the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital. One of my proudest moments in the parliament was when I convinced her to help fund the Ungarie flood victims who, under the state criteria, did not qualify for New South Wales flood assistance. She was good enough to provide that funding. When the floods came to the Riverina in February 2012, she was good enough to visit. One of my favourite photographs was when she jumped into my parliamentary car with 'The National Party' displayed proudly on the door. She was only too happy to have her photograph taken with the National Party branding. I think she had a bit of a soft spot for the Riverina and I know that she had a soft spot for the National Party. Mr Ripoll: She was never threatened in Gellibrand, absolutely correct. She did a lot of good for the Riverina in the last parliament and that was important because the Riverina is a great producer of goods and services which this nation needs and which this nation exports. Former Minister Roxon recognised that. When the Riverina needed help after the floods-particularly with the road networks, which were",177,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As

310,Mr Mccormack,"She was never threatened by the National Party in Gellibrand, that isdamaged-both the state coalition government and the federal Labor government came to the assistance of the Riverina, which was very much appreciated at the time. The coalition government will build the roads for the 21st century, we will be the infrastructure government and Tony Abbott will be the infrastructure Prime Minister. We are getting on with the job of helping to build the nation and helping to continue to make things to make our nation great. The Prime Minister has said many times that our best years are ahead of us, and I am sure that the member for Gellibrand would agree with that statement, but we do need good road infrastructure and good rail infrastructure, as the member for Gellibrand acknowledged in his speech. We need those good arterial networks in both road and rail to ensure that we are able to get the job done. That was the plan we took to the last election, and building the roads of the 21st century is something we are serious about now that we are in government. We keep our promises; indeed, we do. The coalition government is working with the states, not against them, to deliver critical infrastructure upgrades right across Australia. We want to deliver nationally significant infrastructure projects to grow Australian productivity and improve living standards. I heard the member for Gellibrand and the member for Throsby in their respective speeches talking about National Party pork barrelling. I have to say the regions often miss out when it comes to funding-and those regions are not just represented by National Party members, although it is shame that they are not all represented by National Party members. The regions often miss out on vital funding despite the fact that they produce the wealth-the mining wealth and the agricultural wealth-that makes this country great. For example, the member for Gellibrand talked about public transport. We could only hope for a better public transport network in Wagga Wagga and other regions. We have got a half-decent public transport system, but we certainly do not have the level of public transport that they have in the metropolitan areas. In order for the government to deliver the roads of the 21st century through greater collaboration and good relationships with state and territory governments and the private sector, amendments to the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 are unnecessary. This bill will amend the name of the act to the National Transport Act 2014. This is not a great scheme to put National Party stickers all over signage across the nation. Under Labor, projects were not even allowed to be opened, or in some cases the first sod was not able to be turned, until a great sign labelled the project. This certainly was the case with the school halls program. It was ridiculous. I do not know the total amount expended on these signs, but it was just a way of taking credit-that money could have been far better spent on delivering a better school halls program. Importantly, this bill will enable the continuation of the Howard government's Roads to Recovery program, a program that was fostered and helped along by the National Party. It was introduced by the former Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Nationals, John Anderson-a great man. It was a program synonymous with critical infrastructure upgrades throughout this wide brown land. For country people, Roads to Recovery was a program that demonstrated that the government-of course it was a coalition government-understood the state of the roads in the bush, understood how critical those transport arteries were to the nation's economy and prioritised, not pork barrelled, the necessary upgrades to road infrastructure. The fact that they just happened to be in coalition seats was because we represented more rural electorates than your side of politics did. It was not pork barrelling, it was just giving the regions their due. This bill will allow for the continuation of that program. Highway for a long time and that will continue as it is a road that needs funding. I am sure that, as the current member for Dawson is a very good member, he will continue to fight hard for that project. In my Riverina electorate, Roads to Recovery delivered much funding to many vital infrastructure projects. In fact between the 2000-01 and 2006-07 financial years, Roads to Recovery project funding in the Riverina was $51.5 million. This included funding for every local government area in my electorate, and I can name them all-not that all of these local government areas were in the Riverina electorate during those years, but they are now. It might suit the House if I read these out to demonstrate the enormous amount of spending that we delivered. I will just round off the figures: Bland Shire Council, $7.2 million; Carrathool Shire, $5 million; Coolamon Shire, $3.8 million; Griffith City Council, $4.8 million; Gundagai Shire, $2.4 million; Junee Shire, $2.9 million; Leeton Shire, $2.8 million; Murrumbidgee Shire, $1.7 million; Narrandera Shire Council, $4.4 million; Temora Shire, $3.2 million; Tumbarumba Shire, $1.5 million-I just add that Tumbarumba Shire recently won the AR Bluett award for being the most financially sound council in New South WalesTumut Shire, $2.2 million; and Wagga Wagga City Council, $9.1 million. Wagga Wagga City Council got the lion's share because it has the biggest city, with a population of 63,000, and has a lot of roads. It actually neighbours Tumbarumba Shire and many others. It also has an intermodal rail freight hub project, which is underway at the moment. I must say that the Labor government did fund that to the tune of $14.5 million. It is a project which will, hopefully, be using a lot of the products which come from Visy paper mill. The Visy pulp and paper mill at Tumut relies heavily on the Gocup Road, a very windy, 30.1-kilometre stretch of road between Tumut and South Gundagai. A report prepared by the Tumut Shire Council in December 2006 indicated that the Gocup Road 'currently carries an estimated 234 heavy vehicles and 1,229 light vehicles over its entire length each weekday'. The report said: 'It is an important transport link for the timber companies in and around Tumut,' which, I have to say, underpin the entire Tumut and Tumbarumba economies, 'as it provides the main road link to the Hume Highway for northbound traffic'. Bearing in mind that we are talking 2006 here, the report continues, 'Timber production is expected to increase the heavy vehicle haulage on Gocup Road over the next few years.' Indeed it has. 'For Visy Pulp and Paper Pty Limited,' owned by the Pratt family, 'this will result from the implementation of stage 2 of their plant development'-that has happened-'and a major increase in timber hauled from their plantations in the Macquarie timber region near Bathurst/Oberon. To more effectively manage their back-loading Visy will be hauling 60 per cent of their export products to the port of Sydney rather than to Melbourne.' Gocup Road is a road which needs funding. I hosted the Tumut Shire Council Mayor, Trina Thomson, and the General Manager, Bob Stewart, at important talks with the Deputy Prime Minister on 4 March, at which we discussed Gocup Road and its need for funding. It is a very important transport link, linking both the ports of Sydney and Melbourne. It also has",181,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As

312,Mr Mccormack,"The current member for Dawson has been on about the Bruceimportance to the potential benefits of the RIFL project at Bomen, just north of Wagga Wagga. Very tragically, there was a fatal accident on Gocup Road just last Saturday, the circumstances of which will be determined by the coroner. It is a very winding road. It does need to be improved, and the safety upgrades do need funding-a serious amount of funding. In 2007 when Kay Hull, my predecessor, ran for re-election, the coalition put $11 million on the table for Gocup Road funding. In 2010 that offer was again put up by the coalition. Unfortunately we did not win the election in either of those years. At the last election such a sum was not put up, because we were not sure about the state of the economy and the state of the financial books that we would inherit if indeed we were to win the election, which thankfully we did. On coming to government we found that the books were in a parlous state. But this Roads to Recovery rebirth will provide much-needed money for infrastructure projects, hopefully including Gocup Road and other important projects throughout the Riverina. It is necessary. Through the Infrastructure Investment program, the coalition has committed $35.5 billion over six years to road and rail projects, including $6.7 billion for the Bruce Highway, which the member for Dawson has been fighting for; $5.6 billion to finish the duplication of the Pacific Highway-that very dangerous stretch of road linking New South Wales and Queensland-which is so important; $1.5 billion for the WestConnex project in Sydney; and $1.5 billion for the East West link in Melbourne. Mr Tudge: They are great projects. all vital projects, as are the many road funding initiatives that need to happen in rural areas such as the Riverina, and even in your electorate of Maranoa, Deputy Speaker Scott. I know the coalition is getting on with the job of the $300 million Bridges Renewal Program, another important initiative. If bridges are not repaired, harvesters and farmers have to travel many kilometres to get their heavy stripping equipment across rivers and across creeks, and that stalls production and costs money. The Bridges Renewal Program is going to be so important to the regional areas that we serve, Mr Deputy Speaker, and that is to be commended. The bill also includes a new requirement for states and territories to notify the minister as soon as possible after the sale or disposal of land that was acquired using Australian government funding, and that is important too. There are many important initiatives in this bill. It will ensure a timely response to land sales or disposals from both the states and territories. So, as we can see, the coalition is getting on with the job of cooperating with the states. In six years of Labor government, that did not often happen with a lot of the states. We saw that with education and with so many other things. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan has only just been put into practice, with New South Wales finally coming on board. There was such a disconnect between the Commonwealth and the states. We are getting on with the job of building the infrastructure we need. This bill goes to that, and that is why I so earnestly support it.",183,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
313,Mr Mccormack,"They are great projects, I hear the member for Aston say. They arethe question: That the House do now adjourn. Paid Parental Leave Ms BUTLER (Griffith) (19:29): Paid parental leave is an important benefit, both private and public. It shows that it is normal and desirable to take time away from the workforce when you have kids. It helps families bond. It helps people afford to take the time away from work. It helps society if it is administered so as to let people better participate in our workforce and if it leads to stronger families But, as Professor Pocock has said: … work and family policy is about much more than PPL. The body of existing research about good work and family regimes around the world supports a balanced policy approach: one that walks on more than one leg-responding to the intensive demands of early childhood that reach beyond the moment of birth-to ensure quality care for children and flexibility in workplaces. In Australia there is much to be done to make workplaces flexible enough to enable people with kids to fully participate for their own benefit and for the nation's. There is also much to be done to make quality child care that meets parents' and children's needs accessible and affordable. When there is so much to be done, the Prime Minister's expensive and inequitable Paid Parental Leave scheme seems unfair and indulgent. It is inequitable because people who are more well off will receive greater government support-up to $75,000, because it fully replaces wages of up to $150,000 per annum for six months-than people who are less well off. The scheme is expected to cost $5.5 billion and Mr Abbott intends for it to be funded by a 1.5 per cent levy on big business, but it is far from clear that that levy will be enough. It has been said that the Commission of Audit report, which Mr Abbott has already received but we have not seen, 'supports the concept but feels the price tag is too high given the pressure on the budget.' The 2009 Productivity Commission report into paid parental leave expressly disapproved of a scheme like Mr Abbott's, instead recommending the option that Labor implementedparental leave at the minimum wage. The report said: Payment at a flat rate would mean that the labour supply effects would be greatest for lower income, less skilled women-precisely those who are most responsive to wage subsidies and who are least likely to have privately negotiated paid parental leave. Full replacement wages for highly educated, well paid women would be very costly for taxpayers and, given their high level of attachment to the labour force and a high level of private provision of paid parental leave, would have few incremental labour supply benefits. The report also noted that high earners 'usually have better access to resources to self-finance leave,' and said: Our approachthe commission's approach… takes into account the balance between the needs of parents and the burdens on taxpayersespecially those who would not receive any direct benefits, such as those without children.",184,Emdgs Austrade Similarly Provides A Range Of Vital Services To Would Be Exporters Such As
314,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bc Scott) (19:29,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I proposeThe report cautioned against an overgenerous policy. It indicated that if there were a need to top-up the scheme, a future government could consider higher education style loans where repayment depends on income. The report said:  Income contingent loans used to supplement a base taxpayer-funded scheme would give families the choice of extending the time spent with young children beyond that needed to meet the primary objectives of the Commission's proposed scheme. Should the Government consider increasing the generosity of the scheme in the future, income contingent loans could provide an appropriate low cost option for doing so. That option would recognise that paid parental leave has both public and private benefits, but the government has not heeded the Productivity Commission's report. Instead, it is going ahead and doing exactly what the Productivity Commission said not do to. It is already seeking to extend the scheme. It is not going to use the commission's suggested option of loans; it is going to pay replacement wages. Public policy experts, economists and business people have criticised the government's scheme and it goes against the Productivity Commission's recommendations. Coalition MPs have been openly, as well as less openly, breaking ranks on the government's expensive Paid Parental Leave scheme. In the face of all of this criticism, one would think that the Prime Minister would reconsider the scheme. If it is possible to raise sufficient moneys for a $5.5 billion scheme, then why not use those moneys on other legs of work and family policy like making paid work more compatible with family demands; introducing genuine flexibility that meets parents' and children's needs and helps integrate family demands into working life; or making quality child care that meets parents' and children's needs more available, affordable and accessible? Why not those policies instead of this expensive, unfair and inequitable Paid Parental Leave scheme? Education Christopher Pyne, Minister for Education, for taking the time to visit Albany last week. I was proud to show him one of our flagship independent public schools and host an education forum for local education professionals to discuss regional and rural education issues. My electorate of O'Connor has 22 independent public schools. Mount Lockyer Primary School became an IPS in 2011 and is a glowing example of the success of this initiative. Since commencing her tenure in 2006, principal Maxine Augustson has worked hard to coordinate not only the educational needs of her students but also their social and cultural needs in the broader context of their community. Adopting the IPS system has been the perfect vehicle to achieve this vision for the school. Mount Lockyer Primary School is situated in a lower socioeconomic area of Albany, with only four per cent of students falling into the top quarter of the Australian Index of Community Socio-Economic Advantage. The student body at Mount Lockyer numbers 545 and ranges from pre-primary to grade 7. Fifteen per cent of these students are of Aboriginal descent and three per cent are of Filipino origin. There is a significant refugee componentmost recently displaced Karen children from Thai refugee camps-and five per cent of their students are not primary English speakers. A small proportion of their students are from outlying rural areas. A 'one size fits all' approach was never going to work for a diverse student body which is a subset of such a varied community.",185,Adjournment
315,Mr Wilson (O'connor) (19:35,"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Hon.IPS has allowed the school the autonomy to identify and work towards solutions for the students' needs. These include social and emotional needs, poor parental engagement in their children's education, absenteeism and truancy, school readiness, health and nutrition status, behaviour problems and poor literacy and English skills. Prior to the school becoming an IPS, Mrs Augustson was already finding ways to engage the Lockyer community in their children's education. The inception of an elders circle, where a group of selected Aboriginal elders became the connection between problem students and disengaged parents, opened up the lines of communication between the community and educators. Community members also became involved in the sharing of Indigenous culture within the school environment, and families entered into a community partnership with the school. With these innovations, Indigenous school attendance rates jumped from 42 per cent to 86 per cent. The Mount Lockyer area has a below-average result on the Australian Early Development Index. Mount Lockyer Primary School, therefore, also strategically targets education at the playgroup years, from birth through to three. It also offers parental support, information and empowerment through its Communities for Children hub. The overall goal is to engage parents in their children's early education and to achieve school-ready children at the kindergarten intake. Health and nutrition outcomes are supported through the breakfast clubs, which are heartily attended, and a school pantry from which children can prepare lunches if they have not been provided with lunch from home. The autonomy of the IPS system has allowed the principal, with the support of the school board, to employ appropriate staff to address specific learning and social issues. The school has a dedicated behaviour intervention centre, staffed by appropriately skilled individuals, to cater for students with emotional and social development needs. Poor English and literacy parameters have been recently targeted and have significantly improved since employing teachers with strengths and experience in this field. Since becoming an IPS, the My School data reflects a marked improvement in the Lockyer student outcomes. In 2008, Mount Lockyer performed below 'like' schools in almost every average for similar schools in every category and every group. The main criteria for staff selection at Mount Lockyer are based on the school ethos and goals. They note that the applications for teaching positions have trebled in the three years since the school became an IPS, and staff turnover has very much reduced. With this stability of staffing comes continuity for the students and a sustained focus on student outcomes and school goals. Like all independent public schools, the principal, in consultation with a board comprising parents and community members, operates autonomously to set their own strategic priorities for the social and educational outcomes for their students. The Mount Lockyer board comprises representatives of the school teaching body, the P&C, parents and the wider community-including the Aboriginal community. Together, they adhere to a strategic plan formed by the school for itself and meet regularly to audit whether these goals are being met. Parental feedback is also a critical measure of the success of the school, as well as a tool for greater parental engagement. While still having significant obstacles in the social issues of their community, Mount Lockyer feels it is achieving greater parental involvement. The Mount Lockyer Primary School motto is, 'Care, Compassion and Excellence. A place to learn and grow.' I am proud to have such a passionate team working towards favourable education outcomes in my electorate. I truly believe that, despite their challenges, the innovation and determination of the school principal, board and staff, in conjunction with an engaged community, will allow the students to develop into well-educated and valued members of society. (Time expired) New South Wales Government Sydney Electorate: Public Housing Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (19:40): I rise tonight on a very serious issue. Today, the O'Farrell government dropped a bomb on the inner city of Sydney. They announced with no consultation and no warning that they will sell almost 300 properties in Millers Point in Sydney; 300 homes that have been public housing, some for generations. There are families that have lived in Millers Point for one or two or three generations. People often ask what is the difference between a house and home. The difference between a house and a home is the family, the people who live there. You could just as easily ask the same question about a suburb. What is the difference between a suburb and a community? The difference between a suburb and a community is the people who live there, who have put their roots down there, who have sent their children to school there, who know each other and their neighbours and who help each other. That is what Millers Point is. It is a community with a long history and it is a community that has supported and cared for each other throughout that long history. We are talking about an area that has a history as long as the European settlement of Sydney. For that time, there have been working class people living there-stevedores, people who worked on the docks, people who worked on the Hungry Mile, people who saw the depression, people who saw the plague and people who have seen Sydney change and grow through the generations. Those people are part of the heart and soul of our city. We have seen cities around the world where working class people cannot afford to live in the centre of the city. Sydney will become such a city if the O'Farrell government proceeds with this decision. This is a devastating decision and a deep shock to the tenants, who have lived there all their lives and, in some cases, are the second or third generation of people to have done so. With no consultation, they have been told today that they will have to move from homes that have been theirs all their lives. I condemn the O'Farrell government for making this decision, but I have to say that I also hold the Abbott government responsible for this. This is a government that refusesA government member interjectingMs PLIBERSEK: The guy who is sitting at the table, I do not know his name, says, 'Oh yeah, I'm sure it's our fault!' Your government will not sign the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, which expires on 30 June. What do you think that that uncertainty does to homelessness services? What do you think it does to their clients? This is a federal government that will not support, and will not announce whether it will support, another round of funding for the National Affordable Housing Agreement. How can states plan, build and fund their public housing, when they cannot hear from the federal government what sort of funds will be available for them in the future? We have seen, over this last week, the softening-up exercise start, with criticisms about social housing and criticisms about the National Rental Affordability Scheme-which are two excellent programs. The National Rental Affordability Scheme has already built 14,000 homes in Australia, and another 24,000 are in the pipeline. It is a program, incidentally, that the states contribute a quarter of the funding to, with states selecting the projects that go ahead, in cooperation with the Commonwealth government. We have seen the softening up now when it comes to social housing. The previous federal Liberal government did nothing for social housing, and now we have a state Liberal government, who, when in opposition, opposed the stimulus package. They had Liberals out there campaigning against new social housing being built in their electorates. True to form, we have the O'Farrell government now selling 300 family homes from a community in the centre of Sydney and we have the Abbott government, who will not lift a finger to stop it or to fund affordable housing in the future. We have seen the softeningup exercise. The National Rental Affordability Scheme is going to go, the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness will not be re-signed, and the National Affordable Housing Agreement is going to go too, because this is a federal government that has no respect for public housing tenants. And it is working with a state government that has no respect for public housing tenants and no respect for the families and the communities that they have built in Millers Point in inner-city Sydney. I am devastated and disgusted to see this action from the O'Farrell government today. I think it is a betrayal of the people of inner-city Sydney. They may as well have dropped a bomb on the centre of Sydney for the damage they will do to the community that has been there for generations. Human Rights of Women and Children Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is set to begin an inquiry into the human rights of women and children. As the chair of the subcommittee I am very keen to advance this important inquiry, not only because I have two daughters aged 11 and 15 but because of so many of the reports we hear of the conditions women and girls have to endure in the world. The inquiry will include an examination of the barriers and impediments to enhancing the human rights of women and girls in the Indian Ocean and Asia-Pacific region, especially regarding the impact of family and sexual violence, women's leadership and economic opportunities. As we know, violence and sexual abuse against women and children are some of the most universal human rights violations in the world. Tragically, these include sexual harassment, domestic violence, rape, and harmful practices such as early and forced marriages and female genital mutilation. More often than not, human rights violations involve the stronger abusing the weaker. Amongst the very worse examples of such abuses are the issues of female genital mutilation and underage marriage, and it is these two issues that I wish to highlight particularly. According to the World Health Organization, more than 125 million women and girls have been subjected to the practice of female genital mutilation. This is not an isolated practice; it is an international horror story that must be condemned and stopped. I condemn it as a primitive and ignorant practice that is rooted in gender inequality-ideas about purity,",186,Adjournment
316,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (19:45,"The Human Rights Sub-committee of the Jointmodesty and aesthetics and attempts to control women's sexuality. The trauma and long-term health effects cannot be underestimated. Female genital mutilation is a disgrace that has been outlawed in most of the countries in which it occurs. But the laws are poorly enforced, so it is anticipated that 30 million women and girls will be at risk of the procedure in the next decade. It is uncivilised and unworthy of the modern era. I acknowledge that even in Australia there are some that subscribe to this indecent assault on children, this barbaric practice. I condemn it, regardless of any religious or cultural justifications. All who impose it upon girls should be prosecuted, and their children should be given to someone who will properly look after them. The other point I wish to raise is that of underage marriage. Again, this is a human rights issue, and I condemn it. Underage marriage is paedophilia. Any religion or culture that condones it, promotes it or accepts it in any way is condoning, promoting or accepting paedophilia. It is evil and has no place in this country or anywhere. As I said, I look forward to our inquiry. We will cover many important issues, and there will be a variety of opinions on many of those issues. However, we need to recognise that issues such as female genital mutilation and underage marriage are human rights issues of fundamental importance. They are ugly topics, but we must not shy away from them because of mistaken notions of cultural sensitivity and relativism. On the good side, I also look forward to finding encouragement in the work of the Australian government in empowering women and girls in the Indian Ocean and Asia-Pacific region. More than $2 billion of our foreign aid budget is spent on initiatives that have women and girls as a principal or significant focus. These programs include innovative initiatives such as the multi-donor Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme, which is helping to address a major barrier to women's economic empowerment by providing women in the Pacific with access to mobile money-a quick, low-cost way to transfer and receive funds. In Vietnam, we will invest more than $2 million in a new agricultural research partnership project. This will support more than 2,000 women from ethnic and minority groups as well as poor smallholder farmers, enabling them to increase vegetable production by around $3.4 million annually. In Papua New Guinea we are investing $3 million in a new family and sexual violence case management centre at Lae. In Timor-Leste, Australia is funding the International Women's Development Agency to support women to develop micro-businesses and savings clubs. We will also examine the implications for economic and social development of promoting women's and girls' human rights. This is an important inquiry. It is important that we examine and learn of what is happening in the Indian Ocean and the Asia-Pacific regions. We need to know the good and the bad, the success and the failures. The vulnerable need protection, and this inquiry will give Australia, the government and the parliament a vital insight into the lives and circumstances of women and girls in the regions. I thank the foreign affairs minister, the Hon. Julie Bishop, for referring this worthy inquiry to the subcommittee. Blair Electorate: St Edmund's College Blair, which covers Ipswich and the Somerset region. But tonight I would like to tell you about just one of them: St Edmund's Christian Brothers' College, which has a student body of about 950 young men. The secondary school is located in the inner-Ipswich suburb of Woodend. Last Saturday night I attended-as I usually do-the St Edmund's College",189,Naplan Category For Assessment In Years 3 5 And 7 Last Year They Ranked Above The
317,Mr Neumann (Blair) (19:49,"There are some wonderful schools in my electorate ofFoundation annual dinner. Firstly, I will give a bit of background about St Eddie's. It is located on a hill in Ipswich, where for generations young Aboriginal men experienced initiation ceremonies. Today young men-both Indigenous and non-Indigenous-are initiated into the culture of St Eddie's and become what is known as 'Eddie's men'-kind men, gentle men and compassionate men. The Brothers arrived in Ipswich in February 1892 and taught mainly the Irish Catholic community-young men and young women-across the heart of Ipswich. The original building was St Mary's Christian Brothers' College. From that time until 1961 there was a demand for a secondary education facility for the young men of Ipswich. Building commenced near St Mary's Christian Brothers' College soon thereafter. The first completed building was blessed by Reverend James Duhig, who was responsible for many, many of the churches in Brisbane and Ipswich and the surrounds, and who was then Archbishop of Brisbane. The first foundation stone was laid by the then Mayor of Ipswich, Alderman JT Finimore, and was renamed St Edmund's Christian Brothers' College on 21 February 1965. St Eddie's has the most wonderful Indigenous mural inside its hall, which is where the dinner was held. Last year the mural was unveiled by Uncle Joe Kirk, its designer and interpreter. Joe works as a mentor with students from St Edmund's College, St Mary's College, and St Peter Claver College in Ipswich, using a literacy and numeracy approach he designed to educate young people in traditional language, culture, music and spirituality. I am pleased to say the former federal Labor government's commitment to education with 'St Eddies' was clearly demonstrated by the Ipswich Region Trade Training Centre, a $3 million commitment that Ipswich Grammar School and Ipswich Girls' Grammar School participated in. That trade training centre boasts an automotive garage, a world class facility that is used to train mechanics, carpenters, and brick layers of the future, in the Ipswich and the West Moreton region. St Edmund's College recently appointed former old boy Chris Leadbetter as its principal, upon the retirement of Brendan Lawler, who had been principal for nine years. Chris has big shoes to fill, but it is already evident that he is more than up to the job. I congratulate and commend Brendan for the commitment he made to the spirituality and education of young men in Ipswich. St Edmund's College is very much a part of the Ipswich community, and that is obvious from the fact that 320 people attended the event. St Edmund's College has produced many fine men who have made contributions to our community, our culture and our country, including Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisasale and former Wallaby great Paul McLean MBE, who were both present on the evening. The Foundation Dinner is ably run by the St Edmund's College Foundation, and it raises tens of thousands of dollars every year. St Edmund's College has a long commitment to social justice, equality of opportunity, and help for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth, and particularly disadvantaged students in the region. But its commitment is also demonstrated by its program Footprints in the Park, where teachers, students and parents help provide nourishment to homeless and disadvantaged people in the Ipswich community. Those fortnightly meals take place at Queens Park in Ipswich central. The dinner is sponsored by Brothers Leagues Club, and I want to make particular mention of general manager Mark Henley, who is a 'St Eddies' old boy who has made a significant contribution to Ipswich and the greater community. Well known speakers are usually there, such as Kerry O'Brien and Sam Kekovich, and this year ABC commentator Kerry O'Keeffe, whose exploits in the field and his comedy in the media have kept us entertained for a long time. He has a very instinctive, distinctive and infectious laugh. I commend St Edmund's Christian Brothers College, and the foundation, for their commitment to the Ipswich community, and for their annual foundation dinner. Chris Leadbetter's joke that night as to why he did not pursue a career as a test cricketer was extraordinary to hear. Everyone had a great night of fun, fellowship and laughter, and I am looking forward to next year's event. Congratulations 'St Eddies'. You are a great school and you have made a great contribution to the people of Ipswich. Parer, Hon. Warwick Raymond, AM and passed away on 14 March 2014. He was an Australian politician, a Liberal member of the Australian Senate representing the state of Queensland. He is the nephew of Australian war photographer Damien Parer. Warwick was born in Papua New Guinea. He attended St Joseph's Nudgee College in Brisbane, and he was educated at the University of Melbourne, where he received a Bachelor of Commerce. Warwick became a member of the Senate in 1985, and from March 1996 to October 1998 he was minister for resources and energy in John Howard's government. He retired from the Senate on 11 February 2000, and his vacant seat was taken by Senator the Hon. George Brandis. He was Chair of the Coalition of Australian Governments Independent Energy Review Panel and was a Member of the Governing Council of the Old Parliament House in Queensland. He was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 2005. Warwick Parer served as President of the Queensland Liberal Party from 2006 until February 2008. In May 2012 Warwick was appointed Chairman of the Board of Stanwell Corporation Limited. He was also a former chair of the Energy and Transport Advisory Sector of the CSIRO. He had also been the Chair of the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital Foundation since 2010. After departing politics he remained active in the Liberal Party, serving as Queensland State President from 2005 to 2008. He worked with the National Party President, the Hon. Bruce Scott-and I acknowledge him in the chair tonight-to prepare for the eventual amalgamation of the two parties into the LNP. Warwick Parer was a Bonner constituent, and he was also a friend. I first met Warwick in the early 1990s. His son Justin and I were in the Young Liberals, and I was invited over to the Parer household to meet with Karen Rasey-who was the Young Liberal President. Little did I know that it was part of a predetermined plan to have me sign up to the Young Liberal executive, and Karen was not going to allow me to leave the Parer residence unless I signed the nomination form then and there. There was the start of the influence Warwick Parer and his family had in helping me pursue my career in politics. I know that Warwick helped many people start a career in politics, and that is because he dedicated his life to public service. Warwick was also an inspiration when events did not seem positive at the time. I remember that he was the Queensland Liberal President when I lost my seat, in 2007. He made me feel like I had achieved something by saying to me and",190,Naplan Category For Assessment In Years 3 5 And 7 Last Year They Ranked Above The

Recently he scrutineered the biggest booth in Bonner, in last year's federal election, and he was able to analyse the result and report back to me. I treasure the last hour of manning that booth with Warwick as we shared many memorable stories with each other. He would always attend functions with his supportive and loving wife Kathi. One of the rare times when I did not see them both together was Tuesday last week, when we were honoured to be hosting a dinner in Bonner for the Hon. Phillip Ruddock. It was only when speaking to Drewe Freeburn, the event organiser, that he informed me of how Warwick was looking forward to attending the event. However, he had been hospitalised just prior to it. Warwick still wanted Kathi to attend, and we all passed on our well wishes to Kathi for Warwick's speedy recovery. Warwick's greatest achievement by far was his family. Justin and I had been friends since the early 1990s, and Warwick would always talk about Justin and his great achievements, from raising a family to his successful business ventures. Justin, your father was very, very proud of you, and especially of your determination to succeed. Justin is one of Warwick's three sons. Warwick married Kathi 40 years ago, and their love produced four daughters and three sons: Carol, Martine, Helen, Sonia, Warwick, Justin and Rowan. Their family includes four sons-in-law: Peter, Lee, Chris and Bruce, a daughter-in-law Jenny, and 18 grandchildren. Our thoughts and prayers are with you all.

Mr Coleman: To move: That this House: (1) notes that the National Broadband Network project was badly mismanaged by the previous government, and has: (a) caused a substantial amount of taxpayer funds to be wasted; and (b) led to a minute proportion of Australians actually being connected to the network; and (2) recognises the plans of the Government to change the strategy of NBN Co.

Wednesday, 19 March 2014; Griffith By-election Ms BUTLER (Griffith) (09:30): I recently gave my first speech to the parliament. It was not possible in that speech for me to thank everyone who supported me in the by-election campaign and nor will it be possible to do in this speech. However, I would like to place on record my appreciation to a number of supporters. In doing so, I will not repeat my thanks to those I mentioned in my first speech and I will not mention the many, many senators and federal MPs who assisted in the campaign, though each of them can be assured that I am extremely grateful for their support. I single out my friend Richard Alcorn. Richard is a loyal friend who provided me with a great deal of support during the campaign-just the most recent of the many things he has done for me. I also wish to thank the following people: Ken A; Mary Rose Abbott; Amjid Abdul-ala; Ahmad Shadi; Peter Akeer; Surabi Alauddin; Ian Alberto; Ian Alcorn; Ann-Marie Allan; Peter Allen; Steven Allen; Peter Alley; Ines Almeida; India Anderson; Christine Anderson; Simon Andrews; Nic Andriopoulos; Clare Angel-Auld; Imogen Armstrong; Henry Armstrong; Delma Nicholson and the members of the Galloways Hill Branch of the ALP; Jane Austen; Debra Austin; Van Badham; Mark Bailey; Aaron Bakota; Brenton Baldwin; Jonathon Baque; Justin Barbour; Cameron Barnes; Chris Barrett; Leonard Bates; Peter Baulch; my friend Emerson; Roger Beames; Nicole Bell; Rob Bigalla, my fellow republican; John Bird; Gemma Black; Ruth Blair; Toni Blake; Janelle Blatchly-Read; Mr Jack Blinco, a very, very strong supporter who sat outside his house with a sign on multiple occasions; Theresa Blumel; Brendan Bogle; Lara Boniface; Sue Botha; Wendy Bourne; Matt Bowden; Emma Bowman; Roger and Patricia Boyd; Mark Brady; Helen Bray; Clifford Brandon; Sara Breckenridge; Mitch Brigg; Margaret Bright; Daniela Brinis-Norris; Derek Broanda; Jenny Brock; Priya Brown; Daniel Brown; Don Brown and members from Capalaba of the Australian Labor Party; Annette Brownlie; Yvonne Bryce; Judith Bugden; Katherine Bullen; Norm Bullen; Frank and Loretta Carroll; Matt Foley; Joan McGrath; Edwina Crowther; Ken and Robin Boyne and the entire Yeronga Branch of the ALP; Taylor Bunnag; Vivienne Burton; James Butchers; Jane Caldwell; Eloise Caldwell; Catlin Callanan; Nick Car; Prue Car; David Carlyon; Zena Carusi-Lees; Isaac Cavanagh; Carol Chambers; Neel Chaudhuri; Gabriel Churchill; Kaitlyn Clancy and many others. McMillan Electorate: Corner Inlet Justice Group in our own electorates, but I certainly was when I went to the Corner Inlet social justice group. When I arrived, I saw a whole lot of cars at the Fish Creek Hotel and I thought there must be a function on. There was, and I was the guest speaker. I was a bit surprised at the numbers: nearly 50 people arrived with our hosts Simon and Kerry at the Fish Creek Hotel.

321,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (09:33,"It is not often we are tested as federal membersbroad fashion, including overseas aid. We covered a myriad of issues once we went into question time. The others involved were Brenda Linderman, Rosemary Livingston, Neil and Judy Travers, Lyne Muir and Nain Philp. The most interesting part was the presence of an award-winning winery that has won national and international awards. I was sitting next to a local vet-this was just an eclectic group of people who I was so pleased to interact with at that level. Our time went for two hours, not five minutes. I expected to go and meet five or so people down there and more than 40 people turned up. These people are directly interested in how we spend our foreign aid, how we treat those who are disenfranchised and how we address ourselves to the movement of people across this world and those who want to come here by boat. It was a pressure time. It was an exhausting time, but it was a pleasurable time to know that there are people in our community who actually take a direct interest in what is going on and are prepared to come out at lunchtime, sit down and discuss the issues with their local member. As I wound up the day, I had to say to Rosemary Livingston particularly, 'Rosemary, the situation is this when it comes to allocating funds in this nation and who we address first: you and I are in a room and we cannot leave that room until we have made a decision about where we spend the money. It is our decision what money goes on defence, what money goes on our border protection and what money is spent on social services. There is only you and I left in the room and we have to make the decision.' When you put it into that type of context-the decisions that the previous government made and that this government made and governments before this have made that affect us today-and you say to people, 'Now it is us; now we have to make the decision,' I say to every member of parliament in this room today, 'You are the decision makers. Consider carefully how you make your decisions.' Scullin Electorate: Community Catch-Up some way responding to the challenges that he left us all with. Last week I held two community catch-ups in the communities of Wollert and Yarrambat-two very different suburbs in the Scullin electorate. I wanted to provide an informal opportunity for people to meet with me near their homes and raise issues of concern to them, to ensure that I am responsive to those concerns whether they relate to local, national or indeed global matters, and to bring formal politics a little bit closer to people seeking to build confidence in this institution. There was clearly a lot of pent-up frustration at the current Victorian government, particularly the lack of investment in public transport infrastructure in these growing communities. In Wollert and Epping North, residents were keen to make the case for rail and bus services to be extended to Epping North. The case for buses is particularly stark, given the existence of bus stops without buses to service them on new estates. When last in government Labor in Victoria extended the Epping railway lane to South Morang. Labor recognised that the communities in Melbourne's north were growing and that people needed an efficient way to get where they needed to go. This is in stark contrast to the current Victorian government, whose transport policy is built around an $8 billion east-east tollway that does nothing for residents in Melbourne's north. I have yet to speak to a single",195,Constituency Statements
322,Mr Giles (Scullin) (09:36,"I rise following the member for McMillan and hopefully inconstituent who favours this tollway. Unfortunately, when it comes to Melbourne's north, the Commonwealth government is even worse than the Victorian government, repeatedly refusing to fund urban rail at all. I know that state MP Lily D'Ambrosio shares my concern about the lack of infrastructure in the area and will continue to be a strong voice on this matter, along with the City of Whittlesea. In Yarrambat, just about every single person who spoke to me raised the problems of Yan Yean Road. It has reached the stage whereby a resident has taken to petitioning the state government to take control of this road between Kurrak and Bridge Inn roads. I await the government's response with interest-though, based on the record, with little optimism. I too have been stuck in traffic on Yan Yean Road and can personally attest to its seemingly permanently gridlocked nature. I know residents affected by this road have an energetic and vocal advocate in their state MP, Danielle Green. The issues raised by residents in both places went to matters of social inclusion and their ability to access opportunities for work, and living their day-to-day lives by doing something as simple as meeting their neighbours for coffee at the local cafe. In Epping North this can be hard to do where there are no footpaths and in Yarrambat people can spend more time stuck in traffic than it takes to complete their weekly shop. I thank the owner of the Third Place Cafe in Wollert, Samir Latif, and the owner of Tancks Corner Cafe in Yarrambat, Chris Guy, for their delicious food and coffee, as well as their warm hospitality. I am pleased to support these local small businesses. AndI thank the many local constituents who took the time to chat or even just to say hello. It is important to me that I am where the people are and that I am working for them and listening to them. I am of course determined to deliver for these communities. Hughes Electorate: Education emails from constituents on the issue of education. I would like to congratulate those people who wrote to me, because I share their passion for education, especially public education. I attended a public school-a public high school and public primary schools-my children attended public schools, and I have a daughter who is studying to be a teacher. Therefore I share these writers' passion and I would love to see more resources put into our education system. Further, I am concerned that what is being peddled out in the public is nothing other than a politically inspired disinformation campaign. The coalition are not breaking any promises on their election commitments on education. We promised before the election that during this term of government we would match what the previous Labor government had proposed under the so-called Gonski funding for the next three years of this government. We are meeting that commitment not only 100 per cent; we are actually doing better than that: we are putting in an extra $1.2 billion into education. In fact this government, this parliament, which is a Liberal coalition government, will be spending more money on education than any other government since Federation. We all know government operates over a forward estimates period, which is four years. Any political party that makes promises about spending outside those four years, trying to make a promise not what the next government would do but the one after when they have no",196,Constituency Statements
323,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (09:39,"Over the last several days I have received severalidea about where that funding will come from, is simply being disingenuous at best. That is what the current opposition is doing. I note the opposition spokesman for education is in the chamber and I noticed the other day she could not even commit to what Labor would propose after the next election. During this period, the coalition is meeting its commitments on education spending in full. Also, while on education, I would like to take this opportunity to say that I agree with the New South Wales education minister that the My School website should be scrapped and those funds should be put into boosting the skills of our teachers. However, I do not agree with the reason given that it is stressful for our students. Life is stressful. Personal relationships, business and sport are stressful. Learning to cope with stress is part of the education that we need to give our students, and we should not be taking away a test, because it is apparently stressful. We need to teach our kids creativity, innovation, critical thinking and entrepreneurship-they should be priorities at school. Qantas The 'Flying Kangaroo' represents Australia around the world. Some people in other countries may not know where Australia is but they know our country by the flying kangaroo. Queensland Northern Territory Aerial Services is part of Australia just like Holden cars and meat pies-I should say meat pies, because Holden are going. What would anyone dowhat would you do-if you had a chief executive that lost consistently over a billion dollars every year in the value of your business? I would not keep him even for six months, let alone for five or six years. The first of the 5,000 people to lose their jobs at Qantas should be the chief executive, the chairman and then the board. The Qantas CEO does not have any performance-just failure, failure. And why is this so? The focus on the airline needs to be on making a profit. By having ridiculous fares that are non-sustainable-$69 from Brisbane to Sydney, $499 return to Tokyo-he only runs down the capitalisation of the airline. I remember when it was approaching $10 million; today it is just over $2 billion. The CEO and the board of Qantas have destroyed Qantas's value and, when they took it over, Air New Zealand had been unable to grow because of the fiasco with Ansett. Today Air New Zealand is making a good profit while Qantas has continued to decline. Maybe Qantas should recruit the next CEO from Bondi or Auckland. Australia must keep its national airline. Australian super funds would be more than happy to support Qantas's financial needs but first it needs new management, a sustainable business plan and a profit. I am sure all the senators from my party and the Motorists will vote against any changes to the Qantas Sale Act in the Senate. Such a proposal strikes against the very interests of the Australian people. If a foreign airline were to control competition, airfares to and from Australia would be the most expensive in the Western world. Governments all over the world ensure their national carrier is owned by companies domiciled in their own countries. So should the Australian parliament.

324,Mr Palmer (Fairfax) (09:42,My constituents are concerned about the sale of Qantas.,198,Constituency Statements
325,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (09:44,"Last week I met with Mrs Carmel O'Shaughnessy, theopportunity to speak about this new school which is being constructed in the electorate of Cowan. St Elizabeth's Catholic Primary School is the third Catholic primary school within the parish of St Anthony of Padua; the others are Banksia Grove and St Anthony's schools. The school building was designed by Peter Quinn and will be completed in early July 2014, allowing the school to be ready for a second semester start this year. As I have often said in this place, the City of Wanneroo, which Hocking falls into, is a region that is experiencing rapid growth and is expected to double its population to approximately 300,000 by 2031. Demonstrating this, the adjacent Hocking Primary School has over their double-stream quota. At the same time, both St Anthony's in Wanneroo and St Luke's in Woodvale had waiting lists for kindergarten up into the high twenties. It was for this reason that the Catholic Education Office agreed it was time to cater for the Catholic families in the area. Currently, the school is operating from St Luke's Primary School in Woodvale and has a small kindergarten class. Carmel O'Shaughnessy expects the numbers to rise dramatically when they are on site, with many expressions of interest forms completed. As well as Carmel, the school staff currently consists of a secretary and finance officer, Melissa Dimond; a teacher assistant, Joan Martino; and a teacher, Kim Manov. I wish them all the best for the future. When I met with Carmel, she told me that at the time of her interview for the position of Foundation Principal, she was asked what would be distinctive about St Elizabeth's Catholic Primary School. Her commitment was not about the school being known for any one particular strength; rather, it would be a school that is distinctive as a community designed school with Christ as the centre involving parish, school and the wider community. She said, 'Christ as our centre requires us to grow in understanding of our faith, to nourish our faith and to have courage to be positive role models of our Catholic beliefs.' Carmel said that she recalled as a child learning the importance of faith, hope and charity-with charity as the very essence of love. She believes that charity is love of God above all else and that, in so doing, we love those who are created in the image and likeness of God. At her initial meeting with the interim board members of Hocking Catholic Primary School, she expressed her own thoughts on the saint's name for Hocking: someone the children could relate to in terms of both a deep love of Christ and the practical actions of charity. Following a great deal of research and discussion they chose St Elizabeth for their school's name. I wish Carmel and everyone involved at St Elizabeth's Catholic School in Hocking all the best for a bright future. Adelaide Electorate: Nowruz Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide) (09:47): I rise today to inform the House of the Nowruz festival celebrations which will take place this week-the largest celebrations taking place in my home town of Adelaide. Nowruz means 'new day' and it is the new year celebration which is celebrated by different ethnicities right around the world. It is particularly a Middle Eastern celebration. I know that a large emerging culture within the Adelaide electorate, the Afghan community, will be out in force over the weekend. As I indicated, the largest Nowruz celebration in Australia will be held in the Adelaide electorate. It will involve over 5,000 people and celebrations will run over three days this weekend, with communities travelling from interstate to witness this great festival in Adelaide. The Nowruz festival is around 3,000 years old and it shows the benefits that our very diverse multicultural communities bring to our local neighbourhoods. It marks the first day of spring and the new year. On Friday night there will be quite a celebration-a festival of firewhich is being organised by the Kurdish community, who work incredibly hard in Adelaide, for the wider community. There will be a symbolic table on which there will be seven things which symbolise the coming of the new year. On the last Wednesday of the year, which is today, a fire is lit to cleanse the passing of the last year, and the community jump over it to move into the new year and to leave the last year behind. I can assure people that in Adelaide this fire will be off the ground, because of our local fire bans, so it cannot be jumped over; but the sentiment remains the same. On Saturday there will be a large celebration held at the Adelaide Festival Centre to celebrate the diversity of Middle Eastern cultures in the Adelaide community. Celebrations begin on the Northward equinox-the moment the sun crosses the celestial equator and equalises day and night. That is when families gather together to observe the rituals. It is a secular holiday enjoyed by people of several different faiths. It is celebrated by cultural regions in the Middle East including the regions of Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Kurdistan and also other scattered populations in Central Asia. It is a celebration of language, of food, of music, of dance and of leisure activities. I really want to congratulate and give my best to all of those who are celebrating this very special holiday this weekend and particularly acknowledge all of those in the Adelaide community who work so tirelessly and volunteer their time to organise these celebrations. To all of them. I say that I very much look forward to joining them to mark these celebrations, and I want to thank all of the multicultural organisations who give so tirelessly back to our community, especially the Middle Eastern Communities Council of South Australia and the Migrant Resource Centre of South Australia. To all of the community I say: a very happy Nowruz. Morcombe Family under a week ago, the murderer of their son Daniel Morcombe was committed in trial by his peers, found guilty and convicted of heinous crimes, and he is now going to serve at least the next 20 years in jail. There are a couple of observations I would like to make. First of all, this crime should never have been allowed to happen. Let me read to you what this criminal, this pervert, had done previously. Whilst he was actually in community service as a result of property and dishonesty offences and he was working in that community service, he took a seven-year-old boy into the toilets and molested him, and he went back to his work. Subsequently, in Darwin, he brutally molested a six-year-old, at one stage covering the child's mouth when he cried loudly. The man, Cowan, left the boy to die. The youngster was found that evening when he stumbled out of the bushland naked and covered in dirt, cuts and bruises. His eyes had haemorrhaged and his lung was punctured, injuries a doctor said were caused through strangulation. The police thought he had been hit by a car. The man only got 4½ years in jail for this. I am saying to the judiciary today that this is not meeting public expectations. Daniel Morcombe died because the judiciary failed him when a man like this did what he did. The first thing I would say is: when you hurt a child in this way, you forfeit your right to be free",198,Constituency Statements
326,Mr Brough (Fisher) (09:50,"I rise today to pay tribute to the Morcombe family. Justfor the rest of your life. Let me say that again: when you hurt a child, you forfeit your right to be a free man for the rest of your life. People like this have no place in our society. I want to read to you the words of Denise Morcombe as she spoke to the judge before sentencing. She said, 'I have tears as they describe not being able to sleep more than three hours at a time since my son disappeared.' She described the bond of 'the big eyes staring at me'. She wrote: I have bad nightmares every couple of weeks, screaming out ""no, no, I won't go with you"". I see my son lying by himself in that dark, eerie bushland, being destroyed by wild animals. … It was an innocent boy … He was gentle, he loved animals, and wanted to be a vet. He would never hurt a soul. He was scared of the dark, and often slept on the floor … She goes on, but I will stop there, only because I do not have time. These are the words of a mother in great anguish. I honour the Morcombe family, Dean, Bradley, Bruce and Denise, for what they are doing for the rest of Australia's children. A young family, Tim and Sam Aitken, the teenage sons of Tony and Lisa, have come up with the idea that we should be painting the overpass where Daniel was abducted red, like the tie I am wearing today, in memory of the shirt he was wearing at the time. It would stand as a permanent reminder to every family that comes to the beautiful Sunshine Coast: protect your children. Always be aware of the predators that, unfortunately, lurk amongst us. National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (09:53): I rise today to speak about a very important issue in my local community, and that is the Abbott government's failure to recommit funding to the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, which is due to expire shortly. Many fantastic organisations in the southern suburbs of Adelaide rely on the funding through this initiative to continue their important work to support some of our most vulnerable Australians, and they are understandably feeling very anxious and concerned about whether they will be able to continue to employ their staff and whether they will be able to continue to deliver the important services that they provide. I just want to quote a number of people who have raised concerns with me. First, Megan Hughes is the Executive Officer of the Southern Domestic Violence Service. She has contacted me because her organisation is feeling extremely nervous. Megan has said: We're talking about some of the most vulnerable people in our community here. At Southern Domestic Violence Service we support people who have been subjected to domestic violence to escape and begin new lives free from abuse. We can't do this work without ongoing funding. Not extending funding under the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness could mean that we would be forced to cut up to 30% of our services and reduce our workforce through redundancies. We have been left in the dark, and we really need to know what is going to happen now so that we can plan for our future. Another comment that has been received by my office is from the Junction Australia CEO, Graham Brown, who runs Junction Australia services. He is similarly concerned. Graham has said: Our service helps people who are at risk of falling through the cracks to find a home of their own. We provide social and affordable housing options to vulnerable Australians in Southern Adelaide and around the State so that they are able to have a safe place to call home, and so that we have strong healthy communities. As a quality employer we are committed to providing stability of employment to our staff and therefore we like to be able to provide staff with at least three month's notice of changes to employment contractsstaff who work in the area of homelessness are extraordinarily gracious and committed and it is important that the significance of their work in the community is honoured and upheld with stability of employment. There's a lot of uncertainty in the sector at the momentwe need to know what's going to happen come the 30th of June. I call on the Minister for Social Services to please extend this vital funding, to please give these organisations some certainty. I have also written to the Minister for Social Services, expressing my concerns and the concerns of those in my electorate, and I eagerly await a reply. The clock is ticking, and we simply cannot afford to take our foot off the pedal when it comes to homelessness. I will continue to stand up for my community and to fight for this funding. Mallee Electorate: Woodbine visit that I made in my electorate last Thursday. One of the great things about being a regional member, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, is just how important rural communities are, but also how resilient they are and how they do things for themselves. Last ThursdayI was fortunate to catch up with an organisation called Woodbine. Their mission statement is: To provide residential, skill development, employment and recreational services primarily for people with an intellectual disability in the Wimmera and adjoining regions. This is a great organisation. One of the things I went to is a new residential care facility that they have built. They said to me at the time: 'We actually applied for federal funds. We missed out. It was going to cost $700,000, so we just damn well built it ourselves.' You have to admire that sense of community spirit. I caught up with Phil, a man there with a disability. He had a set of drums. He got on the drums and I got on guitar and we rocked on for a little while; it was just really good. One of the things that has happened recently in the township of Warracknabeal is that Target chose to shut their shop. In a little country town it is good to be able to go somewhere and be able to buy some socks and jocks, a nightie if you are going into hospital. It became a big issue in Warracknabeal that Target were shutting. Not to be outdone, Woodbine decided: 'Well, blow it. We're going to grab it by the mantle and do something about it.' They talked to the local community and the local community said, 'Yes, we're on side'. They talked to the local menswear shops so that they did not compete with them, and Woodbine have opened a shop in Warracknabeal. They are employing people with intellectual disabilities. They are providing socks, jocks, clothes. They are actually turning a profit, which is fantastic. This is another example of what I see every day while travelling around my electorate-that is, when big business pulls out, communities say, 'Well, we're going to have to do it ourselves', and they get on with it and they do it. It just makes me so proud to be able to speak about them to the Australian Parliament. So Woodbine: a great organisation, doing a great deal of work, often not supported but certainly should be morally supported and acknowledged for their contribution to Australian society and particularly to the township of Warracknabeal.",200,Constituency Statements

Quarantine Charges (Imposition-General) Bill 2014 Quarantine Charges (Imposition-Customs) Bill 2014 Quarantine Charges (Imposition-Excise) Bill 2014 Quarantine Charges (Collection) Bill 2014 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. to which the following amendment to the Quarantine Charges (Imposition-General) Bill 2014 was moved: That all the words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for quarantine funding cuts."" (Imposition-General) Bill 2014 and the other bills in this cognate debate and also in support of the amendment put by the member for Hunter, who is Labor's spokesperson for agriculture, fisheries and forestry. Agriculture is absolutely critical to our future as a country. I represent a regional and rural seat in South-East Queensland and, as a federal member in my third term, I have seen first hand and from personal experience the importance of food security and agriculture to our economy. Labor, in government and in opposition, has been committed to guaranteeing the long-term productivity and sustainability of Australia's agriculture, fishery and forestry industries; we think this is crucial. The agricultural sector contributes about $38 billion annually in export dollars and about $47.3 billion to the gross value of production, so this is an important sector for our economy. We face challenges in areas of biosecurity. We need a biosecurity system that protects the health of all Australians. There is no doubt about that whatsoever. We have a wonderful natural environment which faces the challenges of floods, droughts and fire, so we need a biosecurity system that makes sure that we have competitive agricultural, farming, fishery and forestry sectors. We also face the challenge of agri-terrorism and the risk of climate change and the challenges that it brings. We have also seen the risks of pests and disease status challenge us. We have a competitive advantage in this country when exporting to world markets because other countries recognise our pest and disease control status. We expect our exporters to be treated fairly under the World Trade Organisation rules and, in turn, we also expect our trading partners to be treated fairly. We have real and legitimate concerns about our biosecurity. We saw the challenges that that brought to our economy in the agricultural and farming sectors, particularly in equine industries in the last few years. There was devastation in not",202,Constituency Statements

329,Mr Neumann (Blair) (10:00,"I speak in support of the Quarantine Chargesjust one part of Australia but whole areas, and that created a challenge for those people who work in the horse industry, particularly those who keep horses not just for sporting activities but also for use in agriculture. I represent an area where the racing industry is important, particularly to Ipswich. The Ipswich Cup is the most visited regional race day in the country. It brings a huge amount of money into the Ipswich economy, so the equine industry is very important for Ipswich and its surrounds. This legislation is important, and it comes about because of the Beale report. The review panel, chaired by Roger Beale AO, presented a pretty far-reaching and comprehensive blueprint for a stronger biosecurity system. Now in opposition, we are calling on the government to carry out a number of things which we think are important, and the member for Hunter has raised them. We had some legislation on the table and asked the government to reintroduce the biosecurity bills to replace the Quarantine Act 1908. That was a recommendation of the Beale report and built on work we undertook in this space when Tony Burke was the minister for primary industries. The Beale report indicated that our governance in this area was totally outdated-a 100year-old act of parliament. So we introduced the Biosecurity Bill 2012. One of the other recommendations was that we needed an inspector-general-a peak organisation across this space. So we introduced the Inspector-General of Biosecurity Bill 2012 into parliament on 28 November 2012. It went to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for inquiry. The bills have lapsed and we are calling on the government to resurrect those bills. They are important. The Beale review was highly commended and its report, One biosecurity: a working partnership, is important. It has far-reaching recommendations and we call on the government to act on this. This particular quarantine charges legislation before the chamber is basic. It covers a legislative package designed purely as a cost-recovery mechanism. Governments of both persuasions do this. It is important that cost-recovery in the industry takes place so that taxpayers do not foot the bill. It does give the power for the Commonwealth government to sell goods and vessels to recover outstanding debts and deal with goods and vessels that are abandoned or forfeited, and it provides an opportunity for regulations to be undertaken to make sure that taxpayers are not out of pocket in this area. We are critical of the government in relation to this area, as indicated by member for Hunter in his motion. There is a voluntary retrenchment program across this space and we saw that announcement back in November 2013. We have seen a number of retrenchments. It was not about natural attrition; they called on people to take voluntary redundancies as part of cost-cutting measures. The shadow minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter, has called on the government to reverse this and said that those job losses within the department would strike at Australia's front-line defences against introduced plants. We have seen that more than 500 public servants in the department want out, most of whom work in the agriculture and border protection divisions. So we are concerned that if the government continues down this road, our biosecurity safety could be at risk. We think the government should have a look at this. This is particularly concerning for us. We saw the impact with equine influenza across the horse industry-not just for equestrian and farming but also for the racing industry. Through Senate estimates, we have seen some more concerns in this area as well. We think the government should look at this. The government do go on a lot about the fact that they are a government for all Australia, particularly for the regions. This impacts agriculture and they should really look at this. The facts and figures are clear, redundancies are taking place in this space. There is a risk to our reputation as a clean and green producer of food if these redundancies continue. We call on the government to look at this and to review this. The Canberra Times reported on 6 March this year that the agriculture department is the latest government department to be swamped with requests from its workers for redundancy payouts. We think the government should have a look at this. We do not want to risk the biosecurity of this country. We support this legislation before the chamber but we have also put forward the amendment from the member for Hunter because we are very concerned about the job losses in this space. We are very concerned about the risk to Australia's reputation and the risk to the farming, agriculture and fishing industries of this country from job losses across the Public Service. (10:09): I find it quite remarkable that, after six long years, Labor are at last talking agriculture. They suddenly have a new-found interest in farming. Suddenly they have discovered the fact that there are regional and rural areas in Australia which need protecting. WhilstI commend the member for Blair for finally figuring out that there is life beyond the bright lights of the metropolitan areas, and whilst I appreciate the fact that he says he is from Ipswich, which is a regional area of sorts, I just find it incredible that Labor have finally discovered that there are regional areas which need protecting. Certainly, this cognate debate into the Quarantine Charges (Imposition-General) Bill 2014, the Quarantine Charges (Imposition-Customs) Bill 2014, the Quarantine Charges (Imposition-Excise) Bill 2014 and the Quarantine Charges (Collection) Bill 2014 goes to the very heart of protecting our wonderful diversity in regional areas. I am joined here by the member for Mallee, whose area, like mine, produces many fine products-the food and fibre which feed and clothe our nation but, perhaps more importantly, other nations as well. Those agricultural industries need protection. They need good quarantine measures. The package of bills presented to the House by the Minister for Agriculture seeks to put in place appropriate cost recovery mechanisms to support Australia's capacity to manage biosecurity risks. Careful management of biosecurity risks is central to Australia's position as an exporter of high-quality agricultural products-the sorts of products that come out of Mallee and Riverina. It is a trade that is forecast to be worth around $38 billion to the Australian economy this year. It is critical-if we are to protect Australian crops and livestock from diseases of which we are currently free but which blight the produce of other countries, we need to have in place good quarantine measures. I found it remarkable that Labor, the member for Hunter, the shadow agriculture minister, and others opposite now find it so critical to Australia's export demands and needs that they all of a sudden find voice in such matters, when they did not give two hoots when they were in government. I refer to Batlow, a town in my area, east of the Riverina electorate, which was placed at risk. The entire town's economy was placed at risk because of the lack of biosecurity, the lack of protocols and the lack of foresight by Labor. Apple orchards have been vital to Batlow's economy for 120 years. In 1922, the first cool stores in New South Wales were built at Batlow. At the same time, a railway was constructed from nearby Tumut.",203,Bills
330,Mr Mccormack (Riverina,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance)These developments facilitated Batlow's trade with Sydney and beyond. In times of this nation's greatest need, the dark days of World War II, the district served an essential role by supplying the troops with dehydrated fruit and vegetables. These days, up to 40 apple growers at Batlow provide employment directly and indirectly to 2½ thousand people-all hard workers; all taxpayers. That wonderful history and those jobs were placed at risk by the Labor government, which could and should have done more to look after its own. I am talking about 2011 here. Instead, as with most things agricultural and many things of importance to regional Australia, Labor either caved in or, worse, did nothing. The same could be said about Labor's inaction on the Asian bee incursion, which was another critical quarantine risk, the mouse plague, live cattle exports and its abysmal failure to give good governance on the water issue. It deserted regional Australia when it was most in need. Australia is at present free of fire blight. Fire blight can destroy an entire orchard in a single growing season. An outbreak would devastate Australian horticulture, cause considerable environmental harm and be impossible to eradicate. Labor opened the way for apples to be imported from New Zealand. It was the first time for 90 years that apples from New Zealand were going to be allowed into Australia, all just to give the then Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, something to talk about when she historically addressed the New Zealand parliament. Up she got and announced, 'Oh, it's great. New Zealand apples will be allowed into Australia.' She had a photo opportunity with the Prime Minister of New Zealand, John Key, and they laughed about whether the All Blacks or the Wallabies would win the next test match and who would eat whose apples. Whilst it was a great photo op for our Prime Minister, it left my Batlow apple growers at great risk. They were absolutely fraught with worry and concern that New Zealand apples were going to come into this country, bring with them the fire blight, which is well known in New Zealand, and eradicate our entire crops and orchards. It was of grave concern at the time that three of the first 13 consignments of New Zealand apples were denied entry. That is a damning rejection rate. Australia originally barred apple imports after discovering in 1919 the bacterial disease fire blight in fruit from New Zealand; it was banned not long after that. Prime Minister Gillard, addressing the New Zealand parliament on 16 February 2011, announced Australia would lift the 90-year ban. By 18 August that year, just a day after the all clear was given, seven permits had been issued to New Zealand orchards. They thought: 'Let's cash in on this. We've got so many apples we are now going to invade the Australian market.' Later that same month a live insect pathogen and potentially fire blight carrying leaf matter had already been found in one of the first consignments of New Zealand apples bound for Australia. The news justifiably angered many, especially those in the industry who campaigned against Labor's decision prompted by a World Trade Organisation ruling. The industry warned that this could expose crops to crippling diseases such as fire blight and pests. One of the very first consignments was refused after a small piece of leaf matter which could carry disease and an insect, an apple leaf curling midge, were found during inspection in New Zealand. I am sure the member for Murray, who will follow me, will have something to say about that. Alarmingly the live insect was found four to five months after the fruit was harvested. The midge eats leaves and can defoliate trees depriving them of nutrients. Australia does not have leaf curling midge, and strong chemicals are needed to control it. Some of these strong chemicals are banned in Australia. But that does not matter to some of the WTO rules we have and it certainly did not matter at the time to Labor. A recent coalition delegation to the Hawkes Bay region on the east coast of New Zealand's North Island heard some disturbing remarks from one of the countries largest apple growers who openly admitted in response to questioning about the instance of fire blight: 'If you look hard enough, for long enough, you will find some.' There was also this quote: 'Half of our orchards have never had fire blight.' Well, if half of them have not had fire blight, you might wonder about the other half. Fire blight is not a notifiable disease in New Zealand. Every safeguard is taken against it, I must admit, including sophisticated warning systems linked with weather updates. But, when it does occur, treatments including streptomycin and antibiotics not registered for use in Australia are applied. Water used in processing fruit headed to Australia is often the same as that which washes streptomycin and other contaminants from apples destined for other countries as New Zealand orchards are only required to change the water every 48 hours. The Australian Labor government, at the time, did nothing. I, along with the then shadow minister for agriculture, John Cobb, the member for Wannon, Dan Tehan, and the member for Murray, Dr Sharman Stone, went to New Zealand on a self-funded tour. We looked at the apple orchards. When we came home we made sure, through insistent lobbying, that our protocols for quarantine were such that no New Zealand apples were going to arrive here. I am proud to say it is now March 2014 and we have not had one crate of New Zealand apples come to Australia. But that may not have happened. I see the member for Makin nodding. He knows how good the apples are in Australia-as I am sure you do, Deputy Speaker. I am sure the member for Lalor doesn't mind a crunchy Pink Lady either. We need to protect what we have here in Australia. Sometimes through inactivity governments just do not do it. But I am glad to say that no New Zealand apples came to Australia because of the good work done by the shadow agriculture minister at the time, and others, to make sure that our quarantine measures are enforced. It is so important. We sometimes have the biosecurity measures in place but, for whatever reason, we do not actually ensure that every letter of the law is followed. As I say, careful management of biosecurity risk is essential to ensuring we have clean green exports as well as product for our own domestic use. It was not that long ago that Labor just ignored that very premise. It was a particular concern to growers in Batlow. Batlow is Australia's apple capital-Tasmanians might disagree-and an outbreak of fire blight would be devastating. These bills will enable cost recovery for the direct costs of providing services to importers under the Quarantine Act of 1908 and indirect activities such as surveillance, risk analysis and the gathering of intelligence which genuinely support Australia's biosecurity. The amount of charges is to be set out in delegated legislation, but Australian farmers can take comfort that the regime established by these bills requires that the Minister for Agriculture must be satisfied that the amount charged will not be more than the likely costs of delivering the activity. Unlike his predecessor, the Minister for Agriculture, a National Party member, actually understands the consequences of government decisions on the livelihood of farmers and their communities, and our farmers are so important. The Minister for Agriculture, like me, grew up on a farm, and he still farms to this day-like the member for Mallee, who gave a great speech in parliament yesterday about the hardships faced by farmers. I listened intently, and he too understands why and how farmers are so important. Barnaby Joyce, the member for New England, knows the challenges and realities of life in the Australian bush. They can take heart that there will be no repeat of the woeful and quite frankly inept actions of the previous government's ban on live exports to Indonesia. This new regime will support the risk based approach to biosecurity management which has over time replaced the system of mandatory border intervention targets in relation to certain products. At best, this was a blunt tool which failed to direct resources based on a deep understanding of biosecurity risks-in terms of both the likelihood and potentially devastating consequences for industry-across the range of products imported into Australia which can change over time. As I have said in this place many times before, good regulation gives regulators flexibility in their approach to enforcement so that the nature of their enforcement action can be adapted to the severity of the non-compliance and the circumstances of the individual. I am pleased that these bills include provisions to both impose late payment fees and remit those fees where appropriate. One of the first site visits I made as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance was the site of the new post entry quarantine facility at Mickleham in Victoria. The Department of Agriculture currently operates post entry quarantine facilities at five sites across this nation. At each site, the facilities are over 25 years old and are fast approaching the end of their useful life. The new facility at Mickleham will replace these dispersed and outdated facilities. It is a major undertaking with an expected cost of $293 million. We in the coalition are getting on with the job of doing these things, but I must admit Labor has had something to do with that site and it will be a good facility when it is up and running. Certainly, with the new government focused on agriculture, it is going to reap the rewards for our farmers and indeed the nation as a whole. Construction is being managed by the Department of Finance and is expected to begin soon, with the first phase due for completion in late 2015 and a final second phase due for completion in late 2018. Hopefully, the coalition will still be in government. Funding Australia's biosecurity system is critically important if we are to ensure that Australia's unique animal and plant health status is maintained. This status is in turn, as I have said before, vital to our ability to export clean, high-quality produce to the rest of the world. We had the opportunity to be the grower of great food, to feed the Asian century, to feed that growing middle class in Asia. Prime Minister Gillard said that herself in one of, I thought, her best speeches as a keynote speaker to an international food summit in Melbourne. She said that we need to be there to feed the growing Asian nation boom. Unfortunately, the policies that Labor put in place did not follow through, but I am glad to say that now the coalition is in power, we will put the policy settings in place to ensure that our farmers, who are unquestionably the very best in the world, following world's best practice, will be there to ensure that we are able to feed that growing Asian market and feed our own domestic supply needs with the very best, cleanest, highest-quality food. I commend these bills to the House. It is very important that they be supported. Quarantine Charges (Collection) Bill 2014 and associated bills. I share the concerns of the member for Riverina with respect to the intrusion of fire blight into Australian apple orchards. Just for his interest, I represent an electorate that borders perhaps the prime apple-growing district in Adelaide. Last year when the issue became a real issue for Australia, he might be interested to know that I, some of my colleagues from Western Australia-including the member for Freemantle-and some Tasmanian Labor colleagues met with the then agriculture minister, Senator Joe Ludwig. He, in turn, listened and shared our concerns and ensured that the biosecurity arrangements for the import of New Zealand apples into Australia were set so high as to ensure exactly what has happened-that is, we have not seen any New Zealand apples coming into the country. Having said that, I entirely share his concerns about diseases entering into the Australian agricultural sector because it could destroy and ruin the whole sector. I will fight as hard as anyone in this place to ensure that that does not happen. The agriculture, farming and fisheries sectors are important to Australia, especially when we consider that by 2050 it is estimated that world food consumption is expected to rise by some 75 per cent. Here in Australia the sector currently provides one in six jobs and, as we all know, it sustains many regional communities. In fact, Australia produces food to feed some 60 million people around the world. Not surprisingly, 90 per cent of the fresh fruit and vegetables that we eat in Australia are produced here in Australia. I think that is a good thing because it gives us some level of confidence in the fresh fruit and vegetables that we consume. Agriculture, farming and fisheries are indeed important not only to our economy right now but to our economic future. They are important because we have an opportunity to produce more food here in Australia and because, with a growing demand for that food, we know that that it turn means growing opportunities for our export markets. Getting into new markets depends on many things, including there being a demand for Australian produced food and also perhaps on getting some new free trade agreements with other countries. To ensure that there is a demand for Australian food, we also need to ensure that we maintain the image that we have of Australian food as being clean and green. This is a phrase we quite often use in this place that, I believe, is not only true but ensures that Australian produced food remains in demand and remains, in many places, the food of choice for those who are able to access it. This bill, obviously, seeks to address the very issue of making sure that we have and maintain the clean green image in our food production. We do that essentially through maintaining a robust and appropriate biosecurity system. The bill in essence responds to the Beale inquiry that was commissioned by the previous Labor government and which in turn made several recommendations, amongst which was the need to invest more in our biosecurity systems in this country. And if we are going to provide that investment then maybe the costs should be shared between government, those people who are going to directly benefit from food production in this country and the biosecurity supports that are provided. As we know, and as other speakers have commented already, biosecurity risks are very real. We have seen several events in recent years of those risks being presented to the Australian market. In fact, the Beale report quite rightly refers to a Productivity Commission estimate made in 2002 that had the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease which occurred in the",205,Bills
331,Mr Zappia (Makin) (10:24,"I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on theUK hit Australia, at that time it would have affected the Australian market to the tune of $2 billion to $3 billion if it were managed very quickly. If it were not managed very quickly and it extended on to, say, a 12-month outbreak, then the cost could have been as high as $8 billion to $12 billion. Such is the magnitude of the cost to the Australian economy if we get it wrong and if disease is allowed into the country. We have seen again in the last decade or so, outbreaks of bird flu, mad cow disease and equine influenza, which in fact did get into the horse industry in Australia, which all presented serious risks but, fortunately, were pretty well managed in Australia and did not affect our industries anywhere near as much as they could have or they might have in other countries. As I stated earlier, a reliable biosecurity system comes at a cost and this legislation is essentially about raising revenue. One of the things I want to make clear is that there are two issues. Cost recovery is one thing; raising revenue is another. I certainly hope that this legislation is indeed about genuine cost recovery and not about raising revenue, because I note that one of the first pieces of legislation brought into this House by the government is in fact this legislation after it has been sitting dormant for the last couple of years because we could not get it through the Senate in the last government. The Abbott government has now very quickly moved to bring it into place. I suspect they do so because they are looking at raising revenue out of it as much as the real need to ensure that we have an effective biosecurity system in place. It simply highlights that the Abbott government talks about, on one hand, cutting costs to business in this country but very quickly is bringing in legislation which is indeed going to add to those costs, and I want to come back to that in just a moment in a bit more detail. I am also concerned-and I noticed one of my colleagues mentioned the issue earlier-that there may be cuts to biosecurity expenditure in this country in the coming May budget. I believe that that would be a foolish step by the government, and the few dollars that might be saved in the process-if that is what the government intends to do–will cost this country dearly in the long term, because of the problems that might arise as a result of having a weaker Australian biosecurity system. I said a moment ago I wanted to come back to the issue of costs and I do so now. One of the matters that has been raised with me by several exporters and growers in this country is the issue of costs they incur for the production of their product and, in particular, when they try to export their products to other markets. I note that there was in fact a press release issued not long ago, and I quote from the Victorian Farmers Federation: Merbein fruit grower Darren Argiro said that in the last two years, AQIS’ export registration fees for packing sheds had blown out from $330 to $8530. It is an incredible increase, something to the tune of a 25-fold increase to the cost for those exporters. I have had similar concerns expressed to me by growers in the very region where Mr Argiro comes from. I thought I would look up the horticultural export program list of fees that applied for 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013. IfI am reading this list correctly-and I may not be and I stand to be corrected-the fees imposed for the recovery of order and inspections are from $36 per quarter hour, which obviously translates to about $150 an hour. But if you have the inspection done on a full daily basis, it costs $1,152 per day to have your packing shed inspected on a daily basis or $5,760 a week. I find those costs quite excessive and I can understand not only the concerns of the growers with regard to the fact they have to pay them, but that it also in turn makes their product less competitive in overseas markets because they incur these additional costs. It is a concern I have, because I doubt very much that their competitors in other places and in other countries are incurring this same level of fees. One of the things we need to bear in mind when we look at cost recovery is that, if we want our growers to get into other markets we need to understand and accept that they are competing with growers in other countries who are also trying to get into those same markets and who may not have the same robust biosecurity processes in place as we have in Australia, and that in turn puts our growers at a real disadvantage. I would hate to see that happen. As we all know, most of these growers are only what we would refer to as small business operators. For them, these kinds of additional costs on top of the plethora of other fees and charges that they pay governments on a daily or weekly or yearly basis really do make a difference to them. SoI simply impress upon the Minister for Agriculture and the department that, whilst they use the term 'cost recovery', they need to ensure that it is a fair and reasonable cost and not an excessive cost on those growers, because if it is it could ultimately kill off their businesses. Last night I attended the Costa fresh food presentation here in this place. Frank Costa, who is the chairman of the Costa Group, raised a matter with all of us who were there that I believe is worthy of consideration. He talked about the bumblebee and made the comment that in Tasmania pollenisation of different crops is allowed by the bumblebee as it is in many other places in the world. He made the point that on the Australian mainland it is not allowed and yet the bumblebee from his understanding presents no risk to the rest of the agricultural sector whatsoever. It has caused no risk in Tasmania and it has caused no risk in other places in the world. Again, these are claims he has made; I am simply passing them on to the House. If he is right, then I would urge the minister to consider his pleas to allow the bumblebee into mainland Australia because it will save growers I think he said something in the order of 13 per cent of their growing costs, which is quite considerable. Allowing the bumblebee into mainland Australia is a real issue for growers. Again, I raise this matter for consideration by the minister and the department as opposed to simply arguing the case that it should or should not be allowed to happen. As I said at the outset, this is legislation that follows the bill inquiry report which was initiated by the Labor government. It is legislation that we on this side of the House support, because in principle we want to ensure that we have a robust and effective biosecurity system in place; however, as I made clear in my address today I simply want to ensure that it is not an excuse for revenue raising as opposed to cost recovery. Nationals) (10:37): They always say that when people put in the word 'that' you should ignore everything that comes before it. That is pretty good advice. It is advice you use certainly when dealing with the media. If you hear 'He is a good person but', remove everything before 'but' and hear what they say next. With an amendment, if they say remove everything before 'that' then basically they are completely changing the context of what was said. In this case, the government will not be supporting the amendment. The member for Makin mentioned bumblebees. I thank the opposition for their statement that they will be mindful that, if we do intend to go down that path, the Labor Party will not",209,Bills
332,Mr Joyce (New England,"Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of Thebe lining up with the Greens and will be proactive in making sure that a relevant debate is had. Without prejudice I am considering seeing if we can do a further examination of and test theories about bumblebees, and do those tests in Tasmania where there already are bumblebees. There have been bumblebees in Tasmania since about 1880, so even if they escape from a glasshouse they will just go back into the bumblebee population. Bumblebees have also been in New Zealand. We are basically talking about using bumblebees for the crosspollination of plants, but introducing them in such a way that they cannot go out into the bee population and breed. You can do that by just having one sex of the bumblebee. In many instances where they are wanted to be used, they would not survive in any case, even if they did get out. However, I do note the concerns of apiarists, and varroa mite is one of the issues that they bring up. We have to make sure that there would not be an incursion of varroa mite by bringing the bumblebees across to the mainland. A further investigation of that process in Tasmania is something that I do consider. The issue that pertains to this bill-and we have noted that we will not be supporting the amendment-is trying to get cost recovery. I wish that this was not the case, but, when a nation is left in a position where the current cost streams that have been delivered to us and the current debt that was left with us would lead our nation to a position where we were $667 billion in debt, that is untenable. We cannot end up in that place. In my own department, on the first day-as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, when you come into a department, it is like taking over a business-they said: 'Congratulations. Here are your 4½ thousand staff. Here's your budget. And here's $48½ million loss for the previous year. And there's no money, so you've got to try and clean it up.' This leaves you in an invidious position. The one department that the Labor Party did manage to cut costs in, whether we liked it or not, was agriculture. We went from a budget of about $3½ billion a year down to about $1.7 billion. They just did not believe in that part of the economy, and that is disgraceful. It is so vitally important, Mr Deputy Speaker, to where we go-and you would know this, coming from Townsville, knowing about the live cattle trade that comes out of the port of Townsville and knowing how important the agricultural industry is. I am very proud of the fact that, since we have been there, from the good people of the city of Townsville, the city of Darwin and Northern Australia, over 500,000 head of cattle have now left and we are starting to get money back into that section of the economy. That was cut off at the knees by a ridiculous decision by the previous government. I was always concerned, too, that with the previous government it seemed like agriculture was the booby prize if you did not get another portfolio. If, at the end of the day, you had not got anything else, it was the last lolly in the jar, and it was: 'Oh, well, you can be the Minister for Agriculture.' That is basically how it was treated. Mr Broad interjectinggive you an example from recent history of how important agriculture is to the coalition. Do you realise that in this nation we thought we were going to make a loss? You see, this is the difference from when they were in government. We did not make a loss. We thought we were",211,Bills
333,Mr Joyce,"The member for Mallee clearly understands how important this is. I willgoing to make a loss of $100 million in January. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know that in January we made a profit of $1.4 billion, a surplus of $1.4 billion? And guess where a large portion of that came from-agriculture; it came from turning around agriculture. It was from those terrible people in the live cattle trade putting all those cattle on the boats and getting paid for it so that money could flow into our nation. And those terrible ma-and-pa farmers, as they are pejoratively called by Mr Paul Howes, from the AWU-he used to be a friend of the Leader of the Opposition; I do not know what he is now; 'dangerous', I think, is the best word for him-harvested 17.2 million tonnes of wheat in Western Australia, and they managed to ship in excess of six million tonnes of it. This meant that our nation made money. We actually started getting back into the main frame. There are two sections in this nation that I think we should be really focused on. There are people in this nation who actually put money on the table. There are others who put it on and take it off, and there are others who produce extremely good social goods, and we need to be mindful of them. But I will tell you the two sections that do it, and Townsville would be very aware of this: agriculture and mining. They put money-big lumps of it-on the table. That is why it is so vitally important that we stand behind our agricultural industry. It should not be some dismissive sideline; it is absolutely vital for where we are going. In the circumstances we have been left with we unfortunately do have to do costrecovery-we have to pay our way. We have to make sure that if the costs are out there we cover them. I have debts in this department that we have to clean up. I am also mindful that we have to do this in the most effective and fairest way and make sure people are getting a fair return for the costs that they incur. We have put $15 million aside to try to assist the smaller producers and we will be doing a review to make sure that the charges, especially in the horticultural industry and areas such as that, are fair in how we do this. If we can do it in a cheaper way but with the same outcome then that is what we should endeavour to do. I commend the Quarantine Charges (Imposition-General) Bill 2014. As we are still talking to the amendment, I will not repeat myself in the concluding speech. This amendment this is just so typical of the Labor Party. We were down there yesterday on a non-controversial bill and all of a sudden guess what happened? The shadow minister, the member for Hunter, jumps up and moves an amendment. I am sitting there at the table and thinking, 'This is news to me.' I said, 'You've got to circulate the amendment.' He says, 'I don't think you have.' The more I looked and the more I thought about it, I thought: 'You know what? He's moving an amendment to the wrong bill. But no-one could be that silly. No-one who holds a shadow ministry could actually move an amendment to the wrong bill.' I always give people the benefit of the doubt so I very politely and deferentially put a point of order and said to the shadow minister for agriculture, the member for Hunter, 'Excuse me, with the greatest of respect, I think you are moving an amendment to the wrong bill.' He said, 'No, you've got it wrong. This is the amendment.' Then the member for Grayndler-he was a bit like Carl Lewis-came screaming in and said, 'What on earth are you doing?' Then there was a kerfuffle and the member for Hunter went back to these dispatch box and said: 'I apologise. I have made a mistake. It is actually the wrong bill.' It was wrong in that bill, it is wrong in this bill and we do not support it. Original question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

In my electorate, nearly every town has an airstrip that is up to a standard to take the air ambulance. There would be very few electorates that could say that. We also have aviation businesses and maintenance businesses, such as Horsham Aviation Services. Ramair does a lot of air spraying in the horticultural and cotton industry in Tandou, to the north of Mildura. They are telling me that they have been very concerned about the direction CASA have been heading with the regulation burden that has been put on them. Currently there are five directors on the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board and not one of those directors has any flying experience. Whilst we need myriad skills on our board, it",212,Bills

Just for the record, I bought it before I became a parliamentarian. I did not afford a plane with my parliamentarian wages. I am just making that very clear. There are many people who enjoy both the sport and the necessity for air transport in Australia. In Australia there are 36,900 people with a current pilot's licence, there are more than 15,100 registered aircraft and there are more than 7,700 licensed aircraft maintenance engineers. There are more than 100 air traffic controllers, 330 operators in certified and registered aerodromes, 701 maintenance organisations and 856 holders of air operator certificates. It is an important part of the landscape. One of the things we are blessed with in Australia is a large land mass with fairly stable weather patterns, which lends itself to aviation. But what we are hearing time and time again is that CASA have been over-regulating the maintenance of private aircraft and over-regulating the medicals. An example of this was brought to me the other day, where a guy who is 65 now has to have a medical certificate every year. The difficulty is that after he fills in the paperwork for his medical certificate it then takes six months to get it back to him. So effectively he has six months without flying. This is to fly a private plane with a maximum of six seats in visual met conditions, in nice clear skies, and the regulation on him just to pass a medical is huge. He is physically fit. If he wanted to drive a school bus with 45 kids on board, he would not have to pass a medical to that level. There needs to be some common sense. There is this perception that just because it is an aircraft it is so much more dangerous. The thing that we are seeing squashed in Australian aviation is some of the innovation around manufacturing. The aircraft I do have-and I am pretty risky, because I happen to fly the prototype of this aircraft-is from a company called PG Aviation, based in Cowra. They are an Australian company making Australian aircraft. They get an Austrian engine but they essentially design and build the aircraft themselves. They make a high wing and a low wing, and they are a very safe and reliable aircraft. They are actually in the process of negotiating a deal to take the R&D of their business into the manufacturing opportunities in China. CASA has been very difficult to deal with in driving that company with a level of burden and regulation. We have some great innovative people in Australia. We want to make sure that they can be productive and that they can grab hold of the opportunities that exist in personal aviation and in the broader aviation industry, but we need an attitude within CASA that encourages those people to develop and grow. By simply expanding the board we are going to allow more skill sets, we are going to allow more people who have an affinity with aviation on that board. We are going to take that from five to seven. The total cost is negligible. It is in the vicinity of $160,000 a year, which will be absorbed by CASA's operating budget, so I think that is very good. We do have an ageing aviation fleet-there is no doubt about that-simply on the back of the withdrawal of production from Cessna and Piper in the mid-1980s on the back of litigation before some common sense came back into the US system. That means that there has to be greater oversight and watching of maintenance. From the feedback I am getting, it appears that that maintenance oversight is at the very point of putting some of our LAMEs out of business-and the pendulum has swung too far. Very rarely do we hear of a plane dropping out of the air due to a mechanical failure, due to a breakdown of the structure of the aircraft, even in some of our ageing aircraft. Usually it is weather or pilot error. In fact, there is a very strong argument that the aviation industry has been pretty safe. But it is important that CASA realise that you cannot put the same regulation on small general aviation that you have been regular public transport aircraft. We know that they have to have very strict oversight of regular public transport aircraft. That is as it should be. No-one at any point is saying that jets that people are paying money to fly in should not be very well maintained. They must be well maintained. But when you are talking about general aviation-such as four-seater and six-seater aircraft-you cannot expect a person to operate them at the same level of maintenance scheduling as an airline. They simply cannot. People who fly air tractors for spraying cotton cannot do that. The regulatory burden, for really no effect, is stifling some of our small and regional manufacturing and maintenance vehicles. I want to hark back to the importance of aviation, particularly in our rural areas. In my electorate, for example, Air Ambulance Victoria would use Horsham airport three times a day. I do not think people realise just how important air ambulance is. In the township of Mildura at the moment, if you have a cardiac problem there are not the facilities there to treat you. They will stabilise you and put you on a plane, and take you to Melbourne. Having an effective air ambulance swings on having a regulatory body that has an understanding of the importance of air ambulance in the aviation sector. I think that this amendment will be the start and broadening the skill set will be first. Having people involved in CASA who have an affinity with the aviation industry and who actually can fly themselves will be welcomed by the general aviation sector. They will then look at replacing the CEO. The CEO, John McCormick, will be finishing up in August, as I understand. Then they will be moving in a forward direction. I hope that this is the first step to restoring confidence for general aviation and I hope this is the first step in restoring confidence for maintenance. One of the things that I think is not talked about is the great demand we will have for aviation pilots, specifically from the Asian region. There are great training opportunities in Australia. We have the perfect weather for it and Asia's proximity enables people to come over here and do that level of training. Enhancing this field-general aviation and the training sector-by having people on the CASA board who understand aviation will have a long-term effect in attracting people to come and do their studies here. Currently, I do get a little nervous about some of the trainers. I have been up in a plane myself and had a guy give me a 10-mile out call to tell me that he was 10 miles 'north-south' of Bendigo. And he was not sure what altitude he was at either-and I was a little nervous, I have to say. His English language proficiency did leave a bit to be desired. But I give you an example of how foolish this has become: when I applied for my private plane licence I had to prove to CASA that I had English proficiency. I am a member of the Australian federal parliament and I am an Australian citizen-I have lived here all my life-but I had to prove to CASA that I can actually speak English. An honourable member: They must have read your Hansard! The other thing that I think needs to be looked at are the ASIC cards-another regulation which I will touch on. An honourable member interjectingstring a couple of words together, which is an advantage in this House, I am told. The other issue, too, is in getting an ASIC card to be able to get access and walk across to my private plane. IfI had lived overseas in, say, EnglandI would actually have had to get a police check from Scotland Yard. Some things have just gone to the point of ridiculous for general aviation and we need to swing that pendulum back so that we have manufacturing, good maintenance and good, safe recreational aviation and charter operators. I think we can do it. I think the first step is to expand the skill set of the board. I commend Warren Truss for adopting this, and this is why I support this bill. congratulate you on your elevation to the Speakers' Panel. It is good to see you up there, and I am sure you will bring a level of intensity and a dedication to the role that it deserves. Congratulations to you. I rise to contribute to this debate on the Civil Aviation Amendment (CASA Board) Bill 2014, and in doing so acknowledge the importance of a strong, experienced, balanced and fair Civil Aviation Safety Authority to Australia and to my electorate of Swan. Obviously, most members in this place will know that I have the Perth airport in my electorate. I share that with the member for Hasluck; I have all the good bits and he has the brickworks and some of the other industrial areas! But I have the runways-all the stuff that people in my electorate and outside my electorate go to to spend time in the observation area for, watching the planes coming in and out of Perth. The people in my electorate of Swan often remark that they can almost touch the planes as they come in to land at Perth airport, particularly over the residential areas. My office does receive calls from residents where there are aircraft that seem to be flying particularly close to the ground. Just to give you some background: in 2008 we had some aircraft flight routes change due to the WARRP process, which was initiated by CASA around the issue of safety. There was no consultation with stakeholders-people in my community and people around the CBD of Perth. Because of that, we received a lot of calls with regard to changes in flight paths. We managed to get a Senate inquiry in Perth on that issue. At the same time, we directed a lot of inquiries towards the then Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the member for Grayndler, who has also spoken on this bill. In fact, the billion-dollar Gateway WA Perth Airport and Freight Access Project is in my electorate of Swan. That is a major roads upgrade project on the periphery of the airport and bordering residential areas in the Belmont area. This involves land excavation and works to ensure that complex interchanges sit at an acceptable height so as not to interfere with lowflying incoming aircraft. This again comes under the auspices of CASA. They would have had some involvement in making sure that the safety of the aircraft and the people on the ground was paramount.",214,Bills

337,Mr Irons (Swan) (11:03,"Mr Deputy Speaker Ewen Jones, I take this opportunity toAs the Minister for Infrastructure explained yesterday in question time, this is a roads project that could never have been delivered under the previous government, which had said that the funding for the project would come from the mining tax. I am sure we are all aware in this place that the mining tax never raised any money. It is an anti-Western Australian tax. I mention the project during this speech because it is closely associated with the safety around the airport, which CASA oversees. Safety is certainly always in the minds of residents and workers in my electorate of Swan, and I am pleased to be able to comment on this bill today. The bill's primary purpose is to give effect to an election commitment, made by the coalition and announced on 30 August 2013, to increase the membership of the CASA board. This is an increase from five members to seven. The bill also makes two minor amendments, consequential to increasing the size of the board. These amendments increase the number of board members required to constitute a quorum at a board meeting and increase the number of board members required to initiate an ad hoc board meeting. This is a government that delivers on its commitments to the Australian people. It will deliver on these commitments to reform the structure of CASA. Part of this reform involves enhancing CASA's abilities to function as Australia's key aviation safety regulator by establishing a firm strategic direction for the organisation. The need for increasing the size of the board comes from the need to put some aviation experience on the board-which it currently does not have. I received an email yesterday from one of my constituents in Langford. The member for Tangney is next to me. I am sure that he knows Langford, because it used to be in his electorate. The member for Tangney is also going to speak on this bill, because his office is also hounded by people who are complaining about aircraft noise. The constituent who wrote to me yesterday nominated that he is a pilot. He says: As background I am a pilot who is very frustrated by what I see as unrestrained corruption and overreach in CASA. I'm not going to bore you with a diatribe about it but CASA really is Royal Commission territory as it appears that ultimate power ultimately corrupts. So obviously there is a perception within the industry and the public that there need to be changes to the board of CASA. As our pre-election policy outlined, CASA's board has been repeatedly established, abandoned and re-established. While boards in other agencies have been successful in setting and implementing the strategic direction of their agencies, CASA's board structure has been the subject of criticism. While CASA was established in July 1995, under an update to the Civil Aviation Act, the CASA board in its previous form was established under the previous government in 2009. As I said before, CASA's involvement in the flight path changes in the electorate of Swan at the Perth airport was extensive. The WARRP review was undertaken to change aircraft flight patterns, which CASA, at that particular time, believed were unsafe. As I said, the outcome of that review was a Senate inquiry which made some recommendations to the government about what changes should be made to consultation between CASA and Airservices Australia when future changes are made to flight paths. Following the Senate inquiry, the then member for Pearce, Ms Moylan, and I put its recommendations into a bill, the Air Services (Aircraft Noise) Amendment Bill 2011. While the bill was focused on changes to Air Services Australia, it was certainly brought in in the aftermath of the CASA flight path review of Perth airport. As Judi Moylan said in her first reading speech: The apparent clandestine nature of the processes precipitating the flight path changes, however, as well as the uncertainty and the inconsistency of the rationale for not providing the CASA report to the public, highlights some of the current flaws in the consultation process and the reason for such disquiet from within the community. The relationship between Air Services Australia and CASA is an interesting one and needs to be considered. The bill drew the support of the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Greens and initially the Independents but was then voted down. There was extensive consultation with the Australian aviation authorities but it seemed to fall upon deaf ears. I remind the House that that bill was lost by one vote in the House. Unfortunately, it displayed the fact that the Labor Party had no interest in helping the residents of Perth with aircraft noise. I am sure the member for Tangney was just as disappointed as I was that the Labor Party spoke about aircraft noise in Sydney, Adelaide and Brisbane, where we saw many Labor ministers fighting for their constituents, but when it came to Perth airport, they had no interest at all and voted the bill down. I note the member for Grayndler's contribution to the debate yesterday evening in the chamber and his call for a non-partisan approach to civil aviation safety. But I have to take issue with the member for Grayndler on a couple of points he made in his speech. The member called for everyone to support the government of the day on issues related to CASA, but many constituents would find that difficult following the Western Australian Route Review Project, which was conducted in near secrecy, altering flight paths over my electorate of Swan and in Tangney, Hasluck, Pearce and Canning. This was of course the finding of the Senate inquiry in 2010. CASA's operations should be transparent and the people should be informed about changes to flight paths in the airspace above their houses. It was not good enough for the previous government not to explain these changes to the people of Swan, just responding that it was all down to 'safety matters', a continual line during that period by the previous government. It is good to see we are finally getting some action from this government to improve the performance of CASA by having some board members who have aviation experience. This is a view I know the minister also shares. I remember a freedom of information request by the former member for Pearce coming back to her with line after line redacted-it was virtually pages of black lines, demonstrating how secret the previous government kept their report. It is certainly not the case that flight paths cannot be adjusted safely. We have seen this recently with an ongoing trial to change a flight path over the member for Hasluck's electorate. The response of the public has been very positive to these changes and, as I understand, the authorities are completely satisfied with the safety result. So it is not acceptable for CASA to just respond with 'safety reasons' to every inquiry about flight paths. It is, I feel, a lazy approach. Secondly the member for Grayndler spoke about the white paper, and I say to the member that parts of that white paper were highly partisan. There was a section talking about a curfew review for Brisbane Airport-coincidentally an issue affecting former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's electorate. There was nothing for Perth, though, which remained one of the few major airports in Australia with no noise amelioration measures. Along with the member for Tangney, we have spoken to constituents and public groups advocating that there be a review of the ANEF contour system because under the current system only about 60 houses in Perth qualify for any noise amelioration similar to Adelaide and Sydney. There needs to be a review of that ANEF contour system so that we can move forward in trying to get the same noise amelioration schemes that the people of Sydney and Adelaide are the beneficiaries of. I think the comments by the member for Grayndler are simplistic and not reflective of what happened under his government. I sought on many occasions during the last parliament to have a meeting with the member for Grayndler to present the concerns of my constituents. But in all that time that he was the minister, he never met with me once. It shows that, with regard to the concerns of the people of Perth, his focus was eastern-centric. He was however only too keen to travel to Western Australia at the time of the last state election to meet with the state Labor candidate Hannah Beazley, who was running for a seat in the member for Tangney's area. He was all over that and spruiking the talk, but in the six years I was the member he never met with me once. I think that says it all about his commitment to nonpartisanship in this area. The Perth Airport and the aviation industry are vital to the Western Australia economy and it is vital to our mining industry. We need to make sure that we have a healthy board that overlooks Western Australia and the Perth Airport and that we have people with experience on that board. I would like to finish with a comment from a recent meeting I had with CASA. The member for Tangney would know that there is a flight path which takes off from Perth Airport and heads south and then heads to the west and goes down the river. It is a consistent flight path for all of the fly-in and fly-outs to the north-west of our great city for the mining people. The flights are from 6 o'clock in the morning and there are a consistent 90 flights within a short period of time, which has a real effect on the lives of people in that particular flight path. In looking at the sharing of those flight paths and the aircraft noise, we asked CASA to look at making a trident type flight path where there could be three legs heading out so that some of the noise could be shared and it would not all be concentrated in one space. The answer, typically, came back from CASA that it was a safety issue and they could not look at it. It was really disappointing that they continue to hide behind safety issues. We need some people with aviation experience on the board who can look at these types of things for the benefit of people in Perth and around the Perth Airport. I support the bill. Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (11:17): I am very pleased to follow the member for Swan in supporting the Civil Aviation Amendment (CASA Board) Bill 2014. I rise to speak on this bill not for the specifics so much as the general-that is, the general thrust and meaning of this bill and what it hopes to address. The increased diversity in the Australian aviation industry requires continuous improvement in the aviation safety regulatory system. While Australia has an enviable record in aviation safety, built on a strong regulatory system, any regulator must keep pace with the industry it regulates. Australia's aviation safety governance structures and processes have continued to evolve since the initial establishment of the Civil Aviation Act 1988 covering the operations of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority-Australia's aviation safety regulator. CASA was established in July 1995, under an updated Civil Aviation Act 1988, as the independent aviation safety regulator-a Commonwealth statutory authority with responsibility for the safety regulation of civil air operations in Australia and Australian aircraft operating outside Australian territory. At the very heart of this bill is safety. How does a governing body catch up with an industry that is moving so quickly? This bill adds two members to the CASA board, taking the total from five members to seven. This includes the Director of Aviation Safety as an exofficio member. The two additional members, importantly, will have operational and/or technical aviation experience. The provisions of the bill will provide for the CASA board to be comprised of six members appointed by the minister, plus the Director of Aviation Safety as an ex-officio member-in other words, seven members in total. An expanded board with experience and background in aviation would be better equipped to implement CASA's new strategic direction to be established by the government after considering the outcomes of the external aviation safety regulation review due to be completed in May 2014. There are other issues related to bringing CASA up to world best standard. It is the hope of all government members that the proposed changes in this bill will achieve that standard. It is the hallmark of a good government, and especially this government, that common sense be at the heart of legislation. So yes, the size of the board is to increase, but this is to address the backlog of issues building due to the changing nature of aviation and the increasing complexity surrounding that industry. There are too many new issues to detail. Suffice to say that the world is a very different place from what it was in 1995. The common sense aspect of this legislation is item 2 of the bill, which increases the number of written requests that the chair must receive from board members before the chair is required to call an ad hoc board meeting. With the increased size of the board, this amendment keeps in place the requirement that the chair must call an ad hoc board meeting if he or she receives a written request from at least 50 per cent of the remaining board members, including the director. This cuts down on the number of two-person board meetings. It cuts down on expenses claims for meetings that have no value. It is more democratic and more efficient. Responsible government is responsive. This legislation, while in process for a considerable time, looks timely in light of revelations arising from an inquiry in the other place into CASA's standards. During the inquiry into Qantas an engineering union official accused CASA of failing to properly supervise maintenance and of favouring the national airline. A Senate committee was told that the engines on a Qantas jet were not properly attached after it was serviced in Hong Kong, and CASA was accused of handling the incident inappropriately. There is no reason why CASA should not be a world leader, nor is there any reason why Australia should not set industry standards rather than follow industry leaders. Let me expand on the specific example of the use of electronics during take-off and landing. In the United States it is possible to use electronic devices at all stages during flight, including take-off and landing. This is not the case in Australia. While this is not a big issue in and of itself, it is indicative of a governing authority that is behind the curve. So this legislation is timely. CASA is a slow body and governing processes are even slower. It is my ardent hope that this necessary increase in bureaucracy results in the speeding up of the process. Hopefully more hands will make light work of the increased demands on CASA. At this juncture I would like to talk about how CASA impacts constituents in my electorate of Tangney. Tangney is an electorate that knows the benefit of both private and commercial flight and also the downsides associated with both-which were spoken about by the member for Swan. Jandakot Airport is a key stakeholder and, like any airport or private operator, should have a role in the greater discussion regarding aviation regulations and CASA. However, it is not only significant financial stakeholders that are impacted by any change to CASA or the regulatory environment surrounding aviation. A demonstration of this point is that, in October 2013, I was briefed by a constituent, Mr John Janssen, about how seemingly small changes can have a very significant impact. He wished to highlight what he had been alerted to by Mr Max Scorer-namely, that while the strictest standards of safety should be religiously enforced on commercial airlines it is sometimes not possible or practical in relation to recreational airplanes. Mr Scorer had recently retired from CASA-at the end of June 2013-after just on 30 years of service with CASA and its predecessors as an airworthiness inspector. Prior to his appointment in 1983 to the then Department of Aviation, he worked in the field of aircraft maintenance as a licenced engineer on large airline aircraft, light aircraft and corporate jet aircraft. He also spent some time as a flight engineer and in his younger years he served with RAAF City of Melbourne 21 Squadron. So to say he is a person of great experience would be no exaggeration. Mr Scorer approached me with a view to offering his services to the aviation industry to give something back to an industry that has provided him with a living for many years. In January 2014 he clocked up 50 years of service in aviation. Mr Scorer gave me a presentation with regard to the recently implemented Civil Aviation Safety Regulation 1998 part 42. It is my belief that more of the aviation community should be aware of the situation as it now exists under part 42. One would obviously realise that the intricacies of government legislation can be complex, so I will try to explain the requirements as briefly as possible and attempt to give you some idea of what changing safety legislation could mean for the general aviation sector. Under Civil Aviation Regulation [1988] 30, the regulation under which GA maintenance organisations presently gain approval, the norm has been for the operator's chosen maintenance organisation to control all the pending maintenance requirements for their aircraft. In other words, the maintenance organisation would keep concise records of what is required to safely maintain the aircraft and comply with all CASA legislation. Much of this is provided to the customer as part of maintenance services and as a normal function of aircraft maintenance. It is called continuing airworthiness control or continuing airworthiness management. CAMOs are granted approval under part 42G. The RPT sector, which used to operate under CAR 30, now operates under part 145-the actual physical maintenance function-and part 42G-airworthiness management-two different approvals. Part 42B, specifically 42.040 (2) says that the registered operator of an aircraft operating under an air operator's certificate 'must' have a contract with a CAMO or form their own CAMO. The requirements relating to gaining approval as a CAMO are very costly and difficult for the GA sector to achieve. For instance, a small maintenance organisation consisting of a chief engineer-quite often the owner-hangar foreman, and licensed aircraft maintenance engineers, unlicensed personnel and quite often a couple of apprentices will not be allowed to utilise any of those personnel to form a CAMO. It will not be acceptable for them to carry out the two roles as they have done in the past. The CAMO must have a management structure consisting of an accountable manager, responsible manager, quality manager, continuing airworthiness manager, airworthiness review manager and so on. All of these personnel have to have formal qualifications to be acceptable to CASA to fill these positions. For instance, to fill the position of continuing airworthiness manager you would have to be a LAME or equivalent. There are not enough LAMEs in Australia to carry out aircraft maintenance as it is; pulling them out of the system and putting them into a CAM role would severely hamper the industry in available personnel and impose a huge increase in cost to the operator. At this time CASA has not approved any independent CAMOs. All approvals have been granted within the RPT sector. There are thousands of aircraft in Australia that are affected. There are many private aircraft owners who make their aircraft available to operators under leasing agreements. This helps in two ways: it lessens the cost of ownership where maintenance costs et cetera are concerned and it makes aircraft available to operators who would otherwise not be able to finance the purchase of the aircraft. If any such aircraft are operating under an AOC then the owner will have to contract the services of a CAMO to gain an ARC-no ARC, no flying. The maintenance organisations will not be able to issue a certificate to release the service following the maintenance unless the aircraft has an ARC. These requirements will have far-reaching implications where the GA sector is concerned. The Royal Flying Doctor Service, for instance, will have to comply with the CAMO and ARC requirements. At the moment the operation of the ESSO helicopters in Victoria ferrying workers out to the oil rigs is a 'private operation'. This operation, by the way, rivals the airlines in terms of departure and arrival frequencies. Via the new operational regs, this operation will be under an AOC. The Royal Flying Doctor Service is funded largely by donations. The requirement to either contract a CAMO or gain their own 42G approval will entail the use of some of those vital funds. The adoption of the European Aviation Safety Agency legislation, which is what the new legislation is based on, is all very fine for airline-type operators, such as Qantas or Virgin. However, it is a bit ludicrous to expect an organisation that is operating a couple of piston-powered Robinson R44 helicopters, carrying three passengers to a remote site to view cave paintings, to provide the same infrastructure as Qantas does for the Boeing 747s. As Mr Scorer pointed out, that needs to be back at the heart of law making. I believe this bill is a fine example of sense. Items2 and 3 of the bill exemplify this common-sense approach. That is, with item 3 increasing the quorum limits, there is an added incentive to get more board members to attend, thus ensuring better delivery and decision making. The Civil Aviation Amendment (CASA Board) Bill demonstrates this government's ongoing commitment to aviation safety. The coalition government is taking decisive action now to strengthen the nation's safety regulator and its oversight of the aviation industry. In the final analysis, it demonstrates the government's clear commitment to deliver hope, reward and opportunity to all Australians. Regional Development) (11:31): In summing up, may I thank those members who contributed to this debate on the Civil Aviation Amendment (CASA Board) Bill 2014. Their contributions have been wide ranging, dealing with a whole spectrum of aviation issues:",217,Bills
338,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure andnoise, regulatory arrangements and issues associated with CASA and the way in which the industry has managed, and other related concerns. Obviously we are very proud in this country that we have an aviation industry that is safe by world standards and safe by comparison with other modes of travel. Indeed, I was interested to read statistics this morning showing that aviation now has a safety record matching that of rail. The number of casualties arising from the aviation industry means that it is something like 30 times safer to travel by plane than it is to travel on the road. That is a tribute to those associated with the industry, and it has to be acknowledged that the regulator also plays a key role in our achieving that objective. However, there are, as was evidenced from the debate today and yesterday, a range of concerns about the operations of the regulatory system in Australia. We are therefore conducting a safety regulatory review with an international panel, and I anticipate that, arising from that review, significant reforms will be under consideration. The panel is due to report to the government by the end of May 2014. Once the government has considered the report it will finalise an updated strategic direction for CASA, which will enhance the authority's role as Australia's independent aviation safety regulator. The shadow minister reported a little on the history of civil aviation regulation during the time he was the minister. As usual, he looked at it through somewhat rose-coloured glasses. But I am sure that even he must acknowledge that there is widespread concern in the industry about the way our regulatory system is working, the difficulties in managing and dealing with the new rules that are currently being developed and the widespread acceptance that there needs to be a simplification in the way in which we administer safety issues in the aviation industry. Also, there needs to be a substantial improvement in the relationship between the regulator and the industry. There needs to be confidence on both sides and also a willingness to work together to achieve a satisfactory outcome. So, I thank all members who have participated in the debate, and also the opposition, for their willingness to support the legislation. The bill represents one of a number of initiatives being implemented by the coalition government to strengthen the nation's independent aviation safety regulatory agency, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The bill maintains the existing CASA board structure but provides for the appointment of two additional board members. It has been a relatively small board and, therefore, the absence amongst the current board members of anyone with substantial aviation experience is obviously an issue. The current board obviously contains very capable people, but I think aviation experience is one of the skills that should be guaranteed in the board of CASA. The government will use the bill's provisions to add beneficial aviation experience to strengthen the board's future operations. Having an expanded board is timely given the government has established this external safety review that is being undertaken by a small panel of leading international aviation experts. I compliment that panel on the way in which it is seeking to consult with industry, taking on board their views and developing constructive ideas that I hope will provide us with a path ahead that will be acceptable to industry and continue to deliver effectively the safety objectives that the organisation is designed to ensure. The expanded board will be well placed to oversee CASA's new strategic direction, which the government will issue, as provided for under section 12A of the Civil Aviation Act 1988. The new strategic direction for CASA will reinforce safety as CASA's primary responsibility, but it also will set out a more active leadership and review role for the board. In summary, enhancing the CASA board is an important step in helping fulfil this government's commitment to a safe, competitive and sustainable Australian aviation industry. I again thank members for their contribution to the debate and commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Parer, Hon. Warwick Raymond, AM Debate resumed on the motion: That the House record its deep regret at the death on 14 March 2014, of the Honourable Warwick Raymond Parer AM, former Senator for Queensland from 1984 to 2000, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. some enthusiasm to say of Warwick Parer that, as the Minister for Resources and Energy of our country, the job he did in a short period of time was simply terrific. Warwick Parer was well regarded in Western Australia's resources sector for many reasons: he understood it instinctively, he understood it legislatively and he cared. In the context of the LNG sector, in which I was employed from the early 2000s before my entry to parliament, Minister Parer performed a number of regulatory simplifying operations that made life significantly easier for that sector. Members will be aware that the idea of exporting Australia's mineral resources seems to us today to be a relatively straightforward matter, but one of the substantial regulatory burdens on the sector at the turn of the century, in 1999, was that any shipment of LNG from Australia had to be given the approval of the minister for resources. Every single shipment had to obtain that approval-and Minister Parer removed that regulatory burden and obstacle, which allowed the industry to both feel more comfortable about its operations and also perform its operations in a much smoother way. It may seem an odd thing to remark upon, but it takes a minister who cares and understands about the little things to have a big impact, and Senator Parer's impact across the board in resources was not simply the accumulation of those small pieces of caring knowledge; it was a big impact because it was very clear to those in the resources sector that he enjoyed being amongst them. He enjoyed visiting mine sites. He enjoyed visiting the big stuff and he pressed boards, executives and employees of companies on matters from safety and efficiency through to ensuring that these industries had a robust growth path. He was an executive from Utah's coal mining division. In his latter years he continued as chairman of a power corporation. He continued to serve his community of Queensland in many different ways until his death last week. Mr Parer is in many ways a great exemplar both of public service and of good corporate practice-public service in a man who cared to serve his party as well as he possibly could, to serve his state in the best way possible and to find those value-adding, no-cost initiatives that were so reforming for the resources sector and",223,Bills
339,Mr Gray (Brand) (11:37,"I rise to speak on this condolence motion with great heart andfrom which Australia continues to benefit. He did all of this in a relatively short time as minister. I pay tribute to him for his hard work and his thoughtful efforts, and I express my condolences to his family and his friends and my regret that I will not be able to attend his funeral on Friday. But I am in some hope that my comments today show both respect and admiration for a man who came to Canberra and made a substantial mark that is remembered, acknowledged and understood by those of us in the industry who benefited from his time, his service, his thoughtfulness and his insight. Brand for his comments. I might say I had the privilege of seeing Warwick Parer's widow, Kathi, last Tuesday week at a function in Brisbane. While I think he was unwell, I was not apprised of any particular immediate vulnerability. I had the great privilege of serving with Warwick Parer in this parliament. He joined it on 5 November 1984, succeeding a dear friend of mine, Kathy Sullivan, who became the member for Moncrieff. I served with him while he was a minister in the Howard government. We served together from 11 March 1996 until 21 October 1998, and he remained in the parliament until he left in February 2000. He was a person whom I greatly admired. I had the opportunity of understanding something of the career he had with Utah before he came here. I must say I think it is very hard, from personal experience-not related to me but to my late father-for people in business to be able to aspire to public service. I do not think that in Australia firms understand that in the way in which they do, for instance, in the United States of America. I know from personal experience that some people have even had employment discontinued when they have evinced a willingness to give of themselves in public life. So it is unusual to have somebody who had succeeded at a very high level in commerce coming into the parliament to serve as he did for some 16 years and then, as he left, going back-as my colleague said a few moments ago-to serve in business but also to serve his party. He was the President of the Liberal Party in Queensland between 2005 and 2008. Others may speak of that engagement, because I understand that he was particularly positive in seeking the formation of the coalition of Liberals and Nationals that we now have in Queensland. He was a person who continued that involvement. I am glad that the member for Brand remains here, because I wanted to read to him a little of Warwick's maiden speech, because it was somewhat prescient. I do not know whether the member will mind me involving him in the politics of today. Warwick had this to say: Under the Constitution there are clearly defined powers of the Federal government. Yet over the years, by various devices, Federal governments have slowly usurped powers that are better left to the States. State governments are not let off; they have done the same to local government. Yet the bureaucratic baggage of regulation remains at all levelssomewhat prescient, isn't itMuch to the bewilderment of the person in the street. People are confused and frustrated at the cost and the complexity of the plethora of State and Federal laws. Obvious examples of duplication occur in the areas of housing, health, roads, education and the environment. The elimination of duplication would not only put us on the road to real reductions in taxation but it also makes political sense to have clearly defined separation of powers. This is the essence of a properly functioning, dynamic Federal system",225,Condolences
340,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Chief Government Whip) (11:42): I thank the member forwhere competition and diversity, rather than levelling uniformity, are the hallmarks. Over the years it has been all too easy for the States to sheet home the blame for various problems on the Commonwealth or vice versa. He went on to say-and this is particularly interesting: The mining industry is exhausted by government regulations and punitive charges. The extent of the exhaustion can be seen in the dramatic decline in profitability, employment and investment-this in an industry which has the potential to contribute so much more to the prosperity of our great nation. Federal and State governments are equally to blame for the intolerable level of crippling taxes, charges and costly regulations. Governments avoid their responsibilities if they think the real problems will go away simply by the formation of committees and sub-committees. It is fascinating, isn't it? I should have given this quote to the Prime Minister for his speech earlier today. I am delighted that the member for Brand recognised that Warwick not only believed it but also put it into practice when he became the minister. Warwick is a man who has contributed greatly to this country. To his widow, Kathi, to his seven children and to his many grandchildren, I extend my personal condolences and I join with them as they grieve. He has been a great Australian, properly recognised, and his death has come a little too soon. Ms GAMBARO (Brisbane) (11:48): I would also like to associate myself with the kind remarks by the member for Brand and the member for Berowra. I rise with great sadness to honour the passing of a man I consider to be a great Australian, the Hon. Warwick Parer AM. When I first came into this place as the member for Petrie in 1996, I was a very green member of parliament. I had worked in the business sector and did not know much about the political workings of the House. Warwick Parer took me under his wing. He was under no obligation at that time to extend his kindness and generosity to me, but that is exactly what he did, and I will be forever grateful for the benefits of his tutelage, his patience, his experience and, of course, his great congeniality. He was always a happy person. My experiences of him in this regard are not unique. We have heard in the other place Senators Boswell and Brandis this week acknowledging Warwick's open-door policy. He had a willingness to talk to anybody at any time about anything, and to provide advice. For that many of us in both houses were truly grateful. He was my mentor. I developed under his guidance, and he became my friend. Too often in this place, and in other areas of life, the use of superlatives in describing someone as a statesman is often overused to such an extent that the true import or gravity of such a description is sometimes watered down or loses its true meaning, but that was not the case with Warwick Parer. When I say we have lost a statesman with the passing of Warwick Parer, I do so knowing that that description will stand scrutiny and it is a deserved description of a great man. He was also a statesman of the Liberal Party. The member for Berowra spoke about his active work in the Liberal Party. Both he and Kathi were tireless workers for the party. For many years he was the patron of the Young Liberals movement, and he and Kathi worked in a very dedicated and committed way for the Creek Road branch of the Liberal Party. He served as a Liberal senator for Queensland from 1984 to 2000, and was the Minister for Resources and Energy from 1996 to 1998 under Prime Minister John Howard. The member for Brand spoke about his very short time as resource minister, and one cannot underestimate what he achieved. In that time, he oversaw the abolition of the three mines uranium policy. The member for Brand is quite right: he oversaw the removing of regulation that absolutely strangled our resource sector at the time and had an incredible impost on export controls. By doing this, he improved expansion of our sector internationally. He also freed up jobs growth in that really important area. After leaving politics, Warwick was very active in the Liberal Party. He served as Queensland state president from 2005 to 2008. That was a very tumultuous time. He worked with the National Party president Bruce McIver to prepare for the eventual amalgamation of the two parties into the LNP. I had a large number of dealings with him after I lost my seat of Petrie in 2007. He was very helpful to me at that time. He served his state of Queensland and the country proudly and with great dignity. His dedication to public life has been acknowledged by many from both sides of the House, as well as captains of business and industry, and particularly by a lot of people who worked in the mining and resource sector in which he dedicated a whole lot of his working life. He was able to bring that great expertise into parliament and it assisted him to fulfil his parliamentary duties. Warwick served Australia in a number of important roles in his twin careers as a businessman and as a politician and, as has been stated by many members, he brought a depth of understanding to that resources portfolio that nobody-and I mean absolutely nobody-in the parliament could match. He was also a very interesting Minister for Resources and Energy. I recall that he would regularly say to me that the fisheries part of that portfolio took up 90 per cent of his time, because it was so contentious. I worked with him to remove an impost on the industry, which was the Australian prawn promotion levy. That freed up a lot of the impost, particularly on companies who were working in the prawn industry. The agency that was collecting the levy was very upset with the minister. It wanted the agency to continue, but the industry were so much in favour of it being abolished. I remember the agency taking out a full-page ad against the minister and myself. I was a bit disturbed at the time, and I remember Senator Parer telling me that it was the best advertising that I would ever get in my parliamentary career and that I should be very pleased that it was in the newspaper. I will never forget those words of encouragement, and he was absolutely right. It was a huge impost. The industry wanted it abolished and they were forever grateful that he took the step that he did. He was an exemplary fishing minister who worked closely with industry to deliver better outcomes for the sector and to reduce costs. It was a great privilege to work with him when he was fisheries minister. He was also very mindful of environmental sustainability. I thank him for the work that he did, particularly on the Patagonian toothfish, the fisheries and Macquarie Island. He realised the importance that commercial fishery had to play as well as making sure that there was environmental sustainability. In a press release at the time, when he was minister, he said: The arrangements will ensure that Australia obtains the maximum return from the fish resources in these waters, while guaranteeing that any long term fishery established in the area is sustainable. He worked constantly towards making sure that areas such as Macquarie Island were nominated for World Heritage listing and that fisheries were in tune with each other. Unlike many in this place-and I have had the experience of leaving not of my own choosing-he left parliament of his own choosing. He left the Senate in 2000, at a time that he decided it was best for him. In a testament to his talents and his expertise, the business sector was all too willing to snap him up. He served as the chairman of the energy and transport advisory sector of the CSIRO from 2002 to 2004. He was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 2005 for his work in the mining industry. In May 2012 Warwick took up the role of chairman of the board of Stanwell Corporation Ltd. His dedication to community service continued in his post-political life. He was appointed chair of the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital Foundation in 2010. I applaud him for fine work that he did as chair of that organisation. Our sympathies go to Warwick's family, whose loss exceeds ours. His passing is a great loss to our nation and to public life. Warwick was a devoted husband to Kathi, a loving father to his seven children, Carol, Martine, Helen, Sonia, Warwick, Justin and Rowan. Warwick was also a very proud and devoted grandfather. To the Parer family: thank you, so much, for sharing your husband, father and grandfather with us. We are all the richer for his presence in our life. some words in memory of Warwick Parer. He was in many respects an influence on me, from my time as president of the Queensland Young Liberal movement and my time as a Young Liberal in Queensland. He was a man whose shadow, in a political sense, I grew up in. He was a man who had very strong connections not only to the Gold Coast but, through the Liberal Party, to many of my contemporaries. In particular, I acknowledge the fact that Warwick Parer replaced my predecessor, Kathy Martin Sullivan, who in 1984 stood for the seat of Moncrieff, thereby creating the Senate vacancy that Senator Parer subsequently filled in 1985. I also note that upon his retirement in February 2000 his vacancy was filled by a good friend of mine, the current Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis. Warwick Parer, especially but not solely in his capacity as President of the Liberal Party, throughout the time of his very active involvement with and stewardship of the Liberal Party, was a person with whom I had the opportunity on many occasions to break bread and to discuss issues of the day, particularly, of course, political issues of the day. Warwick had a most magnificent holiday residence on the Gold Coast, in my electorate. It was a small place, the name of which escapes me but which I know is French, at Budds Beach, which is a favourite haunt of my wife, our family and mine. We would frequently find ourselves down there at a small cafe named Bumbles Cafe, at Budds Beach, and see Warwick tottering across the road to get his morning coffee, which he was partial to, whenever he and Kathi were staying on the Gold Coast. There were many occasions on which, by sheer coincidence, an opportunity arose for Warwick and me to discuss all manner of political issues and contemporary issues of the day at Bumbles Cafe. In many respects that for me is the focal point of my relationship with Warwick Parer, because although in a formal sense there was our relationship through the Liberal Party, it was his mentoring to a certain extent through those conversations-and there were many-at Budds Beach, on the Gold Coast, that helped to shape my view of the man and helped to deepen my understanding of him. He was in my estimation an erstwhile gentleman and a man of tremendous character and good humour. But he was a man who had a clear-eyed resolve when it came to what was needed for the Queensland Liberal Party. In many respects, Warwick Parer put in play and",226,Condolences
341,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (11:57): I rise to sayhelped to facilitate the Liberal Party merger with the National Party, which created the LNP. That in many respects helped to land a victory, through what was a period of much tumult around what was going to happen the contemporary Queensland Liberal Party. It helped to land the very significant win that was achieved by the LNP at the state election. I have a very good relationship with one of Warwick's seven children, Justin Parer. He was a contemporary of mine in the Queensland Young Liberals. He is a man who has gone on to leave an impression in business in Queensland, as did his father. Warwick Parer's contribution to the Gold Coast cannot be understated. He was a man who, through his time as a senator for Queensland, played an incredibly important role. I think he was born in Papua New Guinea. He attended Nudgee College. Those are great foundations. Some would worry about someone born in Papua New Guinea, but he is certainly someone who excelled throughout the time of his involvement in the Senate and in the Liberal Party. I want to acknowledge and honour Warwick Parer. He will remain a great man. Through his family, he has left his imprint not only on Queensland but also on Queensland politics. On a very personal level, to Kathi and his children I thank you for lending us Warwick Parer. Anyone who is involved in politics and has children, let alone seven children, recognises the incredible sacrifice made by family. For Warwick Parer to have achieved what he did, rising as a cabinet minister for resources and energy in the Howard government, and who was a senator from 1985 through until 2000, it really is in many respects the family that does the heavy lifting, with the frequent absences. As a father of two children I can only imagine the heavy lifting that Kathi had to do as a mother of seven children. To Kathi and the rest of Warwick's family, thank you for lending us Warwick Parer. His contribution was significant. He helped to shape me into the politician that I am today and he helped to shape generations of Young Liberals who mixed with Justin and also those who knew Warwick from his time as both a senator and as a president. I honour and acknowledge Warwick Parer and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to get to know him over the years. condolence motion to honour the life of Warwick Parer, a person I got to know in the political field here in Canberra. I knew of his reputation prior to my coming to Canberra, in 1990. He had already arrived here in 1985, as a senator. I got to know Warwick when he became a minister after John Howard won the 1996 election. He was the minister for resources and energy and I was the minister for veterans' affairs in that first Howard ministry. There were times when we would sit down together. I well recall that Warwick's father lost his life in 1942. Warwick was born in Papua New Guinea. There was the connection to his background, his birth right of having been born in Papua New Guinea and losing his father. In fact, his uncle, Damien Parer, was a very well known wartime correspondent and photographer with some photographs that will stand the test of time as they captured moments in history. I return to Warwick. As Minister for Resources and Energy, certainly well before what we might call the mining boom that we have seen recently, he brought to the portfolio experience in the coal industry. The great Bowen Basin in Queensland was one that he had a great deal to do with, in terms of some of the companies that invested there. He had first-hand knowledge of the industry and what would be good for the industry in terms of legislative areas that were a barrier to the export of coal. Thinking back to some of the barriers and some of the",229,Condolences
342,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa,"Deputy Speaker) (12:04): I rise to speak on theregulations that were imposed on the energy sector-in this case, the coal industry-you would think that it could not have happened and would not have been the case, but, in fact, it was. Warwick brought very particular knowledge to that portfolio of Energy and Resources. At that time, the Bowen Basin was well and truly in my constituency of Maranoa, so I could call on Warwick to share his knowledge and understanding of what would be a good way forward in some of the new tenements that were being developed, and he would know the pitfalls. He would always tell it to you straight. There was no nonsense about Warwick. He was honest to the core. His judgement was always unquestionable and I always respected his opinion. The other time that I really got to know him was when he was President of the Queensland Liberal Party in 2006 to 2008. At the time, I was President of the Queensland National Party. The situation was that the National Party had more seats in Queensland than the Liberal Party held in the state parliament. Year after year, there were agreements and disagreements between the two conservative parties. I said to Warwick, 'We've got to try to end this,' because we were trying to sort out who could run in a particular seat and whether there were more potential Liberal Party voters than National Party voters in areas. It was one of those ridiculous discussions, because at the end of the day we were talking about the same goal: winning government. I will never forget being in the seat of Bowman and talking about who might run in the state seat in the Bay area. It had previously been held by the National Party but had been lost. It was won by Peter Beattie of the Labor Party, and a number of seats in the south-east corner were held by the Labor Party-more than should have been, but that is because the two parties were always fighting each other. Warwick and I acknowledged that the business community had come to us and said, 'While you two fight each other, we are not going to back you. When you get the house in order, we are prepared to consider supporting you and being an advocate for common sense and also for the conservative cause in Queensland.' Having Warwick there was pivotal in establishing the LNP in Queensland. I have no doubt about that. We need to understand that political parties have long history. Members, senators and the general membership also have very long history. Sometimes they want to look further back than forward, but Warwick always wanted to look forward, as did I. We started the long process of bringing the two parties together, and we got them together. We had a stumble, but eventually it led to the formation of the LNP. The record stands itself today, both at a state level and here in Canberra. SoI say that, without Warwick Parer at that time, I really would have to question whether we would ever have got together in Queensland and whether we would have seen the numbers of conservative-held seats contributed from Queensland to this federal parliament or, indeed, Premier Campbell Newman's massive win in the last election at the state level. Without Warwick Parer, perhaps none of what has transpired since would have happened. We might still have been arguing amongst ourselves and deciding who should run in which seats. I think my two colleagues to my right here, the member for Brisbane and the member for Ryan, can attest to the difficulties that were there. When you are in politics it can be difficult, but I hope part of my nature and part of Warwick's experience is knowing how to nuance the two parties so we came together. Once Warwick left this place-and he did leave on his own terms, and that is something that everyone tries to do-it did not end his commitment to community or his service to the nation. He served on a number of organisations, including, in 2012, being appointed chairman of the board of the Stanwell Corporation, an energy company to which I know he would have brought great knowledge and expertise and which plays a fundamental part in electricity generation in Queensland. He was chair of the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital Foundation from 2010, so he was retired from public life but he still wanted to give something in a public sense. He did that right up to the day he sadly passed away. I say also to his wife, Kathi, and his seven children: Kathi, I know the great support that you gave Warwick throughout his life. On occasion we would meet-my own wife, Joan, and I and Warwick-and we would enjoy each other's company as wonderful friends, not necessarily political friends, although we were political friends, but it was all about the friendship that was always there. The hand of friendship was always extended from Warwick for people to come and see his family, as the member for Moncrieff said, down at their Budds Beach holiday home. SoI say to Kathi: thank you to your family for what you did to support Warwick and, of course, your children as they grew up. Thank you for giving Warwick to this parliament and for the contribution that he has made in public life. I say to you, Kathi, on behalf of my wife, Joan, that we are sincerely saddened by the passing of Warwick. To your children I say: we want you to accept our condolences and our deepest sympathy. Warwick, may you rest in peace. successful businessman, a senator, a minister and a proud Queenslander. However, the Hon. Warwick Parer was actually born in Papua New Guinea. Tragically, he passed away last Friday, leaving behind Kathi, an incredibly supportive wife-they really were a partnership in so many ways-their seven children and many grandchildren. Queensland will be the poorer for the loss of Warwick's guidance and vision. His strong leadership as chairman of the Stanwell Corporation over the past few years has been invaluable, and indeed he worked continually up to his tragic death last Friday. In addition to Warwick's distinguished career in public service, he also lent his business acumen and perspective to the field of innovation as a former chairman of the Energy and Transport Advisory Sector of the CSIRO. He was also chairman of the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital Foundation from 2010. While in Papua New Guinea, Warwick's father and family held many timber leases. Indeed, his father, Kevin, pioneered aviation up there with Bobby Gibbes, later of Gibbes Sepik Airways. His father tragically died while attempting to evacuate refugees from the Japanese in 1942 when he was shot down and killed. Warwick was educated at Nudgee College in Brisbane and completed a commerce degree at the University of Melbourne, and later went on to become the commercial manager of Utah Development Company. Warwick was a leader in negotiating contracts between Australian exporters and the emerging Japanese markets for coal from the Bowen Basin. Unlike many of my colleagues who knew Warwick through his political and parliamentary career, the first time. I got to meet Warwick was when he left Utah and formed a company called Queensland Energy with his colleagues Ken Foots and Peter Gilchrist. This was back in the late seventies. I was working for an IT company in the same building, and Warwick purchased a computer from us to set up their new business. Back in those days we had some",230,Condolences
343,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (12:13,"I rise in this place today to pay tribute to a great man: avery entertaining moments trying to work out how this computer operated. That was the first time. I got to meet Warwick and I got to know him and his family even better over the subsequent years. While he was in Melbourne he had Sir Robert Menzies as his local member, and this initially sparked Warwick's interest in politics. Back in Queensland, faced with Minister Connor's approaches to resources investment, he became very active in the Liberal Party and served on many political committees. Warwick was a pioneer, being the first to properly introduce the Liberal Party to the mining sector in Queensland. His bold efforts with Winchester South coalmine will always be remembered. Warwick was one of the relatively few senior Queensland businessmen actually involved in the Liberal Party at the time and shaped its mining and resources policy in the 1970s and 1980s. Warwick was said to have brought a depth of understanding to the resources portfolio that nobody else in the parliament could match. Warwick entered the Senate to fill the vacancy created when Kathy Martin resigned from the Senate in November 1984 to contest the division of Moncrieff at the 1984 election. There was controversy at the time, when the then Queensland Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, was tempted to knock back his nomination, not just because it represented another opportunity to give the Liberals a bit of a kick at the time. Among Warwick's peers in the mining industry, he never disguised his unease at the political patronage which often seemed to determine the granting of mining leases in Queensland. Like most mining men at the time, he was also critical of the state government's charges on a depressed industry and the continued 'open arms' policy of the government at the time towards foreign investment and its then grip on Australian resources. Back then he gave an interview to a local journalist, saying: 'Foreign ownership is like a constant haemorrhage of Australian profits. We now have our own expertise and we should be taking advantage of it.' Warwick served in the first Howard ministry as Minister for Resources and Energy from March 1996 until 21 October 1998. I remember he regularly introduced himself at events emphasising that he was the Minister 'for' Resources and Energy, not the 'minister against resources and energy'-which he thought some predecessors in previous governments had been. While he was not reappointed to the ministry after the 1998 election, Warwick continued in the Senate until his retirement in February 2000, when our now Attorney General, Senator George Brandis, was chosen to fill his vacancy. Shortly after resigning from the Senate, Warwick was appointed a director of several coal companies. He led the Queensland Liberal Party from 2005 to 2008, working, as we heard, with our colleague the member for Maranoa as party president of the National Party to prepare for the amalgamation of the LNP. He not only had the strong backing of John Howard but also was highly respected by the Queensland members of the Liberal Party. I refer to a speech that former Senator Hill-a fellow senator in this place and a colleague of ours-made at the time of Senator Parer's retirement from the Senate. He commented that Warwick had had a distinguished career in the mining industry before his contribution to politics. He said: … he brought to us a great deal of practical experience in that industry which balanced the many theorists that we have in this place. I thought that was a fitting tribute, given the very practical and knowledgeable contribution that Warwick made not only as minister but to our parliament. Warwick's many years of public service and long contribution to the people of Queensland will always be remembered. I join with my colleagues in expressing our sympathy to Kathi and the Parer family. Regional Development) (12:20): I am pleased to join with colleagues from both sides of the chamber to recognise the life of Warwick Parer. I had the privilege of knowing Warwick during his service as a senator and a minister in the Howard government, and he quickly earned my respect and, I know, the respect of all of his colleagues. He was determined. He was honourable in the true sense of the word. He was an achiever. He was a man who had a vision for Australia, a particular passion for the mining industry and the resource sector, and he was a man who made a real difference in Australia. Like most Queenslanders, Warwick was parochial, a fierce advocate for his state, and an Australian dedicated to development and progress. He passed just a few weeks short of his 78th birthday, having been born in New Guinea in 1936. He was a nephew of Australia's renowned Second World War photographer Damien Parer. The devastation of war was sheeted home to Warwick at a tender age when he lost his father in New Guinea in 1942 following the result of a Japanese attack on his aircraft as he prepared to take off from the airstrip at Salamaua. Warwick was educated in Brisbane and at the University of Melbourne, where he gained a Bachelor of Commerce. He developed a keen and deep knowledge, over decades, of the mining and energy industries that are so central to the development of his state of Queensland and our nation. Warwick founded the non-destructive testing laboratories, a facility widely used for materials testing in engineering, aeronautics and medicine, in 1962. He had a distinguished career in the private sector before taking on public office. He became commercial manager and assistant secretary of the Utah Development Company in 1973 and chairman of the Australian coal exporters in 1976. He pioneered the development of the Bowen Basin coalfields for the Japanese market, a development which helped to transform the state of Queensland and enable it to develop the kinds of infrastructure and services that have held the state proud in subsequent decades. Few people have entered parliament with the depth of Warwick's understanding of his industry and the Australian national interest at stake in mining and energy. He knew it well. He appreciated its capacity to transform Australia and had played an active role in bringing this industry to fruition. His service as Minister for Resources and Energy between March 1996 and October 1998 reflected his deep understanding. The portfolio suited his skills and experience perfectly. He was especially proud, as resources minister, of his abolition of export controls on minerals. Those controls had dated back to the Whitlam years. Warwick would not have been out of place in today's government, cutting a swathe through the red tape hampering national prosperity. He turned the first sod for the Australian Geological Survey Organisation's building, and he also chaired the first meeting of APEC ministers in Sydney. As resources minister, his tasks were about more than mining and energy. He played a key role in preserving and protecting the Patagonian toothfish. As the minister for natural",232,Condolences
344,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure andresources, he led the charge for the government to move in the Australian Navy to enforce Australian fishing regulations and arrest a number of ships that were fishing illegally in Australia's Antarctic waters. There is also the famous occasion when Warwick took on the Japanese under the bluefin tuna convention. He believed the Japanese to be unreasonable in demanding a take under what he thought was a ruse of science, putting ocean tuna stocks at risk. Despite all of the departmental and other advice of the time advocating compromise, Warwick declared, 'No, this is wrong in principle'. His strident approach was to effectively ban the Japanese take. While controversial at the time, his stance was later vindicated through the courts, forcing a change in tack from the Japanese towards compromise. These are examples symbolic of the man: strong when he needed to be and pragmatic in dealing with problems fairly and with a strong sense of natural justice. After his retirement in 2000, Warwick continued to contribute very generously to Australian public life. As others have mentioned, he served as President of the Queensland Liberal Party between 2006 and 2008, and was Chair of the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital Foundation from 2012. Warwick was a longtime champion of the merger of the Queensland National and Liberal parties, determined to see it through for over a decade-and the member for Maranoa spoke previously about his role in one of the first attempts to bring the parties together. He believed in that cause and was supportive as the opportunities arose later for that merger to be realised. I would catch up with Warwick regularly. He was a regular attendee at my annual Brisbane Conservative Club post budget breakfast addresses. He still attended LNP conferences regularly and campaign launches and other important party events but also he was still regarded very highly in mining industry circles not only for his contribution as a practitioner in the industry but also as a minister who understood and cared about the industry and wanted to see it grow and prosper. He remained a true champion of conservative politics, Queensland's progress and national growth throughout his life. On a personal note, Warwick's chief of staff during the time when he was a minister was David Whitrow, and David has been my chief of staff now for around a decade. David also has fond memories of working with Warwick, whom he admired as a boss and as a partner in endeavouring to deliver reform in the mining sector. Australian industry, the mining sector in particular, is much better and stronger because of the role played by Warwick Parer and his lifetime of service to the industry. Our thoughts are with his wife Kathi, their seven children and, I understand, 26 grandchildren, so it is a very large family-all of whom will grieve his loss. Those of us who shared the parliament with him also grieve his loss and recognise his contribution as a senator, in particular, to Australian industry and commerce. I salute a great Australian and may he rest in peace. at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places.
