Department of Immigration, Local Government and Historically Australia has suffered, or perhaps Ethnic Affairs enjoyed, a particularly large foreign debt to GDP Department of Administrative Services ratio. Those who express concern today about the size of that debt would have considered our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade circumstances prior to 1950 and back into the Department of Employment, Education and Training nineteenth century to have been a tragedy. The Department of Social Security statistics available show that between 1900 and Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, 1950 the debt to GDP ratio did not fall below Tourism and Territories 20 per cent and exceeded 50 per cent for 45 of Department of Community Services and Health, Dethose 50 years.
