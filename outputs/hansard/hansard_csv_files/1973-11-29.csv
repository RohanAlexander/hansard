of undersigned citizens of Aus. tralia respectfully showeth: That the proposed 'free' national health scheme is not free at all and will cost many citizens more, particularly single people and working wives. That the proposed scheme is in fact a plan for nationalisation of health services which will lead to impersonalised and mediocre standards of medical care, the creation of a huge new bureaucracy, and will limit the citizen's freedom of choice. That the present health scheme can be amended to overcome existing deficiencies, and that the proposed scheme is totally unnecessary. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take no measures to interfere with the basic principles of the existing health scheme which functions efficiently and economically. And your petitioners, as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Barnard, Mr Adermann, Mr Drory, son. Petitions received. National Health Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That they oppose the Australian Health Insurance Program and any National Health Scheme. That they wish to retain the right to choose their own medical care by selecting a General Practitioner, Specialist or any other medical classification of their own choice under the present conditions in private consulting rooms and also the right to choose an intermediate ward or private hospital of their own choice. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take no measure to interfere with the existing health scheme. And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Bonnett, Mr Donald Cameron, Mr and Mr Eric Robinson. Petitions received. Television To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the undersigned men and women of Australia believe in a Christian way of life; and that no democracy can thrive unless its citizens are responsible and law abiding. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the members in Parliament assembled will see that the powerful communicator, television, is used to build into the nation those qualities of character which make a democracy work-integrity , teamwork and a sense of purpose by serving, and that television be used to bring faith in God to the heart of the family, and national life. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Stewart, Mr James and Mr Ruddock. Petitions received. Education To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. Your petitioners believe in the principle that every Australian child, irrespective of the school he attends, is entitled to economic support for his hasic educational needs from the funds placed at the disposal of the Australian Government through taxation. Further, they believe that this economic support should be in the form of per capita grants which are directly related to the cost of educating an Austrahan child in a government school. 2. Your petitioners believe that in addition to this basic per capita grant additional assistance should be provided in cases of educational disadvantage, but they believe that the appropriate instruments for reducing economic inequalities are taxation and social welfare systems which deal with individuals and families and not with schools. 3. The reduction of the existing per capita grants will impose great hardships on many parents who have chosen, at considerable personal sacrifice, to send their sons and daughters to independent schools. Indeed curtailment of the said grants will create divisions in the community. 4. Some independent schools of high educational standards will be forced to close with the consequences that children attending those schools will have to attend government schools already over-taxed and under-staffed. 5. Some independent schools have been encouraged to lower standards in order that their parents may continue to receive per capita grants.",10,Setup

The proposed legislation will penalise parents who try to exercise this choice, be prejudiced further by escalating building and discourage them from making a vital financial contribution to Australian education over and above what they contribute through taxation. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should acknowledge the right of every Australian child to equal per capita grants of government money spent on education. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr JJarmam. Petition received.

36,Mr Crean,"Firstly, the AIDC does not",21,Australian Industry Development Corporation
37,Mr Sinclair,"No, but you are interested,hope everybody is. The AIDC was set up by an Act passed by the previous Government. As my colleague, the Minister for Overseas Trade, fully indicated yesterday, the AIDC has certain problems now because it was sought to amend the Act and to extend the Corporation's powers quite widely, and the enabling Bill passed through this House but is held up in another place. I understand that it has now been referred to a committee for investigation. As the Minister indicated yesterday, quite a number of projects have been entered into involving the use of the available funds, and in terms of the present funds and future commitments it requires more finance to enable it to expand. I suggest that the honourable member read in detail in yesterday's Hansard the ful] answer the Minister gave to the question yesterday. to the Minister for External Territories. Following his recent visit to Christmas Island, is the Minister concerned about the wages and working conditions of Asian workers employed by the British Phosphate Commission? Does he see a conflict between the Commission's charter to extract phosphate at the lowest possible cost and the provision of wage justice to workers in an Australian territory? Phosphate Commission operates on the basis that phosphate should be extracted at the lowest possible cost. On my visit to Christmas Island recendy I was concerned to find that Christmas Island was being run very much as a company town. The workers are principally from Malaysia and Singapore and, although, as an inducement, the wages are better than those paid in Malaysia and Singapore, they are well below Australian awards. Following my visit to Christmas IslandI asked for a review not only of wages and conditions but also of environmental matters related to mining and the protection of wildlife. I have also had a government statistician review the cost of living index for Christmas Island on the basis on which the wages are determined. Anomalies have been found in the cost of living index used by the Phosphate Commission. These will be rectified and I hope arrangements will be made before Christmas for an increase in wages paid on Christmas Island in accordance with the cost of living adjustments. Prime Minister and I refer to the honourable gentleman's observations yesterday concerning China. Does he agree with me that it is the essence of futility to imagine that you can temper or moderate the attitude of a man by pretending that he does not exist and, a fortiori, that the attitude and politics of a country can ever be moderated by pretending that it does not exist? Does the honourable gentleman accept that as a sound principle in the conduct of international affairs? If he does, will he ensure that his Government gives every encouragement to the councils of the world to accept that principle? word in the first sentence of the question. What was the country? have, within the limits of its resources, diplomatic relations with all countries, irrespective of their ideology. It is essential in the view of the Government, and it was essential in the view of preceding governments, that there should be diplomatic relations between Australia and China. This has been the situation since those relations were established, I would think, more than 30 years ago by an earlier Labor government. There has been no dispute between the political parties in the Australian Parliament that there ought to be recognition by the Australian Government of a government of China. Except for an interval between 1949 or 1950 and 1966, when there was an ambassador from the Republic of China in Australia but not an ambassado r from Australia in Taipeh, the capital of tl Republic of China, there has been diplomatic representation by each country. That has been the position for 30 years, except for that gap. The dispute between the political parties in the Australian Parliament has been about which was the government of China. There were 2 rival governments. Our predecessors look the attitude, from 1949 to the end of ineir period in office, that they should recognise as the government of China the government headed by Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek and resident in Taipeh, the capital of the province of Taiwan.

44,Mr Whitlam,"The Government seeks toattitude since 1955I myself had expressed the attitude since 1954-that Australia should recognise the government in Peking as the government of China, lt has not been possible for any country to have diplomatic relations with or to extend recognition to both the government in Taipeh and the government in Peking. Every other government in the world has had to make a choice as to which of those rival governments it would recognise as the government of China. Both rival governments asserted that their writ ran or should run over the whole of China. Both rival governments asserted, and still assert, that Taiwan is a province of one country-China. Both also have asserted that Tibet is part of one country-China. There are some minor border differences between them concerning Mongolia, North Vietnam or some other countries, but on matters such as Taiwan and Tibet and their position in the country of China there has never been any dispute between the 2 rival governments. The dispute between the political parties in the Australian Parliament, of course, took practical effect just before Christmas last year gration Ministers in Adelaide just recently, it when the present Government changed its recognition from Taipeh to Peking and withdrew its representative from Taipeh and sent one to Peking. Whatever other countries may think or whatever people in Australia or successive governments in Australia may think about the geographical or political realitities of the situation, the fact is that one can have recognition of a government of China or have diplomatic relations with a government of China only on the basis of there being one government of China. Every country has to make a choice. The Australian Government had told the people, and for years past as leader of the Australian Labor Party at the last 2 House of Representatives elections I made it quite plain, that we would change our diplomatic representation from Taipeh to Peking. That being so, we promptly carried out what we had always told the public we would do, what the rest of the world knew we would do, and we took the earliest opportunity of telling the countries most closely associated with us that we would do it. Immigration confirm that the Melbourne education task force has advised him that only 20 per cent of Melbourne's non-English speaking migrant children are receiving adequate educational opportunities? Would these opportunities be improved substantially by the grants for disadvantaged schools recommended in the report of the Interim Committee of the Australian Schools Commission? Does the Minister anticipate that serious harm will be done to the migration program and to the capacity of migrant children to take advantage of the opportunities open to them in Australia if the Government is forced to divert to schools which are already highly privileged, the funds which were to have made up the Karmel Committee grants? so far reported to me on migrant matters in all the States has emphasised that the first priority is to correct some of the grave deficiencies in migrant education. The survey to which the honourable member has referred was jointly sponsored by the Australian Government and the Victorian Government and referred to inner city schools, particularly in Melbourne. So the need has been validated by both governments. At the meeting of Immiwas unanimously accepted that a new thrust and a new effort would have to be made to correct some of the serious deficiencies in migrant education. The situation is that classes are being held in some instances in shower recesses. In one Queensland school the language class for migrant children is held in a cellar, and there is a series of desks made out of trestle tables. The need is urgent. There is no doubt that there is a need to implement urgently the recommendations of the Interim Comittee of the Australian Schools Commission, and any delay in bringing about these desirable improvements will bring widespread and deep resentment and, I think, would be opposed by all of the State Ministers who also are concerned to see improvements in this direction.

Is it a fact that even Conservative members of the British House of Commons find that the business sector in the United Kingdom feels very emotional about the role of even a tory government and even feels threatened from time to time by tliat government? Is it a fact that the present feeling in the Australian private business sector that communications are not what they ought to be with the Australian Labor Government falls into the same emotional category? Is it a fact also that the Australian Labor Government has gone far further than its predecessors in setting up regular means of consultation between industry and government, including industry panels? What is the latest development with regard to industry panels? first 2 questions are yes. If one reads the newspaper reports from Britain one sees the same degree of criticism levelled at government, coming even from business leaders and directed towards a conservative government, as one sometimes finds it in this country. A report which went to the then Minister for Trade and Industry last year made the same point. This Government has taken many important steps to institutionalise the solution PRG and is his Government going to recogto the need for close consultation between business and government. Before the change of government my predecessor began the process of setting up industry panels. Under the Liberal-Country Party Government of last year and previous years there was no such system. They occasionally used panels on an ad hoc basis to solve some problem as it arose but there was Uttle, regular, institutionalised structural system of consultation. The system of industry panels is well under way. About eight have been established. They meet regularly. They represent employer, employee and consumer groups. They are chaired by senior officers of the Department of Secondary Industry-usuall y the Secretary of that Department. Following every meeting a report is made to the Minister for Secondary Industry so that government knows what that particular industry is thinking and so that in the same way that particular industry is fully aware of what government is thinking. A close relationship is being established. I should also add that in this countryI cannot comment on the situation in the United Kingdoma lot is achieved by the good work done by local members of this House and presumably by the Senate. They frequently bring leaders of industry into contact with the Government through the appropriate Minister. A lot of good work is done there. In recent months I have been talking about the advantages that might be gained from having an industries council for Australia, which would include not only State Ministers with appropriate responsibilities but also Australian Government Ministers with appropriate responsibilities. It would also include leaders of industry So something of a cultural kind can be created in Australia to take the process still further. But we have made very significant progress in the first year of a Labor Government. aware that some countries have recognised the PRC-Provisiona l Revolutionary Government -as being a legitimate government within South Vietnam?

It was in fact discussed at the Federal Conference of the Australian Labor Party last July. I expressed my views that in the circumstances then obtaining it would be inappropriate to recognise the PRG. I am not aware of any change in circumstances since that time which would persuade me otherwise. I am not aware that my colleague the Minister for Secondary Industry has expressed a view on this matter. He has not discussed it with me. I have not discussed it with the Foreign Minister.

These experiments, at the Bomana Prison Farm piggery, use pig manure to produce methane gas for boiling water, providing light and power, operating a gas refrigerator and powering a 6cylinder combustion engine? I understand that a Queensland farmer also has produced fuel in this way. It is estimated that 30 pigs can produce sufficient methane gas to provide daily cooking, lighting and refrigeration needs for a family of six. Have these developments been investigated to ascertain whether sewage treatment plants in Australian towns and cities could be adapted as fuel producers? and on a visit to Papua New GuineaI saw the farms to which the honourable senator has referred. The waste digestion process is very well known. In fact it has been used in certain towns in Australia. It has been estimated that about one per cent of our total energy requirements could be provided by the processing of human waste. The difficulty at the moment under present economic conditions is that it does not provide an economic way of producing energy. I think all of us have to look at this process in terms of the energy crisis and also in terms of getting rid of pollution. It seems to me, with the fuel crisis exacerbating, that this form of waste digestion providing methane gas could be a goer much sooner than most people think. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has a special program on sewage treatment. Following representations by the honourable member for Robertson we are looking, in conjunction with the Cities Commission, at a special program in the Gosford-Wyong area. It is a field in which the CSIRO is doing an increased amount of research. It can provide a form of energy which can be useful, particularly for household consumption, and also is a way of overcoming one of our great problems, which is the disposal of human waste. the Treasurer in the absence of the Minister for Overseas Trade and it concerns the Australian Industry Development Corporation. No doubt the Treasurer's colleague has kept the Treasurer very closely informed in recent developments concerning that Corporation. Is 16759/73-R[ 146] it a fact that the Australian Industry Development Corporation's proposed investment in the Redcliffs project is approximately 845m? What amount of funds can the AIDC borrow on its present capital of S50m? What is its full potential capacity to borrow under the Act? To what extent is that capacity being utilised at present? Having regard to the answers to these questions which the Treasurer no doubt will put on the record, will he not agree that his colleague has grossly misled this House by alleging that the AIDC has insufficient funds to enable it to expand and also by alleging that the Opposition's attitude to the new legislation is jeopardising the Redcliffs project? matter is not directly my ministerial concern. However, the AIDC, as presently constituted, was set up by an Act passed when the Opposition Parties were the Government for this country. The Act gave limited powers to the AIDC to borrow. In fact the Act states that the AIDC should seek to borrow principally overseas. At the moment the Australian Government, in view of the buoyancy of our overseas funds, sees no need to borrow overseas. We are endeavouring to widen the charter of the AIDC so that it can operate on the capital market internally. The Bill, at the moment, is meeting with some difficulty in being passed into law. My understanding is that existing funds of the AIDC are largely committed already to certain undertakings of a large kind, one of which is the Redcliffs project. Surely these days we ought not to be thinking of the AIDC in terms of an investment fund of $50m, rather we should be thinking in terms of $500m. That is the kind of capital development that this country requires and the sort of thing that is being talked about in the mineralfields,the gas fields and so on where in the ultimate the capital outlay is of a magnitude of billions of dollars. The majority of the capital funds available in Australia come from internal sources, but in our view they are not as properly mobilised as they should be and we see the AIDC as an agency to do that job better. the Prime Minister been drawn to the fact that higher fees will be charged by Catholic systemic schools in the new school year?

61,Mr Oldmeadow,"Has the attention ofincreases to a minimum in the belief that substantially increased Australian Government assistance would be available to them in the new school year? Does the Prime Minister anticipate alarm among Catholic education authorities at the prospect that the Government will be held back from providing the assistance, and will he advise these authorities that the funds earmarked for them are likely to be paid instead to the Melbourne Grammar School and other similarly deprived schools under existing statutory obligations? be premature to advise the authorities that they might receive no more than they were receiving this scholastic year under last year's legislation. I have no doubt that they would be concerned to read the proposals which have been made by Opposition parries to continue those payments instead of replacing them by the larger payments recommended by the Karmel Committee 6 months ago. I do not assume that the Karmel Committee's recommendations embodied in legislation which this House has passed and which is now before the Senate will not in fact be enacted. schools even if there is not category A conduct by the right honourable gentleman from the other side who interjects. I would point out that last year, when our predecessors in office introduced the States Grants (Schools) Bill to cover a period of 5 years thereafter and to provide by way of grants the non-government schools with a percentage of the cost of conducting state schools, the then Opposition said, that, because plans would be being made for the 1973 year it would not oppose those grants under that legislation. We made it plain however, that for 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977 we thought that the grants which the Commonwealth should make for non-government schools as well as government schools should be on the basis of needs. I was the Minister for Education and Science at the time and on 12 December last I asked Professor Karmel to prepare course. been. The last Minister for Education and Science was the best. I will happily concede that the present Minister for Education is still better. The Karmel Committee very promptly was commissioned 10 days after the last election to make recommendations for grants by the Commonwealth to non-government schools, on the basis of need, and also to government schools. The report was made 6 months ago and it was a unanimous report. Members of the Committee were associated with every type of school in Australia. The Karmel Committee members of which were drawn from every school system in Australia, unanimously recommended 6 months ago that the grants which were provided in last year's legislation for Catholic schools, among others, should be replaced in 1974 and 1975 by grants which it recommended. Legislation fulfilling those recommendations with respect to those Catholic schools has gone through this House. I would hope that it would go through the Senate. As I said earlier, there is a very clear choice here. It was put to a vote in this House a couple of days ago. The choice is between a continuation of last year's legislation and the substitution of this year's legislation. Much more money is being made available in this year's legislation and it is being made available on the basis of need. It is well to recollect that while Opposition leaders are so solicitous of the category A schools they did not venture to put to the vote a proposition which would have benefited those schools. It would have been possible to do so under that legislation. They did not do so in this House. It is significant that the pupils about whom I was asked a question earlier do not go to category A schools. How many migrant children go to category A schools? How many children from disadvantaged localities or families go to category A schools? Yet, under the legislation last year, which the States Grants {Schools) Bill would replace but which members of the Opposition wish to retain, there would be more money for category A schools every year, based on the increased expenditure in State government schools. That is, the schools which do not need anything, according to the Karmel Committee report-thos e schools which the Karmel Committee recommends already have more resources than the rest of Australia's schools will have by 1979-if the old legislation continues are to get still more. The Karmel Committee very rightly said that that could not be justified.",26,School Fees

83,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) (10.59),"The important point to remember about our plague locusts is what is known as the phase change. In the solitary phase these insects do not breed very extensively, but when their concentration gets to a certain level a population explosion occurs and the solitary locust undergoes morphological and other changes and becomes the plague locust operating in bands and behaving in quite a different way. This apparently is a behaviour common to all related locusts in various parts of the world. This phase change, which was not recognised by scientists, I think, until as late as 1920 or thereabouts, is the specific thing which makes the locust so dangerous. As honourable members know the locust breeds in this manner: The eggs are laid, the hoppers emerge and then they become winged. It is only in the gregarious state after the phase change that they form the locust bands. The cycle from egg laying to egg laying can be as short as 10 weeks, but it can be as long as 6 months or even 9 months, depending upon the weather. Onr locust migrates.

It is not an insect locust; it is a human before any big plague develops. The plague is not inevitable, but it is highly likely. It depends on the weather. The chief victim would be the cotton in the Narrabri-Wee Waa area. Already the locusts are eating the cotton in the St George area in Queensland. Also threatened would be the fruit and vegetables in the Riverina and all coarse grains and vegetable crops which might be out at the time. We need more resources to combat the locusts. The cotton crop alone, which could be wiped out entirely, would be worth $25m or $30m in the Wee Waa area. I emphasise to the House that, although the danger is not inevitable, the potential danger exists at the moment and we should be doing much more about it. More resources are needed. Control cannot be exercised locally. We need to know more about what is happening.

The locusts mentioned by the honourable member for Mackellar clean out pastures, but the locusts to which I want to refer clean out pockets, particularly the pockets of decent Australian shareholders who invest in companies which they believe to be companies of integrity but which turn out to be companies of ill repute. In his concluding remarks the honourable member for Mackellar urged the necessity for more legislative resources to be made available to combat the type of locusts to which he referred. During my remarks I want to put emphasis on the fact that we need more legislative resouces, implemented by this Parliament, to combat the 2legged or human locusts that have lowered the name of Australian companies throughout our land and overseas. The matter I desire to raise today is in furtherance of my remarks relating to dishonest companies formed by the Alexander Barton group which has clipped the Australian shareholders of some $21m and which the Liberal Government of New South Wales appear to condone. 1 ask: What has Alexander Barton got on the New South Wales Liberal Government? If no action is taken soon by that Government the answer in my mind will be clear. It will be that it was there for the Askin.

Oilmin NL, as was pointed out by the writer of the letter, was formerly Exoil NL. The formation of Exoil was perpetrated in 1962 by Australia's wealthiest Premier, none other than Joh Bjelke-Petersen, the Premier of Queensland. Maranoa may regret he has said that. It has gone down on the record. If one looks at the 'Australian' of 17 September 1973 one will find certain facts. The Petersen family has obtained, through another private company, around 1.8 per cent of the shares in Oilmin, formerly Exoil. The private company is Artesian Basin Oil Co.

89,In 1959 Hy Mr Bjelke,"Petersen, the PremierI .believe that, because Australia has a bad record in the eyes of the world for allowing shady or crooked companies to exist in this country, the time is long overdue for action to be taken. Canada now has tight company laws. In Canada all companies have to prove to their shareholders and to the Government how they spend the shareholders' money. Canadian based companies may function successfully in the United Kingdom and in Ireland. People invest in them knowing that they are rigidly controlled. It is time that the Australian Government implemented rigid controls and uniform company laws. I hope that my Government will do this early next year and will strive to restore in the eyes of the world some respect for Australia's name. that. Barton reminds me that my Government has promised to bring in such measures. I hope that this will have the backing of every member of this House, because of the disgusting scandals that arise from time to time in respect of Australia's crooked companies. In the short time remaining to me in this debate I would like to quote from the annual report of Oilmin. On the last page it says: The firm of Spry Walker& Co., of which Mr L. reasons: Firstly, the number of locusts in W. Doggett is a member, has received professional Australia at present in 1973 is higher than at fees for work done for the company during the year.

Before doing so I would like to refer, contrary to the previous honourable member's views on the subject, to the book of Exodus in the Bible. In Exodus locusts were referred to as the eighth plague visited on the people. This was due to the misdoings of their Pharaoh. I do not know whether honourable members would like to strike an analogy in terms of the Australian Pharaoh of the moment, or whether this pestilence should be removed. I think it would be quite easy to think of half a dozen plagues on the people. I think of, firstly, inflation, secondly, the broken promises that children should have per capita education grants; thirdly, the promises to the wine industry which, in the view of the Premier of South Australia have been broken; fourthly, the wrecking of the defence structure of Australia; fifthly, the wrecking of the mineral industry and the petroleum exploration industry. Sixthly, one could even go so far as to talk of pensioners being taxed and chiselled, I shall leave the seventh plague as a blank because one would hope that the pestilence might be removed shortly. I should like personally to deal with the eighth plague-locust s -whic h I hope will not develop. I back up what was said by the honourable member for Mackellar for the following enough work has been done on matters such as course, is largely a matter of sprays. Let us have a look at the problem of sprays, because could occur if locust populations build up and if weather conditions turn out to be optimum Firstly, DDT evidently is not of much use",31,Grievance Debate

92,Mr Speaker,Order! The honourable this has a great deal of relevance to what,32,Grievance Debate
93,Mr Gules (Angas) (11.19),"I wish to for that buildup.Secondly, malathion, which honourable members will recall was mentioned recently in a debate on wheat storage, has the capacity to build insects, such as weavils and probably has a limited future use. However, it can be used at the moment at a cost of about 13c for an acre's coverage, but it is in very short supply. In fact, it is virtually unobtainable. Thirdly, there is lindane which, in my State, is being purchased at present for, I think, $4 a gallon and distributed to farmers for their own use at $2 a gallon. Lindane is technically the third best spray against locusts, but I believe that no more of it is available. We now come to Fenitrathion which technically is the best of the sprays against locusts -is that an autumn migration would, I am I think that it is marginally more expensive than the other sprays, but no more of it will be available until May 1975 because the only plant in the world where this chemical has been manufactured recently is in Japan, and last month the factory blew up. So, at a time of maximum buildup of locusts in Australia, a total situation of non-supply-to use a generalised term-of the 3 major sprays applies right across the board. It is for this reason that I have pleasure in congratulating the honourable member for Mackellar for bringing these facts to the notice of the House. Many of my colleagues on this side of the House represent agricultural areas which could-and I stress the word 'could be threatened by locusts. Perhaps this is flying a kite in a way, but I think that it is part of our job as members of Parliament to point to dangers when they exist. AH I can do is bring the matter to the notice of the Government today and point to the situation as it exists. In South Australia recently there has been a steep increase in locust numbers due, strangely enough, to a change in wind direction to the northeast. In fact, because of this we have been copping-if that is the right word-grasshoppe r flyers from central New South Wales. This is the directiona rather unusual direction-fro m which they have been coming. So the general picture is ithat due to this unusual wind direction, the grasshoppers, instead of immediately threatening the breeding areas of south-west Queensland and north-central New South Wales-perhap s they are threatening those areas as well-ar e presently building up numbers in the Mallee and Nildottee River areas in my own electorate. Fortunately, the locusts eat, and therefore breed, in arid areas. They like creek beds and feeding on barrel medic, burr medic, danthonia up resistant strains in the and other annual grasses in those areas. As the honourable member for Mackellar has said, they swarm and fly habitually perhaps 250 miles, on average, during their lifetime, and may be, if they breed because of cold fronts and frosts, they will fly 2 spans of 250 miles from their point of breeding. At present the swarms in South Australia are not dense, though spraying is being carried out by the South Australian Department of Agriculture in the Nildottee area because of the danger to vegetables presently growing there. The real danger-gettin g into the hypothetical area told, be a prelude to a move into the lower pastoral and mid-northern areas of South Australia. If there were to be a hot spring and buildups of locusts due to summer rainfalls-heav y January-February rains in South Australia-the danger of a very large locust population buildup would be real indeed. However, a series of generations of locusts probably would be necessary, at any rate in South Australia, to build up the density of the swarms and the area covered by swarms both of grasshoppers and flyers. Finally, I think that we have to be very careful how we deal with this problem. Locusts, traditionally, have been a problem after plenty-the pestilence visited on the people. They are the oldest pests knownI suppose other than human ones. It is most important that the Government should look in future to a much heavier funding for biological and physical control while the locusts are on the ground and not in the air, and further, for plotting their breeding areas. I back up what was said by the honourable member for Mackellar when I say that I do not believe that enough work has been done on research into breeding grounds as a prerequisite to proper control. Much of the problem boils down to funding and on the insistence of members of Parliament like ourselves to try to make the Government, at every possible opportunity, push more funds into overcoming an age old pestilence. I want to change the subject that has been raised by previous speakers on the Opposition side and discuss the attitude of the Opposition to matters of economic policy, and particularly the practice of Opposition spokesmen of continually berating this Government's",32,Grievance Debate
94,Mr Willis (Gellibrand) (11.29>,"Todayeconomic policies and contrasting them with the supposed 'soundness', to use their word, of the economic policies which they followed when in office and which they currently advocate. To give some examples, earlier this week the right honourable member for previous Government's economic policies, described them as: 'Sound, progressive, economic andfinancialpolicies and sound economic management'. In his Budget speech earlier this year, the Leader of the Opposidon ( Mr Snedden) said: The choice the Australian people have to make is between the economic irresponsibility of the Government and the sound economic management we offer. An objective analysis of the previous Government's economic policies and those postulated now by the Opposition shows those policies to be anything but sound. At some other time. I shall expose the absurdity of the Opposition's current economic policies but today 1 want to demonstrate that in its last few years of office the previous Government was utterly irresponsible--to use another of its favourite words-and left this Government a legacy of grossly excessive liquidity in the economy which accounts for both the present level of inflation and the tight money policy that this Government has had no option but to adopt. The irony of it is that the Opposition now berates the Government for the existence of conditions which are directly attributable to its own reckless disregard for proper economic management during its last few years of office. The fact is that over the past few years the world's largest economy had been transmitted rate of inflation in Australia rose markedly.

Then it rose to 4.8 per by economists overseas and in Australia. cent in 1970-71 and 6.6 per cent in 1971-72. In 1972-73 it was held somewhat and referred to various notable overseas econodropped to 6 per cent.

The guished American economist who came to Opposition ignored the fact that inflation had Australia a couple of months ago, Professor spurted upwards in most other countries in Michael Parkin of the University of Manthe world and denied that international facchester and currently a research economist tors were in any way an important reason for that upsurge in Australia's rate of inflation. The previous Government sought to overcome inflation by appearing before the Arbitration Commission in case after case to oppose wage rises and also by introducing tough budgetary measures such as we saw in 1971, which led to a dramatic increase in the number of persons unemployed. In August 1971 the number of persons registered as unemployed was 76,000, seasonally adjusted, but in August 1972, only one year later, the figure had shot up to an unprecedented 120,000. Economic growth also suffered as a result of the previous Government's measures. Although the former Government did succeed in cutting back inflation somewhat by its measures, which are quite unacceptable to the present Government, it was at the same time sowing the seeds of much greater inflation in the near future. This stemmed from the former Government's utter refusal or inability to see that much of Australia's recent inflation was imported and that in those circumstances it was utterly absurd not to revalue the ourrency, particularly as our international reserves were large and growing rapidly. The theory of imported inflation is one which was first postulated 2 years ago by Professor Harry Johnson of international fame. Professor Johnson maintained that the increase in world inflation during the late 1960s was due directly to the substantial increase in inflation in the United States of America which in turn was due to that country's deficit financing of the Vietnam war. The resultant upsurge of inflation in the In a speech in this House on 16 May last I",33,Grievance Debate
95,"Lowe ( Mr Mcmahon), When Referring To The","with the Reserve Bank, and Dr Michael Porter from the International Monetary Fund, and also the Reserve Bank this year. All these people have endorsed the Johnson thesis. Despite the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has achieved international notoriety by describing, during a debate earlier this year, Professor Johnson as a discredited American academic it seems more than likely that imported inflation has been an important factor in accounting for the higher rate of inflation Australia has experienced in recent years. The previous Government, by refusing to acknowledge this factor, pursued needlessly restrictive budgetary policies and left Australia completely exposed to that overseas inflation by refusing to revalue the currency. Thus Australia bore the full brunt of increased import prices which encouraged local prices to rise. As Dr Porter has shown, we were left also with an uncontrolled speculative capital inflow which greatly inflated the money supply and thereby sowed the seeds of further inflation which we are now experiencing. At the winter school of the Economic Society in Sydney on 9 November last, Dr Porter made some comments on Professor Argy's paper on world inflation. Referring to exchange rate policy Dr Porter said: A rigid exchange rate tends to guarantee that a country shares in the broad trend of world prices. Countries may resist such trends by steady revaluation combined with a degree of monetary, restraint. Attempting to resist world inflationary trends without revaluation causes the domestic currency to become over-valued and this then generates speculative inflow. The resulting increase in liquidity ultimately aggravates domestic inflation. . . . That exactly describes what happened in Australia last year and the year before. If we look at the balance of payments and the state of international reserves we find that in the past couple of years there was tremendous inflow into this country. In 1969-70 it was $798m; in 1970-71 it was $l,469m; in 197172 it was $l,858m; and in the last 6 months of last year it was $996m. Much of this capital inflow was speculative and some of it was induced by the higher interest rates applying in Australia as compared with those available overseas. Dr Porter has produced a paper to be published in the 'Economic Record' entitled The Interdependence of Monetary Policy and Capital Inflows in Australia'. In this paper he explains that the previous Government's refusal to revalue the currency led to speculative inflow which in turn expanded the money supply, and the Government's attempts to offset that increased liquidity by using monetary pohcy, that is, by selling government bonds to soak up money, meant that interest rates remained high and so induced further capital inflow. This in turn swelled our reserves even further so speculators brought in more overseas money as they sensed a revaluation. The Government attempted to offset this by further sales of government bonds. That kept interest rates high and so more capital was induced into the country. In this way our international reserves swelled even further and more speculative capital flowed in. And so the process continued. The former Government's stubborn-in deed one might say idiotic-refusa l to revalue was leading to a quite uncontrolled explosion of capital inflow, our international reserves and the money supply. I have referred to the figures of capital inflow. An even more dramatic picture is shown in the movement of our official reserves. In June 1970 they were $l,538m; in June 1971 they were $2,280m; in June 1972 they were $3,764m; and then, in November 1972, only 5 months later, ithey were $4,73 8m, an incredible increase of $974m. In December 1972 the official reserves were $4,816m; in January 1973 they were $4,849m and in September 1973 they had fallen to $4,090m. It can be seen that in the last few months of office of the previous Government the economic policy was not sound at all. In fact, it was totally out of control. Overseas capital wasfloodinginto the country. Overseas reserves were increasing at an unprecedented rate. Consequently the money supply was going crazy. In 1968-69 the money supply increased by 9.1 per cent; in 1969-70 it increased by 6.2 per cent; in 1970-71 it increased by 6.8 per cent; in 1971-72 it increased by 10.5 per cent and in the first 6 months of 1972-73 it increased by 16.7 per cent. By allowing the money supply to increase at such an extraordinary rate last year the previous Government was building up an inflationary time bomb set to go off this year. Economists differ as to the degree of importance to be attached to increases in the money supply but all agree that it is quite inflationary to allow the money supply to increase at a rapid rate. ourable member's time has expired.",34,Grievance Debate
96,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Order! The honOpposition) (11.39)-The Government is manufacturing an issue by misrepresentation. The real issues involved in the education matter before us in the public Press today are these: All members of the House of Representatives voted in favour of the expenditure of $690m for education for 1974-75, which was the recommendation of the Karmel Committee. The Opposition not only wants that sum of money spent, but also wants to see retained the principle that every Australian child is entitled to a grant regardless of the school to which the child's parents send it. This principle government school. The Karmel Committee's was unanimously reaffirmed by the Catholic bishops in August this year and it is a principle all non-government schools from A to H. which the Liberal and Country Parties have constantly espoused. The Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) and the the Minister for Education ( Mr Beazley) have failed to honour clear promises which they gave many times throughout 1972, both before and after the election, in the following terms: The Prime Minister in speaking of recurrent grants to schools said: 'The ALP will support any forms of benefit already existing.' This per capita grant to all school children existed at that time. The Minister for Education said: 'Whispering campaigns to the contrary, no private school under Labor will in future get less than the per capita grant it gets now.' That clear undertaking is now the issue in this education debate. The Opposition's policy and the promises of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education are in fact the same thing. The only difference is that the Opposition has the courage and the principle to stand by its policy, and the Prime Mmister and the Minister for Education deny their clear promises. The next point is that the Opposition supports the provision of extra funds on the basis of need. There is no reason whatever why the Government cannot honour its undertakings and achieve the expenditure that it wishes. Any representation that this involves $114m is false, and deliberately so. The sum involved is less than $5m per annum. Any representation that it is the wealthy schools only which are to be advantaged is false. Under the Karmel Committee's proposals, which are included in this Bill, 53 per cent of secondary pupils in independent schools will receive less money than they would have received under the former Government's legislation. By the action taken by the Opposition in the House of Representatives the security of the basic grant to every child attending a nongovernment school is preserved, as it should be. Twenty-two per cent of all Australian children attend those schools, and this affects every one of them. There is no valid reason why the $690m of funds for education should be held up by the Government, as it is threatening to do. The previous Government passed legislation which provided grants for each child-$10 4 for secondary pupils and $62 for primary students, which at that time was 20 per cent of the cost of running a report introduced a categorisation scheme of The category A schools are to receive that amount of money in 1974 and then they are to stop receiving assistance altogether after 1974. Meanwhile the schools in categories B to H are to receive varying amounts-the lower in the alphabet, the higher the amount. For example, in the secondary area, all schools in categories A to F are to be worse off under the Karmel report. So it is not just category A schools that the Opposition is concerned about; it is the schools in categories A to F. Those categories can be changed at any time at the whim of the Minister. There is no appeal and no criteria for change in the Bill. Two of the Opposition's amendments relate to that. In the secondary schools, categories A to F-whic h contain about half the children in the private schools and the Catholic parochial schoolsare to be worse off under the Karmel Committee's report. The Opposition is taking action now to preserve the money sum of the grant to those disadvantaged schools in the private sector-no t the continued escalation at 20 per cent of the cost of running a government school as it was when first put, but the money sum in accordance with the promises given by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education. The fundamental principles as we see them are these: All children, no matter to which school their parents send them, should receive a grant. There should be distributed, on top of this fundamental grant to every child, much larger funds according to need. That is why the Opposition supports the Karmel Committee's report and why it insists that this per capita grant to every child should be preserved. Surely this must he right. Does anyone say that a child, because its parents",35,Grievance Debate
97,Mr Snedden (Bruce,"Leade r of thesend it to a particular school, is not entitled to the equality of opportunity slum school to remain in a slum school. say that because a child's parents send it to a particular school, that child, with no choice, is to be removed from the possibility of support from Commonwealth funds? That is the greatest bit of class intrusion by these middle class intellectual socialists that one could posthose amendments. We made it better legissibly get. The Australian Episcopal Conference supports that view and I am sure that every decent minded citizen of Australia supports it. The fact is that there are some courses open. The first course that is open is quite clearly this: The Opposition could not carry that amendment in this House because it does not have the numbers to carry it in this House. Whether that amendment will be carried in the Senate remains to be seen. I can say to this House that I have every confidence that the senators of the Liberal Country Party joint Opposition will be supporting the amendment in the Senate. We could not move amendments in this House which would have the effect of increasing the expenditure by $5m because there has to be a message from the Governor General to increase the appropriation. For that reason we could not move the amendment to increase the amount by about $5m. Therefore there was only one course open member for Stirling( Mr Viner), quite innoto us and that was to refuse to allow the cently, walked up and took one of the papers. repeal of the old Act so that we could bring He was halfway down the passage when one the Government to its senses, so that the of the members of the staff of the House Government could honour the promises made chased after him and told him that the Govby the Prime Minister and the Minister for ernment had declared the paper secret.

We said: 'We are not going to be cowed down by a threat. It is bad legislation and we will defeat it'. We defeated it. The Government then said that it would bring in 2 separate Bills. We have not yet seen the second Bill. The first Bill came into this House. We moved a series of amendments. The Bill was transmitted to the Senate. The Opposition there carried the amendments. The Bill came back to this House, and the Minister for Labour( Mr Clyde Cameron) accepted all lation. Then we were threatened with a double dissolution over the Electoral Bill. It was said that that Bill would make elections democratic. The clear implication was that this Government was elected undemocratically. But we said that we would not be frightened by these threats, and we rejected the Bill. Not only has the Government not called a double dissolution, but it probably has lost the ground for calling a double dissolution on that issue because it has dallied around on it. The Government then said to us: Tf you do not pass the mining code in the Seas and Submerged Lands Bill, we will take you to the people'. We said: OK, we will take you to the cleaners.

By implication, throughout the election campaign last year every member of the then Opposition was saying to the parents of children in the private schools: 'You can vote Labor, and the principle of per capita grants will be retained'. The then Opposition got into office and did not honour the promise. So many promises have been dishonoured that we tend to forget just how deep is the obligation of a government to maintain a promise. If the Government wants a double dissolution on this issue and says that the Opposition is opposed to the expenditure of $690m or to the recommendations of the Karmel Committee report, it will be making a fraudulent statement. That is not true. If the Government does say that, everybody in Australia should know that it is saying falsehoods in an attempt to serve its own political interests.

If you are in difficulty, come back to us and negotiate'. That was the responsible spokesman on education. I understand that he is only the acting spokesman on education and that the real Opposition spokesman on education is in the Senate. I imagine that that senator has a much more intelligent appreciation of the problems on schools. But for the Leader of the Opposition to speak here when the Bill is still to be dealt with in the Senate shows how frightened the Opposition is. That is the reason why he spoke. Fancy the Opposition saying that it wanted only $5m. The Opposition did not move any amendment to clause 15 to make provision for $5m. The Opposition could have done so, but it did not. It never mentioned $5m at any stage of the second reading debate or the debate in Committee. The Opposition through the honourable member for Wannon; said to us: 'You will have 2 Acts. No government it knows it has not a majority in the Senate'. The Government has a mandate from the people.

We said: 'We will implement that needs commission'. We have done that. There is some criticism of the fact that we deleted category A schools.

In some cases it was as high as 270. The Opposition is adopting a policy of giving per capita grants to those schools in the 270 category. That shows how fair dinkum the Opposition is on this issue. The result of the ineffective action of the Opposition in this House is that it says that it still wants 20 per cent per capita grants across the board to those schools with resources of 270. The Opposition is not entitled to do that. The per capita grants will not be made on that basis. The real issue which the Opposition has to understand is that we have $114m available for re-allocation on a needs basis. That is what we have done. That is not the Opposition's view. It wants the $114m to be given to the wealthy schools as well. That is the Opposition's attitude. Mr Ian Robinson-What about the changes you made as you went along? honourable member not make a speech later? He ought to talk! He came from the New South Wales Parliament where he opposed every per capita grant. He is the one who did it. He should not talk to me about per capita grants in view of his actions in the New South Wales Parliament. The New South Wales Government still will not give per capita grants to secondary schools because of the means test involved. The honourable member's Party is hypocritical from the point of view of political theory. It has 2 standards. It has one in this Parliament and one in New South Wales, and the honourable members knows it. Let us look at this matter from the point of view of what is really being said. In a debate in September 1972, when the then Government was introducing this legislation, my colleague the Minister for Education ( Mr Beazley) moved an amendment which clearly indicated to the then Government that the per capita grants would not be continued after 1973. In that debate he said to the then Government, in effect: T give you fair warning that when we are in power'-wha t a good judge he was; we got into power-'w e will establish a commission. It will assess the needs, and when those amendment, not opposing the Bill if you felt needs are known we will reallocate those resources in accordance with need'. That is what we are doing. The Opposition should not come in here and say that there has been deception. That statement is on record on 26 September 1972. The Minister for Education made this clear and certainly the people were told. The honourable member should know that this is particularly so on the North Shore. I was campaigning in North Sydney on that basis. Whom did we meet in that campaign? All these people saying 'We want you to continue per capita grants.' We said: 'We are not going to do that; we are going to do it on a needs basis.' Our policy was adopted to the needs basis. The Karmel Committee said that need was the essential thing. Now the Opposition says to the Government: 'Unless you give us $5m'a belated figure I might add, not even given on Tuesday-'for these schools which have resources well above the norm we will not give you $700m for all these government and non-government schools well below the norm.' How many Australians listening to me today would think that the Opposition would play politics with the children of Australia? Deputy Speaker. I know that there is nothing specific in Standing Orders forbidding Ministers to tell lies at the table, but surely it is implied in Standing Orders Order! By implication the honourable member for Mackellar has now called the Postmaster General a liar. I ask him to withdraw the implication. only saying that he should tell the truth. I withdraw the implication. order is involved. protection, Mr Deputy Speaker. For the people listening the .issue is this: The Opposition is trying to blackmail us on the basis that unless we give $5m the Opposition will not agree to clause 66 remaining. Where is your legal logic in this issue? Clause 66 has nothing to do with $5m going anywhere else. If you wanted SSm the appropriate clause was clause IS.

Further, we will take you to the people on the issue. Let us be clear on that. We will see then how well you perform in the Senate.

(Extension of time granted). I make the position clear. The legislation we are introducing is in accordance with the Karmel Committee report. The only point of contention that the Opposition is now trying to raise today-and which it did not raise in the debate-is that there should have been some consideration of that aspect of the report which referred to higher category schools being phased out. ThatI shall acknowledge. However, the fact is that the report said that there was no"" justification for the continuation of those grants but that those schools might be affected in their budgeting and some consideration should be given to them. That is the one kick in the Opposition's case. But the Opposition is saying that because that little aspect has not been looked at it will give us nothing for the government and non-government area which is in need. It could have allowed clause 66 to remain and enable a carrying out of all the programs, which I might add all the State Premiers have endorsed and for which they have already allocated money. Unless the program is allowed to flow through the whole of the State's programs for the next year is in jeopardy. They are upset now. I am being inundated by phone calls from across the nation. Responsible Ministers for Education in the States, irrespective of their politics, will have the whole of their programs put in jeopardy. I instance Victoria where they have the land, the buildings and contracts let on the basis of receiving this money and that State's program will be put in jeopardy unless some more money is given. For a start there was no amendment at all. The first time that I heard of the $5m was in a Press release by the Leader of the Opposition. Let it be put on record that I understand the Opposition spokesman on education and the acting spokesman on education had a little difference in the Press gallery as to who should be issuing Press releases and what they should say. I suppose that because they could not make up their minds on a Press release they got the Leader of the Opposition to do one and he has plucked the mathematical figure of $5m out of the air. He still has not given any indication as to how it would be allocated. Mathematically I do not think he can make it stick, but from our point of view that is not the issue. The issue is clause 66, the termination of the old legislation and the re-allocation of the appropriation of $114m, which is within the $690m that we are providing in this Bill. The Opposition has placed the whole lot in jeopardy by saying that we are not going to get the $114m for re-allocation. It could have let clause 66 remain and moved an amendment to clause 15 to guarantee that what it is contending could be argued and debated.

This would be the first time ever. It shows how worried the Opposition is. I thank the House for the opportunity to reply. address my remarks to the question that has been the subject of some debate this morning. I refer principally to what I regard as blackmail by the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) of the students of this country and his effort to blackmail the Opposition for supporting a position that he supported himself last year when going to the people. This week the Parliament voted unanimously for the States Grants (Schools) Bill. It voted an expenditure of $690m towards education in Australia for the years 1974 and 1975. The Opposition wishes not only to ensure that this money goes to education but also to see retained the principle that every Australian child is entitled to go and his parents have a freedom of choice to send him to whatever school is selected. This principle was reaffirmed unanimously by the Catholic bishops in August this year. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Education, Mr Beazley, claimed repeatedly prior to the last election, and I quote the Prime Minister: The ALP will support any forms of benefit already undertakings in these discussions. This is a existing to education and therefore any policies would breach of faith and a broken promise. It is be additional to those existing in thefieldof education. just another one of the promises broken by Mr Beazley went to great lengths to try to overcome this Government. The promise to the Auswhat he claimed was a whispering campaign. He said that no private school under Labor will in future have tralian people on this issue has been broken less than it will receive under the per capita grant and the Government is not prepared to go to system at that time. So, here is a complete repudiation of Labor's prepared to go to the Australian people on promise; a breach of faith with the parents of any of the issues on which it claimed it school children in Australia. Let us look at what happened with respect gave to Australian parents who were sending to the Karmel Committee. The Interim Schools their children to independent schools. Commission was given terms of reference that did not match the spirit of the undertakings given by spokesmen for the then Opposition, prior to the last election. Those terms of reference said that the Committee should make its recommendations on the basis of relative needs and priorities without a predetermined basic level of support to all non-government schools. Order! I ask the honourable member for It was on that basis that the Karmel ComCasey to cease interjecting. mittee made its recommendations for assistance to education, was forced into categorising ing of recurrent grants to schools, said: schools from A to H and was forced to deny the per capita grants system flowing to the existing independent schools of this country. Not even the Caucus, the Cabinet or the Government accepted the recommendations of the Karmel Committee. Even the Karmel Committee recommended that grants to category A schools should not be phased out immediately or should be immediately deprived of state aid. The Karmel Committee recommended that aid to those schools should be phased out over a 2 year period. The Government did not accept that recommendation. The reason for that recommendation is a callous and a bitter prejudice against certain schools in this country. It is a bitterness which eats into its soul as maggots eat into a carcass. It is a most unfortunate and sad state of affairs. This aspect of the Government's policy has marred what has otherwise been a very sound and good approach to education generally. It is quite wrong for the Prime Mimster or his Ministers to claim that the Opposition has opposed the Bill to extend aid to independent and other schools. quite untrue. What the Opposition has done is to try to force the Prime Mimster and the Government to honour their pre-election undertakings to the Australian people. The Government has failed to live up to those the people on it. The Government is not would. The Government knows in its own heart that it has broken an undertaking that it The ALP will support any forms of benefit already",40,Grievance Debate

128,Mr Mathews,"That is what it has done.says the honourable member for Casey. Yet, as a result of the proposals of the Karmel Committee which were included in the States Grants (Schools) Bill, independent schools will receive less money in respect of 53 per cent of their secondary school pupils than they would have received under the legislation of the former Government. Do not try to deny that. It is the truth. The Australian people should know the truth. Let the media state the truth. There has been a certain degree of misrepresentation in the media of this fact to date. The Government has failed to honour undertakings that the Prime Minister himself gave, whilst Leader of the Opposition, to parents with children at independent schools. I want to repeat one fact. Let us leave aside the category A schools about which there is so much prejudice and bitterness. Under this scheme that the Government is implementing, 53 per cent of all secondary school pupils attending independent schools will receive less money than they would have received under the legislation of the former Government. If Government members can prove that statement to be incorrect, I will apologise. But that is the situation. By the action taken by the Opposition in the House of Representatives, the security of a basic grant to every child attending a non-government school is preserved. There is no valid reason why the funds for education totalling S690m should be held up by the Government as the Government is now threatening to do. This is a bluff and a threat. It is not directed so much against the Opposition, although I must say that one could claim as support for a belief that it was an article in the 'Australian' of today's date attributed to a Paul Kelly. That article states: The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, told a Labor Party Caucus meeting yesterday the Government would win an election fought on the Opposition's amendments to the $690m schools grants program. Mr Whitlam said the Government had a clear mandate. . . The Opposition parties in the Senate are threatenput that situation right as soon as practicable. ing Australian schools with great hardship and, in many cases, with disaster' So it goes on. Look, the Prime Minister is quite wrong and he is quite deliberately forgetting the undertakings which he gave to the Australian people prior to the last election. He thinks that memories are short. He thinks that he can bluff the Australian people and the Opposition on this issue, believing that it might be the thing on which he can win an election. Country Party supporters-Might! members of the Labor Party will see the sense in restoring to those schools what has been denied to them, that is, the sum of $2m in the first 6 months of this year and Sim for next year. Do not tell me that this is a matter of funds. The Government has instituted a program for university and tertiary education to be free of fees. I do not argue against that. But that program will cost $30m. For the sake of $3m, Government members have allowed prejudice and bitterness to become the overriding factor. They have placed themselves in a serious situation. I hope that they will negotiate with common sense for the sake of justice and for what is otherwise a good education program. tory-Minister for Secondary Industry) (12.18) -The last speaker, on behalf of the Country Party, mentioned bitterness. Well, we are seeing it here today. We are seeing bitterness in the House on the part of people, half of whom would not have gone to a state school. went to wealthy schools and they are showing the bitterness that they represent. They want money to be given to schools which really do not need it. The Australian Labor Party came to power on the firm pledge that it would do right by Australian education and by the school children of Australia who needed assistance. I remind honourable members of the extent of that need. It was only last year, or perhaps the year before, that an independent body said that the state of Australian education was so deplorable after 23 years of Liberal-Country Party neglect that $ 1,400m would not put the situation right. I remind honourable members of that fact. The Labor Party came to power pledged to What did the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) say in this respect? In his speech which opened the election campaign and which persuaded the Australian people to vote for the Australian Labor Party the Prime Minister said: The most rapidly growing sector of public spending under a Labor Government will be education.

It wants money for Melbourne Is that not what we are seeing here and now? The privilege and inequality, which honourable members opposite fought so hard to preserve and were so successful in preserving for 23 years and which they now see slipping away from them, have produced the bitterness that has expressed itself in all of their speeches. The Australian Labor Party sees the position in a different light. The Prime Minister, as the then Leader of the Opposition, went on to say for example that under the previous Government the pupils of state and Catholic schools had less than half as good an opportunity as the pupils of non-Catholic independent schools to gain Commonwealth secondary scholarships and very much less than half the opportunity to complete their secondary education. Does anyone deny that that is correct? Does anyone deny that it is the policy of the present Government to spend an additional amount of nearly $700m to put the situation right? Are honourable members opposite saying that the additional $700m should not be spent on education? Are they saying that the money should be denied to education? Honourable members opposite-collectivel y and individually-ar e hypocrites when they come along and say that they are not opposed to the additional expenditure. Everything they have said here amounts to their saying: 'Give us $5m'-ho w they have arrived at that figure Heaven only knows-'for Melbourne Grammar and Sydney Grammar'-the schools they went to-'and we might be able to make a deal*. The honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Hunt) actually spoke of that. He said: 'Let us negotiate'. What do honourable members opposite have with which to negotiate? They do not have any credit. They had 23 years in which to prove that they had credit. They have none. The honourable member for Gwydir wants to do a deal of some sort. He said: 'If you do not let the wealthy schools that are the basis of our support keep the money that we were giving to them we'-the Liberal and Country Parties-*wil l see that the people who really need the $700m do not get it*. If that is not holding a gun at the head of the school children of Australia, who are represented welltoythe Labor Government, I do not know what is. If it is not blackmail, I do not know what is. The honourable member for Gwydir said: 'Let us negotiate'. What does the Opposition have to negotiate about? What sort of deal Grammar. It wants money for Sydney Grammar. It does not want anything for the children who go to schools in Surry Hills, Balmain or Glebe. It does not want any of that. The Opposition has said: 'Let us do a deal. Give us $5m\ Perhaps it will settle for $3m. Perhaps it will settle for $lm. It will get nothing. But the Government will continue its great increase in expenditure on education for tbe people who need it. The Prime Minister has said that the most rapidly growing sector of public spending under a Labor Government will be education. We will see that it comes about. The spending will not be by way of per capita grants to people who do not need them, so that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and so that the inequality becomes greater every year. Is it not the experience of everyone who has lived in Australia that the gap between the rich and the poor has grown in the last 20 years? Is that not the experience of the honourable member for Stirling( Mr Viner), who is trying to interject? The honourable member is an honest man. Is it not his experience that the gap between the rich and the poor in this country has grown in the last 20 years? Of course it is. It is the experience of everyone. That is particularly so in the field of education. An amount of $ 1,400m has been deemed to be what is needed to put the situation right. The Labor Government has said: 'We will put almost half of it forward in our first year of ofhce. We will not neglect the private school sector. We will just see that its needs arc determined on a proper basis'. The money will go to those who need it most, including the poor Catholic parish schools and the poor private schools-and there are some poor private schools. It will be allocated on the basis of need. What could be more equitable? What could be more just? But honourable members opposite want it on a per capita basis. They are being hypocritical when they come into this chamber and say that there is no difference between the child of a rich man and the child of a poor man. There is hypocrisy in that statement. The children are the same; but honourable members opposite are fooling themselves, although they are not fooling the people of Australia, when they say that there is no inequality between the child of a man on $50,000 who chooses to send that child to Melbourne Grammar or Sydney Grammar and the child of a bus driver on $80 a week, $100 a week, or whatever it happens to be who has to send his child to a state school. There is gross inequality. Look at the schools in the slum areas of Australia. I remember seeing advertised last year the curricula of a wealthy private school in Queensland. Do honourable members know what was included in the curricula? That school offered private flying lessons in a Piper Cherokee aircraft. That is the sort of school to which honourable members opposite want to give money. They say that a child at that school also needs help. What about the school children in Glebe, Surry Hills and Balmain. the Leader of the House. Honourable members opposite are hypocrites. They are also bastions of privilege. I do not have anything against wealth. I like it. WhatI want is a better distribution of that wealth and that privilege. Mr KatterI will swap you bank accounts. Mir ENDERBY-The honourable member for Kennedy would win handsomely. Ms Katter-Well, let us swap. Order! I warn the honourable member for Kennedy that if he does not remain silent I will deal with him. Mr KatterI am sorry. for Kennedy would win handsomely. The Government set up a committee to take the allocation of funds to education out of the hands of politicians such as honourable members opposite, who would give it to Melbourne Grammar, Sydney Grammar and the like. The Government asked the committee it set up to ascertain where the need really is and said that the money it allocated would go there. Honourable members opposite lost an election on this issue. They know that they cannot win on it in this House because they do not have the numbers. Thank God they do not have the numbers in this chamber. But they have the numbers in a place called the Senate, whose members were not elected at the same time as we were. In fact, half of them were elected as far back as 6 years ago. The circumstances of their election had nothing to do with what led the Australian people to elect the Labor Government to office last year. Honourable members opposite have called upon their majority in the Senate, in the most undemocratic way possible, to thwart, frustrate and sabotage what the Australian people thought they were electing, that is, a political party which had a better education policy. Honourable members opposite say that what was implicit in everything on which the Australian Labor Party campaigned and everything for which the Australian public voted, including a better deal in education, can be thrown out the window. They say: 'Why should the schools which need the money get $700m if Melbourne Grammar and Sydney Grammar do not get $Sm? That is the attitude of honourable members opposite. They have revealed themselves in their true colours when they have stood up and said those things in this Parliament. The record is abundantly clear. One has only to look at it. For example, in 1972, when honourable members opposite put forward the legislation which they now seek to maintain, although they are no longer in office, and which preserves privilege and increases the difference between poor and rich people, the present Prime Minister, in moving an amendment to the legislation, said that the grants should not be made on the basis provided in the Bill in respect of any year after 1973. He made his position quite clear then. He spoke about the purpose of need. It is in the platform of the Australian Labor Party. It has been there since 1971. It is recorded in the proceedings of this House and it is in the Prime Minister's policy speech. What could be more consistent and proper than that? We were elected on this proposal. proposal. Nothing could be more abundantly clear. If we have said one thing, it is that we will increase spending on education based upon the needs of the people who most need it and not upon the needs of Sydney Grammar. Even the Karmel Committee reported that the allocation of funds to the category A schools could not be justified. That was one of its findings. Minister's time has expired.

140,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Order! The Government supporters-Oh! opposite may laugh. One of the myths or lies continually perpetrated by successive speakers for the Government is that all this money will be going to the so-called rich schools, as though all the pupils at category A schools came from rich homes. If they are really concerned about the wealth of individual parents, why do they not move against the wealthy parents who send their children to state schools? Where is the hypocrisy that they suggest is in us when we say that all children, no matter where they come from and no matter what their background, should be treated basically as equals? That is our main proposition. The speech of the Minister for Secondary Industry( Mr Enderby) was a classic of class bitterness. All we seek to doI want to make this clear to the people of Australiais to hold the Government to the promises it made last year. I think that must be made clear because the Government is attempting to mislead the nation yet again on this issue. Let me quote from the statements made by the present Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam), last year. On 20 June 1972, speaking on recurrent grants, he said: The ALP has never voted against any Bill proposing Commonwealth aid for education and it will support any forms of benefit already existing. In a letter to Mr Dixon on 13 December 1972 he, as the Prime Minister, said: Per capita grants to non-government schools for the terms of education expenditure from the year 1973 will be paid at the rates now approved under the provisions of that Act. Commencing in 1974 additional Commonwealth contributions towards fulfilling the costs of non-government schools will be considered on the basis of relative need. Additional-that is the point. Let up keep him to his promise. What about the Minister for Education ( Mr Beazley)? On 27 October 1972 he said: Whispering campaigns to the contrary, no private school under Labor will in future get less than the per capita grant it gets now. Now what do honourable members opposite say about that? Let us try to bring a little honesty into the performance of the Government. The Minister for Education, in his speech on 26 September last year, said: But we give a fair warning that if we are in power, while there will be an expenditure on non-government schools of no less than the sum total that will be appropriated in this Bill, the appropriation will be reapportioned-it will be reapportioned on the basis of need. He said nothing about cutting it out. but nothing about cutting it out. That is what the Government has done, and not just to category A. schools but to a large number of schools. Fifty-three per cent of the independent secondary schools will get less under this Labor Government. Let honourable members opposite remember that. I refer not just to category A schools but to 53 per cent of the independent secondary schools. Despite the pre-election promises made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education a deliberate secret instruction was given to the Karmel Committee-'governmen t schools will not be pre-determined'. That was in complete contradistinction to the promises delivered to the Australian population before the election, because the Australian Labor Party knew before the election that this was a really live issue. It sought to pull the wool over the Australian electors' eyes by promising them these things, and it succeeded. Now we are simply trying to hold the Government to its promises so that this 53 per cent of non-government secondary schools will not be disadvantaged by the actions of the Government. We have a very simple point to make. We believe that every child, regardless of where he comes from, whether he comes from Surrey Hills or the electorate of Casey, has a fundamental right to a basic level of support in Federal Government. This is the position we take. This is the position we have always taken. Every child-n o class distinction, no lower class, upper class or middle class-ha s this fundamental right. In addition-w e make no secret about this; we put it forward, and we put it forward clearly-wher e there are obvious areas of need we would seek to have additional funds expended. We have made this position quite clear. It is totally misleading for honourable members opposite to say that we seek to hold up or to destroy $690m additional government expenditure on education. We do not. Let them not try to confuse the Australian public. We do not try to hold that up. What we seek to do is have that money spent throughout Australia, because we agreed during the second reading debates on the States Grants (Schools) Bill and the Schools Commission Bill that that money needs to be spent. But in addition we seek to ensure the fundamental right of every Australian child, free from class bitterness and class distinction.",44,Grievance Debate

142,Mr Mathews,Reapportioned .,45,Grievance Debate
143,Mr Mackellar,"Reapportioned , surely,There is no attempt to block this legislation. What we simply seek to do is to put before the Australian people the promises made by the members of this Government when they were in Opposition last year and seek to hold them to those promises. What could be fairer than that? The Minister sought information about costs. Let me quote to him a telegram received last night from the National Council of Independent Schools. It states: The Committee of the National Council of Independent Schools meeting in Melbourne today That is yesterdayunanimously reaffirmed its strong general support for the proposal of the Australian Government to provide substantial additional funds for the improvement of all Australian schools We hold to that. We agree with it, and I am sure all honourable members opposite would agree too. The telegram goes on: Its firm belief in the principle that each Australian can come to some accommodation to enable child should receive basic recurrent educational support by a grant from the Australian Government of a proportion of the per pupil cost in government schools irrespective of the school attended and that furtlier grants according to need should be added to this bask grant We agree with that completely. Let me just add one more point. What schools in Australia need, whether they be classified in the lowest categories or the highest categories is security, and what they do not have under the legislation as proposed by this Government is security. What they would have under the policies as enunciated by the Liberal and Country Parties would be this security. It would provide a basic firm groundwork for future planning. Anybody who has had any experience in managing any organisation would know that you need to know what security you have for the future. If you do not have this the whole basis of your planning is cast in doubt. That is the position of a large number of schools-no t just the lower category schools, not just the higher category schools, but all independent schools. They are deprived this basic security by the legislation proposed by the present Government. Let no headmaster from any independent school, be it Catholic or non-Catholic, be in doubt about that. The telegram from the National Council of Independent Schools goes on to state that it reaffirms: Its hope that all political parties will co-operate in the legislation necessary to implement this principle . . . its belief that the additional cost of such action need not exceed 5 million dollars per annum Let us just have one or two clear points made. The Opposition does not seek to block this legislation. We seek to encourage the Government to expend the additional $690m. I repeat that we do not seek to block this legislation. In fact we voted for it in this House, and we made it perfectly clear at the time that we did vote for it. What we seek to do is to provide security for all independent schools, no matter what category they are in. What we seek to do is to provide a fundamental right for all Australian children to support from the Australian Government-to all Australian school children, no matter what school they are at-fre e of religious bias, free of class bitterness as put forward particularly by the Minister for Secondary Industry. This is all we seek to do, and we would hope that in this place and the other place the Government this to be done. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The words that fall from the lips of the Opposition spokesmen fall very heavily indeed, because honourable members opposite do not have a feather to fly with. The situation is that the Bill which the Government put before the people is a Rolls Royce in education legislation, but the Opposition wants to take away the wheels. It wants to stop it working. One would wonder who the Opposition spokesman on education was. This morning the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) in this House tried to defend the despicable action which has been taken by the Opposition. Senator Rae said that in his belief it will cost $3m more to allow the sections in the old Act to flow on. The Leader of the Opposition here said $5m and the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser) said $15m. 'Whom are we to believe when the Opposition cannot make up its own mind where it is going on this subject? The fact of the matter is that the failure to carry in the Senate the clause relating to the repeal of the old legislation would involve an expenditure of $114m. I refer honourable members to section. 13 in the old Act, which very clearly points out that there is a one-fifth, that is 20 per cent, tie-up between the amounts granted to government schools and",45,Grievance Debate
144,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Scholes),,46,Grievance Debate
145,Mr Mckenzie (Diamond Valley) (12.38),"those granted to non-government schools. I want to point out to the members of this House and to the people of Australia that under the old Act the former Government would have spent $225m on education in this coming year. We propose to spend nearly $700m, but the Opposition is not satisfied with that. The failure to accept the repeal legislation will mean that an additional $114m will be spent. Honourable members opposite are the people who say that Government expenditure ought to be cut, that this Government is spending too much and it is having an effect on inflation. I say to honourable members opposite that if that is the way they think then their logic is not very good at all and, of course, theirfiguresare not very good. I pointed out in a debate on social services that the Leader of the Opposition could not even calculate the percentage increase in social fended the status quo in education.

Quite about the way in which those figures were clearly they had very little feeling for those arrived at. Let me look at this on the basis of children at all. They allowed them to stagnate the figures of the honourable member for in shocking schools. I believe it is worth readGwydir. He claims that 53 per cent of seconding again what the Prime Minister said in his ary school pupils in private schools will be policy speech. He said: worse off. The reality of the situation is that only 8 per cent of all secondary school pupils embarks on secondary education in 1973 shall, irrespecgo to private schools. Therefore on his own tive figures-53 per cent is nearly half-onl y 4 per education. . . . cent of all secondary school pupils will be worse off. In fact 96 per cent of the children in accordance with standing order 106, I put attending secondary schools in Australia will the question: be better off-and much better off. That is the truth of the argument of the honourable member for Gwydir. Let me look at the table setting out cateSTATES GRANTS (SPECIAL ASSISTANCE) gories A to H. Last year the amounts payable were $62 and $104. This year in category C -bearin g in mind that we go down to category H-the amount payable for a primary school pupil will be $70. This business about abolishpage ing per capita grants is so much nonsense. We have not abolished per capita grants at all. What we have done is to reallocate funds, as seeks parliamentary approval for financial we said we would both in statements made payments to the States arising from the recin this place and in the policy speech of the ommendations of the fourtieth report of the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam). An amount of Grants Commission. The Bill makes provision $70 will be payable for a primary school pupil for payments of $10m to Queensland, $ 19.9m and an amount of $100 for a secondary school pupil in category C. The amount payable for secondary school pupils is $4 less than it was previously and the amount for primary school pupils is $8 more. It is a fairly good cut-off point. By looking at the number of schools in category C we would really get a true picture. Let us consider the number of pupils in the categories, after appeals. Surely this is what we ought to be looking at in categories A to C. I have even included category A because as I have pointed out primary school pupils are better off and the secondary school pupils are only $4 worse off. Twenty-nine per cent of the children fall into categories A to C and 71 per cent of all children, primary and secondary, fall into the other categories where they clearly get more. Members of the Opposition have always deThe Labor Party is determined that every child who of school or location, have as good an opportunity as any other child of completing his secondary That grievances be noted.

Although the role of the Commission has been substantially altered following the entitlement of the Grants Commission Act 1973 it maintains its traditional function of inquiring into applications by States for special grants of financial assistance.

However, I emphasise, as I have done debate to indicate that, while the recommendaon previous occasions, that my Party believes tions of the Commission have traditionally that there would be real advantages in a system been subject to the approval of this Parliainvolving the sharing of income tax revenues ment, they are nevertheless matters which in fixed proportions between the Commonshould not be treated as simply a matter of wealth and the various States. Equally, there course. The Opposition is concerned that the is a very strong need to examine limitations additional activities to be undertaken by the to the application of section 96 of the ConCommission under the Act enacted this year stitution, to restrict the nature of the conwill not, in fact, diminish the Commission's ditions which the Commonwealth can impose capacity to undertake its primary function. A on grants made under this section. This present reading of the Board's annual report indicates the complexities of that function and the need for continuing attention to a number of the problems inherent in such a system. During his speech on the States Grants (Special Assistance) Bill last year the present Treasurer stated that, in Government, he would seek to refine the techniques of the Grants Commission. He commented at that time: I would keep the broad principles, but I think that in some respects the Commission is becoming a body which is a little over-systematic in trying to work out the relative abilities as between one State and another. PerhapsI could take this opportunity to raise in the House for response by the Treasurer whether or not he still adheres to that approach and, if so, what action has he taken during the course of the year to influence the operations of fhe Commission. Finally, I take this opportunity to place on culties. It would, of course, be inappropriate to preempt the determinations of the Convention by Government has so clearly abused the powers available under section 96. In short, this Government has shown a flagrant determination to exploit the weaknesses in the constitutional framework in order to increase the dominance of the central government. The Opposition, in contra-distinction to the Australian Labor Party, believes in the federal system of government. This is not a belief based on outmoded principles; it is based on an acceptance of efficient and sympathetic administration, recognising the need for effective decentralisation and devolution of power. Equally, it is based on a rejection of authoritarian or remote methods of government administration. The Opposition, for the reasons which I have made clear, supports the Bill before the House. being considered by the House at the moment provides for allocations from the Australian Government to the States that are considered to be the less advantaged States of the Commonwealth-the mendicant States which, through the Commonwealth Grants Commission, make application to the Australian Government for additional finance to supplement their own budgets. It has always been the practice of the Australian Government to give finance to the States in accordance with the applications made to the Grants Commission. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lynch) mentioned that this practice has been followed by various Australian governments since the introduction of this method of allocating money to the mendicant Statesthe smaller and more disadvantaged States. While I welcome the allocation to Queensland for which provision is being made in this Bill, I think it is appropriate that reference should be made to some of the underlying reasons why such a claim has to be made to the Commonwealth Grants Commission by Queensland. Queensland certainly is a disadvantaged State. It is disadvantaged in a major way by the very system of government that operates there. The greatest burden, the greatest disadvantage that Queensland bears in relation to its economy, in comparison with the other States, is that a bigoted if it is exported. The royalty on bauxite and insular Country Party Premier controls the State electoral system. The corrupt electoral system and the rigged boundaries allow him to be the leader of the major party in the coalition government, although that party receives a minority of votes in elections. This contributes in no small way to the financial problems that exist in Queensland. I want to refer particularly to the failure of the Queensland Government to get the greatest financial advantage for that State from the royalties that it gains from the mining operations which are carried out in that State. The special report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission in 1972, which referred to the original application made by Queensland, on page 11 stated: The Commonwealth Treasury expressed a belief that the material presented in Queensland's submission concerning the 1971-72 budgets of Queensland and the standard States 'is not necessarily reliable as an overall guide to whether or not a special grant is justified Nothing has been disclosed in subsequent reports. Certainly this 40th report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission does not throw any more light on the reliability of Queensland's submissions. I submit that the reason for this is that Queensland's submissions seek to keep from the Grants Commission the truth of the situation that exists in that State, which was mentioned in the original report of the Grants Commission, namely, the fact that Queensland is not getting from mining royalties as much benefit for that State as it should be getting. The report from which I quoted earlier stated: The Commonwealth Treasury suggested That was the Commonwealth Treasury under the former Liberal-Country Party Government that the value of mining output might give some indication of capacity to raise mining royalties. This would suggest that Queensland's capacity is above standard; and as the royalties collected per head of population in Queensland are below the average per capita for the standard States it would appear that Queensland makes a relatively low effort in this field. It certainly does make a low effort in this field. I refer to bauxite. Weipa bauxite attracts a royalty of 5c a ton for Queensland if it is processed locally. The royalty is doubled to 10c a ton if the bauxite is exported. In comparison to thosefigures,it is interesting to look at the situation in the Northern Territory. Bauxite from Gove attracts a royalty of 20c a ton if it is processed locally and a royalty of 30c a ton exported from the Northern Territory is three times the royalty that the Queensland Government gains for the people of that State from bauxite exported from Weipa. One of the Queensland Government's most often used excuses for negotiating contracts",47,Grievance Debate
148,Mr Keogh (Bowman) (12.53),"The Billwith overseas developing compames and allowing them to get away with murder, as far as the low level of royalties is concerned, has always been that there is an offset advantage to the State by the rail freight charges that are made for the cartage of these minerals to the coast for export. But it is as well to remember that in respect of bauxite this advantage cannot be claimed. It is all very well to claim that this is so in respect of black coal. Although this claim, when it has been made in submissions to the Commonwealth Grants Commission, has not been totally refuted, it has been very seriously questioned. But there is no question at all in regard to bauxite because it is mined at Weipa in Queensland and it is exported from Weipa. The low effort that the Queensland Government is making in order to gain royalties from bauxite mined in Queensland is a disgraceful insult to the people of Queensland. Sitting suspendedffirom1 to 2.15 p.ma. pension of the sitting I was speaking of the situation in Queensland in regard to bauxite royalties. I was about to citefiguresrelating to the Weipa project in that State. The Weipa project is the world's biggest bauxite deposit and is now being developed. The argument advanced is that the royalty level attracted that development. I should like to compare the low royalties coming from Weipa with those coming from the Gove deposits in the Northern Territory where the value of royalties per ton are more than 3 times those at Weipa. In 1970-71 4.242 million tons of bauxite was extracted at Weipa, bringing in a return of $23.3m. The royalty payment received by the Queensland Government amounted to a paltry $412,443 or 1.8 per cent of the total revenue. That was the total gain to the Queensland people in 1970-71 from the development of the bauxite deposits at Weipa. The story gets even worse. In 1971-72 7.7 million tons of bauxite was extracted at Weipa for a return of $42,35m. The royalty payments received by the Queensland Government amounted to only $570,141. As production increases the percentage of the royalties paid does not increase but in fact shows a remarkable reduction from 1.8 per cent in 1970-71 to 1.35 per cent in 1971-72. It is easy to see that if any real efforts Customs Tariff Bill could be introduced next were made by the Queensland Government for a proper return of royalties on that bauxite deposit, even without taking into consideration coal exports, there would not be a need for that State to go to the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The blame for the situation that exists in Queensland whereby it is able to claim to be a disadvantaged State lies clearly at the feet of its own government. It is to the disgrace of Opposition members who represent Queensland electorates that they support the actions of the Queensland Government because the greatest disadvantage to Queensland today is the Country Party leadership of the coalition in that State.

149,Mr Keogh,"Mr Speaker, before the susBILL 1973 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 November (vide page 3538), on motion by Mr Uren: That the BiU be now read a second time. House)Mr Speaker, I should like the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure in relation to this legislation. Before the debate on this Bill is resumed I suggest that it might suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering that Bill, the Albury-Wodonga Development (Financial Assistance) Bill, the Growth Centres (Financial Assistance) Bill and the Land Commissions (Financial Assistance) Bill as they are all associated measures. Separate questions might be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest that you permit the subject matter of the 4 Bills to be discussed in this debate. to have a general debate covering the 4 measures? As there is no objection, I shall allow that course to be followed. Opposition) (2.24)I have agreed for the Opposition to these 4 Bills being debated in a cognate debate. Those Bills are the Albury Wodonga Development Bill, the Albury Wodonga Development (Financial Assistance) BiU, the Growth Centres (Financial Assistance) Bill, and the Land Commissions (Financial Assistance) Bill. The first 2 Bills are obvious companions for the establishment of the Albury-Wodonga city complex. The second provides finance for that purpose. The other two are not in fact directly related to the Albury-Wodonga complex although they are part of the whole scheme of legislation relating to regional and urban development and they form part of the legislative scheme, but only part because the remainder of the scheme in relation to Albury-Wodonga and the development of growth centres belongs to the States and there will be legislation from the States. I think it is proper that they should be debated together. I welcome all 4 of these Bills. They will be supported by the Opposition. The initiatives in these Bills set out to relieve the pressures on the ever sprawling maritime conurbations. In over-simple terms, major cities are growing too large and therefore there must be active intervention to regionalise development. Really, it means that there is too much concentration on the hub of the major cities and not enough on the circumference. Therefore, consideration needs to be given to the circumference and also to developing regional development centres so that the pressures on the circumference or the inner city are relieved by the development of the regional development centres. Some natural choice has been manifested by the citizens of this country in coming to the major conurbations. We all know that the non-metropolitan centres are tending to decline in population, although some of the non-urban areas are attracting population and many of the country towns are actually growing. That natural choice needs assistance. We must assist this process in 2 ways. We must see that there is a better standard of life on the circumference and that there is the opportunity for people to find what they would naturally select outside the urban areas. We must not overlook the very significant importance of the inner urban areas, but I will come to that shortly. The inner cites themselves are in need of renewal and more attractive planning so that open space, playing fields and landscaping become more a rule than an accident. We have very devoted and imaginative planners in Australia and we need to give them scope for their imaginative drive. I am glad to say that not only the Commonwealth Government but also the State governments and the major municipalities have attracted planners who are developing very good schemes. One of the major reasons why the Opposition wholeheartedly supports this legislation is that last year, while in government, we introduced a piece of legislation known as the National Urban and Regional Development Authority Bill. I am glad to say that the quality of that legislation was recognised by the incoming Government. The amendments that this Government made to the legislation were to provide a role for the new ministry that was established-the Department of Urban and Regional Development-withi n the structure of the Authority, and to change the name to the Cities Commission. I remember that at the time there was some debate as to whether the name should be the Cities Commission or whether the old name should be maintained. That is in the past. It is the Cities Commission. There is a role for the Department. But, basically, the legislation before the House today",50,Customs Tariff Validation Bull

152,Mr Snedden (Bruce,"Leade r of theis the legislation which was introduced by the previous Government last year. I think that all parties take the view that this scheme should be developed. Some differences of attitude may emerge over time, but we welcome the continuation of that initiative. I do not think it is an issue on which we should compete with each other as to who took the initiative. The fact is that the legislation exists centres at markedly varying distances from the and we must go ahead on the basis of that legislation in the national interest. We must set out to improve the expectation of people to a clean, aesthetic and yet varied environment. Some of the most beautiful areas of the capital cities are in the inner metropolitan areas. By that I do not mean what might be described as the actual city; I mean some of the surrounding residential areas. In most cities those areas are really very beautiful and ought to be preserved and developed. Yet this beauty is becoming increasingly obscured by lack of care of the buildings and the houses and by the intrusion into naturally beautiful residential areas of other types of residences or groups of residences which do not have the same charm. One thing that is apparent is that many of the buildings in thc cities show the grime that has accumulated since coal furnaces and the internal combustion engine were introduced. Australia does not have the range of beautiful buildings that some of the older European cities have. Those who have been to London and Paris recently will have noticed the tremendous change that has occurred in both those cities by taking the grime off the natural beauty of buildings. We must pay tribute to what migrants have done in some of the inner suburban areas in taking old, broken down houses and refurbishing them, painting them and making them very attractive. Mr Donald Cameron-And taking pride. Mir SNEDDEN-And taking pride in them. I have been supplied with the word by the honourable member for Griffith. People have taken pride in these areas. I think it is important that there be selection. I believe that more and more people will be confronted with the dilemma of choice in the future. Young people with young families may very well want to live further away from the city centre; but, as the children grow older and leave home, the parents who are left on their own may very well want to live in the closer city area. In planning we must have in mind the different phases of selection which people will have in their minds when selecting their residence. I turn now to regional development, about which the first 2 Bills are concerned. The Cities Commission appears to be trying a mix of a number of precepts of regional development, with the intention of locating regional capital cities. Centres such as Geelong and Holsworthy-Campbelltown are most reasonably considered to be sub-metropolitan centres or, to use the word which the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren) used in his second reading speech, systems cities. I have not been using that word, although I have been meaning the same thing. I have been referring to sub-city centres and I think it really amounts to the same thing. If the term that is to be used is 'systems cities', I do not object to using it; but I believe that the term 'sub-city centres' expresses more adequately what I have in mind. -systems . that we live in an environmental age. Words catch on. The term 'systems cities' probably will be adopted, but I will not alter my concept of sub-city centres. Incidentally, it was once reported that I was talking about subsidy centres. I mean not subsidy centres but subcity centres. Initially conceived as dormitory towns for the large cities, there is an increasingly and generally held concept that these systems cities should themselves be selfsufficient with their own services and industries. I support the concept of systems cities on the periphery of the major conurbations. There has been some discussion, if not controversy, about whether regional development should be essentially in the suburbs or spread inland. This consideration has been shown in the Schedule. Quite clearly, it must be both. I want to make a point about the difficulties of appropriation of funds for metropolitan transport. I believe that there is a great danger that, in allocating funds for metropolitan transport, we could fall into the trap of providing money so that all suburban transport converges on the hub. This must not happen. If it does happen, it will mean that the conurbations will grow worse because everybody will be transported into the hub in the morning and out of the hub in the evening. It is very important",51,Albury Wodonga Development
153,Mr Uren,We live in an environmental age,52,Albury Wodonga Development
154,Mr Snedden,"The Minister has just said that, ia developing metropolitan transport systems and making money available for them, there should be major planning on the basis of bringing people into that sub-city centre from around it and not transporting everybody to the hub. Another consideration that is implicit in the Therefore I am sure the planner of these Schedule is the fact that regional centres may regional centres would have in mind the need arise in 'new towns', such as is envisaged in to provide incentives for people to stay in Monarto, or may grow from pre-existing these centres.

But I think it will not be 25 million payers. The essential consideration is that these regional centres must be attractive enough for people to want to live in them rather than to flock to the pre-existing urban areas. Achievement of this is contingent on work opportunities being made available. I feel that it is essential that both private and public investment in these centres be encouraged. I think that we could very well have in the sub-city centres-the system centresa priming from public funds of public buildings in those centres. I do not wish to see a series of what I may term public service towns being developed with public servants unwillingly being relocated just because a government has a grand design. Nor do I wish to see regional centres being developed as places where migrants are directed only to escape later when they have served their period, as happened in earlier years when migrants had to remain in a designated place for 2 years. I agree with the principle of facilitating the if we are not afraid, and if we are adventurous settlement of migrants in Australia as expressed in the Albury-Wodonga Development Bill, but we must remain conscious of the fact that people must retain their freedom of choice to live wherever they want and to have the mobility to move from one place to another. We can achieve this only by making these growth centres more attractive to people. The whole concepts implicit in these Bills1 if Mr UrenI hope it is not. hopes it will not be. That expresses a very significant difference between the Minister and myself. The Minister is operating on the basis that we must hold down population in order to make the quality of life good. I hold the opposite view. I believe that Australia has potential and capacity; it has people; it has resources, and by growth we can contribute more to our people and we can discharge the idealism that Australians feel to people outside Australia by generating the wealth of Australia. Therefore my belief is that we should grow. We need to make sure that in growing we do not sacrifice qualities. The Minister's attitude is that he prefers the population not to grow but to concentrate everything on quality. I do not believe that by refusing to grow we will necessarily achieve greater quality. I am sure that if we continue to grow, within reason so that we know what we are",52,Albury Wodonga Development
155,Mr Snedden,"The Minister says that hedoing and why, we will make Australia a better country in which to Uve. I do not believe we should stultify growth because we are afraid. I believe the Minister's attitude is to stultify growth because he is afraid. The task is ours to achieve. Mr UrenI have always said that I support the concept of about a 1.1 per cent growth rate. interjection, has said that he has always accepted a growth rate of 1.1 per cent. rate vastly in excess of 1.1 per cent. The point is that we should take into the country as many people as we can find who suitably fit into our environment, into our way of life, and who can contribute. I do not believe an artificial boundary can be set. I am interested that the Minister acknowledges a growth rate of at least 1.1 per cent, because he is going to have problems with growth. ledges that. If we are to have problems with growth let us realise that it is within our hands to take the appropriate measures to ensure the quality of life of the people making that growth. The Bills set out a mechanism for implementation of the design of this complex. The Albury-Wodonga Development Bill sets out a prototype for the development of a regional centre, and I applaud fhe evidence of Federal and State co-operation as evidenced by this Bill. Without this co-operation the Albury-Wodonga regional centre, first conceived by the Victorian Government in discussion with the Liberal-Country Party Government, would still remain just a good idea. It is said that the original concept of Albury Wodonga came from the Prime Minister when he was the Leader of the Opposition. The story further goes on that on one occasion Graham Freudenberg, not knowing what the Prime Minister should make a speech about, sat down to write a speech and said: 'Let's have the Albury-Wodonga complex'. But it was not an original proposal. The proposal had already emanated out of Victoria. The Albury-Wodonga Development Bill and land against possible rather than probable the complementary Bill dealing with financial development. This is essentially a State resassistance set the guidelines for one of our ponsibility. I know that both Western Ausmost worthwhile projects undertaken in 1972 tralia and South Australia have enacted legisand now followed through by the present Govlation whereas Victoria and New South Wales ernment. I acknowledge that the present Government has followed it through. There are problems implicit in the Bill-the question of how the land once acquired will be held, either as leasehold or freehold. It would appear that the Commonwealth Government is waiting the Else-Mitchell report on land tenure. I do not object to it waiting for the outcome of that inquiry. It will help us all in our debate. But I say quite unequivocally that I believe absolutely, explicitly and without qualification that all residential holdings ought to be freehold. If the land is not freehold it will not attract the support of people to the area whom we do hope to attract to it to make their homes and their lives in a particular area. There is the problem of involvement of local government in all these ventures. I note that there is no mention of this tier of government in the Albury-Wodonga Development Bill, except as an advisory council with no responsibilities as a link between the developmental authority and the residents. I believe that it is important to have regard of the needs of local government especially in areas which previously have developed a highly institutionalised system of local government, responsible as they are for the provision and implementation of very many services. These services are important in an economic and social sense. I believe the provision of services to the cost of Iand is of the ratio of four to one. I also believe that the Government, whether Federal or State, should give recognition to the existence and objectives of resident action groups provided these groups are essentially acting within the confines of their own municipality. I see the growth of dozens of action groups which purport to represent the residents, and yet in fact represent multivested interests whether these be politically motivated or are unions or developers insensitive to the expectations and aspirations of the actual residents. The proposed Growth Centres (Financial Assistance) Bill and the Land Commission (Financial Assistance) Bill extend the concept implicit in the Albury-Wodonga Bills. I do not fully support the concept of Iand commissions acting as land banks and holding",53,Albury Wodonga Development

160,Mr Snedden,"The Minister acknowhave quite different concepts. Those States have in mind a body which will acquire land as the land is needed. I would rather see the statutory authority, the Development Corporation, as the vehicle for control, having full power of acquisition over a designated area which can be seen by all the community as a denned plan, that is, a strategic action plan of achievement and not merely the taking of a great deal of land and putting it, so to speak, in a bank for future calling upon. I reiterate my complete support for the conto declare any State Act a complementary Act, cepts of the need for planned decentralisation, and also for planned urban renewal and extension of sub-city centres or, to use the name that detail in the second reading speech and perhaps is preferred, the system cities. I note in an answer to a question on notice that the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr is in the following terms: Uren) has yet to look in detail at this latter area of urban renewal. I would commend that he do so at an early opportunity and in cooperation with each of the States. Having said that, I should like to make a few comments on the actual legislation. Financial assistance to the States is tied tightly by the Federal Government. My Party's attitude is that grants under section 96 should be conceived in the context of specific grants as national purpose grants. They should give direction to the overall design but should, as the development proceeds, give more latitude in their use to the States and through them to local government bodies in the further planning of these areas. We must assume that all wisdom in this use of responsibility does not devolve in the central bureaucracy in Canberra. There is great wisdom in the States and in local government bodies and although some people may think they can walk on the waters of Lake Burley Griffin, that is not a widely held belief throughout Australia. We in the 2 Opposition Parties have not had all the time we needed to examine the Bills in detail. We should have liked more time, but that is as it may be. Specifically I would like to express-and I do not want this to be understood as more than I intended it to mean as a worda caveat over some areas of the legislation which we will be examining further. I do not expect that if we find them unacceptable to us they would be unacceptable to the Government; I think it would be a matter of discussion. I am concerned to ensure that the parties understand clause 8, sub-clauses consultation between the Commonwealth and (2), (3) and (4) of the Albury-Wodonga Development Bill. The Minister will see that by sub-clause (2) the Corporation is given power to do all things necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with, or as incidental to, the performance of its function. Its functions are contained in clause 8. Very few functions are enumerated and quite clearly this is because the function of land acquisition must be with the States, as it is in fact. That carries me on to sub-clause (3), which gives the Minister power, unqualifiedly and not subject to any supervision of the Parliament, which is then published in the Government Gazette. This has not been spelt out in any the Minister might provide some more information about that. Sub-clause (4) of clause 8 It is hereby declared to be the intention of the Parliament that the Corporation may have and be subject to functions, powers and duties specified by an Act or part of an Act for the time being declared under sub-section (3) to be complementary to this Act. It all ties back and I believe it meansI should like the Minister to reply on this-that once this Bill is passed the Parliament as such will no longer have any capacity to observe what is happening and express views-excep t by way of the forms of the House, which are not very suitable for this purpose, as to the conduct and success of the development of the Albury Wodonga region. I would expect that these provisions will be contained in other legislation which will relate to other growth centres. The next matter I should like to refer to necessitates my citing clause 9 (1) of the Growth Centres (Financial Assistance) BiU which is in the following terms: A payment or advance to a State under this Act is subject to(a) such conditions, not inconsistent with this Act, as are agreed between Australia and the State; and (b) such of the other conditions provided for by this Act as are applicable. I should like some information as to what is intended by the words 'as are applicable'. Clause 14 of the same Bill-ther e are comparable provisions in the Land Commissions (Financial Assistance) Bill-make s it quite clear that there is an extremely tight control over the use of land by the Commonwealth and that the conditions can be applied by the Minister with the concurrence of the Treasurer. There does not seem to be at that point any the States. I should like the Minister to take up that point if he would. The next point I should like to make is that loan funds are made available and are repayable after the expiration of 30 years, which seems a long time. However, in the context of the Albury-Wodonga complex it is a relatively short period. There is provision for the commencement of the repayment period to be deferred but there is no provision for a deferment of the repayment of the total of the loan after 30 years. My recollection is that a comparable provision in English legislation provides that loan funds are for 47 years. I should like the Minister to consider extending the time for repayment to 47 years or else an extension of the repayment finally when there has been deferment of the initial repayment. the cash flows. vide me with that information I should be grateful. The next point I wish to make is that there is quite a marked difference between grant money and loan money and the purposes to which they are put. It seems to me that as experience is gained in the Albury-Wodonga complex it may be necessary to alter attitudes as to what should be grant money and what should be loan money. I do not have an objection at this stage and I would not be wishing to suggest that there should be a change in the statute as it is an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States. However, as experience develops and if there is a need to change loan money into grant money I should like the Minister to indicate that he would be prepared to discuss it with the States. By way of summary, the Opposition supports the concepts basic to the Bills. We support the development of regional centres along the criteria set out by the Cities Commission; we support the need to plan rationally and renew the pre-existing urban areas; we support the need for involvement of local government and the recognition of the actions of legitimate relevant action groups. (Extensions of time granted.)

Ministerial Statement Science and Minister for External Territories) --by leave-This will be the last time that a Minister for External Territories will address this House. On1 December amendments to the Papua New Guinea Act recently passed by this Parliament will come into effect. Papua New Guinea will become formally self governing. The portfolio of Minister for External Territories and the Department of External Territories will cease from that date. This is an historic occasion. Seventy-two years ago this House and the Senate resolved 'that they are prepared to join in measures for the acceptance of British New Guinea as a territory of the Commonwealth'. Papua was formally placed under Australian administration by the Papua Act 1905 which was proclaimed on 1 September 1906. In 1920 the League of Nations conferred on the Australian Government a mandate for the government of the Territory of New Guinea. Following the Second World War the 2 Territories were unified under one administration. In his second reading speech on the Papua New Guinea Provisional Administration Bill on 4 July 1945, the then Labor Government Minister for External Territories, Mr Eddie Ward, observed: This Government is not satisfied that sufficient interest had been taken in the Territories prior to the Japanese invasion, or that adequate funds had been provided for their development and the advancement of the native inhabitants. Apart from the debt of gratitude that the people of Australia owe to the natives of the Territory, the Government regards it as its bounden duty to further to the utmost the advancement of the natives, and considers that that can 'be achieved only by providing facilities for better health, better education and for a greater participation by the natives in the wealth of their country and eventually in its government . . . Today we are witnessing one of the last steps in the fulfilment of that promise. In2 days time Papua New Guinea will have full legal control over its own internal affairs. Government regarded self-government and independence as a remote possibility. The visits in 1970 and 1971 of the then Leader of the Opposition, the present Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam), broke the nexus. His proposal for early self-government and independence was met with official hostility and public dismay. But the course and flow of events in Papua",54,Albury Wodonga Development

163,Mr Morrison (St George,"Minister forNew Guinea were dramatically and irrevocably changed. Papua New Guinea has attained self-government and is moving to independence by orderly constitutional procedures. The Labor Party, having noted the reluctance of colonial powers to give up their coloniesa reluctance which led to wars of national liberation, subversion and bloodshed-wa s determined that the distresing lessons of history tralia with due regard to its own national should not be repeated in Australia's colonyPapua New Guinea. As a political party, wefirmlybelieve that the decisions affecting the people of any country should be made by the representatives of the people of that country. The people of Papua New Guinea will want to measure their own steps and to set their own course. The National Coalition Government, under the leadership of Mr Michael Somare, has already re-oriented the economic and social development of Papua New Guinea in line with the 8-Point Improvement Program. I am sure that all of us wish the Chief Minister and his Government well in guiding their own country to nationhood. There are problems, some of them daunting, particularly for a young country; but, in the words of an old Persian proverb, 'Only your ownfingerscan find the itch'. The character of any nation is determined as much by the manner in which problems are resolved as by the nature of the solution arrived at. Australia will, as the Prime Minister has stated publicly and unequivocally, continue to provide assistance to Papua New Guinea up to independence and beyond. We will not leave Papua New Guinea in the lurch. The assistance will be applied to the objectives and priorities established by the Papua New Guinea Government. By the very nature of our past relations and the agreed tasks, it will be substantial. But I believe it is important for both countries to recognise that the relationship of donor to receiver is just as complex between nations as it is between people. It is a relationship that requires a sensitive understanding on both sides. A heavy dependence on foreign aid can only be acceptable to an independent country if it is not too long lived. The Papua New Guinea Government, in acknowledging this, has ranked self-reliance as one of its major objectives. The very closeness of our relations can create problems. The Australian Government recognises that Papua New Guinea will conThat, Sir, is a complimentI believe a well tinue to occupy a special position in Australia's earned compliment-by His Excellency, who, policy, but we do not see Australia as seeking or asserting an exclusive relationship with Papua New Guinea. Let me quote another national proverb, this time from Malaysia: 'Even good friends must keep their distance'. Papua New Guinea will want to find its own place in the international community. It will want to determine its own relations with Ausinterests. Australia will want to do the same. There could be conflicts of interest, but the test of our friendship will be in the amicable resolution of any such conflicts. The attainment of self-government for Papua New Guinea is also the occasion for the disbandment of the Department of External Territories whose staff has worked tirelessly and with dedication in the interests of Papua New Guinea's future. The contribution it has made is without parallel in the Australian Public Service. Officers of that Department have served successive Ministers for External Territories well and I would like to place on record my appreciation for their support and advice during a very demanding year. To the many thousands of Australians who have served and are serving in Papua New Guinea, we extend our appreciation for their contribution to the development of Papua New Guinea. At this stage, I wish to read an extract from a letter that I received this morning from His Excellency, the Governor General. This letter is intended for an occasion that we are to have tomorrow eveninga wake, I suppose one would call it-for the Department of External Territories. In this letter, His Excellency says: In the continuing labour of government the ending of one job only means the beginning of a new job. There is still a great need for the Australian Government to draw on the training, experience and knowledge gained by its public servants in handling matters related to Papua New Guinea and I trust that full and intelligent use will be made of this asset in the coming years. It is. too early for an historical judgment to be made on what Australia has done in Papua New Guinea. At this time it is enough to remember with pride, and record with honour the patient and devoted labours and the good intention of Australian public servants. Tbe length of their service gave continuity and the depth of their experience gave better understanding of the wide range of problems and the many changes in situations which successive Australian Ministeries had to face. for many years, was the Minister for Territories and in charge of the affairs of Papua New Guinea for the Government of his day.

The date was agreed upon their future, not ours. I said in a speech in last year by the Liberal-Country Party GovJune last year: ernment of Australia and the Government of Papua New Guinea. As I said in May of last from one status to another. Australia has long held year, it is not the timing of self government the view that there should be a smooth and orderly or even the act of self-government itself that transition which establishes Papua New Guinea by is of prime importance; the aim must be to the achieve a self governing country and not just wishes of the people. There is a need to plan ahead a legal facade. The attainment of self government is also a tribute to successive Australian Administrators and to the officers of the Department of External Territories, both in Canberra and in Papua New Guinea, as well as the officers of other departments which have contributed to Papua New Guinea's progress towards self government. Naturally I place the greatest emphasis on those who worked for the Administrator and the Department of External Territories. Their role has been greatly understated and underestimated. Indeed it is, as the Minister for External Territories ( Mr Morrison) has said, unparalleled. So too was the contribution made by those from this Parliament who served as the Minister for Territories or Minister for External Territories. Naturally I exclude the present incumbent and myself. I refer to those who are not members of this House today. 16759/73-Jt-[147 ] Australia's task in the past has been to carry out the United Nations mandate to advance the people of Papua New Guinea politically, economically and socially to the position where this constitutional advance occurred in April 1972 with the election of the present House of Assembly and the exercising of increasingly The date of the next step-that of independence-ha s become a subject of some controversy. On this I merely wish to say today that the prime determinant of the date of Independence should not represent a sudden break time of independence as a state able to manage its own affairs with a government responsive to the to avoid the hangover that so often follows the intoxication of emotional independence celebration. In most areas of government Papua New Guinea is now responsible for the evolution of policies. That has been so for some time. Indeed, the people of Papua New Guinea are uniquely qualified for this responsibility, since only they have a fundamental understanding of the fabric of life in their own country. Only they can properly develop policies that will assist the progress of national unity, the formation of further land legislation and the evolution of the legal system to marry traditional law with existing concepts of British justice. Only they should work out national priorities in variousfields,such as in the setting out of new foreign investment guidelines as announced by the Chief Minister, Mr Somare, this week and.his eight point improvement program for",56,Papua New Guinea Self Government

This philosophy envisages a more self reliant economy, decentralisation of economic activity, with emphasis on agricultural development and small scale artisan business activity, and a rapid increase in the proportion of the economy under Papua New Guinean control. In a speech I made in June of last year I quoted comments of a noted Australian economist, Mr the future relationship and to the form of the E. K. Fisk, which are pertinent to my remarks at this moment. He said: The aims of development are not solely or even geography have dictated that this must be a primarily economic. In trying to direct development close one. We are mutually important to each our concern must be first with the type of society other. Papua New Guinea will be our closest and environment we are trying to produce.

It is In the difficult process of defining goals the subindeed a special relationship. sidiary status of the economic factor should not be forgotten.

The terms of this relationship will, I hope, be planned and some elements of it negotiated before the actual date of independence. We should be remiss if we found ourselves completing the independence of Papua New Guinea without adequate preparation for the post-independence world. The need to look beyond Papua New Guinea's independence to future relationship between the 2 countries is urgent. Events of history and facts of On Australia's part, as long as Papua New their peoples creates a special kind of situation where the development assistance Australia understanding than is usual between developed and developing countries. Although It is necessary to distinguish between Aush the countries of the South Pacific and with other countries in Asia. Papua New and already developing a relationship of economic interdependence with Japan. I observed in an address to the New South Wales Branch of the Institute of International Affairs in June of last year: While Australia will remain important to Papua New Guinea, we should not seek to build an exclusive relationship based on a mistaken belief that past assistance places Papua New Guinea under an obligation to us. Looked at from Papua New Guinea's point of view, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Japan, as well as the island nations of the Pacific, will have important places in the eyes of the Papua New Guinea Governments. Other Governments will be seeking to assist Papua New Guinea. We will do well to recognise this. Not to do so might adversely affect both our and Papua New Guinea's relations with third countries. Through close consultation with one another, Australia and Papua New Guinea could begin now to formulate policies which will make more fruitful our relationship and theirs with both the Asian and the Pacific regions. It is significant that Papua New Guinea's attainment of self-government is acclaimed hy all parties in the Australian Parliament and is endorsed not only here but also in the Commonwealth and the 'United Nations. In both these international forums it is expected that Papua New Guinea, on the attainment of independence will take its rightful place as a sovereign nation. Finally, may I say that during my period as Minister for External Territories I tried to convey an understanding of trust between Australia and Papua New Guinea, in particular a trust between myself, the Chief Minister and his Ministers, to ensure that the Chief Minister realised at all times that when one spoke of Papua New Guinea one spoke not just of a country but of its people, and that as fellow human beings we should jointly seek a 'better life and a better relationship between our peoples. I hope to some extent I succeeded, but of more importance I fervently hope that it will be the basis of a close and trusting relationship for years to come. We wish the Chief Minister, his Government and his people well in the endless human adventure that is before them. join with the Minister for External Territories ( Mr Morrison), speaking as the Minister for External Territories in this Parliament for the last time, and his predecessor, the former Minister for External Territories, the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Peacock), in endorsing on behalf of the AustraUan Country Party the message to be conveyed to the people of Papua New Guinea through the House of Assembly of warm wishes on the occasion of their self-government. Of all the quaUties which go to foster relations between people and between countries, good will is paramount. In the relationships that have evolved between Australia and Papua New Guinea it is that quality above all others which has distinguished the successive relationships at a ministerial level, at a parliamentary level and at a personal level between AustraUans, Papuans and New Guineans both in peace and at war. On1 December a significant event will occur not only for Papua New Guinea but for Australia. We are as a parent to a child moving out into the world on her own. The relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea is almost as close as that personal one. We have had a very close involvement in the past, and I believe we should maintain-and there is the will to maintain a similar close relationship in the future. It has been a personal involvement not only by those who are today in this Parliament and in the House of Assembly in Papua New Guinea but also by those who have been in the Ministry or in the Department of External Territories over the years. I would like in particular at this time to compliment the present Governor General, a former Minister for External Territories; my colleague, Mr C. E . Barnes, another former Minister for External Territories; the honourable member for Kooyong and the present Minister on the way in which the goodwill between our 2 peoples has been maintained. But in particular to Sir Paul Hasluck and to Mr Barnes, I think, the credit must go for the capacity of the people of Papua New Guinea to take the step which tomorrow represents. The present Minister said in his statement in the House today that he believes it was the visit to Papua New Guinea of the Australian Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) that served as a catalyst for change. I do not believe that that statement is accurate. To me it is regrettable that there should have been that type of visit at a time when, through a progressive support of the actions and the initiatives of which the people of Papua New Guinea were capable, there had been a remarkable transition from a state of complete dependence on Australia to a state in which economically the people of Papua New Guinea were more and",58,Papua New Guinea Self Government
167,Mr Sinclair (New England) (3.17),"Imore able to sustain their own future development. I believe that through a process of gradual transition there has developed a feeling of confidence in the future which would not otherwise have been possible. It was that confidence in the future which was unfortunately so violently disrupted by the actions and statements of the present Prime Minister as Leader of the Opposition when he visited Papua New Guinea in 1970 and 1971. However, I believe that it is important that, 1 believe it is a motion which will lead not Papua New Guinea having attained self government, the good will that bas been in existence between our 2 countries is preserved during this next transition stage in the move towards independence and in the period thereafter. It is important that there be no feeling on the part of the Government, the Parliament or the people of Australia that we will force upon the people of Papua New Guinea decisions which they themselves do not desire to take. One would hope that in this transition to independence a capacity is developed within the people of Papua New Guinea which will enable them to accept the greater responsibilities which the final step will involve. To all those who have been officers of the Department of External Territories under its several names I also pay credit. Both the Minister and the honourable member for Kooyong have made reference to the contribution that these men have made. Their actions both in the past and in the present represent the highdebating 4 Bills-the Albury-Wodonga Devest contribution that men can make within the obligations that are theirs as members of the Australian Public Service. I believe that their contribution to the self-government and to the status of Papua New Guinea must be a great tribute to their own personal efforts. To Michael Somare, the Chief Minister of Papua New Guinea and to his parliamentarians the responsibility for the future is now passed. It is a step of gradual transition. One would hope that this step is seen not as one of violent change but rather as one of progressively taking last election the problems facing the cities. on a wider burden of responsibility. I believe that in Michael Somare and his Ministry there is the capacity for the guidance of Papua New Guinea in the future in a sound and constructive way. Indeed, in the remarkable contribution which he has made towards unifying the country since he has taken up his present responsibility, I believe there are signs and symptoms of a man who is a great leader at a time when his country needs him. To all those in Papua New Guinea, to those in the House of Assembly, on behalf of the Australian Country PartyI wish the very best for the future. It is with a real feeling of a significant time in history that I give my own personal endorsement to the motion moved by the Minister for External Territories. So it is that on this last occasion on which a Minister for External Territories speaks in this House the Minister moves a motion with the complete endorsement of all honourable members. towards the severance of relations between our 2 countries but rather to the fostering of a closer and a permanent relationship which will give to both the people of Australia and the people of Papua New Guinea greater promise for tomorrow than might otherwise have been the case.

The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) spoke in this debate for about 35 minutes. I was mildly amused to hear him claim credit for the program of decentralisation which is encompassed in this legislation. We all recall the haste with which the Liberals and the Australian Country Party suddenly discovered one month before the After years of ignoring totally the problems in capital cities around Australia there was a sudden upsurge of interest. One would hesitate to suggest that it might have been the wrath of the voters that honourable members opposite were anticipating that broupht on this interest.

169,Mr Cohen (Robertson) (3.25),"We areby the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren). I can recall the famous Walter Burley Griffin memorial speech which set the tone and the pattern for political campaigns in 1969 and 1972. What we are really encompassing in these 4 Bills is a totally new concept, a new vision of an Australia of the future. Decentralisation has been the catch cry of the Country Party down the ages. But unfortunately the Country Party has been singularly ineffective in its attempts to achieve anything remotely resembling decentralisation. It has had a total lack of success in implementing decentralisation programs. What we have seen has been a continued expansion of the growth of major cities. The population of Sydney is almost 3 million and in Melbourne it is almost 2 i million. It is almost inevitable that those cities will progress to a population of 5 million each. It is not a question of stopping them now; it is a question of stopping them from rising to a figure of 10 million. The facts are that there has been a continual drift from the country to the cities. We have been unable to retain our population in the rural areas. There are a number of reasons for this. There was in recent years a rural recession. The main attraction of cities is that they offer employment; they offer a great range of educational opportunities; they offer cultural and recreational advantages that small country towns do not have. The primary attraction is employment. A wide range of employment opportunities exists in large towns. What we really have to do is to establish in other parts of Ausning in Canberra takes a long time. The tralia large towns equal in size to a city, such as Albury-Wodonga. honourable member is referring. Perhaps he could explain it to me later. We are really aiming at 2 types of growth in this program. Albury-Wodonga represents an artificial growth stimulus. People would not have gone to Albury-Wodonga in great numbers unless there had been a massive program such as the one proposed by the present Government. The other aspect of our program is to plan properly those areas which inevitably would grow, for example, Holsworthy, Menai, Appin, Campbelltown and Gosford-Wyong. People were going in their thousands to those places anyhow because they are close to the city. They are new areas in which land is available and in which there is room to move. There are 2 distinct types of growth involved in this program. I think people ought to bear that in mind because I have heard honourable members on the other side say what a terrible thing it is to say to people in an area: 'You will have 300,000 or 400,000 people'. In most cases that figure would have been reached anyhow. What is desired is that those 300,000 or 400,000 people will go into the area in a properly planned environment. I think it is important that the people of Australia recognise that there is no instant decentralisation formula. It is a long slow program. We have only to look at Canberra as an example of this. I said earlier that there had been no effective decentralisation. There has been one, and that is the development of Canberra. If there is one thing that the previous Government can take credit for it is the development of this city of Canberra. But in the early 1950s Sir Robert Menzies said: 'Yes, let us make Canberra the capital in reality, not only in principle.' The Menzies Government set out on a program of encouraging growtha massive rate of growth. Yet in the 20 years that has elapsed since that time the population of Canberra has risen from about 20,000 to only 170,000. In contrast the city of Sydney is growing by 70,000 a year. To keep Sydney's growth at that level we must aim at creating towns that are able to absorb 70,000 people a year. Clearly that is quite impossible. We will not see immediate results of the program. Plancreation of suburbs like Tuggeranong or Belconnen takes a minimum of 9 years from the time planning is started, the plans go into the pipeline and the suburb is established. In this program we will not see the results immediately. It will be a long slow process but it will lay the foundation stone for new cities and towns of the future. I hope the people do not expect to see this happen overnight because it is not on. It is important that we should be selective. The 1968 report of the New South Wales Department of Decentralisation said for thc first time that there must be selected growth centres; that if you spread decentralisation in a pepper and salt method all over the country you would achieve nothing; that a city had to get to a certain minimal size before it started to generate its own growth. The figure given for that was a city with a population of between 50,000 and 100,000.",61,Albury Wodonga Development
170,Mr England,Gosford is almost denuded.,62,Albury Wodonga Development
171,Mr Coheni Do Not Know To What The,"The problem that we have had has been a political one. The Country Party has a sort of schizophrenic attitude towards the question of decentralisation. It wants it but it does not want it. Its members talk, about it in their electorates. They demand that it be their bailwick. They all want it so long as it is theirs but they do not want it in the next fellow's area. They expect it to be in every country town and this is simply not on. If honourable members read that decentralisation report I referred to they will recognise the common sense contained in it. The other problems with the members of the Country Party is that once they demand it in their own bailiwick they hope that it is not the one chosen because unfortunately decentralisation brings with it people who are known as urban voters and who inevitably vote not for the Country Party but for the Labor Party. Unfortunately the Country Party has had this schizophrenic attitude towards decentralisation. Its members talk about it. They are in favour of it just like the national anthem, motherhood, ANZAC Day and the Returned Services League. But by God if it ever happened they would all be out of this place on their ears. We must get away from ad hoc planning of the past. Unfortunately I have been asked to keep my speech within a limited time. I want to deal very briefly with the community which I represent, the community on the Central Coast of New South Wales. The development on the Central Coast is typical of the type of poor development that has occurred almost throughout the whole of Australia. The community has grown like Topsy. I do not say this in any derogatory sense but developers were allowed to pick off little sub-divisions hither and thither all over the Central Coast. They were able to move in on perhaps 100 blocks of land on the edge of a lake, near a river or down near a beach; flog them off without any kerbing, guttering, facilities libraries and recreation facilities. All those amenities have to be provided by the rest of the community. It is simply a matter of economics: If you have to provide all those sorts of facilities in a community to 60, 70 or 80 villages-and if honourable members are familiar with my area, they will know that it is broken up into a whole lot of little communities-it is a very expensive proposition. There are some major towns in my electroate, but there is an enormous number of places which one would describe as villages of 50 or 60 houses. Some little villages extend out 6 or 7 miles from the main centres. That means that the authorities have to provide 6 or 7 miles of bitumen road, telephone cable, electricity cable and so on. It is just as economical to provide those facilities for 1,000, 2,000 or 5,000 people as it is to provide them for 100 people. This is the way in which we have wasted our resources, and this is what we have to avoid in the future. This is what this new concept will do. We will move in and plan townships with communities of 4,000 or 5,000 people and suburbs of larger towns which perhaps will consist of 40,000 or 50,000 people. The whole project will be planned at the beginning. It may mean that a vastly greater amount of money will be out laid at the beginning, but in the long term the capital investment that is ploughed in in these early years will show an economic result in the future. We will do this rather than spend money constantly to get an adequate result, which we are doing now. For example, in the case of a road, a little dirt track is made, it is widened a few feet, a few years later a bit of bitumen is put on it, then as the population grows a 4-lane highway is put down, and so it goes on. Millions of dollars are expended over a long period of time, and this results in an enormous waste. If the project is planned, the 4-lane road is put down in the first place, and one bite is taken at the cherry. The same principle applies, whether it be telephone services, electricity, water, sewerage, schools, hospitals and so on. The final thing I want to say in the last few minutes of my speech is that as Chairman of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Road SafetyI have viewed with grave roads, electricity, telephone concern the enormous number of pedestrian deaths that occur in our community. About one-quarter of the 3,500 people killed on our roads every year are pedestrians. In a planned community, such as Canberra, the pedestrian death rate is about one-sixth of that in any other community in Australia. In the next 30 years we will build as many communities as we have built in the last 140 years. The Committee has asked the Department of Urban and Regional Development to make a submission to it, and the Department will do so. By planning our communities in this way we can save",62,Albury Wodonga Development
172,Mr Hewson,No sewerage.,63,Albury Wodonga Development
173,Mr Cohen,"No sewerage, hospitals,many thousands of lives. Pedestrian deaths, I repeat, comprise one-quarter of all Australian road deaths, and in most cases little children or older people are the victims. If we are looking for ways of saving lives, one way is to build communities in which one separates the pedestrian from the vehicle. The Radburn principle of planning, in which there are overpasses and underpasses, where children can play safely and walk to school, to playing fields and to shopping centres without ever coming into contact with a vehicle, is, I believe, the hope of the future. When I was in Western Australia recently I had the very great privilege of looking at a development called 'Crestwood', where a township is being built by a gentleman named Mr Sloane. It is a very fine performance. About 1,250 homes are to be built in an area in which the vehicle and the pedestrian are completely and utterly separated. I commend the Bill. I am delighted to see that the Opposition will support it. I look forward to the day when we will receive that unequivocal support on a whole range of measures. up one point that was made by the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Cohen). He referred to the lack of progress that had been made over a long period of years towards achieving a better balance in the distribution of population in Australia. I cannot help but agree with the comments that he made. I do not do it in any political sense because, although all politipared a valuable report as a result of those cal parties may have had a good philosophical approach to the problem of decentralisation and a better distribution of population, it has been very difficult over the period to get sufficient public enthusiasm for this approach in Australia. Governments of all political persuasions in all States have been aware of the problem, but they have not been able to approach the problem satisfactorily. Obviously, there is only one way in which they can make the sort of attack on the problem that is necessary, and that is with the aid of finance from the Australian Government. Honourable members, and indeed the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr what I thought was a heavy hand in his Uren), will recall that last year the former approach to the States, I commend him for Prime Minister introduced legislation to estabthe way in which he has been able to negolish the National Urban and Regional Developtiate with the various State governments to ment Authority. This is the genesis of the achieve the sort of machinery that has been legislation before us today. Indeed, in the necessary for new town development. It was debate at that time in September or October of last year I said: This proposal marks an historic landmark in the direction of Australia's future development. At the time of the introduction of this legislation to establish the National Urban and Regional Development Authority we also pointed to the mammoth task which would confront all governments, both State and Federal, in making a real dent on the problem. The Leader of my Party, the Right Honourable J. D. Anthony, made this comment when that legislation was introduced: It marks the beginning of a major attack on the imbalance of population and industry that has plagued the nation for a long time. The formation of the National Urban and Regional Development Authority was the result of many years of consultation between officials of the State and Commonwealth governments. They met together in an officers committee which was established to work out a formula that would provide a policy for the comprehensive and balanced development of Australia. During 1971 and 1972 the then Department of the Interior, upon my instruction, undertook far reaching studies of ways and means to set in train a pattern of new town development. Indeed, I asked the permanent head of that Department, Mr George Warwick Smith, to undertake an overseas study of new town development in the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Scandinavia. He prestudies. I also had general discussions with Sir John Overall who was at that time the Commissioner of the National Capital Development Commission and who later became the Chairman of the Cities Commission. I asked him to turn his mind to ways and means of bringing about new town development in Australia. As a consequence of these efforts and the other efforts, and indeed the years of efforts of the present Minister, who brought to his Department a degree of knowledge and a very good approach to the problem, we are now seeing an approach to comprehensive and balanced development getting off the ground. Although the Minister began the year with",63,Albury Wodonga Development
174,Mr Hunt (Gwydir) (3.39),"Firsdy, I takeno easy task. It would not have mattered as to what party the Minister had belonged; he would have had some difficulty in trying to accommodate the views of the various State governments, with their jealousies, and the position of the Commonwealth. I believe that if he had not approached the matter in the manner in which he has he would have imperilled progress towards any meaningful approach to any new pattern of urban and regional development. I think that the Mimster has shown a great example of how other Commonwealth Ministers should deal in their discussions with State Ministers. SoI commend the Minister quite sincerely for the way in which he has succeeded in getting the cooperation of the States. Earlier this year at a meeting of the MinisDepartment from the Treasury, so that there terial Council it was agreed to establish an interim consultative committee in regard to the Albury-Wodonga growth centre. After protracted negotiations an agreement was signed on 23 October 1973. Although it did not completely conform to the New South Wales Government's position, a compromise was reached. The structure of the proposed developvision of $9m in repayable loans to enable ment corporation ensured that the States of New South Wales and Victoria would have rights equal to those of the Australian Government. The agreement also required the States to program of decentralisation to succeed, it must establish land corporations or commissions be one of comprehensive balanced developto acquire land under State legislation, with ment. The recent savage Budget-the Minister the State nominated deputy chairman of the for Urban and Regional Development is not development corporation as the chairman of directly responsible for this-wit h its effect on the land corporation.

The States will retain the right to establish rural areas of Australia. The total budgetary their own policies of acquisition and comcost to rural Australia is of the magnitude of pensation payable in respect of land acquired $140m at least, and must be regarded as a for the development corporations. I undersevere blow to the rural areas of our nation. stand that within the next week or so the New South Wales Government will introduce legislation to set up a lands commission, which these measures came on top of the equivalent is essential. One thing is clear, namely, that of 3 appreciations of the Australian dollar no Iand owner should be either the benewhich reduced the returns to export industries, ficiary of a great land boom windfall in a whether they be rural, mining or manufacdesignated area or a loser as a result of an turing. Our exporters are now at a 26 per cent area being designated in an interim order. However, that is a matter for the States, although the Commonwealth is indirectly financing land acquisition by loans at the bond rate. Those loans are repayable by the States. There are provisions to assist the States in the repayment of some of those loans. There is provision also for grants to be made for specific projects. One would hope that the Government would be generous with grants in such an important national program, which we hope will remove the pattern of ugly urban development we have seen in Australia. If the Whitlam Government is serious and sincere in its approach to this problem, it should ensure that generous grants are made to the Minister and his is a degree of flexibility and so that non-repayable grants are available to the various State development authorities to enable the program to accelerate, now that it is getting off the ground. The allocation of $24m of loan funds for a new cities program is only a flea bite on the massive problem. The prothe New South Wales and Victorian Governments to commence a program at Albury Wodonga is but a start. Admittedly, $30m has been provided for land acquisition. For any in air charges and air fares will reverse any real efforts towards decentralisation in the It is more severe when one realises that disadvantage, in terms of currency and exchange rates, compared with their competitors in the United States of America and Canada. the Government had floated the currency. Your Leader is now advocating floating the currency. currency than to have it tied to the United States dollar when the United States dollar is getting stronger. We are continuing to appreciate from a high base as a result of 3 unilateral revaluations. We are informed that this year's Budget is only phase 1 of the adoption of the recommendations in the Coombs repoit. Phase2 and phase 3, certainly supported by the honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun), are yet to come. Yet, these measures are replaced by a $54m loan allocation to the States to aid a new cities program for the development of new cities within 150 miles of our capital cities. The combined result of these programs will accelerate the drift bf population to the cities. Needless to say, these measures tend to receive the applause of most of the metropolitan Press and editorial writers who are aiding what I believe to be a one-eyed, lopsided, crazy and ugly trend of population distribution and development in this country. Australia is the largest island continent in the world. It has vast resources, enormous space and a relatively small population; yet it has the most urbanised population in the world. It has a Prime Minister who calls himself a cities Prime Minister and calls his Government a government of the cities. In truth, Australia has all the ingredients for an escalating cities growth trend, although it has the opportunity to achieve comprehensive balanced development. It must be our national objective to ensure that our largest cities do not grow at their present rates and to such sizes that human endeavour within them takes too great a toll of human time, comfort and pleasure in living. Any attack on the problem of regional development should be directed towards ensuring that people who prefer to live in country towns or medium sized rural cities such as Dubbo may do so without forgoing a reasonable range of employment opportunities and a fair share of the social and economic opportunities at present found only in the major cities. The Whitlam Government's 2-pronged approach to comprehensive balanced development is not broad enough. In the longer term it will not be suflicient to alter the trend of population congestion in Australia. I believe that, if anything, it will tend to accelerate the drift in the movement of people to the metropolitan cities. The only way in which a real impact on the problem of gaining balanced development will be achieved is by a joint Commonwealth-State 4-pronged approach. I have said this before in the House. I reiterate it because I am sure that the Minister ultimately will see the sense in it, if only he can persuade his ministerial and party colleagues. That is not something that applies only to him; but it applies to all Ministers of all governments. If the Minister can persuade fellows such as the honourable member for Kingston on this point, then his job will be much easier. The first prong in my suggested approach is the commencement, on an annual basis, of selected regional growth centres, each to accommodate up to 300,000 people, and located throughout Australia and away from existing cities. The Minister would agree with that entirely. The second prong is a metropolitan redevelopment program to help overcome problems of population and environmental pressures in the major cities. The third prong is the provision of general incentives and subsidies to assist country areas to overcome their existing economic disadvantages for industry, commerce and investment and social disadvantages for the people. The fourth prong is that State governments should be given every encouragement to continue with their selective support in country towns generally in order to maintain a healthy and viable growth rate in those towns. People who live in country towns with a population of up to, say, 10,000 or more are Australians and are just as important as those who live in the cities. We are one people, one nation and one Australia. The first 2 prongs are of equal importance, and the prospect of any program achieving a balanced distribution of population, with people living at desirable standards, will depend upon the balance achieved in those 2 areas. The other 2 prongs in the approach are also important and appear to have been disregarded in the current approach to the problem. However, the main thrust in any decentralisation program must be towards selective decentralisation in spite of the political considerations and parochial jealousies it can",64,Albury Wodonga Development
175,Dr Gun,It would have gone up more if,66,Albury Wodonga Development
176,Mr Hunt,"It might be wiser to float thearouse. I concur fully with the Minister in that regard. The success of the program will also depend on the incentives it can offer industries to relocate or locate their enterprises in these new centres. It will depend on how much confidence it can inspire among those in the private sector to invest in the new development. Incentives offered to industry, especially labour intensive industries, should be designed to make them better off than similar industries in metropolitan areas. If they only neutralise cost disadvantages because of rural locations they fail to achieve the carrot objective. This is especially so when an industry's viability is related to its proximity to markets. Before concluding I wish to refer to one other aspect of the legislation-the land commissions. I have been provided with an information paper by the Department of Urban and Regional Development. Paragraph 3 on page 2 reads as follows: It is proposed that an Australian Land Commission of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) referred to will eventually be formed as the vehicle through which the agreements between tbe Australian Governthe fact that each of the States contained ment and the State governments would be brought within its boundaries at least one designated into effect and monitored and through which funds growth centre. He properly paid tribute to would be made available by the Australian the wisdom of the Minister for Urban and Government.

It is a mark of the fruitfulness of that the past 12 months by the Minister for Urban approach that we should have this legislation and Regional Development ( Mr Uren) in his setting up the Albury-Wodonga Development negotiations with the States on this important Authority at such a relatively early stage in matter of new city development I felt moved the lifetime of the Government and in the to pay a similar tribute to the Australian Counworking out of these new programs. Honourtry Party and to the honourable member. But able members opposite should be particularly with the best will in the world, thinking back pleased at the selection of Albury-Wodonga as over the record of decentralisation over the the last 23 years, I find it impossible to pay such a tribute. The statistics speak for themselves. The honourable member for Petrie( Mr Cooke), who is interjecting, may throw doubt on the statistics if he wishes, but the fact is that in 1947, 31 per cent of this country's population lived in non-urban areas, and In 1970-the last year for which consolidated statistics are available-onl y 14.7 per cent were still living in non-urban areas. The years of Liberal-Country Party hegemony have been years of steady decline in the rural population and of steady consolidation and growth of population in our 6 capital cities. The legislation which we have before us today will be remembered in the history of this country as marking a point of new departure. It will be remembered that, through this legislation, Australians broke out of the urban straitjacket of 6 capital cities in which they had lived throughout their history. The Albury-Wodonga project, exciting as it is in itself, is only the forerunner of further new city projects. In his speech today the Leader The Government has based its thinking on country that, in the words used by the Leader federalism, in that the Department and the first of the growth centres in the new program.

It is proof of the incapacity of this Government to bear a grudge that Albury-Wodonga has been singled out for the honour now bestowed upon it. We do not hold its history against it. It is important that we should not see the new cities program in isolation from the Government's overall approach to urban development, because whether it be the new cities, the noticed in the last week negotiations establishment of the land commissions, the program of catching up with the sewerage backlog in the existing State capitals, the monwealth assistance for making good the program for the upgrading of public transport, backlog in sewerage services of the State the program of improvement of recreational capitals. facilities initiated by my colleague the Minister for Tourism and Recreation ( Mr Stewart), ance will be provided in the form of low cost all these things are aspects of the practical loans and that when the process of negotiacommitment of this Government to the imtion still under way is complete very greatly provement of the quality of life for Australians augmented wherever they may elect to Uve.

We have frequently heard cited in this House the backlog in each of the State capitals in that respect. In the Bill before the House today we are tacking both these problems.

At the same time honourable members will have reaching the point of conclusion on the matter of ComThey will have noticed that for the one year period immediately ahead such assistsums will be provided not only in the form of low cost loans but also in the form of grants from the Australian Government to the States to see that this crucial backlog of services is made good. The Lands Commissions in themselves can It is for this reason that we in this Governcapitals. Similarly it gives an alternative to the person living at present in a rural community and obliged by economic pressures operating on that rural community to seek a different style of life in one of the established State capitals. That is why I was disappointed with the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Hunt) when he appeared to be over-anxious to have his cake and eat it in this matter of decentralisation, to argue at one and at the same time for the Country Party's traditional approach of dispersed developmenta program which has been so conspicuous a failure over the years-and in the same sentence almost to argue for the program of concentrated development to which this Government is committed. The simple fact is that the resources are limited and we cannot have both. The question is not whether we will have that if we had not done a number of things 6 State capitals and the present arrangement we did do undoubtedly the drift to the cities of dispersed development.

I am afraid the ous effect on decentralisation throughout the last speaker, the honourable member for whole of Australia but more particularly in Casey( Mr Mathews), brought in a certain the north. note of politics. I know it is extremely difficult in a place like this to keep politics out of it altogether but I feel it is a pity when I intend to make some critical remarks conwe get back to that old political stock-in-trade cerning certain aspects of the second reading of 'What did you do?'. Of course none of us speech of the Minister for Urban and Regional have been as successful in the field of Development ( Mr Uren), but this certainly does decentralisation as we would have wanted not mean that I oppose the principle of deceneither in the Federal sphere or in the State tralisation. I only oppose the way in which the sphere. The honourable member for Casey Government is carrying out some of this was blaming us for the drift to the city. There decentralisation. Ever since I came into this is no doubt whatsoever, and ngures can prove HouseI have spoken on many occasions on it, that this drift occurred over a period. It the necessity for decentralisation and the did not occur only during the period of necessity for policies which encouraged a government of my Party. The fact that we greater spread in the country. After all, we in were in power for 23 years did not give the the Liberal Party have decentralisation as our Labor Party an opportunity to show just what official plank. I was glad that it was the honsort of drift it would have had if it had been ourable member for Casey who mentioned the in power. The basic factor which has caused fact that one of the 2 meetings which led to this-I am afraid the honourable member for the formation of the Liberal Party was held Casey ignored it-is the vast change which at Albury. Going back even further, Corowa, has occurred in relation to land. In the old days-and I talk about the time when I first went on to my property-it was a manpower job. We were still using draught horses. In those days 10 men did less than 3 men would do towards the end of my time, because-manpower has been replaced with machinery. I am sure that the honourable member for Casey would not want us to go back to the days of almost peasant farming. If we go back far enough, it was peasant farming. We have got away from that situation and no one would think of going back to it. That is the basic reason why there has been a drift to the cities. I do not wish to extol the virtues of anything we should have done. AllI can say is ous effect. People do not often realise that Having said that, let me refer to this measure.",67,Albury Wodonga Development
178,Mr Fairbairn (Farrer) (4.11),"It is all during the decade of the 1960s at least 25which is not far from Albury, was where one of the major meetings which was held which led to Federation and to the formation of the Federal Parliament in which we sit. It is interesting that that area should be selected for this growth. I believe that the Liberal Party is the only political party which has as one of its officials planks an Australian nation in which decentralisation of industry is encouraged. A major problem in Australia, which has been brought forward and highlighted by previous speakers, is that it has a small population and an extremely large continent. I think that 40 per cent of our population lives in Sydney and Melbourne and 56 per cent lives in the capital cities. The worse feature is that the position is becoming worse. Between 1961 and 1969 the total population in New South Wales increased by 558,000. Of this number only 68,000 went into areas outside Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong. Some humourists stands for Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong, and I think that it virtually does because the rate of increase in Sydney in that period was 6 times that in country areas. If this rate continues, there will be some extreme problems with traffic congestion, transport, sewerage facilities, pollution and the availability of houses, land and water. As cities develop, public investment becomes skilled labour-to move to the area. I can more costly. I can recall the honourable memrecall that when the Borg-Warner Company's ber for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon), when he was factory was moved to Albury the company had Minister for the Interior, telling me that a considerable difficulty initially in getting its study carried out by his Department showed top management to settle in Albury. However, that it. cost almost twice as much to set up those who did go there were so thrilled with one person in Sydney as it did to set up one it after a short time that now there is a waiting person in Canberra. This was because of the list and people are anxious to go there as increased cost associated with traffic, roads, quickly as they can. water, sewerage and all the other services that went from the public sector into setting up we set up the National Urban and Regional that one person. I believe that all honourable members tioned already by the Leader of the Opposiwould like to see encouragement given to tion ( Mr Snedden). Whether we had won or people and to industry to relocate in the lost the election, this had been set up under country. There are advantages in country Sir John Overall, an extremely able person. I establishment and in dwelling in the country. believe that if a Liberal-Country Party GovernI suppose that one of the greatest advantages ment had remained in power it would have is the fact that there is less pollution, a better been extremely likely that the Authority would life closer to nature and less time lost in have recommended that Albury-Wodonga be transportation. It is not unusual for a person one of the first areas selected as future growth living in a city to take an hour or more going centres. I think the main difference between to work and another hour or more coming the Labor Party and our parties is the way in home from work each day. On the other hand, which our parties would have sought to build although there is less traffic congestion, very up Albury-Wodonga as a growth centre and little public transport is available in country areas and this means that in most cases country residents need to have their own transport. Basically, there are more recreational facilities in the country, although one might not get some of the spectacles, such as Collingwood v. Carlton and similar football matches. Nevertheless, I suppose that if we can see the Benalla and Albury teams play that is almost as good. Cheaper land is available in country areas. In most cases there is no shortage of labour, particularly female labour. Generally speaking, the country work force appears to be more reliable and stable, although not always as technically competent and skilled. Normally, in most country areas it is possible to get cheaper water and sewerage facilities. Against that, there are disadvantages. For instance, transport costs are more expensive. This is one of the greatest problems militating against industry setting up in the country, have said that N.S.W. which involves the cost of bringing raw material to a factory, then working on it and then sending the finished product back to where the major markets are located-usuall y in the Melbourne and Sydney areas. Also, there is the problem of higher telephone charges. I shall say a little more about that later. Further, if an industry does move into a country area it is not easy to get those who are working in the industry-in some cases I do not need to mention again the fact that Development Authority. This has been mento run the area. It is of interest to note that last year many of the citizens of Wagga, which also is in my electorate, were green with envy when they learned that Albury was to become a growth centre; but I can assure the Minister that today many of them are thanking their lucky stars that their city was not selected. I got. go there. I believe that a similar change has occurred in Albury-fro m a euphoria 12 months ago to a doubt, and I do not put it any higher than a doubt today. The Minister claims that the Bill represents 'our achievements', but the people of Albury are asking what has been the achievement. All that appears to have happened so far is a stopping of the natural growth. There was a rate of increase of about 6 per cent per annum and a great deal of this has been stopped. Ot course, land prices have been frozen and very few sales occur now. The Albury City Council does not know what authority it has, if any. It has been directed to cancel 5 major development projects that it was about to approve. The result is that industrial builders, who depend on major industrial projects and are not equipped for home building, have had to stand down staff and their activities are virtually at a standstill. Through me, the mayor and deputy mayor of Albury tried for some weeks-almos t months-to see the Prime Minister about some of these problems. Finally, we received word that he was too busy. After all, he was the greatest and he was going off to China. Last year he had plenty of time to see them, but unfortunately he has none today. I am afraid that it is quite obvious to me that there bers. But the Minister is claiming that events is no place for local government in the new set-up. Sooner or later, the councils or shires in the area either will cease to exist or will have so little authority as to make it difficult of committees, councils and bureaucracies. We to get anyone of top quality to stand for election to these bodies. Perhaps the Minister will point to the fact that the proposed Development Corporation will have 2 representatives of local government on it, one from New South Wales and one from Victoria. But they are in a minority of 2 to 3 government representatives. As three is a quorum, the State and Commonwealth representatives could operate on their own. Certainly, their view could prevail over that of the local people. am only pointing out to the Minister the problems. After all, I live in the area. The Minister goes there only occasionally and on many occasions, no doubt, he would be speaking to officials there and would not get the feeling to the same extent as would a person who lives in the area. I am sure that when the honourable member for Indi( Mr Holten) speaks on this matter he will inform the Minister of the same problems. Perhaps the Minister will point also to the fact that there is to be set up a consultative council which will have the function of advising the Development Corporation. Those of us who have witnessed the ineffectiveness of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council over many years could not have any faith that the views of the proposed council would be listened to or that it would be likely to attract people of the quality and ability that we would seek. People are attracted to local government because they have an executive role and not an advisory role. On occasions the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council has resigned because its members felt that their advice was not accepted. I expect that the Albury Wodonga council will find itself in the same position. The situation is bad enough in Canberra. The Minister responsible for the Australian Capital Territory at least resides for some part of the year in the Territory. But it will be much more difficult to control the growth of Albury-Wodonga from 200 miles away. A great deal will depend on the ability, especially in the field of urban development and city planning, of the Commission memhave moved quickly and that the Government has achieved a great deal. I feel that all that it has achieved so far has been the creation still seem to be a long away from getting a final plan or even a suitable interim plan. As a result, uncertainties and confusion exist. Neither has the Government foreshadowed any way in which Albury-Wodonga is to be encouraged to grow. Canberra has grown on the strength of the public servants mostly transferred from Melbourne, and later increased in number as Australia grew. I cannot see Albury ever housing very many Commonwealth public servants. It would be too",69,Albury Wodonga Development

Albury-Wodonga must grow as the result of attracting industry. There is no other way in which it will grow. What people are waiting for is some indication of how and when this is to be done. So far, the policies of this .Government, such as revaluation and tariff cuts, have led to the closing down of some local industries which appeared to have good prospects a year ago but which cannot today compete with overseas industries. What we want to know as soon as possible is this: What are these incentives to be? Will tax concessions be available to decentralised industry? Will subsidies be provided with respect to freights, rates, land costs, power costs, and fuel costs which, of course, as my colleague from Gwydir( Mr Hunt) pointed out have recently been increased? When will the Government implement its which were going ahead naturally have ceased election promise to give local call access by to go ahead.

He said that this action would the end of this debate. Will the Government agree to freehold tenure? This, I think, is probably the most important question of all-certainl y from the the honourable member's remarks is that the point of view of the people who live in that measures that we are considering today are an area. They want a freehold tenure system, acknowledgement of the fact that the urban and it is desired by the State (Governments of New South Wales and Victoria. How much of the funds which the States will use for land acquisition, development and building works will be repayable loan funds, carrying the present interest rates which, under Labor as we know, are running at the highest level in living memory? Should a 5 per cent preference be given to country industries and should loans be offered to those industries? I understand that such action is undertaken to some extent by State governments. Overseas it is not unusual for loans to be offered to industry, for example, in such remote areas as Sardinia or regions of Scotland where the setting up of industry is desired. Has the Australian Government plans to do the same? I see that the time available to me in this debate has nearly expired. I say to the Minister that I am sorry if I have sounded overcritical. But the fact is that for 12 months now in Albury we have faced a situation in which all that happened has been a freeze. Things Dr GUN (Kingston) (4.30)I rise adversely affect the level of population in the Australian country districts. The first thing which ought to be said about population of Australia will increase, whatever may happen in other respects. Irrespective of the prosperity or otherwise of the countryside, the urban population in Australia will increase. Our aim is to ensure by these measures that that urban population will not all be concentrated in the 6 capital cities. We to make land available as cheaply as is poswish to try to avoid our cities acquiring excessive size, and to establish new regional growth centres. This action, therefore, has nothing to do with the size of the rural population in our various country towns and villages. That is a separate matter. Nevertheless, the honourable member for Party Opposition in the Senate wants to depart Gwydir did raise a couple of points which I from this principle. By and large, the idea of wish to rebut. He said that the withdrawal of the Crown acquiring land and developing it certain subsidies and tax concessions would as cheaply as possible for home purchasers be damaging to the rural community. The fact has been adhered to by governments of all is that the loss of income which the rural political complexions ever since 1908. community may have suffered as a result of the withdrawal of these concessions and subsidies has very much more than been offset by gested that the previous Liberal-Country Party the boom in commodity prices in the rural Government should take the credit for these sector. As much or more money is available measures because it established the National for re-investment and expansion in the rural Urban and Regional Development Authority. sector from the return on present prices for It should be pointed out that it did so in the rural commodities as would have been availdying weeks of its term of office. In actual able if no increase had occurred in those fact the credit should rightly go to the present prices and had we retained all the subsidies, Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, because of his tax concessions and the plethora of other attention to and preoccupation with the probbenefits which were provided by the Country lems of the cities for several years. In 1970 I Party for 23 years on behalf of the sectional suggested to the right honourable member for interests for which it operated. We believe that the specific problems faced people of the Australian Capital Territory in country areas must be overcome by from the acquisition by the Crown of land at measures designed to help directly those in rural prices and its subdivision and developcountry areas who suffer definite need. These ment at low cost perhaps ought to be passed problems cannot be overcome by a blanket on to the people in the States. That suggestion measure such as tax concessions or subsidies fell on deaf ears. It was only quite recently because such action benefits selectively the that the Liberal Party of Australia saw the better off people in the rural community who error of its ways previously. It now agrees that do not face the problem of rural poverty. measures which have applied for many years Rural poverty should be treated as a social in the Australian Capital Territory are also welfare problem. People suffering rural appropriate to the rest of Australia. As a result poverty should be treated by social welfare of that and as a result of the initiatives taken measures designed selectively to help those by the present Government, negotiations have people who are most in need. Of the 4 Bills now before the House, the ernment and the governments of New South one on which I wish to speak primarily is the Wales and Victoria about the acquisition of Land Commissions (Financial Assistance) land for the development of Albury-Wodonga Bill. The purpose of this Bill is to provide as a growth centre. land for housing purposes at as low a cost as possible to families which want to buy houses. obtained on 1 October 1972 and in accordance This is a very good exercise in co-operation with the principle that there is no justification between the Commonwealth and the State for the Crown's paying urban prices to a governments. The concept is that this money will be provided by the Commonwealth to assist the State governments to purchase land prior to the development of that land. First by the provision of cheap land and secondly by planned development we will be enabled sible and to develop it as efficiently as is possible. Of course, this proposal contains nothing new. This is the system that has operated in the Australian Capital Territory for many years. Unfortunately, judging by its attitude recently to the acquisition of land in Canberra, it looks as if the Liberal-Country The honourable member for Gwydir sugHiggins( Mr Gorton), who was then the Prime Minister, that the benefits which flow to the. been conducted between the Australian GovThat land will be acquired at prices which farmer for his broad acres. That is a principle to which the Australian Labor Party holds very dearly. I am glad to see that the governments of New South Wales and Victoria have gone along with it in the case of the Albury Wodonga project. The same principle is applied in South Australia. Land prices in the new city of Monarto in South Australia have been set at a certain value. An allowance has been made for some increase because of inflation but, by and large, the price at which land will be acquired at Monarto will be the same as the price which obtained at a particular date. So it is quite a simple proposal. Unfortunately the track record of the Libwhich the Opposition has to the leasehold eral Party on this question is a rather mixed system. After all it is the system which has one. I have mentioned what happened in 1970 operated for some years and which still when I made certain suggestions to the then operates-admittedl y in a prostituted formPrime Minister about'Canberra. We have had in the Australian Capital Territory. There is the episode in recent weeks of the acquisition no difference between leasehold land and freeof 'Lanyon' station for the development of the hold land as far as the security of tenure of satellite city of Tuggeranong. In the case of the property built on it is concerned. If a that acquisition the present Government has person has a house in his name and the title sought to uphold the views of the previous to the land in his name his security of tenure Minister for the Interior, the present honourto his house is the same irrespective of able member for Gwydir, that the proprietors whether he holds the land in fee simple or of 'Lanyon' station should be paid at rural leasehold.

A farmer who is in cohorts with a private land developer can make a capital gain, instead of the Crown. We believe that there should be no unearned -increment; the savings should be passed on to the person who purchased the land so that the cost of providing a house for his family will be lower. The honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn) spoke about the question of leasehold land. It is not suggested under any of these measures that the States must provide land on a leasehold basis, but for the life of me I cannot understand the obsessional fear The object of the Lands Commission mentioned that such land will be purchased at rural prices and that the person who owns the One of the alternativesI believe it was cities, but it is still required because that is suggested to the committee of inquiry being where the jobs are. We can overcome the conducted by Mr Justice Else-Mitchell-is problem of the high cost of providing serviced a system of restricted freehold, which would blocks by building our regional growth centres, to some extent curtail the ability of a person but they will not be of any use to anybody who obtains land cheaply to capitalise upon unless there is sufficient employment there.

Another method by which the lands must decentralise employment opportunities as commissions in the various States would be much as we can by either providing them in able to control land prices is by making land the growth centres or providing the means of freely available and not withholding certain commuting between the growth centres and blocks from the market, which is a common the capital cities. practice with private developers.

183,Mr Holten (Indi) (4.48),"I commence byspeakers implied that the Country Party did not have a policy on decentralisation. So to put it on the record I quote from the policy of the Australian Country Party. It states under the heading 'Decentralisation': The balancing of the growth and development of Australia is basic to the policies of the Australian Country Party. Australia is already one of the most urbanised nations, with the majority of people living in only nine cities on the edge of the continent. Correlated with the need to check the drift of population from the country to the city are the increasingly seriousfinancialand social problems associated with centralisation. It is the belief of the Australian Country if they had a chance to study the legislation. Party that decentralisation of industry as an aid to correcting the rapidly increasing imbalance of population distribution is of vital importance to Australia. I place that current Country Party policy on decentralisation on the record. I welcome the introduction of these Bills into the Parliament. I accept the concept of them and the principles involved, but there are some aspects that concern not only me but also people whom I have the honour and responsibility to represent in this Parliament. As most honourable members will know, the Wodonga section of the Albury Wodonga growth complex is in the electorate of Indi, which I represent. I will be putting forward to the House some of the areas of concern that my constituents have expressed to me. The objective of the Biills is to give legislative meaning and authority to the historic agreement which was signed by the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) and the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria in Wodonga in the electorate of Indi on 23 October. I had the privilege of being present at the signing. It must be emphasised that for this agreement to work as it is intended to work the 2 State government Acts are crucial in the overall picture. Proper debate on the ramifications of the complex legislation before the House is not really possible without the availability of the other 2 sets of corresponding Bills which must be passed respectively by the Parliaments of New South Wales and Victoria. The Victorian Bills are available, but have become available only in the last few days. To me it is regrettable that the Government has again rushed legislation into the House before adequate time has really been given for consideration. This set of Bills involves many complex issues, and it is most unsatisfactory to many people-man y of my constituents and people both inside and outside the House -that there has been insufficient time to assess all the aspects and effects of this legislation. him an example. I referred to people outside the House. The legislation arrived on the table of the House only last week. the worries that people have. They might have other worries that they would bring to the fore I said that I would be passing on some of the concern of my constituents, and these are thoughts that have been expressed to me. As I mention, the 2 sets of State government Bills should be available to be read in conjunction with these Bills so as to ensure that the terms and conditions of the agreement signed on 23 October between the States and the Commonwealth have been fully included. Unfortunately these sets of Bills are not available. I am well aware of the necessity to get things moving and to keep things moving in the Albury Wodonga area, but more time should have been allowed. I am aware of all the difficulties in this matter, but I repeat that more time should have been allowed to give citizens and their advisers the opportunity to study the legislation from both the State and Federal Parliaments. As I understand it, the New South Wales legislation is not before the Parliament as yet. There is a tremendous feeling of frustration and stagnation and also feelings of uneasy concern affecting many people in the cities of Albury and Wodonga at the moment. The Albury-Wodonga area, of course, is a natural for a growth complex. Many people naturally are associating themselves with the concept or with having thought of the concept of developing Albury-Wodonga in a population and economic sense in order to diminish the growth of Melbourne and Sydney. There are many people who fought over a long period of time to gain more facilities in the Albury Wodonga area. My thoughts turn to the late Dr Merrylees, to whom I would like to pay a brief tribute, because he was so energetic and enthusiastic in his advocacy of the development of the regions of southern New South Wales, northern Victoria and northeastern Victoria. I am sure that his drive and determination played a big part in keeping the Albury-Wodonga area in the forefront of government thinking. He would be a happy man if he were alive today.",75,Albury Wodonga Development

The news release quoted me as saying that I was urging continuing pressure to gain support from the Federal Government for the establishment of a university in the Albury-Wodonga area. I wrote to the Australian Universities Commission in June 1966, suggesting that it should initiate discussions on the possibility of the New South Wales and Victorian State governments combining to ret up a joint university, thus adopting the principle of co-operation between Federal and State governments. In that article I suggested that the Secretary of the Universities Commission should visit the area with a view to establishing the suitability of the Albury-Wodonga area as a site for a joint university.

189,Mr Holten,"Thank you. Great concernand government supported or industry supported superannuation schemes that will provide for their retirement. They have not had paid annual holidays, sick leave and so on. It is very important that these people have their rights protected by both Federal and State legislation. Every avenue must be taken to ensure that the principle of just compensation is made mandatory in regard to acquisition. Other areas of concern have been expressed to me. I have been asked whether this move is decentralisation or centralisation. Other people have said: 'Why do we have to have this Development Corporation at all? We already have certain local governnient and government machinery within this area and we are going along pretty well at the moment. Progress in the Albury-Wodonga area has been very good without the Development Corporation'. Migrants are mentioned specifically in the Bill. They want to know the reason for that. People are concerned that the principle of land tenure is still not clear. I favour the freehold system. I know that the Victorian State Government also favours the freehold system. I realise that the Government is waiting to see the recommendations of the ElseMitchell Committee before making a decision. But the Premiers should be commended on their stand, with the Commonwealth at the last moment, of insisting that another look be taken at the principle of land tenure. They are some of the things about which the people in the Albury-Wodonga area are concerned, and quite rightly so. I now want to refer to a part of the policy speech which has not yet been carried out. I am not saying that an undertaking was given to carry this out in the first year. But everyone will be watching very closely to see that the Government maintains its undertaking in regard to the equation between the costs of telephone calls in the Albury Wodonga area and in other areas. The Government said: In our first term of oflice, we will concentrate our own initiative and endeavours on 2 areas-Albury Wodonga and Townsville. The Government said that the cost of telephone calls and telephone rentals in these new growth centres will be the same as the cost of those services in the capital cities. The puzzling factor to me, which indicates a little inconsistency, misunderstanding and disagreement on the part of the Government, is the Prime Minister's statement about the Dartmouth Dam, which of course will be vital to the future of Albury-iWodonga. We had the extraordinary spectacle of the Prime Minister a couple of months ago writing to the Premiers of the 3 States concerned-South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria-and suggesting that the expenditure on Dartmouth Dam should be deferred or cut down. He got short shrift, of course, from the Premiers of those 3 States. It seems contrary to the whole philosophy of encouraging decentralisation, which, of course, is the basis of this Bill, that the Prime Minister of Australia should advocate the deferral of expenditure of money on the great Dartmouth Dam project. Of course this dam will be further above Albury Wodonga than the Hume Weir. The Prime Minister's action was extraordinary. I should like to mention other matters but unfortuantely my time has almost run out. Therefore, I am not able to mention all the aspects to which I wanted to refer. They include a statement by Senator Geitzelt on 28 November 1972, that the people of Albury-Wodonga would think Father Christmas had arrived when the Labor Government got into power. The Government has loaned the people only $9m, which they will have to repay with interest. The ultimate practical success of this project will call for the highest level of goodwill and co-operation between the Federal and State Ministers, departmental officers, local government and local residents. I wish the whole project well. Any individual or organisation that seeks my assistance and co-operation in any sphere connected with the development of this Albury-Wodonga project will certainly receive my wholehearted support. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. appointing that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Indi( Mr Holten), on the one hand supports the legislation before the House, and on the other hand has to fall back on the old catch cry of the Australian Country Party of talking about support for decentralisation and calamity howling about the provisions of the Budget that has been adopted.

What a ridiculous attitude for a Minister to adopt. In effect the Minister said that police were available and will be used to ensure that higher land prices are obtained for the New South Wales Treasury coffers. However apparently there are not enough police in New South Wales to prevent fire bombings in Kings Cross. I hope that the establishment of the lands comniission will put an end to that kind of approach by the New South Wales Government to the provision of home sites. The result of the contrived scarcity of land and the artificially high land prices in the Lake Macquarie shire in my electorate can be seen in the new land valuations now issuing in that shire. Increases range from the order of 200 per cent up to 500 per cent and in some cases 1,000 per cent compared with the previous valuations of 1968-69. Ratepayers, many of whom are pensioners, will be faced with staggering rate increases. Clearly, some will be rated out of their homes. Those who are on fixed incomes will be the most vulnerable. I have no doubt that the council will seek to adjust its 1974 rate on the basis of the new valuations but no fiat rate in the dollar on an across the board application can take account of the distortion in values that occurs following speculation in properties and the artificial forcing up of the price of land. The presentation of this legislation to the Parliament signals a new high in the closer co-operation of this Government and the various State governments. I remind honourable members of the Opposition of this. It shows that it can be done and is being done and that the States do want to co-operate. It shows that there can be harmony and productive liaison between the Federal Government and the States for the benefit of the community, contrary to the phoney divisive catchcries of members of the Opposition parties who seek to fool the people into believing that Labor is out destroy the States. We know the results of the Opposition's 23 years of stagnant administration that catered only to the concern of the vested interests who donated so heavily to their campaign funds. It is appropriate, in conclusion, to recognise the achievements of the Minister who in hisfirstyear of office has made great progress through wise negotiation and supreme patience in reaching agreements with his State counterparts and in bringing this Bill before the House. I support the Bill. debating 4 Bills and much time has been devoted to that aspect of those Biills which relates to the regional growth centre proposed for Albury-Wodonga. The Albury-Wodonga concept is only part of the total program which the Oppoosition is supporting. The program involves the development and establishment or a corporation to create Albury Wodonga as a growth centre. It involves also the provision offinancefor the establishment of other growth centres. It involves the provision of finance, though for one year only, to land commissions. In the area of urban development, using that in its broadest concept, there have been in recent years exciting developments. It is unfortunate if too much credit is sought by any particular political Party because the improved development in urban areas and urban thinking is a result of changes in community attitudes. As we have overcome other difficulties so the attention of the Australian people has been directed to the importance of the urban environment. For years we have lived on the myths of our early reading of the characteristics of small towns but the psychology of the small town life is now becoming part of history for the great majority of Australians. The life we live is a life in complex large urban areas. The problems that confront these large urban areas are quite different to the problems that confront small centres. The solution to those problems must necessarily be different to the solutions that would apply to problems encountered in small towns. As the community has become aware so have all those involved in the political process in this country become deeply conscious of the concern of the average Australian for the improvement of the urban environment. This has meant that we have directed our attention to both the improvement of the existing urban environment and the more rapid establishment of new urban areas. There was a time when as a people we accepted the fact that when we bought our first home it might be on the outskirts of a large city and it might be located in an area where public facilities and services were lacking. But, as our affluence",78,Albury Wodonga Development
192,Mr Wilson (Sturt) (5.22),"We arehas grown so too, as with so many of the consumer durables that we have come to regard as essential whereas 2 generations ago they were a luxury, have we come to expect the development of urban areas into which we move for our first home to be of a high standard. And that is quite rightly so. As a result of this emerging consciousness by the Australian people as to the importance of urban development we have seen increasing attention paid to the policies of governments -national , State and local-in ensuring that the environment is developed in an orderly fashion. The concepts that are involved in these Bills, as I have pointed out, have been developed over a long period under governments of all political persuasions both here in Canberra and in the States. We are reaching a stage where there is a much deeper public consciousness of the importance of paying attention to policies relating to urban development. We are recognising that there is a need in the large cities not merely for the provision of roads, kerbs, drains, water reticulation and electricity, but also for the provision of adequate open space, recreation areas and recreation facilities. This is a good thing because the type of life that we are able to live in these large urban areas where people are highly mobile is being progressively improved. But it is important that in all of these policies we should ensure that the maximum amount of freedom of choice is left in the hands of the individual citizen. It is equally important that there should be a maximum amount of community involvement. I hope, as a result of the expressions contained in the various speeches made by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren) about the Government's desire to involve the community in some of the decision making that affects them, that most of the States have legislation that would the comments express a real concern and do not merely pay lip service to an aspirations of match that test, but there is one aspect of the people. When we look at urban areas we the matching of that test which causes me tend to apply a small town psychology to some concern. In a case that was decided community involvement. I direct the attention before the High Court it was indicated that of the House to the importance of recognising it was not necessary for a.court to take account that we are dealing with large cities and that of the declining value of money in assessing what we formerly described as a community compensation-the decline between the date based rigidly on geographical boundaries may of acquisition and the date of payment folnot necessarily apply today. There has been a lowing a judgment in the court. There has manifestation of the community's desire to be been much debate in academic and other involved in urban development, by the expancircles amongst people of all political persion of resident action groups and council suasions concerned about stabilising land action groups. I believe that it is important that this community desire to participate should receive the response of government so that people can play a real part in the decision making process on the type of environment in which they live. Having made those general remarks, I wish to draw the attention of the House to a number of points. I express my concern at the way in which this legislation could possibly be used. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) drew the attention of the House to some of these points earlier today. Were it not for the fact that the legislation involves grants for one year only, that we are able to see the manner of its operation and that there will be an opportunity of examining this legislation in closer detail in another place, it could well be that we would have been seeking the inclusion in the legislation of specific guarantees to allay the concerns that have already been expressed and to which I shall now direct the attention of the House. The first point I want to deal with relates to the question of acquisition and the compensation paid to the owners of land that is acquired. The second point relates to the question of tenure. Under the Australian Constitution, if this Parliament wishes to acquire land it is obliged to make compensation available on just terms. There is nothing in this legislation which requires that the States to whom the money is to be granted are themselves to acquire the land on just terms. I hope that the Minister, in laying down conditions, will make it a condition of the grants that acquisition legislation used to acquire land with this money should match the standards set by the Constitution for Commonwealth acquisition of land and that the States be required to acquire on just terms. From my researches so far it appears that prices, as to the manner in which compensation should be assessed. Stabilisation of land prices differs substantially from what might be described as price control. I draw to the attention of the House a statement issued by the Ministerial Council Meeting of Land Commissions held in Melbourne on Monday, 22 October 1973. In that statement Ministers from Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development stated as follows: The distinction between control of land prices generally and land price stabilisation for growth centres or areas was recognised. The latter seeks only about the value of Iand as compared with an to preserve for the community, rather than for specuinflation factor. They have talked about relators and individuals, any increase in land values which arises from a Government's decision for the benefit of the community on growth centres or areas. Similar sentiments were expressed in the report issued by the Department of Urban and Regional Development. It said that land price stabilisation legislation 'is aimed at ensuring that land does not inflate in value merely because it has been chosen for acquisition for urban development. Such inflation could make the land so costly that the States would be unable to continue with their plans to acquire the land and develop the area.' If one accepts that approach and says that the land owner should receive the value of the land as at the date of announcement that his land is to be acquired in order to guarantee that he receives just terms-'just ' in a real senseI think it is important that account be taken of the fact that compensation paid 10 years from the date of the announcement may not necessarily be just terms compared with payment immediately after the announcement and at the time of actual acquisition. I am not suggesting for a moment that the land owner should gain as a result of any government decision that land shall be brought into urban use, but I point out to the Minister that there is a gradient between land in urban use and that now in rural use. I believe that it should be recognised when we look at compensation that, as a result of that gradient or hope value that has been placed upon certain land, the land owners under the gradient, yet not at the rural Iand price level, should receive just compensation. We hear a lot about the large speculator, but I draw to the attention of the House the fact that there are many small property owners and home owners whose homes will need to be acquired for the development of growth centres and land on the edges of existing cities. Account must be taken to ensure that the real value of their asset is preserved. The Institute of Urban Studies has put forward a land conversion value proposition. In its report it says that the conversion value would need to be carefully defined before inclusion in special legislation. I agree with this. It needs to be carefully defined. I believe there should be a guarantee within the legislation to ensure that just and fair terms are provided. I draw the attention of the House to the fact thaf the Minister and his Department have made general statements about this. They have talked lating it to some form of price index. I express concern that a great amount of detail has not been put forward as to how the real value of a person's assets will be preserved to ensure that he is not disadvantaged, while not advantaged, at the expense of the community as a consequence of government announcement. The other matter to which I should like to refer but have not the time because of the limitations upon this debate, is that I too would stress the importance of retaining freehold tenure for residential urban land. I should like to have seen this guarantee included in the legislation so that it was mandatory on State land commissions when they come to sell their land to sell it under terms of freehold tenure so that there could be no fear that the home owner could sustain a loss by confiscation as a result virtually of forfeiture consequent upon his breach of some minor covenant in the lease. I think these matters can await examination in another place or can be included subsequently in legislation to make grants available in future years. I urge the Minister to look at the question of the provision of adequate compensation as if the constitutional requirement were there for the provision of just terms and a recognition of the importance of providing an increase in value to take account of the declining value of money notwithstanding an earlier decision of the High Court taken under different conditions and at a different time. It is pleasing to see that members of the Opposition Parties are supporting the Bills which are before the House, even if they do so with some",81,Albury Wodonga Development

I agree with him that this is obvious that if a government, or for that matter any other community organisation, proship of representatives of community interests duces works in an area which increases the value of the land which has no relationship whatsoever to the effort which the original groups, trade unions, women's groups and new owner of the land has put in, the original owner of the land is entitled to compensation raises and those referred to it by the Developonly on the value of that land and the money that it would have brought if the land had been sold under normal circumstances. I draw attention to problems which have centralism of power in Canberra. One much arisen in the United States of America where more important thing to my mind is the centbuildings and land have been acquired for the ralisation of power in the major capital cities. national estate or its equivalent. In fact, in Local governments do not have any real say times past, there has been quite a jockeying at all.

Many times we have heard talk about the would have extreme difficulty in setting up a I think it is important to note that if we include many scenic areas. If we do not siphon off the population increase which inevitably will occur in Sydney and Melbourne over the next 30 years, these particularly beautiful areas and places of recreation for both the major cities of Melbourne and Sydney and perhaps others in time will be lost to the public. I do not want to see that happen; neither do the people who live in those areas. Another aspect which I think I should mention is that working people are spending more and more of their time in travelling across major urban areas. What is the good of reducing the working week when a very great proportion of the potential increased recreation time is to be spent in travelling. I would like to see, as I have mentioned before in speeches on related subjects, a completely new look at the way in which cities are designed. One of the very big problems in urban life arises from the motor car, which has made life in cities very difficult. Yet without motor cars it would be most difficult to move around in outer suburban areas. We have just not bothered to plan our transport properly. I should like to see much more thought given in the future to linear cities or similar types of development to ensure that people can use public transport effectively and easily, to ensure that they only need to walk a short distance from their home to obtain public transport. That is not an impossible dream. It is something than can be achieved with proper planning. When one flies over Australia one observes the huge open spaces and realises that the scope for development of our continent is tremendous. We ought to take up the challenge. 1 should like to quote the following statement that was made about 30 years ago and of the past will not be repeated or aggravated. is repeated in the report to the Australian There is no doubt in my mind that Australia's Government by the Cities Commission: The unplanned development of towns has led to tralisation means far more than encouraging a unplanned transport and to an excessive amount of few industries to establish themselves outside travelling between different parts of large towns. the big capital cities, although this industrial This in turn had involved high cost of transport to movement may be termed the core of decenthe community as a whole, as well as to the individual who pays this cost not only in money but tralisation.

The decentralisation of industry and is a vital national problem, and to succeed it the possibility of establishing satellite towns will need must become a national way of thought. to be considered. Unfortunately it has taken 30 years to get the greatest promise of any in the world. to this stage. I am sure that all those who What a grand thing it would be if we had a have thought about town planning would welcome this latest move with open arms as it will provide a real opportunity for Australians to have an improvement in their quality of life, so that we do not have to suffer the problems of pollution, open drains and similar inconveniences that exist in the areas around Melbourne that I spoke of before. Finally, something must be done about land speculation. This is one way of approaching the problem. I do not buy the argument of some honourable members opposite who assert that we must have freehold land tenure. This system does not really work. The honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun) has pointed out already that this is really a complete myth and unless it is for rather base political motives I am at a loss to understand why some Opposition members are endeavouring to frighten the Australian public on this matter. A variant of it has worked very successfully in Canberra and I would like to see the principle extended generally. This would have undoubtedly a great effect on the value of land in Australia. Young people would be able to buy land much cheaper than they can now. This and the associated Bills are very important. I am very pleased to see that the measure has the support of the House and I hope that it will receive just as much support in the other place. today is entering an era of development which was never envisaged when the first settlement took place less than two centuries ago, and which was not fully realised even at the time of federation 72 years ago.

But it produces a state one must look back to Australia's history to of affairs where those outside the big cities see how the present division of administration not fully sympathetic to their needs. occurred and where it fell short of perfection. Its basic cause lies in the fact that for many years after 1788 Britain had no interest in governments have been totally unmindful of Australia other than as a place in which to their obligations to all the people in their dump unwanted citizens.

There were few big enough to create employment opportunities over and above the labour force available locally that would bring new people to the locality. The big industries continue to crowd the capital cities. It is argued that they must be established there because that is where the labour is. That is not a wholly valid argument. Obviously the labour is there, because that is where the jobs are. Continuing to provide avenues of employment in the big cities is only further ensuring that more labour congregates there. It must follow that, if jobs are created elsewhere, the labour will move to them. One of the classic examples of this is the Latrobe Valley in Victoria. There could be no suggestion that the great industry of this valley should be established in Melbourne, because the very essence of it, the huge browncoal deposits, happen to be 90 miles away from Melbourne. Another example is Broken Hill, a city of 30,000 inhabitants in what is a barren and somewhat unprepossessing area. If labour could be found for the Latrobe Valley because the brown coal was there, and if labour could be found to establish a city of 30,000 people at Broken Hill because the silver-lead was there, it must follow that if a big automobile plant is established in a relatively small town or city the labour will move to it. There is only one difference in the 2 cases. In one case circumstances force the establishment on a site, whereas in the other case private enterprise cannot be forced to set up its establishments in any particular place. But governments may point the way, and can encourage such movements, whilst industry itself should be able to realise that by crowding into the big cities it is contributing to their target potential in time of war and to a bad balance of population in times of peace. In addition to the defence and population imbalance factors, there is a third reason why we must endeavour to slow down, stop, or even reverse, the growth of the big capital cities. It is simply enormous cost that such moves would involve, that Australia cannot afford such large cities. A factor not often realised, but nevertheless true, is that big cities cost money. These are costs that every nation must eventually meet, but they should not have to be met on the present scale in a countiy with a population of only approximately 13 million people. Like our over-large administrative divisions, our big cities are a legacy of our history. They began as ports, simply to supply the needs of the settlers. They became the administrative centres for colonies covering large areas. When people began to move inland, the governments stayed where they were. Commerce gathered around them, and eventually industry followed. Because of this administrate failure to reach out into the new land, as the Americans had done, commerce, industry and administration all became concentrated in the one spot. It was simply a case of applying a European administrative concept in an American-sized countiy. There seems to be in Australia a general conception that a State capital must also be the chief port. That is not so. It is interesting to note that of the SO American State capitals only three, Boston in Massachusetts, Providence in Rhode Island and Honolulu in Hawaii are ports, and of these only Boston can be regarded as being a port of any importance in the American scene. There is also the view that the capital must be the largest city. Again, only 14 of the SO American State capitals fall into this category. Obviously when, a century ago, our States became self-governing colonies, no consideration was given to whether the place where the administration had been set up for the convenience of far away England was, in fact, the best site for the capital of the colony. It is interesting to note that, in the last 100 years, the population of Ballarat has risen from approximately 47,000 to approximately 65,000, while that of Brisbane has increased from 22,000 to 817,000. The fact that Brisbane became the chief port for the south Queensland area made it inevitable that it would leap ahead of Ballarat which was, in any case, bound to lose population as the gold rush subsided. However, it is obvious that the retention of administration at Brisbane has resulted in the proportional increase being out of all reason. Naturally at this stage it is too late to make a change. Leaving aside the it is doubtful whether any useful purpose would be achieved, for the capitals have developed where they are. However we should recognise them as mistakes of the past and not repeat them in the future. Unfortunately the mistake is already being repeated in Darwin. The capital of a territory 1,000 miles long, it is being groomed as a future State capital for the whole of that area. It is the chief port, the chief air terminal and the administrative centre. As Darwin grows, commercial and industrial life will concentrate there while the remainder of activity in the Territory, except for mining and a few other allied industries, will be left to develop more slowly. It is another Sydney or Melbourne in embryo, and 100 or 150 years from now the scattered inland people will feel just as badly about metropolitan-dominated government there as country people in New South Wales do now. Darwin has an assured future as a port and an air terminal. The Government should be assuring a future for some other centre. The establishment of new States cannot adjust Australia's population imbalance overnight. In fact the big cities have such a start that there will always be a fairly bad imbalance. However, with a realistic administrative approach to the problem, new States will achieve much that is worthwhile. First, they will give people who are now a long way from their administrative centres the opportunity to govern themselves. Secondly, they will produce more compact areas, with which the administration will be in closer touch. Thirdly, they will provide an opportunity to draw industires to particular areas. Fourthly, provided the total force is not simply enlarged, they will draw their public service from the existing and reduced States, bringing with them people to provide the necessary additional services. Fifthly, they will create avenues of employment; they will have to draw on the big cities for labour. Lastly, they will produce a change in the 'centre of gravity' of people's thinking, a new spirit and a new interest. All these factors must tend to slow down the growth of the big cities and build up smaller cities elsewhere, but they must be accompanied by a virile decentralisation policy in the States governed from the big capitals lo ensure a better dispersal of population to the new areas. Many proposals for new States have been made. The most active movement has been in the New England area of New South Wales. Proposals have also been made for new States in the northern half of Queensland, in the Riverina area of New South Wales, in the south-eastern corner of Australia-takin g in a section of New South Wales and a section of Victoria-and in the western section of Victoria and the southeast of South Australia. This would give a total of 11 States, but there is sufficient population for 13 States to be formed in the populated areas of Australia. I suggest that 7 developmental regions should be established in the more sparsely populated area. It is difficult to say by what rules one would determine an area's ability to govern itself but it would appear that when some of the existing States assumed self-government a population of somewhere between 40,000 and 60,000 was considered sufficient. All of the proposed 13 States would have populations well in excess of the 60,000 mark. However, if any principle of minimum population were adopted, it would affect the future of the suggested development regions. There must be a general awakening to the fact that if we are retain our present standards of living we must decentralise. There also must be a re-adjustment of the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the States. There must be a re-appraisal of the role of the Commonwealth and the States. There must be a properly integrated interstate highway system and a modern, efficient railway service. Since the war years, mainly because the Australian Government gained taxing powers by means of the Defence Act, the position of the States within the framework of the governments of Australia-Fed eral State and local-ha s greatly lessened and weakened. This weakening continues as the Australian Government moves into the various spheres of State government responsibility. Those of us who believe in the federal system rather than unification must work for the formation of new States and the strengthening of their status and importance in the areas of their responsibilty. The question is: Do we fool about with this problem for the next 25 years or do we sit down in a responsible manner and work out our destiny in a quite and orderly way? Tbe land is here for us to use. We must use it so that no one will challenge our right to any portion of it and so that the millions of Australians yet to come will be able to rejoice in the heritage that will be there. Debate (on motion by Mir Scholes) adjourned. Sitting suspended from 6.7 to 8 p.mn. Bill presented by Mr Hayden, and read a first time. Second Reading Security) (8.0)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill before the House provides for payments for medical benefits, hospital services and certain other specific services, and is the culmination of a great deal of investigation, planning and community debate concerning the most equitable and efficient means of providing health insurance coverage for all Australians. The Bill will enact principles for a health insurance program which were placed before the public at the last Federal election and for which the Government was given a clear mandate. They are principles which have had firm community support for several years and which have withstood, in recent months, a deliberate campaign of deceit and misrepresentation such as has seldom been seen in this country. The legislation the Government is now proposing represents a sincere endeavour to build a new health benefits system in a way which will meet the expectations of the public for high quality health services to be readily accessible to all, which will expand rather than inhibit the opportunities for freedom of choice, which will promote efficiency in the delivery of health services and which will assist in the upgrading of hospital and community based health facilities. The principles of social equity, universal coverage and cost efficiency which form the Government's intention in this legislation are central to our is observed also when the honourable member whole philosophy of social progress. These principles have been, and will continue to be, pursued with great determination. This determination, however, has not been characterised by doctrinaire or rigid viewpoints which might exclude freedom of choice and flexibility. I submit that the course of the debate on our health insurance proposals, including our deliberately 'open government' approach to our policy planning, speaks for itself about our attitude of listening carefully specific clauses within the Bill, I will mention to responsible criticism and seeking to achieve the best balance possible between the legitimate interests of patients, doctors and hospital legislation. I must first explain, however, that managements. Honourable members will remember that we published in April of this year the report of the Health Insurance Planning Committee which outlined a series of proposals on how a health insurance program could be introduced. When I tabled the report in this HouseI emphasised that its contents were proposals only and that we looked forward to widespread and valuable debate. After6 months of debate throughout the community we published a White Paper setting out our intentions for this legislation. Objective critics throughout the country have noted that the White Paper demonstrates the Government's receptiveness to constructive criticism about the health insurance proposals. It is in that light and in that spirit that this legislation has been drafted. As far as I can ascertain, such an 'open government' exercise has not been undertaken before in Australia and I feel it is a significant innovation and, although it has not yet attracted such widespread attention as the health insurance proposals, I would call the attention of honourable members to the fact that I have also tabled in this House a discussion paper on the Australian Assistance Plan. This concept of placing our proposals for social innovations and improvements before the public for discussion before final policy details are expressed in legislation is one which I advocated as an Opposition spokesman and which, despite the advantages which can be taken by unscrupulous pressure group opponents, I believe to be both desirable and necessary. tain silence during this speech. As honourable members know, this is a very important second reading speech. I intend to see that silence for Hotham replies next week. If there are any more interjections, I will take action. Mir HAYBEN-We have undertaken this 'open government' exercise while adhering to the principles presented to the people of Australia for a new and equitable health insurance system and for which, I repeat, we were given a clear mandate. Before proceeding to outline the purpose of in broad detail the salient points of the health insurance program which will result from this this Bill is the main legislative instrument for the introduction and operation of our health insurance program.

197,Mr Speaker,"Order! I intend to mainwhich provides for the establishment of the Australian Health Insurance Commission, the main function of which will be to operate the program. Further legislation relating to the scope and operation of private health insurance organisations and the introduction of levies on taxable income and on motor vehicle third party and workers compensation insurers and the protection of individual privacy will be introduced in the autumn sittings of 1974. In the meantime provisions are included in the Bill to protect personal records. Together, this legislative framework will provide for a health insurance program such as I shall now outline. The program will enable all residents of Australia to be automatically covered by medical and hospital benefits. Pensioners at present eligible for general practitioner consultation services under the pensioner medical service will have their eligibility extended to a full range of medical services, including specialist services, under arrangements designed so that they receive these services free of charge. All other residents will be entitled to receive medical benefits which will total at least 85 per cent of the cost of medical services for which doctors charge the appropriate fees. In no case will any single medical service where the scheduled fee is charged cost the patient more than $5. Adult residents will be issued with health insurance cards as a means of establishing entitlement to benefits. There will be no obligation to produce the card for any purpose. I wish to emphasise that the cards will simply be a device to make the claiming of benefits as convenient as possible. Clause5 of the Bill covers the issue of the cards. I have mentioned that legislation complementary to this Bill will provide safeguards against the misuse of these cards and will also guarantee privacy of information for individual citizens. I draw the attention of honourable members to what the White Paper says on the matter of the health insurance cards and privacy of information. On the matter of the card it states: It will not be necessary for a card to be produced to a doctor or hospital for a patient to receive medical or hospital services. It must be emphasised that the purposes of the card is simply to enable members of the public to obtain benefit payments as conveniently as possible. It should be borne in mind that many existing health insurance funds require contributors to produce numbered membership cards or books to facilitate benefit claim processing. Indeed, one large fund is issuing to contributors membership cards similar to the health insurance cards proposed for the Program. 16759/73-U,-[148 ] On the matter of privacy in general the White Paper states: The Government will insist that complete confidentiality regarding individual patients and doctors is maintained by the Commission. The information required for the processing of claims will be less than is now required by private health insurance funds. A special committee has been established by the Government to recommend steps necessary to guarantee the privacy of individuals. may I interrupt the Minister. Members of the House who are here now are vitally interested in this Bill. Will the Minister consider authorising the release of copies of his second reading speech while he is reading, as I used to do, so that honourable members may follow his speech? It will help honourable members. Mr ChippI thank the Minister. priority the honourable member gives to the speech. To help finance the program taxpayers will pay a levy of 1.35 per cent on their taxable incomes. People whose incomes are below certain levels will be exempted from the levy. The maximum amount of levy any taxpayer will have to contribute in the first year of the program will be $150. This Bill does not specifically provide for the introduction of the levy. As I have mentioned, other legislation will be introduced during the autumn 1974 sittings of this House for this purpose. I should mention that careful study will be given to the question of exemptions from the payment of the levy, with particular reference to repatriation beneficiaries, Service personnel and low income earners. Within the health insurance program, there will be complete freedom of patients to choose their own doctors in private practice. Both public and private hospital treatment will be provided for within the program. Patients admitted to public hospitals will be able to choose either to enter a standard ward and to receive full hospital care free of cost, or to be private patients with preference in allocation of any intermediate or private ward accommodation, under the care of their own doctors. In respect of public hospitals these arrangements will stem from separate agreements to be negotiated with the State governments. I shou'd mention that negotiations are well advanced with several States but that the",89,Health Insurance Bill 1973

200,Mr Haydeni Am Flattered By The,"States of New South Wales and Victoria have indicated they would prefer to wait until this legislation has been passed before entering into substantive negotiations. Medical fees charged to private patients in hospital will attract medical benefits under the program. Patients who incur hospital charges will, through hospital insurance with private funds, be able to cover their hospital charges. Hospital benefit tables will be designed to meet the costs of intermediate and private ward fees in pub ic hospitals and fees for most types of accommodation in non-public hospitals. Private medical insurance funds will be able to offer coverage against medical costs to the extent that they are not covered by benefits under the program. These discretionary additional costs will be a taxation concessional item. That, then, is a general outline of how the arrangements for the coverage of medical and program will work for the public. I would hospital costs. The authority for such agreelike now to outline in more detail for honourments is outlined in clause 7 of the Bill. able members the principles contained in the more significant clauses of the Bill.

Schedule1 of the Bill, delay the HouseI would ask honourable incorporates the determination made by the members to consider what I shall now say in Medical Fees Tribunal under the chairmanconjunction with the intentions and detail ship of Mr Justice Ludeke, for consultations contained in the White Paper.

I should also point out that the should point out that surgical procedures and Bill is drafted so that all clauses will come anaesthetics constitute separate medical serinto operation on the date of Royal Assent vices and that the $5 maximum gap will apply except where it is otherwise specified that a to each service. clause will operate from a date to be proclaimed. This has been done to enable patient-doctor relationship and indeed this administrative procedures necessary to the relationship has aways been an essential feature early introduction of the program to be implemented at the appropriate times. While the Bill provides for all residents of Australia to be eligible for the benefits of the program, it also makes provisions which will allow, at some future time, the introduction of arrangements whereby non-residents of Australia may purchase Australian health insurance program coverage by payment of a suitable premium. The above provisions relate to the eligibility of people while in Australia. The Bill also makes provision for the payment of medical and hospital benefits to Australian residents who incur medical and hospital expenses while overseas. These payments will be made from the commencement of the program. The Government also intends to enter into negotiations with overseas governments with a view to the initiation of reciprocal The proper operation of the medical benefit and visits. It is expected that, on completion The program is based on preservation of the of our proposals. The methods by wbich a patient exercises his entitlement to benefits are part of this relationship and, under the program, will remain a matter between the patient and doctor. Basically there are 3 convenient methods provided in the Bill for the claiming of benefits. In precis form, the methods by which patients may receive their entitlements are: 1. Be billed by the doctor, pay the doctor and then claim benefits from the Health Insurance Commission. 2. Forward the unpaid doctor's bill to the Health Insurance Commission and receive back the appropriate benefits in the form of a cheque payable to the doctor. In this case it would be the patient's responsibility to forward the cheque to the doctor and the balance of the account would be a matter between the doctor and the patient. 3. Assign to the doctor the benefits payable for a particular service where the doctor is prepared to accept the benefit as full payment for the service. The doctor would then claim bis payment from the Health Insurance Commission and the patient would not have to pay anything. The assignment of benefits will have particular significance for pensioners who have pensioner medical service cards. The Bill requires the Minister to request doctors to undertake that where medical services are provided to persons who present to the doctor a pensioner medical service card, the doctors should give these pensioners an opportunity of assigning their benefits to the doctor instead of receiving a doctors account. The effect of assigning benefits will be that the doctors accept the benefits as full payment for the services they provide to eligible pensioners. This arrangement is designed so that, on the one hand, eligible pensioners enjoy the same entidement to medical services as everybody else in the community and, on the other, that they are not charged anything for services they at present receive free. At present pensioners eligible for the pensioner medical service are entitled only to general practitioner surgery and home' visit consultative services. They are not entitled to procedural items provided by general practitioners and they are not covered for any services provided by private medical specialists. The new arrangements will give them coverage for all of those services. Clause 13 of the Bill sets out the arrangeto be continued. The functions and operations ments which are to apply when there is a of these committees will be the same as those medical attendance as a result of which established under the existing legislation. In spectacle lenses are prescribed. For such fact the Bill provides for the present comattendances the regulations will prescribe that mittees to continue these activities. 16759/73-R-1149 ] the benefit which will be payable will be that part of the benefit specified in the Schedule which isfinancedby the health insurance levy. The principle which has been adopted is that the new benefit in these oases will take the place of the fund benefit which has generally been paid in the past. Commonwealth benefit has not been paid in the past and consequently the new arrangements will not place patients at a disadvantage in comparison with the existing arrangements. The actual amount of benefit under the new arrangements will depend on the scheduled fee for the consultation concerned. This will vary depending on whether it is a consultation with a specialist to whom the patient has been referred or whether the patient consults the specialist directly. Assuming that the normal benefit where no spectacles are prescribed is, say, $16, the benefit for a consultation at which spectacles are prescribed will be 40 per cent of $16, that is $6.40. The patient will be left to pay the doctor the balance of his fee. Patients who consult optometrists will pay the optometrist's consulting fee, which will not be eligible for benefits. Because optometrists' consulting fees are considerably lower than medical specialists' fees, patients generally, I am informed, will be left in approximately the same situation whether they consult a medical specialist or an optometrist. This is the situation which has existed under the present scheme. The arrangements incorporated in the Bill are interim measures and the Governmenit has established a working party to thoroughly review the arrangements with a view to recommending what measures can be taken to resolve the difficult issues that exist in this matter. In any medical benefits system it is necessary to have expert, independent committees to make recommendations on such complex matters as the scope of the medical services to be covered, the level of appropriate fees to be included in the Schedule and to adjudicate on matters relating to the provision of services which attract medical benefits. The Bill, in Part V, provides for the establishment of a number of committees for the purposes I have outlined. The existing Specialist Recognition Advisory Committee for each State and the Specialist Recognition Appeal Committee are A Medical Benefits Advisory Committee will be established with the broad functions of determining the nature and scope of medical services to be included in the Schedule and the fees for those services. The members of this Committee will be appointed by the Minister after consultation with the Australian Medical Association or any other association or college that the Minister considers appropriate. I should mention that within its broad functions, this Committee will have the power to formulate principles for the determination of fees in respect of medical services which are of undue length or complexity. This will enable appropriate benefits to be paid in particular cases where a medical practitioner is justified in charging in excess of the scheduled fee for any service. In practice, the Bill provides for the Health Insurance Commission to determine fees in such circumstances in accordance with the principles laid down by the Committee. Honourable members will recognise that it is necessary to have a method of ensuring that false or excessive claims are not made on public funds. We have indicated, in the White Paper on our health insurance program, that we will consult with the medical profession about appropriate forms of 'peer review' arrangements. In this Bill, we have made provision for committees of inquiiy whose functions relate to the services provided to pensioners, but I wish to stress that we will be consulting with the medical profession to ensure that, on the one hand, there is no abuse of the medical benefits system and, on the other hand, that the professional freedoms of doctors are protected. Under the present committee of inquiry system, there is no established right of appeal for doctors against whom rulings are made by the committees. Division4 of PartV of this Bill establishes a Medical Services Review Tribunal to which a medical practitioner who is dissatisfied with a determination of a committee of inquiry may appeal for a review of the determination. In addition, a further avenue of appeal will be available, on questions on law, to the Australian Industrial Court. I turn now to the arrangements covering payments for hospital services. These are contained in Part III of the Bill. The administrative procedures spelt out in the Bill provide that all hospitals must be approved for the purposes of hospital payments. In this context I would point out that all hospitals currently approved under the National Health Act must apply for approval under this legislation so as to become eligible for Australian Government payments. The basis of the hospital payment arrangements will be agreements to be negotiated separately with each State government. The agreements have not, of course, been formulated at this stage but Schedule2 of the Bill sets out heads around which such agreements will be negotiated. In broad terms these heads of agreements envisage arrangements under which everybody will be entitled to receive comprehensive standard ward hospital treatment free of charge. They also envisage that up to SO per cent of the net operating costs of public hospitals will be met by the Australian Government. This commitment by the Australian Government will comprise daily bed payments at the rate of $16 payable direct to hospitals with the balance of the commitment being paid direct to State governments. Before mentioning the arrangements for hospitals not covered by agreements with the States there is a point on terminology I think it is important to make. The term private hospital is often used to categorise all hospitals not owned by the State or Australian governments. It should be noted, however, that there are some privately owned religious, charitable and community hospitals which regard themselves as public hospitals. These hospitals are certainly public in the sense of the functions they perform, despite the fact that they may not be owned and operated by government authorities. The comments about, and safeguards for, what we referred to in the White Paper as private, religious, charitable or community hospitals are meant to apply also to the type of hospitals I have just referred to. For hospitals not covered by the agreements with the States, the Australian Government will pay daily bed payments of $16. In addition, the Bill provides for supplementary daily bed payments to certain religious, charitable and community hospitals where these hospitals provide free treatment to patients whom they accept as 'hospital patients'. As has been unequivocally stated in the White Paper, these hospitals will be free to set and control their own policies without Government interference and they will retain the sole right to appoint the members of their governing bodies. A corollary of this is that they will retain autonomy of management in the medico-moral area. Thefinancingof the program will take place through the mechanism of a Health Insurance Fund, which will be established under Part VI of the Bill. All payments authorised by this legislation will be paid by the Health Insurance Commission out of this Fund. I should mention that when the levies I have referred to earlier are in operation, the revenue derived will be paid into the Fund, as will payments from consolidated revenue and amounts recovered under the provisions of the Bill. In conclusion, I turn to the reasons why into our program over a million people who the Government has committed itself so at present lack proper protection against the firmly to seeing that the legislative proposals I costs of medical and hospital treatment. have just outlined are brought into operation. I mentioned at the beginning of this speech present scheme has defects. They had some that our proposals seek social equity in health 20 years with the scheme but only very insurance.

This, first aid job to patch up the low income family in turn, means we have a duty to see that and pensioner sections of their scheme. What money is not wasted on an inefficient system of I must point out quite forcibly here is that this health insurance. As an indication of scale, it is worth noting the medical and hospital services covered by that the Australian Government will spend private health insurance and by pensioner over $350m in the 1973-74financialyear on medical and hospital services and repatriation direct subsidies to hospital and medical benemedical services.

For the record, the average proportion of medical less we agree to the extension. benefit refunds met directly by the Australian Government has risen from 45 per cent in 1969-70 to 56 per cent in 1972-73.

With a universal system, in which everybody is automatically covered and in which we can dispense with the services of bounty hunters, we can cut this rate in half. The money saved will be re-applied to finance better benefits for more people. For the same total cost as would be needed to sustain the present scheme, we can provide improved coverage and we can bring The Opposition now acknowledges that the $300m would be additional to the total cost of (Extension oftimegranted) generosity from the honourable member for Moreton.

202,Mr Hayden,"That is uncharacteristicThe present system is indeed a 'scheme'. It is an iniquitious method of ensuring that those who can best afford health care get it more cheaply than those who can least afford it. It perpetuates social inequality and it wastes public money. Our program is not one which stems from doctrinaire beliefs but it is one which flows from a sense of social justice. It is a program which rejects the belief that health care is a commodity to be traded rather than a social utility to be used to improve the quality of living. It is at the same time a program which acknowledges the professional and vocational aspirations of those who provide health services. It is, in total, a program which is a challenge to the social conscience of this Parliament and this nation. It is indeed a program which must cause this Parliament to decide whether health care is to be a privilege to be purchased or a right to be enjoyed equally by every Australian.

We have noted, with some concern for the interests of members of the Opposition, that quite a number of them have bookings at luxury holiday resorts to be effective from the end of next week. The last thing I would ever want to do would be to interfere with the recreation and rest of members of the Opposition. As the spokesman for the Opposition on matters relating to health and welfare, the honourable member for Hotham( Mr Ohipp), and members of the Opposition want to sit for a further week and thereafter. I have discussed the matter with the Leader of the House( Mr Daly) and we are quite happy to accommodate them. We are prepared to defer the debate until Thursday of next week and to return the following week to continue the debate. We will be very happy. I trust that those members of the Opposition who have put deposits on their holiday homes will be able to get refunds. Question resolved in the affirmative.

BILL 1973 Second Reading Debate resumed (vide page 4141). cost of land and the question of how it is made available are among the most obvious of today's urban problems. The cost of land has increased faster than the average rate of inflation in the past few years and is continuing to grow at an accelerating rate. Valuers survey published only last month the value of land in Melbourne is likely to increase at a rate as high as 60 per cent in the next 12 months. The survey, showing inner suburban land price increases of up to 75 per cent, indicated that Melbourne was rivalling Sydney in the real estate price spiral. In the Waverley municipality, about 15 miles east of central Melbourne, land that a year ago sold for $22,000 an acre is now selling for $40,000 an acre. A survey of 40 Melbourne municipalities by the Institute showed that prices had increased by up to 75 per cent in Carlton, parts of Fitzroy and Soulh Melbourne-al l inner suburbs-in the 12 months ending in April this year. At these rates of price increase young couples are forced to the outer fringes of Melbourne, but there the scene is worse. Outer Melbourne areas in an arc from Bulla extending through to Eltham and Lilydale to Mornington and Hastings have had land price increases varying from 45 per cent to 55 per cent. The cost of a building block in Melbourne's outer eastern suburbs is rising by an average of $50 a week, according to a survey carried out by Knox City Council and published in May this year. In Knox, which is in my electorate of La Trobe and in one of the fastest growing suburban areas, the average land price increase for the 12 months to February 1973 was 62.63 per cent. Prices have gone mad; they have gone up even faster in the past 6 months. The Knox survey is the most accurate one yet taken on rising land prices. It is based on sale returns lodged with the Knox building department. The increases included 50 per cent at Wantirna, 63 per cent at Boronia, 66 per cent at the Mountain Gate estate, and 55 per cent at Johnson Park estate in Fern Tree Gully. All of this land is situated between 15 and 20 miles from the General Post Office, unsewered but with made roads and all other services. Sewered blocks in the area have just been released and are selling at between $9000 and $11,000 a block. Blocks on unmade roads jumped 59 per cent in price from $2900 to $4600. Within the next few years owners will have to meet a council road making bill. These rises are alarming, even frightening,",95,Health Insurance Bill 1973

218,Mr Lamb (La Trobe) (8.40),"The soaringand can be attributed mainly to the lack of supply of residential land. Unless a land policy is developed it will be 18 months to 2 years before we see any substantial improvement in the land shortage and a slow down in price increases. At present Melbourne has a population of 2.5 million and it is increasing at the rate of 50,000 a year. To stop the growth of Melbourne it would be necessary to build the equivalent of 15 Canberras within Victoria. Syphoning off the increase in population from big cities is not effective in restricting growth, sold for $400,000.

In a recent sale another 60 acres realised $1.5m. The vendors still hold 44 acres, estimated to be worth more than $lm. A well known bookmaker owns 80 acres in an industrial zone.

Industrial land covering an area of 244 acres is valued at $2.5m and a recent sale of only 45 acres realised approximately Let us examine why land prices are rising is zoned residential and available for immediate subdivision. Seven years ago there were 11,500 vacant building blocks in Knox. This has been cut to 4,400, of which only 2,000 are available. A further 6,000 blocks will become available if rezoning occurs. How can we equalise the supply and demand for land so that prices stabilise? Solutions offered are many. For example, the chairman of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works listed suggestions for price control in an -article published in the 'Age' on 28 August last. He listed the following points. Legislation to compel people to market land which is ripe for development. Consideration given to levying a holding charge on proposed that each State should establish a people who withhold land. Adequatefinancefor servicing authorities. Amendment to the Sale of Land Act to allow stage release of new allotments. A speed-up at all levels of council, board and Government procedures to reduce delays. Agreement by municipalities on uniform requirements for sub-division. Availability of money to developers at reasonable interest rates. Legislation requiring land owners to contribute to State agencies, controlled and managed by the common services so that the cost is spread equally. Greater co-operation by land developers with authorities. The final approach adopted by this Government will need to recognise that more serviced land must be made available to satisfy the demand, that land prices are contained so that all who need the land are not denied it merely because of impecunious circumstances or by earning average incomes, and that a comprehensive view must be taken of land use leading to the development of urban amenities. Unless the adopted policy satisfies these three elements it will fall short of desirable measures. How do the suggested policies face up to these criteria? Holding charges, levies, capital gains taxes and so on can all be passed on to the buyer. This denies the availability of land to low income groups. Legislation which is designed to compel people to sell and staged releases of new allotments do not avoid price increases, and such legislation has not proved easy to implement. Ad hoc rezoning is not complementary to good town planning and creates windfall profits for land owners. The price of land is not stabilised. The availability of money at low interest rates to developers, private and public, adequate finance for servicing authorities and the sharing of service costs by the community through progressive taxation are all desirable, but they need to be part of a co-ordinated program instituted by a Federal government. Most of the remaining measures can be achieved by the national Government entering the field of urban and regional development, in co-operation with the States. This is the purpose of the 5 Bills. If land problems are to be solved, consultation between the various levels of government will be essential. The chief method by which the Government currently hopes more serviced land will be made available, land prices contained, land use recognised and State co-operation achieved is through the establishment of land commissions in the States. ""The Australian Government has land commission or an equivalent body which, with the help of Australian Government finance, would acquire large tracts of land needed for urban development. The commissions would be expected to release the land, fully serviced, as needed. The eventual establishment of large banks of land should help solve the problem of scarcity. The establishment of land commissions, which would be States, would make for a more efficient use of land. By having large tracts of land needed for urban development under the control of the States, a comprehensive approach to investment in urban facilities by both the public and private sector would be made easier. This approach is necessary for the efficient use of both land and resources, which will necessitate long term planning and co-ordination of investment. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) is concerned that action will be taken on the fringes of existing large metropolises for urban planning and in inner suburbs for urban renewal. He need not be so concerned. The land commissions, or their equivalents, would aim initially at buying land required for urban development in areas designated by the States. This would include land on the fringes of metropolitan areas, such as Knox, as well as land required for regional centres and new cities. Their major objective will be to make land available for residential purposes and for other public purposes such as health, education, recreation and transport. The commissions would hold and control the land they acquire, but where large tracts are involved a development corporation would have the responsibility to develop. The corporation or, in the case of small areas of land, the commissions may let contracts to private developers for the servicing and developing of the land. In this way the skills of both the public and the private sector would be used in the operation of the land commission program. In April the Australian Government announced the establishment of a commission of inquiry into land tenures under the chairman ship of Mr Justice Else-Mitchell. The Leader of the Opposition is concerned about future land tenure of acquired land after development. He said that the Opposition is adamant that the form of tenure must be freehold. We are not so presumptive as to state categorically just what form tenure should take. The precise form of the tenure system by which land controlled by the commissions would be made available to the public would differ from State to State. Details of the applicfactor and the adjustments for improvements able tenure would not be settled until the commission of inquiry into land tenure had reported, but the Australian Government has said that public equity in land is necessary for effective co-ordination of development and also to prevent individuals from receiving massive profits as the result of public decisions to acquire and develop land with public money. We are not alone in this wish. During recent hearings held by the National Estate Inquiry in Melbourne, the Westernport Regional Planning Authority appealed to the Federal Government to acquire substantial areas of Mornington Peninsula and Phillip Island. The Authority said that its present planning powers and finances were inadequate to protect Westernport against escalating pressures for undesirable change. It said that these pressures-the demand for hobby farms, holiday houses, rural residential allotments and fringe urban activities-were now threatening places of national significance in Westernport. The Authority also said that from experience in our type of democratic society, planning control can arrest the rate of such development but cannot prevent it when land is in private ownership. Public equity in land is necessary if land use is to be regulated by advanced and community oriented town planning and not allowed to degenerate through ad hoc decisions resulting from indiscriminate purchasing of land and profit motivated pressures to rezone different areas. Land price stabilisation legislation is seen by the Australian Government as an essential part of the land commission project. It is aimed at ensuring that land does not inflate in value merely because it has been chosen for acquisition for urban development. Such inflation could make the land so costly that the States would be unable to continue their plans to acquire the land and develop the area. Although legislation would differ to suit each State's individual requirements, it is expected that where it is introduced it would follow general principles. Such legislation would stabilise tiie prices to be paid for the land to be acquired at the market value at the date set out in the initial proclamation of the study area, plus a value increase factor to allow for normal increase in land values, but excluding any increase principally arising from the identification of an area as a growth area. A capital cost adjustment would also be made for improvements to the land. The value increase would ensure that land owners, while they would be prevented from making windfall profits, would not lose in real money terms if their land is marked for acquisition. member for Diamond Valley says. Safeguards incorporated into the legislation would allow rapid acquisition in hardship cases, so giving the legislationflexibility.Such land stabilisation cannot be described as price freezing. It allows for legitimate increments in earnings on land sales. It avoids the disadvantages of land price freezes such as the creation of a black market, the devaluation of property as inflation generally leaves real value of land behind and the creation of under-the-counter key money, often amounting to $2,000 to $3,000, on the side. Time prevents me from saying more. I congratulate the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren) on the advances that he has made towards conquering our urban and regional problems. There are no panaceas and no immediate solutions, but these programs, backed by $30m of the current Budget's funds, will make a great start for tomorrow's urban dwellers, particularly in land price stabilisation. I commend the Bills to the House. churlish of me not to congratulate the Minister for Uiban and Regional Development { Mr Uren) on being the first Commonwealth Minister to bring the Commonwealth into planning for cities.

221,Mr Cooke (Petrie) (8.57),"It would bethink it is irrefutable that now the Commonwealth is deeply involved in what is happening in the cities, both old and new. Whatever change of political circumstances may come about, I think that the Commonwealth's involvement in this area must continue and will continue to expand in the years ahead. However, I think that the Minister's Department has not yet settled down to a classification of the programs which it wants to implement. The Minister, in his second reading speech on the Albury-Wodonga Development Bill said: The Government is committed to a direct and continuing involvement in cities, old and new. A little later he said: New cities are designed to reduce population pressure on existing cities. He referred to what he called regional growth centres. I think that there are probably 4 classifications which could be used with greater advantage and greater clarity. Firstly, there are new towns. They are certainly created to reduce population pressures on existing cities. New towns require a different approach and have different problems to solve in their development. The second type of classification is expanded towns. IfI might say so, the Albury-Wodonga project would fall into this category because there already is an urban existence in Albury and in Wodonga. The Minister proposes to expand this town into a much larger town with a population of some 300,000. I believe that this is the most difficult sort of project to undertake, and I will say more about that when I deal with the Bill. The third type of classification is a project involving urban renewal in the inner city areas. The inner city areas of most of the capital cities have run down over the years. They require massive injections of money to assist in buying back land that has passed into seperate ownerships, to bring them into larger agglomerations and thus provide them with all the expertise and techniques that are available to us now. This means that more people will be brought back into the urban centre and this wiil create a more vital inner city. The fourth classification I suggest is suburban leads on to the second problem which, in my assistance. This covers the project of the rapidly developing suburban areas where what is needed is Commonwealth money to assist in providing public services which have fallen behind on account of the rapidity of development-thing s like sewerage, the provision of schools and public libraries and particularly the provision of open space. Very often local councils on the perimeters of cities find that there is a spill-over of 'population into the outer area and it all happens very quickly. Of course, a small local council does not have the finance to cope with the increase in facilities that are required when subdivisions occur at such a rapid rate. Most of them have town plans which are admirable; most of them have provision in their town plans and zoning schemes for open space and public purpose lands; but they do not have the money to acquire these when they are needed. SoI see that the fourth classification would be for the Commonwealth Government to provide money to assist in the acquisition of those facilities within the framework of already existing town planning. Let me briefly give my view of the Commonwealth's role in this field. I see it as a threefold role. Thefirstis to provide teams of experts which could be made available to the States and local government bodies to help with planning and development of new projects. The cost of assembling expert teams of this sort is very high and it is beyond the means of most local councils in Australia. Assistance from the Commonwealth level would be most welcome. The second role for the Commonwealth is to provide money for urban projects. The third is to provide the staff necessary for development corporations where these are required. In my view, development corporations would be required where a new town or an expanded town was being established. Let me now come to the project which is in fact a pilot project for die Minister for Urban and Regional Development and his Department. I refer to Albury and Wodonga. Without wishing to put the kiss of death on the project at this stage may I perhaps issue a word of caution. I think that Albury-Wodonga is an unhappy choice for thefirstpilot project. It is an inland city, and everyone knows that the establishment of facilities is far more expensive in the inland than it is on the coast. Also, inland cities have problems with regard to the supply of essential services such as water. That view, means that this is an unhappy choice. Water control on the Murray River must be an important and worrying consideration for the Department in developing Albury-Wodonga as a city of 300,000 people. Only last week a newspaper article drew attention to the problem of water pollution at Mildura. Tbis must be a serious problem. This morning the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) tabled the minutes of a meeting between himself and the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria. At the meeting the main question debated was the quality of the water in the Murray River and the serious problem that exists there with regard to the salinity of the water. Other probveto at every turn. It ought to be able to lems which were also discussed concerned the establishing of a very large city on the Murray River whose waters are required further down, for both irrigation and urban uses. This creates of local government. This is one of the things an additional problem for anyone developing a city in this situation. The third objection-on e which I find most Wodonga when it is fully developed by whichpuzzling-is that the Government has selected ever of the 3 development corporations does as its pilot project a city which has all the the job? What form of local government will problems one could possibly think of. There take the place of the development corporaare 2 State governments to deal with; there are tions? The development corporations cannot 2 local authorities to deal with; and they are go on for ever. At some stage they must be all in the centre of the inland area. With that wound up. Local government must be estabsort of arrangement, trying to obtain agreelished in this area. This is one of the critical ment on what is to be done in the development things that certainly should be agreed on of Albury-Wodonga will be a job for a before things proceed too much further. magician. I make a comment in passing on the agreement, which is a schedule to the Act. It looks as though it were drawn up at a Mad Hatter's Tea Party on the Murray under a gum tree. It provides for the establishment of to the development corporation. I think that a Commonwealth Development Corporation, a this is a sensible way to go about it. I also urge New South Wales Development Corporation the Minister to ensure that the Development and a Victorian Development Corporation.

Nothing can be done undevelopment has been paid for by taxpayers' less the Ministerial Council comes to a unanimoney and no one has any idea how much it mous decision. With these complications I has cost. I believe that new towns and expanded would think that the Ministerial Council should towns can be developed in Australia with the have thought the thing through before it assistance of a Treasury advance of some reached any agreement at all. The Minister is millions of dollars in the first instance. After shaking his head.

But the point I am making is that the and so on, because in the future the DevelopGovernment has made this selection which ment Corporation will have the advantage of has nothing to recommend it at all. Its trethe rising prices of land in the developed area mendous administrative problems could have and ought to be able to break even at least, been overcome if the Government had selected if not to show a small profit on the Treasury a site and dealt with only one State governadvance. This is something which the Minister ment. That would have been a very much ought to keep firmly in mind, to make sure easier task in providing the pilot operation for that the accounts are properly kept so that the types of new cities and expanded cities that the people of Australia and honourable memthe Government wants to produce. I hope that, as the Minister and his Departmuch revenue is being returned from it.

In my view, there ought to be one development corporation. The development corporation ought to be vested with power to plan and develop the area. It ought to be relatively free from ministerial proceed with the planning and development of the area. At the end of it all it ought to be able to hand the area over to some form which I fear has not really been thought out by the Ministerial Council in relation to Albury-Wodonga. What will happen to AlburyI commend to the Minister's attention the provisions of the Bill for Treasury advances bers can see every year exactly how much money is being spent on this project and how subsidies of various sorts.

I wish to speak briefly about the land commissions which seem to be associated with which are less tban they can obtain land for the Albury-Wodonga project. They do not now.

This is something which subdivision and for the property to be sold. perhaps experience will show us and on which SoI do not think there will be very much the reports of the department will enlighten difference in the price of the land which is us as the years go by. The other point I mention is the acquisition the commission is to make available fully of land. I agree with the Minister that it is serviced land for the home buyer. I know that reasonable that once an area has been designated as a growth area the owners of land about these Bills now. I may get an opportunwithin that designated area should not be ity to make a few passing comments on unjustly enriched as a result of Government various clauses when the Bills are considered money being spent in developing the project. in the Committee stage. But on the other hand, I do not believe that owners in the designated area should have to wait up to 10 years before they are paid compensation for the land which was compulsorily with all honourable members from this side of acquired from them. I would like to see a the House in wishing the Government well reduction in the period for which compensawith its new concept and particularly with the tion could be withheld.

222,Mr Drummond (Forrest) (9.15),"Iwhen there will be other legislation before the House we will have this unanimity of feeling in the chamber. Hopefully that will be the case. I would like to make the point, as the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Hunt) did today, that really there is a four-pronged attack against the decentralisation. I would like to take up the last 2 points which he made and which I feel have been overlooked by the Government in all these Bills and other actions, taken by the Government. He mentioned blanket incentives for decentralisation. I will not dwell on those. But I feel that the general support for the initiatives shown by some of our States in supporting decentralisation in some of our minor or provincial towns may have been overlooked to a large extent. I mention this because there are many provincial or rural towns with populations between 5,000 to 20,000 people whioh are looking not for something spectacular, such as is happening in the Albury-Wodonga area or the other anticipated growth centres, but are looking for a small, gradual growth within their community. It may be a small, gradual industrial growth, perhaps just to take care of the unemployment situation which still exists in rural areas, and to take care of the children of the district who are growing up and who wish to stay in the district and seek employment. I know that the Government has ridiculed what it has described as the salt and pepper attitude of decentralisation of which it accused the previous Government. But I feel that with this Government there is too much emphasis on the cities. I would like to quote from an answer given by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren) in reply to a question asked in the House on 11 October. I will not read it all. The question was asked in regard to decentralisation. I will just read the end where the Minister says: We want decentralisation to be successful. The only way that we can achieve this is by determining special growth centres and by then using all the resources of Australian, State, local governments and the private sector to make these centres a success. That is why the Government has stated clearly that industries in selected growth centres agreed upon by the Australian Government and the State governments will receive special assistance and special attention in regard to tarifl and other policies. I feel that the whole emphasis is on the cities. I know that a regional report has been prepared and hopefully other areas can look towards the Grants Commission. But it was in all seriousness that I asked the Minister a further question a couple of weeks ago. What prompted me to ask this question was that on 23 October 1973 there was a report in the 'West Australian' newspaper that the mayor of Bunbury, Mr P. J. Usher, had been told by the Federal Government that it was not considering exemptions to the regulations to restrict foreign investment. I bring this to the attention of the Minister and the House because a couple of days later I asked the Minister about the proposed Alwest refinery. Just let me quote that question. Actually, I addressed it to the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam), but he passed it on to the Minister for Urban and Regional Development. The question was: The proposed all-west project is of tremendous importance to the south west of Western Australia. It will mean regional development, the development of the Bunbury port, increased power generation at Collie and increased employment opportunities throughout the region. As this project was planned during 1969-70 and has been held up awaiting the development of the infrastructure, particularly the port of Bunbury, will the Government reconsider its attitude on foreign capital investment in this instance, bearing in mind the true decentralised nature of the project? The Minister answered: As the honourable member would know, 4 studies have been carried out ih Western Australia by the Cities Commission. Studies have been made of Salvado, north of Perth, and studies have also been made of 3 regional areas-Geraldton , Bunbury and Albany. The study is a continuing one and until such time as it is completed no decision will be made by the Government. Foreign investment in real estate in Australia is the joint responsibility of the Treasurer and myself and each case will be judged on its merits. It is not only the all-west project at Bunbury which is involved. There is also a tannery at Albany. There are other towns throughout the Commonwealth such as this. There are other small industries that could start and operate at no cost to the Government whatsoever. With more Government consideration, we could achieve in these small towns a limited amount of decentralisation with a thoughtful and balanced policy towards foreign investment. That is the only comment I wish to make. AgainI wish the Government well with its whole project. Motion (by Mr Nicholls) agreed to: That the question be now put.

The fourth amendment is a drafting amendment to ensure that capitalised interest is repaid in the same way as the original advance.

I can remember many years ago when I first entered this House, talking about the economic principles involved in regional development. If middle of a sentence, perhaps I should repeat I may hark back to those days, I remember that the sort of argument that I used then was that at that time governments, both State and Federal, were in the habit of propping up from time to time small country industries, such as country abattoirs, in the hope that those industries would contribute to some form of decentralisation. In States such as Victoria got slightly out of focus on the procedure. The Minister has asked for leave to move That the report be adopted'. Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. Report (on motion by Mr Uren) adopted. Third Reading That the BiU be now read a third time. I started a second or two before the firing of the gun. As I said a little earlier, I have no intention of delaying the House for very long. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren), who is at the table, has my support for the general concept of the legislation. I want to put to the HouseI am sure that I could have been more concise a little earlier-the arguments that were put many years ago by members, I guess, from both sides of the House. I want to point out the mistake of making a piecemeal approach to country industries, where State governments sometimes vied with one another to get enterprises across one border or another. That was patently absurd and patently counterproductive. The States also put funds into such projects as country killing works, to which I referred a moment ago. This policy areas of New South Wales, but in most other States-in particular Victoria-it proved to be most unsuccessful. That proved, by and large, that there is a need to take hold of this problem and to infuse large amounts of finance into regional areas point of order. The House is now considering the motion for the third reading of the Bill. As you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the subject matter that can be discussed during the third reading stage is very narrow. what I was saying. I beheve that the whole principle of proper decentralisation and regional development is one in which governments have to grasp the nettle and infuse fairly large amounts of capital into growth areas. There is not an economist in the land who specialises in this field who has not recognised for quite a long time that this is the proper way in which to proceed Motion (by Mr Uren) put: That the question be now put.

The aim of the amendments is to provide for flexibility in the term of each loan. The Bill as originally introduced provides for all loans to have a term of 30 years. The amendments allow the repayment term to be any period up to 30 years. Also the amendments correct some minor drafting errors. In respect of amendment No. 1, the original paragraph (d) required repayments by way of 60 equal halfyearly payments. The amendment provides for flexibility in the method of repayment subject to the proviso that the repayments must be completed within 30 years. Amendment No. 2 is necessary to ensure that the period of deferment can be reviewed in about 5 years time. Amendment No. 3 is a drafting amendment to ensure that the capitalised interest is repaid in the same way as the original advance.

I want to make it clear to honourable members that the Government seems to have some stupid reason for trying to gag me all the time before I can express an opinion and congratulate it on the fact that it is helping South Australia bring about this great concept. That is all I wanted to do in the first place until the ill-mannered people opposite gagged me and prevented me expressing a view. There is only one other thing I may say tonight and that is to advise the Government, as I did once before, to watch very carefully before it again proposes schemes like Albury-Wodonga upstream on any major river of this nation. For a long while now I have been anxious that the South Australian Government, or even perhaps one would hope the Federal Government, would draw up some watertight-probabl y that is the wrong word -o r set scheme order in discussing the Albury-Wodonga comBill. clause 4 of the Bill, which is before the Committee, and if you look at it you will see reference to 'approved program'.

274,The Chairmani Would Suggest That,"disagree with your ruling or your reading of the Standing Orders. I was carefully, I thought, dealing with clause 4 of this Bill, the sidenote of which, in italics, says: 'Approval program'. Under the approval program, I was trying to suggest that in future the Government should not lightly, without very deep consideration, put one of its projects upstream on a major river in Australia unless proper safeguards are written into an agreement. MightI add at this stage that there has been only a lot of words-word s that people do not take a lot of heart from-betwee n the Premier of South Australia, on the one hand, and this Government, in the other hand. I am saying in relation to clause 4 that I hope, because it is a proven ecological fact, that before governments lightly plan growth centres upstream on major rivers on which, as in this case, entire States depend, they should firstly, consider the matter very carefully and, secondly, ensure that agreements are made between the 2 parties to protect people who live in those areas downstream from the projected growth centres. That was all I was trying to say. I could have said that, as I said a little earlier, a lot more concisely a of the water quality works. We intend to long time ago with much less waste of time. I thank the Committee for its consideration and for listening to my views at long last. Regional Development) (10.12)I do not want to delay the Committee, but I want to reply to the honourable member for Angas( Mr National Capital Development Commission did Giles) to put the record straight on this important and historic Bill. Firstly, the Australian Government has taken every precaution to safeguard the environmental standards of all growth centres. In passing, it is true that one of the comments on the water catchment area applies to Albury-Wodonga, which is not being discussed in the debate on this Bill. However, on the same water catchment as that which is being discussed, which would affect the South Australian border, is the BathurstOrange area. What has to be realised-and I hope that honourable members opposite really understand this-is that because Albury Wodonga is on the Murray River, it does not mean that that is the only centre that would affect the quality of water in South Australia. There is an interconnected relationship. All the water systems-whethe r it be the Murray River, Darling River, Murrumbidgee River or Lachlan River-ar e interconnected, and they will all affect the quality of water in South Australia. It so happens that in this debate we are discussing the allocation of $24m, and part of this amount will be allotted to the New South Wales growth area of Bathurst-Orange, which is also on the same catchment area as Albury-Wodonga. So we are being very careful, and we are concerned. MightI say again that it is not the experience of our Government that we are going to use. The Government of which the honourable member for Angas was a supporter had experience of the water quality of the Murrumbidgee River to which the Canberra water supply is linked. It is also in the catchment area that affects the quality of water in South Australia. We are continuing-and in fairness to honourable members opposite, the previous Government actually made the decision to improve the water quality of the lower Molonglo Riverthe plan to set up a water treatment works on the lower Molonglo River to treat the water for Canberra which comes from the Molonglo and Murrumbidgee Rivers. These works will treat the water to such an extent that they will take even the nutrients out of it, and the water will be pure to drink as it comes out apply to Albury-Wodonga and BathurstOrange, and to any other growth centres in inland cities, the type of experience which we have applied in Canberra. I give that assurance to all honourable members opposite. It is collective experience gained from what the under the previous Government. We are going to draw on that experience when planning for the development of any cities near rivers in the future. Minister's reply to my comments. We all know that there has been a big drawing on the water resources of all the rivers that he has mentioned. I acknowledge that. My only point is that the whole increase in South Australia's water supply, which was agreed to some time ago, will come about with the completion of Dartmouth Dam. My only complaint there is that inconsistently, governments do not acknowledge the fact, as the Minister has, that there is a drawing problem, from all the areas he mentioned, on those limited water resources, and one more regional development would not exactly help. I think that even the Minister will acknowledge that it would magnify the problem. That is the point I was trying to make. Amendments agreed to.",108,Growth Centres Financial Assistance Bill 1973

Regional Development) (10.17)I have several amendments to move to clause 10, which reads in part: (2) Subject to sub-section (3), the loan is subject to the following conditions:(a) interest shall accrue in respect of each payment or advance, calculated from the date on which the payment or advance was made, on so much of the payment or advance as for the time being has not been repaid by the State; (b) the rate at which interest shall accrue under paragraph (a) shall be a long-term bond rate or such lower rate as the Treasurer, with the concurrence of the Minister, determines; (d) an amount calculated under paragraph (b) as at a date after the expiration of the period uf following paragraph:deferment shall be paid by the State to Australia upon that date; (3) Commencement of repayments of principal, and payments of interest, by a State in respect of payments and advances made to the State in relation to an approved program may be deferred for such period, not exceeding 10 years (in this section referred to as ""the period of deferment""), as is agreed between Australia and the State before the first payment or advance to the State is made in relation to that program and, in that event, sub-section (2) does not apply, but the loan is subject to the following conditions:(a) interest shall accrue in respect of each payment or advance, calculated from the date on which the payment or advance was made, on so much of the payment or advance as for the time being has not been repaid by the State; (b) the amount of interest that has accrued under paragraph (a), together with interest that has accrued under paragraph (c), shall be calculated as at 15 June and 15 December in each year; (c) each amount calculated under paragraph (b) as at a date before the expiration of the period of deferment shall be payable by tbe State to Australia in accordance with paragraph (f) as if that amount had been a payment made to the State under section 5 on the date as at which it was calculated, and interest shall accrue in respect of that amount, calculated from that date, on so much of that amount as for the time being has not been paid by the State; I seek leave of the Committee to move the amendments together. being no objection, leave is granted. In sub-clause (2), paragraph (b), omit ""be a long term"", substitute ""be the long-term"". Omit paragraph (d) of sub-clause (2), substitute the following paragraph:""(d) the State shall repay to Australia each payment or advance (not being an advance repaid under section 7) by instalments in such manner, and within such period, not exceeding 30 years, after the date on which the payment or advance is made to the State, as is agreed between Australia and the State, the first instalment in each case to be paid on 15 June or 15 December next occurring after the expiration of 12 months after that date."". In sub-clause (3), omit ""before the first payment or advance to the State is made in relation to that program"". In sub-clause (3), paragraph (c), omit ""as at which it was calculated, and interest shall accrue in respect of that amount, calculated from that date,"", substitute ""on which the payment or advance was made, and interest shall accrue in respect of that amount, calculated from the date as at which that amount was calculated,"". Omit paragraph .(f) of sub-clause (3), substitute the ""(f) the State shall repay to Australia each payment or advance (not being an advance repaid under section 7) by instalments in such manner, and within such period, not exceeding 30 years, after the date on which the payment or advance is made to the State, as is agreed between Australia and the State."". Before sub-clause (4), insert the following subclause:""(3A) An agreement fixing a period in accordance with this section may include provision for the variation of that period before the expiration of that period and for the consequential variation of other matters."". The general purpose and aim of the amendments is to provide for flexibility in the term of each loan. The Bill, as originally introduced, provided for all loans to have a term of 30 years. The amendments allow the repayment term to be any period up to 30 years. The amendments also correct some minor drafting",109,Growth Centres Financial Assistance Bill 1973

The amendment provides for flexibility in the method of repayment, subject to the proviso that repayments must be completed within 30 years. In regard, to the third amendment, a deletion has been made to ensure that the penod of deferment can be reviewed in about 5 years time. In regard to the fourth amendment, this is a drafting amendment to ensure that the capitalised interest is repaid in the same manner as the original advance. The fifth amendment is similar to the second amendment and applies where there is a deferment period for the commencement of payments of interest and repayments of principal. The sixth amendment allows a review to cover incidental matters. debating a whole series of amendments, I wish to draw to the attention of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren) the desirability of considering, when future legislation is brought in on this matter, an amendment to cover the point that I raised in the general debate to provide that 'a payment or advance to a State under this Act shall not be made in respect of expenditure for the purpose of acquiring land, unless that land is acquired on just terms, including suitable to retain its position of monetary indeable adjustment for inflation.' Without developing that argument again, the reference to adjustment for inflation is proposed so that the acquisition laws of the States should provide that the land owner should not lose the real value of his asset as a consequence of the declining value in the currency due to inflation. It is not intended to give the land owner inflated compensation as a consequence of the urban development brought about by government decision. I turn to the other amendment which I ask the Minister to consider. I know that he will wish to leave this matter to the decision of the Else-Mitchell Committee, but I hold views in advance of the determination of that inquiry. I would like to see in this legislation Australia. There seems to be very little evidence provision that any land acquired under it when developed for residential use shall be made available for sale on a freehold basis. I recognise that today under freehold systems ( Mr Keogh) made very false statements about of title, there are many restrictions-and the benefits which have been derived by the proper restrictions-o n the manner in which various States and the Commonwealth as a the land can be used. But I think that there are many advantages that a freehold title has, such as giving to the home owner a sense of security, that are not attributed to the form of tenure that is commonly described as leasehold. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report-by leave-adopted . Third Reading read a third time. BILL 1973 Debate resumed (vide page 4103). Grants (Special Assistance) Bill affects 3 States. In this legislation, Queensland is allocated $10m, South Australia is allocated $ 19.9m and the sum of $8.65m is appropriated for Tasmania. Western Australia was a claimant State under the principal Act until a few years ago when it withdrew following a decision arrived at in the course of a Premiers Conference. Some financial arrangements were made. I hope that Western Australia will be pendence without the need to apply again to the Grants Commission. Earlier in the day the honourable member for Bowman( Mr Keogh) in addressing himself to this Bill spoke of happenings in Queensland. He stated that very little was received by that State from certain developments there. He was referring in the main to the bauxite industry in Queensland. Very little was being returned to Queensland from those enterprises. But the honourable member told only part of the story. A few days ago I referred to some of the development taking place in Australia and suggested that some honourable members should take a trip to see what is happening beyond the cities of Australia in terms of development. A lot of this development has been occurring in Western that Canberra knows what it is all about. Today the honourable member for Bowman",110,Assistance Bill 1973

There is not just a royalty paid to the State Government. There is the development of entire towns. The railways are built by developers and the ports are built by developers. This message is coming home to even Ministers of his own Party in Western Australia-Labo r Ministers. I want to refer to the heading on the front page of today's Western Australian Press because of the things said by the honourable member for Bowman earlier in this debate. The newspaper article is headed 'WA Minister' and the next 2 words are: -Canberra mad'. The article states: The Western Australia Minister for the north-west, Mr Bickerton, yesterday described as mad the Federal Government's policies limiting foreign investment in developing remote areas. He said: ' I can say unequivocally that without foreign capital our remote areas will not be developed. 'It is a matter of sensible people sitting down to work out how to arrange this foreign capital whicb at no time will prevent local capital coming in'. Mr Bickerton's criticism of Federal policies is the first in such blunt terms by any Western Australia Minister. His remarks were similar in sentiment to comments by Opposition spokesman in Western Australia and Canberra, but carry more weight politically because he is a Labor Minister criticising a Federal Labor Government. Mr Bickerton, who attended the first meeting of the Northern Development Council in Canberra this Petersen, held similar views. 'We did not have anything in the North West till we got foreign capital,' Mr Bickerton said. 'It is not a matter of knocking back local capital, it is a question of getting capital-foreig n or local. 'Tbe Australian content has not been available.' I could read a lot more of what Mr Bickerton tralia was one and I think South Australia and has said in a similar strain.

All sorts of arguments were advanced necessary at some future time for Western in those days. But the situation is somewhat Australia to go again to the Commonwealth different today in relation to the way in which Grants Commission to seek assistance. I hope the grants are in fact made. Quite a different that will not be the situation but unless the formula is adopted. I thought I had it in front people in Canberra, in this Parliament and the of me, but that does not appear to be so. Government of the day, can see what is required and can change their policies I am useful job in this area over a number of years. afraid there will not be much more of this development taking place. I have every faith in our country; I have every faith that the Australian people will in time be in a position to supply large quantities of capital for this sort of development. But at present the bulk of the capital and the know how required to do these things which are so necessary is coming from overseas. This has never been more important that it is in our oil industry today. Over the last few years we had a program which up to this point has provided 70 per cent of our oil requirements. But now the know-how and capital which has been coming here is disappearing very rapidly. That is something we cannot afford in view of the politics that are being played in the Middle East today and which, I might say, are extremely dangerous for any country or group of countries in that or any other part of the world to be playing. An explosive situation could occur if those countries continue to apply those sorts of tactics. Australia cannot afford to lose one day in getting on with the job of finding the quantities of oil that no doubt exist in this country. Britain has done it in the North Sea, although it will be a few years before she can really harness it. To get back to this Bill, it is interesting to note that Western Australia was given a grant back in 1910, which was before the Grants Commission was established, of some $500,000. Tasmania was given a grant in 1912. South Australia was given a grant in 1929. The Grants Commission itself was not established until 1933. The reason why there was a need for such a grant at that time was that the claimant States, of which Western AusThe Grants Commission has done quite a",111,States Grants Special Assistance

The Grants Commission's responsibilities have now been brought into the area of local government. In fact the local government regions that were drawn up were the subject of a document tabled some weeks ago by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Question resolved in the negative. Uren). There is a considerable amount of confusion in the local authorities throughout Australia as to precisely what terms and conditions are applicable to the making of applications for these grants. I wrote to the Minister quite recently asking him for further information on this matter. I again appeal to him to spell out or to have somebody within the Government spell out in precise terms to the local authorities throughout Australia how applications should be made for grants in this respect. I assure the Minister that there is quite able to Western Australia for a number of a considerable amount of confusion on this matter right throughout Australia.

I hope that the Grants Commission would not apply the principle which it applies in other areas such as the registration of motor vehicles. I think that if a claimant State does not apply as high a registration fee as a non-claimant State, it should not be forced to do so. I cite that as an example that could be considered. I would ask the Government to clarify at some time whether the widening of the Grants Commission's powers under the Act which was passed earlier will extend to local government regions around Australia. I support the Bills before the House. I am very pleased that the member for Bowman( Mr Keogh) has entered the chamber. Just before the sitting was suspended for lunch and immediately after the resumption of the sitting he made a rather vicious attack on the Queensland Government. I wish to take the opportunity in a few words to put the record straight. He referred to the fact that the Queensland Government charges 5c a ton on some of the minerals taken from the ground in that State. He speaks almost as if he is ashamed to be a Queenslander, but it is appropriate to remind him whence he comes to this chamber. I remind the honourable member for Bowman and other honourable members of the record of an Australian Labor Party State Government. When the Australian Labor Party was in power in Queensland it charged a royalty on coal of exactly 6d a ton for the first million tons, 3d a ton for the second million tons and Id a ton thereafter, no matter how many millions or billions of tons were taken out of the ground in Queensland. It also had a system whereby it charged those persons leasing the area for mining one lousy shilling an acre. BecauseI am eating into the normal adjournment debate time. I shall make my remarks short, but I remind the honourable member for Bowman of the things he omitted to say. He omitted to tell the Parliament today that in Queensland the railway lines which have to be put into the areas to be mined must be financed by the mining companies. They are paid for in to to by the mining companies. Furthermore, the moment they are completed, the mining Mr KeoghI rise a point of order. It it correct for the honourable member for Griffith to criticise a member of this Parliament in another place? He is criticising the ex-Leader of the Democratic Labor Party, Senator Gair, who was Premier of Queensland when these contracts were drawn up. I know that he would want to be protected from the honourable member who depends on his preferences to get into the Parliament. order involved. tributions by the honourable member for Bowman are of the type that would be made in the Queensland Parliament. Perhaps after the next election he will be out looking for a seat in the State Parliament, because he certainly will not continue as a member here. As I was saying, these railway lines must be handed over to the Queensland Government; the lines then become owned by the State Government, and the State Government charges the mining companies for using those lines for carrying freight. Last year the Queensland Government made $17m on freight charges alone. The honourable member for Bowman referred also to Weipa and the bauxite deposits in that area. The fact is that the people who have developed Weipa had to dredge a port there and build port facilities. This has happened in many other places in Queensland. The mining companies have had to outlay their finance to develop the State. My case rests there, but I remind all members on the Government side, particularly the honourable member for Bowman, that an Australian Laboi Party Minister in Western Australia is reported in today's paper as referring to Canberra madness and as standing by the utterances of the Queensland Premier, Mr Joh Bjelke-Petersen. do. able member for Wide Bay is another who will be lucky to hold his seat after the next election, likewise the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Doyle) who has a grimace on his face. No wonder the gallup polls show that the Australian Labor Party has the support of only 36 per cent of the Queensland people. I conclude by reminding honourable members opposite that an Australian Labor Party Minister from Western Australia has said that the Government is gripped by madness if it thinks that by kicking foreign capital in the belly continually it is helping the people of Australia or Western Australia or Queensland.",113,States Grants Special Assistance

Defence-Education : Newcastle Medical School Motion (by Mr Daly) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. this House has spent on the vital subject of defence under this Government has been ludicrously small. The Minister for Defence( Mr or the Attorney-General's Department. If the Barnard) made a statement on defence in August. This has never been debated and it now lies buried as No. 43 on the notice paper. Then the debate on the defence estimates was gagged by the Government after only 3 Opposition members had spoken, and even these three Mr Donald Cameron-They had 10 minutes each. for Griffith said, they had only 10 minutes each and 10 minutes is a ludicrously short time in which to develop an argument on such a complex subject as defence. In my brief remarks on the defence estimates I touched on a subject of very great importance-the amalgamation of the defence group of departments. I will elaborate my remarks now. I should like to make clear at the outset that I am in favour of such an amalgamation, if it is done properly. There is no suggestion, I hope, on either side of the House, of the removal of the distinctions between the 3 armed Services. This has been tried in Canada, and it has been a disaster with no redeeming features whatever. But even though we must keep the separate Services, we must integrate their administration and operational control. At the moment each Service Board has statutory responsibility for its own affairs. The authority of the Department of Defence is very tenuous, being based largely on a letter written more than 10 years ago by the then Prime Minister. Of course the Department of Defence has greater influence because of its control of the ear of the Minister. But the statutory contradictions remain. The existing organisation was perhaps adequate when the role of our armed Services was to make contributions to assist the forces of major allies. Then the major contacts were between our Services and the corresponding Service authorities of other countries, with our Department of Defence acting as a sort of secretariat. With the withdrawal of major friendly powers from our region, this pattern no longer fits the requirements. Our forces are likely to have to act alone, and they must have firm central control. But this control must be professional-as it is of course in other departments controlling professional disciplines, such as the Department of Health, or the Department of Foreign Affairs Government merely expands the present basically non-professional Department of Defence, with a token infusion of Service personnel as advisers at subordinate levels, it will be totally rejected by the Services and the result on Service morale will be catastrophic. Some information is gradually becoming available about the way this reorganisation is tending. My remarks on this subject are, I can assure the Minister for Defence who I am glad to see is in the House, intended to be constructive, aimed at avoiding some highly undesirable consequences that I can foresee. It is obvious that the Government is thinking in terms of having a 2-man teama diarchy of one military and one civil member-a t the top of the Department of Defence. If the system is to work, it must be made clear by statute that they have joint control of the affairs of the Department of Defence. Sole control by either would be intolerable. There are a number of points I should like to make about this. Firstly, I should have preferred a broader based committeea Defence Board-instea d of a diarchy, but this is an option that apparently the Government has evidently already rejected. Secondly, each member of the diarchy must clearly be responsible for one special function-the military member for operational matters, the civilian",114,States Grants Special Assistance

Royal Newcastle Hospital, through its outpatient clinics, conducts more than 900,000 consultations per year. It has the largest outpatient department in the southern hemisphere. At the outset, I want to pay tribute to the board of directors, the executive officers and the 2,218 staff of Royal Newcastle Hospital for the exemplary standard of service they provide to the people of Newcastle. The hospital, first established in 1817 in a building intended as a convict gaol, is the second oldest and third largest in the State. It is held in high regard by all persons concerned with the provision of health services. Last year its admissions were approximately 21,470 and its outpatient attendances were more than twice the number at any other hospital in New South Wales. Its specialist medical staff consists of 64 honorary and sessional specialists and 31 full time salaried medical officers. There are also 30 registrars and 47 resident medical officers. The following visiting specialist medical services in medical care and orthopaedics are provided by Royal Newcastle Hospital to hospitals in the Hunter Valley: Full time physicians undertake care of medical patients in the public wards of Maitland Hospital; the orthopaedic department provides a regular clinic service to Maitland, Kurri Kurri and Cessnock Hospitals; the consultants of the obstetric department co-operate with the Department of Health in providing a consultant service to doctors in the area; and for the past 13 years the hospital has supplied Maitland Hospital with resident medical officers.

The association with the hospitals in the area and hospital runs a blood bank which collects about centred on the Royal Newcastle Hospital for 10,000 pints of blood a year and supplies all the following reasons: The supply of potential hospitals in the city. Let me refer briefly to the 6 units administered by the Royal Newcastle Hospital Board. The main unit in the city comprises 509 beds, of which 73 are for obstetric patients. This site could accommodate an additional ward block and extensions for teaching facilities. At Rankin Park the 128 beds are used for chest disease patients and general medical services. Also there are facilities where male patients are given graduated work as part of a rehabilitation and retraining program. The Lodge at Rankin Park provides hostel type accommodation for unmarried mothers. The William Lyne unit is the centre of the domiciliary care service, where about 600 elderly and disabled patients receive treatment each year. This unit also accommodates long term crippled children. Belmont Hospital, with 108 beds, is a new general and maternity hospital with adequate room for expansion. Shortland Clinic, which has 21 beds and is located about a quarter of a mile from the main city unit, provides care for psyohiatric patients as inpatients, outpatients and day patients. In addition, accommodation is available for up to 30 students in residence during obstetric and other live in terms. The Royal Newcastle Hospital has pursued a policy of community involvement and total patient care, insofar as this is possible, for many years. Its training programs cover a broad range. The hospital has 30 specialists in training, all of whose posts are approved by the various postgraduate examination bodies. Resident medical officers are offered appointments over a wide range of terms for a maximum of 3 years, subject to annual reappointment. Since 1972 University of Sydney fifth year medical students have received training in surgery, gynaecology and geriatrics. Nurses' training Mr Speaker, there is need in Newcastle for teaching beds; the size of the existing medical schools in Sydney; the population distribution; the general desirability of decentralisation and the orientation towards social medicine and family practice. Over a period of many years the residents of the Newcastle-Hunter region have waged a continuing campaign to have a medical school established there. I have the complete support of my colleagues, the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation( Mr and a bare quality of opportunity rather than Charles Jones), the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James); the State members, Mr education, we should not delay any longer Face, Mr Jones, Mr Hunter, Mr Wade and Mr Booth, all members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in this project; also the Newcastle City Council, the Newcastle Chamber of Commerce, the Central Northern Medical Association, all of the hospitals in the region, many other citizen organisations and, most importantly, the citizens themselves and on this occasion, the support also of the honourable member for Paterson( Mr O'Keefe) and the honourable member for Lyne( Mr different initiative and new financial arrangeLucock). It is only 2 years ago that the then New South Wales Minister for Health, Mr Jago, foreshadowed a medical school for Newcastle within 5 years, that is, by 1976. However, the New South Wales Government's submission to the Karmel Committee proposed that foreseeable future needs for medical education could be met by extending the capacity of existing schools in Sydney. Following the Karmel Committee's report, Mr Jago in a letter to the Newcastle City Council said: The New South Wales Government's submission to the Committee clearly indicated foreseeable future needs for medical education could be met by extending the capacity of existing schools. While not opposed strongest arguments in favour of Newcastle. to establishment of an additional school in Newcastle, the State Government would insist on a satisfactory financial arrangement with the Australian Government for all increased costs. Does Mr Jago's statement mean the establishment of a medical school at Newcastle is to be inhibited by the economies of scale available by simply expanding existing schools in Sydney? If this is all that is withholding New South Wales support for Newcastle, then his successor and the Australian Government should consider the bad features of further enlarging medical schools which are already too large by the international standards accepted by most authorities. When medical schools become too large they become too impersonal, and it becomes increasingly difficult to experiment and diversify with new teaching methods. This is particularly serious in an age when medical and teaching techniques are changing with an increasing rapidity. With the dynamic new concept which this Government has implemented of making the national Government responsible for tertiary education and searching for quality of life economies of providing minimum of essential doing what is necessary to prevent further growth of Sydney's already overgrown medical schools. If extra finances are needed to start a new medical school, this Government ought to declare itself in favour of this principle. Likewise, Mr Jago's successor ought to spell out his support for this same principle. Mr Jago has said that his Government wanted further development in Sydney only and throws the onus entirely onto Canberra for a ments. If the New South Wales Government has any intention of decentralising and improving medical training, it ought to say so clearly and stop hedging. I strongly request the Minister for Education ( Mr Beazley), supported by the Minister for Health (Dr Everingham) to give the green light to the Australian Universities Commission to implement the recommendations of the Karmel Committee on medical education which gave Newcastle top priority for the next medical school in New South Wales. It has better developed facilities than any of the other applicant centres, which would mean early operation of the school, a point which the Australian Minister for Health has conceded is one of the I hope that the Minister for Education will act promptly to initiate implementation of the Karmel Committee's recommendation on the Newcastle medical school. I hope that the New South Wales Government will show the same spirit of co-operation with the Australian Government as has been exhibited with respect to the Albury-Wodonga proposals and act quickly, as barely 3 years remain to prepare the school for the intake of its first students in 1977. appear to be a true saying that 2 great minds think alike. I assure the Minister for Defence( Mr Barnard), who is at the table, that it is purely coincidental that 2 concerned Australians-the honourable member for Isaacs",116,Adjournment
299,Mr Hewson (Mcmillan) {10.44),"It would( Mr Hamer) and myself-shoul d select the same subject on which to speak on the same night during the debate on the motion for the adjournment of the House. Because of a series of events which are taking place or which have taken place, Australia today faces one of its blackest periods for its armed forces in peace time. It is one of the blackest periods because our Minister for Defence has decreed more and more defence cutbacks which sap our military strength and imperil the security of every Australian. In answer to a question today he added his name to the ever-increasing list of those who say: T am the greatest'. Never before in Australia's history has a Minister taken action which openly invites a potential aggressor to attack this country. Our defence effort has been cut back savagely. This indicates that the Minister cannot win an argument in Cabinet against his socialist mates, let alone one with his own conscience. In the election campaign last year the They should not have occurred.

If he made his promises Indian Ocean has increased. What about our to the electorate in any sincerity, he has no oil and gas wells on the north west shelf? option. It is a coward's excuse to justify these This Minister and this socialist Government cutbacks on the ground that a strategic study apparently do not take into account the vulshows that Australia faces no defence threat. nerability of our vital fuel resources. We must That study was not even prepared by his own not forget the Bass Strait oil wells and the Department. It was foisted on him by the pipelines that come from them. Surely it should be obvious that instead of reducing our defences, we should be strengthening them to protect our vital resources. The Government has ordered a reduction of 20 per cent in the steaming time for the Navy. It will probably be more like 50 per cent when we have taken into account the fuel oil costs and other problems. The Government has abolished vital armed Services units, such as the air field construction squadron, and has reduced numbers of other vital units, such as Army surveys and medical units together with the intake of trainees. Let us face it: Who would want to go into training with the future operations so uncertain? This paints a pretty deplorable picture, particularly for those of us who place the protection of our Australian society on a very high priority. These cut-backs are shameful. In fact, they could be more aptly described as disgraceful. How could the Defence Minister boast that he identifies himself with the Australian fighting man when he has proved himself to be then Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Prime Minister. Talk of no possibility of aggression in the foreseeable future reminds me of Mr from the honourable member who claims to Chamberlain and his umbrella when, in 1939, he visited Hitler in Germany and was assured that there was no threat to the defences of Britain. His own strategists within his Department do not agree with this study. Recent international events have proved its fallibility. will not allow me to answer all of them. The This Minister has no choice. He has allowed the country to retreat into the field of defence isolationism and combat sterility, let alone operational impotence. The cutbacks do not take into account many important issues. For instance, how does our expected fighting force learn weapon technology? In the recent Middle East outbreak of hostilities we saw a completely incompetent comprehension of the development of the surface to air missile. We saw an enormous amount of weaponry and mobile armament battered into submission because of a lack of understanding. This is what happens when men are not trained to use the weapons. Training in these fields is more necessary than this Government believes. The energy crisis resulting from the Middle East activities could spark off a world involvement. Anybody who stops to take a look at the situation would see that. Australia faces unforeseen or hidden potential dangers within the Indian and Pacific Oceans that surround us. It is true to say that Australia is one of the largest islands in the world and is vulnerable along a great area of her coastline. We have oil wells on the north-west shelf. I heard someone mention the morale of our defence personnel? It is stated in the 'Canberra Times' today that during the 3 months ended 31 October 85 commissioned officers left or applied to leave the armed forces. In the same period last year, 27 officers previous Government. I have cited the figures resigned. Is this showing confidence and complete faith in the future of those in charge of our military forces? Mr Speaker, I ask you that question. fence, Minister for the Navy, Minister for the Army and Minister for Air) (10.53)-The honourable member for McMillan( Mr Hewson) started off his speech in a very unfortunate way. He said that great minds think alike. He was obviously comparing himself to the honourable member for Isaacs( Mr Hamer). Of course, the honourable member for Isaacs at least has some knowledge of defence matters and I very often respect his opinion. But I have never listened to so much complete and absolute nonsense as I have just listened to be an expert on defence. Obviously someone wrote the speech for him because he could not even read it correctly. He referred to a number of matters. Unfortunately the time that I have at my disposal honourable member does not even do his homework. He referred to the number of flying hours now permitted in the Royal Australian Air Force. Certainly, there have been some reductions in flying hours but let us look at the record of the previous Government. The honourable member was not a member of the House then. He certainly will not be here in the period of the next government. He had a lot to say about flying hours. Let me give the House some of the facts. In 1970 the number of flying hours for Army aircraft was 34,938. In 1972-thi s is when the honourable member's Party was in office-the number of flying hours was 23,722. The flying hours had been reduced by 11,000 hours. Let me turn to the Royal Australian Air Force. In 1971-72 the flying hours were 144,000, which was a reduction of 12,000 hours from the previous year. In 1972-73 the flying hours numbered 133,000, a fall of 11,000 hours. This did not happen under this Government; it happened under the previous Government. The forecast for 1973-74 is 124,000 flying hours. I have reduced the flying hours by about 9,000 flying hours a year. I ask the House to compare this to the reduction of 12,000 hours. The honourable gentleman should understand that at least I have been honest enough to tell the people of Australia. These matters were concealed by the so that the honourable member will not be misinformed. So that he will have the opportunity to look at the records of the previous Government I seek leave to have the table of hours incorporated in Hansard. misstatement of the honourable member.

I said in this House that the strategic basis document arose as a result of my instruction to the Department of Defence to inform me and the Government on what was the strategic position of Australia between now and the 1980s. The strategic basis document was drawn up. I will again enumerate the persons who comprised the relevant committee, for the benefit of the honourable member. He needs to be informed on these matters, because he deliberately distorted the facts. It included the Chairman of the Chief of Staffs Committee, Sir Victor Smith. It included also each of the Chiefs of Staff, that is, the Chief of the Air Staff, the Chief of the General Staff, and thc Chief of Naval Staff. It also included the Secretary of the Department of Defence, and also a representative from the Joint Intelligence Organisation.

The honourable member inferred, deliberately of course to distort the facts, that this was something that had flowed from the Prime Minister and the 'Department of Foreign Affairs. 1 think I am quoting him accurately. The honourable member needs to be informed on these matters. We are now spending 2.9 per cent of the gross national product on defence. The honourable member should do his homework on these matters. If he compares our expenditure with that of New Zealand and most of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries he will find it is considerably higher. In New Zealand the expenditure in terms of gross domestic product or the gross national product, whichever term the honourable member prefers, is 1.7 per cent. Canada spends 1.7 per cent of its gross national product on defence. West Germany is spending no more than we are here. Let me come to the next point.
