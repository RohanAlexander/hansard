ItThursday, 8 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24313 Thursday, 8 February 2001 ----Golden Circle Ltd: Anti-Dumping Action behind Golden Circle’s anti-dumping action against imported and artificially low priced pineapple products from Indonesia and Thailand. Queensland’s pineapple growing and processing industry is under threat and it must be saved. This government must act. Golden Circle is now a world leader in pineapple processing, yet finds itself under threat from the importation of foreign product, in contravention of Australian law. As a local community, we need successful enterprises like the Golden Circle Cannery, which is internationally competitive, to export more and to replace imports. Dumping occurs when a company sells a product or an export material at a price that is either lower than that charged in its home market or at a price that is less than the producer’s full cost. In the longer term, Australians will pay more if Australian producers like Golden Circle are forced out of the market. Golden Circle directly employs over 1,600 people and is responsible for the employment of many thousands more in local small businesses. The artificially low prices of imported solid pack pineapple and pineapple concentrate are undermining fair trade and threatening the future of the pineapple industry in Queensland. Golden Circle has lodged a submission with the Australian Customs Service, which will bring down an interim finding by 24 April. I urge the Minister for Justice and Customs to take seriously Golden Circle’s case and to put an end to the importation of this dumped product. By signing my petition supporting Golden Circle, local residents can take a positive step in assisting the company by demonstrating the strength of our local support as well as sending a clear message to the minister. Four years ago, Golden Circle was under threat from the Howard government’s changes to tax legislation and 4,000 locals signed petitions supporting the company. Let us see whether we can demonstrate that depth of support again. Golden Circle is essential to the social and economic fabric of the northern suburbs and to the livelihood of thousands of local families. Much of that success is now under threat, so let us get behind them. In particular, I call on the members for Longman, Fisher and Fairfax to support Golden Circle and its farmers. As the Golden Circle anti-dumping submission says, as a result of their reduced gross profits over the last four years, there has been a reduction in the number of active pineapple growers from 310 to 268-a 14 per cent reduction, and a further reduction of 15 per cent is projected by 2002. Furthermore, the submission says that, after applying the multiplier, the number of Australian jobs destroyed through Thai and Indonesian dumping of pineapple products between 1998 and 1999 was 724, based on Golden Circle’s job losses. Further losses have occurred, and will continue to occur, if this government does not act. (Time expired) Golden Circle Ltd: Anti-Dumping Action Australian Labor Party: Queensland stration) (9.54 a.m.)-At the outset, I want to place on record my very high regard for the Golden Circle Company and for the growers of pineapples, both in the electorate of Fisher and elsewhere in the Sunshine Coast hinterland.

There being still no quorum, the sitting isThe following answers to questions were circulated: Goods and Services Tax: Information (Question No. 1640) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 19 June 2000. (1)At how many of 1,000 seminars conducted around Australia as part of the Australian Tax Offices GST communication and education campaign was there a capacity to translate questions or answers into languages other than English. (2) How many staff are available to translate or answer questions in languages other than English during the 159 000 calls to call centres made each month in 2000. (3) How many of the 9 million booklets sent to every household and business in Australia have contained information in languages other than English. (4) How many of 27 different print advertisements that appeared 81 times across 9 rural newspapers, 542 times across 31 metropolitan papers, 4866 times in 394 regional papers, and 1266 times in suburban metropolitan papers, have been in languages other than English. (5) How many television advertisements which have run on 15 metropolitan and 22 regional stations and radio advertisements for 29 metropolitan and 193 regional radio stations, have been in languages other than English. (6) How many of the 34 million hits on the ATO website could have accessed information in languages other than English. (7) How many of the 2.4 million new tax system registration kits posted out to businesses contained information in languages other than English. able member’s question: (1) In recognition of the significant proportion of non-English speaking background (NESB) and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) businesses and individual taxpayers with limited English language skills, a NESB/CALD communication strategy has been developed to assist businesses and individual taxpayers understand and comply with The New Tax System. Both qualitative and quantitative research has been undertaken with NESB communities to understand their needs and assist with the development, implementation and on-going refinement of the communication program. In April 2000, the ATO and the GST Start-Up Assistance Office launched their NESB/CALD strategies to Chambers of Commerce, Business Enterprise Centres, Ethnic Community Councils and Ethnic Press in each State. Core activities complement those conducted for the mainstream community. For example, ‘in language’ seminars have been conducted at community request in Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Arabic, Korean, Thai and Japanese. ‘In language’ seminars have also been conducted for non-profit groups and one-to-one advisory visits to NESB businesses have been conducted by members from the ATO’s GST field teams who speak languages other than English. (2) Call Centres are able to assist callers who do not speak English through the Telephone Interpreter Service. Generally callers who do not speak English call the Telephone Interpreter Service first, then they contact the Call Centre number and have a conference call. (3) In recognition of the need for ‘in language’ materials, the ATO has produced a number of translated publications. These include: Essentials 1 and Essentials 2, ABN fact sheet, PAYG fact sheet, Simplified Accounting Methods for Food Retailers, Be ready for business from 1 July and GST basics for retailers fact sheet. Products have been translated in up to 26 languages. (4) The ATO has run advertisements in the ethnic press covering up to 25 languages. To take account of the frequency of distribution of publications and other government activity, not all mainstream advertisements were translated for the ethnic press. However, to ensure that messages were re-",106,Representatives Main Committee
367,Mr Costello,"The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourceived by this audience, messages were carried as public relations in the ethnic media; for example, through the provision of information kits and translated media releases. (5) Although no television advertisements have been translated, mainstream advertisements have been placed on SBS television, an important information source for the ATO’s bilingual clients. Also, where possible, mainstream television advertisements include images of culturally and linguistically diverse business operators – making the television advertisements relevant to this client group. Advertisements placed on ethnic radio have covered up to 33 languages. Delivery of messages on radio is through advertising and public relations activities. For example, during 2000 the ATO has run monthly shows in eight languages on SBS Radio. The shows included an element of talkback where listeners’ questions were answered. (6) Access to translated materials has been available since March 2000. The Tax Reform website (www.taxreform.ato.gov.au) has a number of key documents which have been translated into many languages. The website is linked to the Department of Family and Community Services which also has information in many languages. (7) All of the registration packages for the New Tax system issued to businesses and other entities were in the English language. There was, however, reference at the end of each Guide to Registering for the New Tax System issued, to the availability of the Translating and Interpreting Service on telephone number 13 14 50. As noted in (6) above, an introductory fact sheet about ABN has been translated into a range of languages other than English. Translations of the fact sheet are available on the website, as well as in the printed form. Each translated fact sheet makes reference to the availability of the Translating and Interpreting Service for further assistance. Goods and Services Tax: Income Tax Cuts (Question No. 1881) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 29 August 2000. (1)Has his attention been drawn to any businesses that have not paid employees the tax cut that they were meant to receive after 1 July 2000. (2) If so, (a) how many businesses are you aware of in this situation and what do you believe the total loss to employees may be, (b) what opportunities do employees have to pursue unpaid tax cuts, (c) what action is the Government taking to pursue unpaid tax cuts on behalf of workers. Mr Costello 7KH $VVLVWDQW 7UHDVXUHU KDV SURYLGHG WKH IROORZLQJ DQVZHU WR WKH KRQRXrable member’s question: (1) and (2) The ATO is aware of a very small number of instances where it is alleged there has been failure to pass on the 1 July 2000 tax cuts. There are no details of the impact on employees, but it is expected to be minimal considering the small number of cases reported to the ATO. Employees can approach their employer to pursue unpaid tax cuts. If this is unsuccessful, the employee can call the ATO for assistance. Upon receipt of a complaint, the ATO makes contact with any non-complying employers as appropriate. Given the ATO is currently dealing effectively with the cases reported to it, no Government action is required. Goods and Services Tax: Computer Software (Question No. 1882) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 29 August 2000: (1) Of the 137 registered software products on the registered software facility, (a) are all of these products ‘GST ready’ (b) what testing procedures or standards must they meet and (c) who assessed the products. (2) If approved products are used in incorrect business activity statements due to software error, will the users, the ATO, or the producers be liable for any fines or penalties associated with lodging incorrect returns. able member’s question: (1)(a) The Registered Software Facility (RSF) is a self-compliance model allowing software developers to check their products against ATO scenarios. Once a software developer is satisfied that a product meets ATO requirements, he or she may submit an electronic Declaration of Compliance to the ATO and register or list the product. As at 14 December 2000, there were 175 products listed on the RSF, however not all of these products were listed as having met all the requirements for GST. The RSF has four GST sub-categories developers may list products against provided they have produced correct results when tested. As at 14 December 2000, the number of products listed for each sub-category were as follows: GST Free: 115 Input Taxed: 109 Mixed: 134 Taxable Only: 116 (1)(b) and (c) It is the responsibility of software developers to run the scenario or test data to check their products. The ATO maintains a quality assurance program that considers intelligence received regarding the performance or non-performance of registered software products. Where a product is found to contain errors, the software developer is contacted and the product is usually voluntarily de-listed until the problem is rectified. In general, the application of fines or penalties would depend on the individual circumstances of each case. However the Commissioner of Taxation has stated that if a taxpayer has made a genuine error in relation to the new tax system, for example due to a possible defect in software used, discretion would be exercised and no fines or penalties would be imposed. Where the facts indicate that a developer knowingly made a false or misleading statement in regard to a product, consideration would need to be given to possible legal action under prosecution guidelines. Telstra: Valuation (Question No. 1985 Replacement) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 3 October 2000. (1) What were the key findings of the valuation of Telstra in the Commonwealth’s balance sheet referred to in Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee Budget hearings (Senate Committee Hansard, 23 May 2000, pages 157-8). (2) Were forward estimates of the sale cost, net income and underlying budget impact of the sale of the Commonwealth’s remaining two thirds share of Telstra provided at page 2-39 of Budget Paper No.1 in 1998-99; if so, why cannot this same information be provided with respect to the sale of the Commonwealth's remaining interest in Telstra on the basis that it is commercially confidential. (1)The Government has decided not to change the valuation of its investment in Telstra under AAS31: Firstly, valuing Telstra at historical cost as the Government has always done complies with the Australian Accounting Standards. This has been confirmed by the Auditor General. Secondly, valuation at historical cost in the GGS Financial Statements is consistent with the treatment in the Whole of Government statements. This is because the Australian Accounting Standards do not permit Telstra to be valued to market value within the Whole of Government Consolidated Financial Statements (CFS).",107,Questions On Notice
368,Mr Costello,The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honour,109,Questions On Notice
369,Mr Fahey,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Thirdly, reporting investments at historical cost is the common commercial practice of large private sector organisations, which must also report under Australian Accounting Standards. (2) Yes. It was deemed appropriate to include this information in the Budget papers for 1998-99 on a one-off basis. The Government decided that it would not be appropriate to provide this information in the papers for 1999-00 or 2000-01, as was the case for the Budget papers for the period up to 1997-98. Taxation: Capital Gains (Question No. 2114) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 2 November 2000: For the most recent financial year for which statistics are available, (a) what proportion of Australian taxpayers made capital gains, (b) what proportion of wage and salary earners made net capital gains and (c) what proportion of capital gains was accounted for by (i) property development; (ii) mining; (iii) agriculture; and (iv) trusts and partnerships. able member’s question: The Australian Taxation Office publications Taxation Statistics 1997-98 and its supplement Taxation Statistics 1997-98 Detailed Tables contain the most recent statistics available on capital gains. Taxation: Financial Planners (Question No. 2150) Mr Andren asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 9 November 2000: Has his attention been drawn to concerns expressed by financial planners that the New Business Tax System (Alienation of Personal Services Income) Act 2000 unintentionally applies to their activities when they operate similar business structures to other professions such as accountants and lawyers; if so (a) does the Government view the concerns as justified and (b) what steps will be taken to address the concerns? able member’s question: The Government is aware of the financial planners’ concerns. The Assistant Treasurer, Government advisers and Treasury and Tax Office (ATO) officials have met with representatives of financial planners to discuss the legislation. The personal services income legislation applies where a person obtains 80% or more of their personal services income from one entity unless the person obtains a personal services business determination from the Commissioner of Taxation. The grounds for a determination include engaging someone to perform 20% or more of the principal work and maintaining business premises that are separate from private premises of the worker (and their associates) and premises of the service acquirer (and associates). The ATO is continuing to work with the financial planners to make their transition to the new tax system as smooth as possible.",109,Questions On Notice
