Youth unemployment remains an ongoing more than a common courtesy. I know that concern.

If they re-engage, their payment social isolation which can occur with longis reinstated. Therefore, the responsibility term unemployment. Long-term rests with the job seeker to determine how unemployment is not that far away for long they will have their welfare payments someone who today does not have a job, who withheld. In other words, when they relost their job three months ago. The slide engage, their welfare payment is reinstated from being in that position to being longand they will also be back paid.

Yet it is vital that the unemployment to be looked after and most vulnerable of these job seekers are not helped-that is, perhaps more help is needed penalised unfairly. As I said, the legislation at the front end of that experience-before is designed to afford a measure of protection, they actually slip into long-term but we need to see how that protection is unemployment. Underlying this legislation is described in the relevant regulations. a clear and simple message. It is one of In my describing in a simple sense the responsibility. People must take principle behind this-of course, like most responsibility for their own lives. If they legislation, this is full of unbelievably have a legitimate reason and are unable to complicated detail-the House will note that attend a meeting with their job services there are significant requirements on provider or if they cannot attend a job Centrelink. They are that Centrelink act in interview then they need to advise in real time, that Centrelink suspend payments advance.

The response citizens and to provide services to assist so often when you contact an agency is, 'The them to address circumstances. That is the system won't allow it.' So we need to make biggest outgoing cost that governments face, sure that the Centrelink system does allow and it is significant. The amendments, NESA this.

155,Mr Mcclelland To Present A Bill For An That This House Supports The Aspirations And,"Wednesday, 11 May 2011 Home Insulation Program Ms O'DWYER (Higgins) (09:31): Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to alert you to a terrible story about the government's continued failure on the home insulation scheme-a scheme that has cost lives and homes, destroyed businesses and cost the Australian taxpayer $1.7 billion and counting. The week before last I was contacted by a constituent of mine in Carnegie, Mr Horvath. You will remember that the government sent out insulation installers door to door to doorknock pensioners like Mr Horvath. He agreed to have them install insulation as it was a government program. He told me that, eight weeks after he had the roof insulation installed under the government's program last year, part of his bedroom ceiling collapsed at 1 am while he and his wife were sleeping. I just want to read part of the discussion that Mr Horvath had with Neil Mitchell where he described what happened: Neil Mitchell: This must have given you an almighty fright, did it? Geza Horvath: Yeah, I thought it's an earthquake because it happened at one o'clock in the morning. We were in bed. Neil Mitchell: Did it come down on you? Geza Horvath: Not exactly on us. It's about a metre from us. It came down on the wardrobe, top of the wardrobe, and it probably slipped over to the bed or hung down right on the end of the bed. Neil Mitchell: Well, you're very lucky. Geza Horvath: We were very lucky because it could have come down, the whole lot, because the weight of the concrete, this is the slab, the concrete (inaudible) into the timber and then plaster closed up on the front, so it's really heavy. When we cleaned it up, it was four wheelbarrows topped up of rubbish. Neil Mitchell: And you're quite sure this was caused by the insulation work? Geza Horvath: Definitely, because the timber with the (inaudible) timber where it's squeezed into the plaster into it. It's broken. Neil Mitchell: And you still haven't had a government inspector out to look at it? Geza Horvath: No. I couldn't cope with it because I'm on chemo, and the second chemo now, and I couldn't cope with it. But I was expecting, I got a call from Sydney about the first time. I reported it, and these people they rang me up and they asked me if I have any spotlights, and I tell them. I haven't got. But the crack was already there, and what he was saying is, ""Look,"" he said, ""you'll be alright"", and boom, he dropped the phone. There was no inspection. Clearly the safety of Mr Horvath and his wife is the most critical thing. I contacted the office of the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Greg Combet, straight away to get a safety inspector out there. Until Mr Horvath spoke to Neil Mitchell, there was no day or time Mr Horvath had been given as to when an inspector would come. Straight after the interview we got a call from the minister's office letting us know that an inspector would be out by Friday3 pm. It should not have to be like that. MAIN COMMITTEE",184,Notices Proposed Work Be Referred To The Parliamentary
156,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper) Took The Chair At 09:31.,"Now that we know that the ceiling is safe, the key problem is fixing the ceiling. Yet-get this-the government takes no responsibility to ensure that there is a rectification of damage under the Home Insulation Program. This is despite the fact that they put the program in place and paid the bills. They leave it to the homeowner to pursue and resolve. I specifically asked the parliamentary secretary's office what assistance would be provided to the people affected and what he would do to help Mr Horvath repair the damage to his home. The advice back from his department was that all that they would do was provide the name of the installer and the installer's insurer to Mr Horvath and then it was up to him. So they expect the victims-people who might be confused by the process and who might not be well enough to hunt down their installer-to write a letter to them, follow them up, contact the installer's insurer to check that it is being progressed and so on and so on-to do all the work. The department advised me that they would give him a caseworker from the department. Yet all the caseworker will do is encourage him to continue to make calls to the installer. According to the annual report of the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, the minister and his parliamentary secretary have 1,027 people working there. If they are not helping elderly and vulnerable people who have been affected by this botched scheme, what are they all doing? The government has to take responsibility for cleaning up the mess that they have created. (Time expired) Volunteers Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (09:34): 'Hard work often going unrecognised. No pay at all but the warm afterglow of knowing you have helped somebody in need'. If this was a job ad, no Australian would ever apply. Yet millions of Australians every year voluntarily sign up to jobs like this one. They are our volunteers, who give up their precious time to help others and make our community a better place. There is a secret to volunteering too. It is not just about helping others. You get something out of it for yourself. I have a passion for social capital, that idea that the things that bind us together have a value, that the social fabric is strengthened when more of us work together in community organisations. Attending a local Greening Australia nursery at Kubura Place in Aranda in my electorate, I saw Australia's volunteer spirit in action. Chatting to a group of volunteers who had been coming along for the past 10 years, I learned of the friendships they had formed over that time. Volunteers at the nursery told me that they were proud to be helping native flora around our beautiful city and thrilled to be learning about native plants, all the while making great friends. In fact, later this year the nursery will plant their millionth native tree in the Canberra region. The spirit on display at this nursery is the same spirit across the city and the country. Whether it is at the Pegasus Riding School for disabled students, where people give up their time to clean out stables and do odd jobs, parents staffing school canteens, or the many church organisations throughout Canberra that help vulnerable people in our community, such as serving breakfast or providing that important emotional counselling-across Canberra and across the nation-ordinary Aussies can be counted on to pitch in. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, more Canberrans volunteer than any other place in Australia. It is one of the things that makes me so proud to represent this city. But on the best data we can get, it looks like volunteering has fallen since the post-war period. Whether it is sporting, cultural or community organisations, they all face the same MAIN COMMITTEE challenges-how to encourage greater participation. However, if there is a light at the end of the tunnel, it is that our spirit to help has not diminished, just gone a little dormant. Events in Queensland at the start of the year showed that when it counts, when Aussies need help, we will be there-friend or stranger-ready to lend a hand. The challenge for us in this place is to work with community organisations to find a way to spark a new spirit of volunteering across Australia. In the 10th anniversary year of the United Nations International Year of Volunteers and as we celebrate 2011 Volunteers Week, I am humbled by the efforts that Canberrans and Australians make to help others in our community. Herbert Electorate: Townsville Aboriginal and Islander Health Services people gather with a positive attitude and we get things done. We respect those who have a go and we look to them for leadership. There should be no differentiation when it comes to this, but there is. Since my election on 21 August last year, I have been besieged with requests to investigate the Townsville Aboriginal and Islander Health Services, or TAIHS. I have received reports of nepotism, bullying, rorting of funding and allowances, and board stacking across the Aboriginal and Islander bodies in Townsville. These concerns over the running of this organisation have been raised previously in this House. In 2008 the then member for Herbert, Mr Peter Lindsay, implored the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin, to act. He followed that up with a letter to Minister Macklin to which it would appear that there has never been a response. In a subsequent meeting and airing of these concerns to TAIHS Chair Angie Akee, I asked her to voluntarily open her books for a forensic audit and an audit on the corporate governance. If there was nothing to hide, the allegations would be put to rest once and for all. Mrs Akee politely refused, which was her right. She said that these allegations were motivated by jealousy and that they had heard them all before. This government has known about these allegations since 2008 and has done nothing. I have come to the conclusion that this government is totally aware of what is going on in this organisation and others where this family has influence and has deliberately chosen to do nothing. They already know that these organisations are rife with questionable corporate governance and lack financial accountability. The government simply lacks the political will to address this major concern. It follows that this government does not care about the overall health of our first Australians, or that the funds meant for their well-being are being misused. This government and Minister Macklin stand condemned by their lack of action here. It has taken a group of Aboriginals and Islanders to stand up and fight for what is right. These people have the courage to stand up against the might of this government and the financial muscle of this organisation. Despite knowing full well that this government does not care, they still come forward with their stories in the hope that something will be done. If this government is serious about Aboriginal and Islander health, it will appoint administrators to this organisation immediately. If this government is serious about Aboriginal and Islander accountability, it will instigate a forensic audit of this organisation and all organisations influenced by this family. If this government is serious about Aboriginal and Islander processes, it will instigate an audit of the corporate governance of all organisations connected to this family. Townsville is a great city and we have great people. Let us hope that this government can see its way clear to represent all of them. MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Constituency Statements
157,Mr Ewen Jones (Herbert) (09:37,"Townsville is a fantastic city. It is a place whereBudget 2011 is going well. We have unemployment levels below five per cent. We have fantastic growth, in excess of four per cent per annum. We have record levels of investment going into the mining industry and we have a set of books and budget figures which would be the envy of most treasurers throughout the Western world. But it is also true that there are challenges that come with the economy going at full speed, as it is at the moment. The first challenge is that a growing economy needs a growing workforce. The second challenge is that, despite this wealth and despite the advantages of growth, there are many throughout Australia who are quite simply missing out. That is why this 2011 budget is clearly focused on both of these challenges. It is great news for people in electorates such as mine which have had unemployment levels stubbornly above the national average for far too long. The $304 million package which is targeted at 10 priority regions throughout the country, including my electorate of Throsby in New South Wales, will assist the 1,950 long-term unemployed people in my electorate and provide assistance to teenage parents, 80 per cent of whom, because of their situation, have not had the benefit of finishing high school. We know that if we are to break the cycle of disadvantage we have to ensure that these young women have the opportunity available to them to complete a high school education. That is why, as a part of this budget and this program that will be focused on my electorate of Throsby, we are providing a package of assistance to these young women. The assistance includes providing quality child care. It includes providing tailored case management facilities. It includes assisting them in financial and other ways, such as with counselling, so that they can re-engage with the education system. And yes, it does also include having some sanctions if there are no good reasons provided by the clients for not engaging and participating in a return to education plan. I think this is a program that all Labor members, and indeed all members of this House, should be proud of because it says that as the economy is booming we should not leave anyone behind.

The Gold Coast, which traditionally has had above national average levels of unemployment, was below the national average. Now, under the reckless economic management of the Labor Party, places like the Gold Coast which do not have a resources base but rely on service industries are really struggling. Thanks to this government's economic recklessness, we have now seen the Australian dollar reach incredible new heights with absolutely no additional support either in last night's budget or in previous years budgets for Australia's tourism industry-the single biggest employer of people in my electorate. This is a government that has turned its back on Gold Coasters and on ordinary Australians.

That is the legacy of this Labor Party. That is the legacy of a government which last night presided over a budget deficit that blew out to nearly $50 billion and that next year is forecast to be $22 billion. If that is good economic stewardship, if that is about making the hard decisions, if that is the responsibility of the government that has delivered a failed BER and is now about to do the whole thing again with rorts through the so-called set-top boxes for pensioners scheme then it is little wonder that Gold Coasters have lost faith in this government. At the end of the day, Gold Coasters know the truth about the Australian Labor Party. They took good economic stewardship and $70 billion in savings from a coalition government that was planning for the future and they spent every last dollar. But then they went beyond it. They are borrowing $135 million a day to spend more money on reckless projects that they can trot around their electorates to feel good about themselves while they mortgage the future of young Australians. It will be the young Australians, the Australians of tomorrow, who will have to pay off the debt of the Labor Party. It is extraordinary that Labor members opposite chant the mantra, 'Jobs', when under the coalition, which had record surpluses, we got a 33-year record low in unemployment. The Labor Party presides over 8.1 per cent unemployment in my electorate. So, please, Labor members, do not lecture us about jobs when you have doubled the national(Time expired) Asylum Seekers recent announcement to reopen the Manus Island detention facility and exchange asylum seekers with Malaysia.' Manus Island was as much a part of the Pacific solution as Nauru. It was an abhorrent policy of the Howard government, not least because of the way in which it denied asylum seekers access to Australian legal provisions. Yes, it was one of many reasons that the number of boats carrying asylum seekers to Australia eased during the early part of the last decade, but it was at the expense of our obligation as a signatory to the refugee convention and, I would add, our country's very heart and soul-the damage to which is still repairing. Processing asylum seekers again on Manus Island may well be conducted in a better way than during the Howard years but, in any case, it will still be at the expense of our treaty obligations to take in and protect asylum seekers, quickly assess their claims and provide them refuge if their claims are upheld. But as bad as the Pacific solution was, and may well be again, the policy was at least supervised by Australian officials, who did their best to implement some safeguards. Sending people to Malaysia for Malaysian authorities to deal with abandons even that last skerrick of care and will effectively throw to the wolves some of the world's most disadvantaged and vulnerable people. Significantly, Malaysia is not a signatory to the refugee convention and would have no qualms about sending asylum seekers back to their country of origin. Frankly, the government's decision to trade asylum seekers with a country which is not a signatory to the refugee convention, and one with the track record it has with asylum seekers, is in some ways even worse than John Howard's Pacific solution. Well may political leaders say or think 'We will decide who comes to this country and under what circumstances', but doing so must never be at the expense of our moral imperative to always do whatever we can to help desperate people.

160,Mr Wilkie (Denison) (09:46,"I rise today to say, 'Shame on the government for itsI call again on the government and opposition to stop treating boat people as a border security problem and start treating them as human beings, the overwhelming majority of whom are genuine asylum seekers. This is a complex problem requiring a sophisticated solution. We must do more to help rebuild source countries like Afghanistan and Iraq, more to support countries of first asylum like Pakistan and Iran, and more to help authorities in transit countries like Malaysia to deal with the people smugglers. Education Funding funding and the direction in which the government is likely to be taking the school funding regime post the expiration of the existing Schools Assistance Act. I am particularly concerned about the Catholic schools which are deemed to be 'funding maintained'. This constitutes over 1,000 Catholic schools in Australia, including eight in my electorate of Aston. 'Funding maintained', in essence, are those schools that were given a guarantee that they would not lose funding in real terms when they transitioned into the new SES funding system. So it was a very important guarantee that they would continue to have their funding increased in real terms over the course of the next four-year funding period. This funding maintained provision is in jeopardy. Minister Garrett, has more or less said that it will be abolished. He calls funding maintained 'indefensible'. There are eight schools in my electorate which are funding maintained. These are everyday schools servicing everyday parents. Their fees range from as little as $873 per annum to $4,322 per annum. These are low-fee, Catholic schools catering for everyday Australians. The benefits of being on funding maintenance are very significant. For example, St Simon's in Rowville receives $810,000 by being funding maintained and it would not have that money if it were not funding maintained. St Jude's in Scoresby receives $329,000 per annum because of funding maintenance. St Luke's in Wantirna receives $327,000 per annum because it is funding maintained. Those are the figures which are at stake for these schools. When you take those sums and convert them into per capita amounts and talk about having to make those per capita amounts up in school fees, you are talking about a doubling and sometimes a tripling of school fees in order to make up for that lost amount of money. Brian Croke, the Deputy Chair of the National Catholic Education Commission, said that funding maintenance is 'an integral part of the SES model', and simply means that the school is funded at 2000 levels, taking inflation into account. Funding maintenance is a very important provision so that schools, including my eight local, low-fee Catholic schools, do not go backwards and fees do not have to rise excessively. I implore the government to guarantee that no school in my electorate will lose funding in real terms. Brain Cancer Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (09:52): As it is unlike its more colourful cousins, many Australians will not have seen the grey and white ribbon that I am wearing today, yet many people in my electorate and throughout Australia will have seen the effects of brain cancer in a friend, a family member, perhaps a work colleague. Kaye, a constituent in my electorate and the coordinator of the Hunter Brain Tumour Support Network, has written to me on a number of occasions about the need for greater funding for brain cancer research. 'Too many people are dying too young,' she said. 'It would make your heart ache.' MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Constituency Statements
161,Mr Tudge (Aston) (09:48,"I rise to express my concern in relation to Catholic schoolThis white and grey ribbon is a symbol of the Cancer Council's Brain Cancer Action Week, which is now in its second year. Running from 8 to 14 May, Brain Cancer Action Week works to highlight the need for funding for and research into the cause and treatment of brain cancer. Although it is the leading cause of cancer death in people under the age of 40 and accounts for more than one-third of all cancer deaths in children aged under 10, it is one of the most underfunded and understudied cancers and receives too little research funding. In part this is because the speed at which brain cancer kills means that conducting clinical or biological research is very difficult. As a result, little is known about this disease other than statistics that reveal its devastating consequences for sufferers, their friends, families, carers and health workers. As a member of the Centre for Brain and Mental Health Research Advisory Board, based at the Calvary Mater Hospital in my electorate of Newcastle, this issue is very close to my heart. There are many people in my electorate who make a significant contribution to fighting brain cancer, but there is one who deserves special mention, Professor Chris Levi. Chris has made a significant contribution to the global research efforts around brain health and particularly to improving the prospects of people who suffer a stroke. Brain cancer has an almost 100 per cent fatality rate, and the number of diagnoses has increased by seven per cent over the past decade. One Australian now dies from brain cancer every eight hours. But we can make a difference. Fifteen years ago leukaemia killed 90 per cent of patients. Now leukaemia sufferers have a 90 per cent survival rate. The slogan of Brain Cancer Action Week this year is 'Ideas. Research. Hope'. The ideas are there; there can be the research. As a parliament we do need to give sufferers and their families hope. I hope that funding take-up for brain cancer research will increase.

My parliamentary colleague the member for Curtin, Julie Bishop, pulled rank and started the eight-kilometre run. The event this year had the highest number of participants, and Perth saw 3,680 people descend on Langley Park, with the majestic Swan River as the backdrop. There was an atmosphere of anticipation as local identities Paul Murray, Dixie Marshall and Perth city councillor Rob Butler warmed the crowd up with some banter and told them about the reason for the walk. People from all walks of life, young and old, came together for this purpose: to raise money for and awareness of breast cancer research. Everybody got into the spirit of the event, and it was quite a sight to see the rainbow of colours and characters all taking part. I met a survivor, Lisa Cabalzar, along with her supporter and friend Cathy Donald. They looked fantastic in their black sports clothes with bright pink bras on the outside of their clothes to highlight the significance of the event. This event alone has raised more than $7.8 million for research into the prevention and cure of breast cancer since it began in 1998.

162,Mr Irons (Swan) (09:54,"I support your cause, Member for Newcastle. My eldestfinancial services industries, has supported 20 researchers across Australia investigating all aspects of breast cancer. The funding has also supported research that has led to improved detection of and treatment for breast cancer, resulting in a 27 per cent decrease in deaths from the disease since 1994. Breast cancer still remains the most common cancer among women in Australia. In Australia, one in nine women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. Approximately 14,000 new cases will be diagnosed in women and 109 new diagnoses are expected in men. In fact, the incidence of breast cancer is increasing. However, due to the valuable funds raised by events like the Mother's Day Classic, survival rates are on the rise. Congratulations to Women in Super, who created the Mother's Day Classic in 1998, and also congratulations to major sponsor ME Bank, who have been supporting the event since 2005. I would also like to recognise the ongoing commitment of the National Breast Cancer Foundation. For my part I was honoured to be asked to be involved and I was heartened to see so many people at the event walking or running as a tribute to the thousands of Australians who have been affected by breast cancer themselves or who know someone who has. My friend Kathy Crone, a survivor, with her husband Jim and son Steve completed the walk. I look forward to continued involvement and thank the thousands of participants in Perth who showed up and are making a difference to the lives of people with breast cancer. Blair Electorate: Building the Education Revolution Program schools in Blair to the tune of nearly $109 million, from Mount Kilcoy in the north to Redbank Plains in the south. On 11 April 2011, I had the privilege of attending the largest primary school in the electorate of Blair, Raceview State School, a school of about 900 students. The school is dear to my heart because both my daughters, Alexandra and Jacqueline, were school captains of that school. As part of the Building the Education Revolution, $3.2 million was given to Raceview State School. A new state-of-the-art library and multipurpose centre has been created, and that is extremely important for Raceview State School. The multimedia centre and the multipurpose hall were created, and there were literally a thousand or more people there that day. It was important because that school has honoured the substantial contribution made by a number of local residents in the Ipswich area who have contributed to the life of the Raceview community and not just the school. For example, the multipurpose hall is named after the Marsh family. It is called the Marsh Family Hall. The Marsh family have been associated with Raceview State School for 100 years, since James Marsh joined the P&C committee in 1911. He remained on that committee for 33 years and was treasurer for 30 years. His granddaughter, Miss Hall, presents the sports award every year and is a year 6 teacher at the school, and his great-granddaughter Sahara Jarman attends prep at the school. The McGuire Multimedia Centre is named after Brian McGuire. Brian has suffered some ill health in recent years. He is a modest gentleman and he is part of the Raceview school community. He was a principal at that school for almost 19 years. He served in state schools for 37½ years. He is widely respected by his colleagues. I said publicly on that day that in my opinion Brian was the best primary school teacher and principal in the Ipswich area and so a MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Constituency Statements

Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms LEY (Farrer) (10:01): I rise today to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011. The intention of this bill is to improve the effectiveness of the recovery of fee reductions, enrolment advances and business continuity payments paid to approved childcare services. Currently, where financial recoveries need to be made, these are for the most part offset against subsequent payments of fee reductions, enrolment advances or business continuity payments made to the service. Amendments made by this bill will enable recovery of these amounts also by way of set-off from any payments made to services through the childcare management system-that is, from acquittal payments made to services under the CCMS Act and from payments made to services under administrative (that is, non-legislative) schemes. Under this government, significant debts have been raised, especially when childcare providers were transitioned to the CCMS system by the Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations, otherwise known as DEEWR. DEEWR officials in 2010 budget estimates indicated this debt to be in the vicinity of $70 million, with around 6,000 childcare providers owing a debt to the Commonwealth as a result. My understanding is that the department is still in the process of recovering these debts. However, discussions with providers have indicated that they are surprised at how tardy the recovery effort has been to date. I suspect that the Australian taxpayer would be quite mortified to learn of this unaccountable delay. This legislation will assist in the recovery, and one can only hope it will (a) decrease future debt accumulation and (b) speed up the recovery process. These are, after all, taxpayer dollars that are sitting idle. Amendments are also included in this bill to enable the recovery of those amounts from the same range of payments to be made to another approved childcare service operated by the MAIN COMMITTEE",192,Constituency Statements
164,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper,"There having been nearly 30 minutes ofsame operator. The schedule 2 amendments seek to allow for greater clarification of when exactly a service has stopped providing care to a particular child, as this determines when childcare benefit is no longer payable. Each child is permitted 42 days absence from care in a given year. However, in circumstances in which it is clear that the service has ceased caring for the child, this bill will allow the minister to specify through a legislative instrument the exact circumstance of a child's absence from care. This will then ensure cessation of the childcare benefit. Further amendments proposed by this bill will allow the secretary the discretion to cease advance enrolment payments to businesses that have notified their intent to close. This will reduce the debt to the Commonwealth where previously advance enrolment payments were paid up until the business ceased operating. In addition, the bill enables for the greater sharing of relevant protected information between departments where expressed or implied consent has been granted. The purpose of these amendments is to allow information collected by Centrelink on approved childcare services to be shared with the relevant state and territory regulatory bodies under the new education and care services national law. The coalition believes that these amendments make for a more cohesive system, unlike other policies of this government that actively seek to increase the workload on childcare providers by overwhelming providers with baseless paperwork and bureaucracy. In short, the coalition have no issue with this unremarkable piece of legislation before the Main Committee today. We take great issue with the government's management of the childcare industry and the nation's children and will, of course, have much more to say about that in the future. Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This is amending legislation. It makes a number of administrative amendments to family assistance law: strengthening debt recovery, empowering the secretary to do certain things and improving compliance and administration of the childcare benefit. It will mean that unscrupulous operators cannot operate in the market and it will protect the markets from the same. It will improve the accountability of the childcare market and also make it clear that, if a childcare operator restructures, they cannot continue to operate in the market without consequence. It will make sure that mums and dads who send their kids to childcare centres while they attend work know they have the best operators possible caring for their kids. Meaningful reform I think is at the heart of our agenda with respect to child care. I think this is extremely important because mums and dads who send their kids to child care want to make sure their kids are cared for by ethical, moral, highly educated professionals who not just provide child care but engage in the education process and improve the socialisation that child care provides for young people before they attend school. The rapid growth in the childcare industry has provided many benefits to families and to our economy, but of course there have been some problems and this legislation seeks to overcome them. At the risk of sounding Orwellian, not all childcare operators are equal, not all state regulations are best practice and not enough scrutiny has been undertaken with respect to the childcare industry to make sure that young people receive consistent, appropriate and the best early learning experiences they can be offered. The unprecedented and shocking collapse of ABC Learning Centres across the country in 2008 exemplified some of the problems in the industry. The industry grew rapidly under the MAIN COMMITTEE",193,Bills
165,Mr Neumann (Blair) (10:05,"I speak in support of the Family Assistance and Otherwatch of the previous Howard coalition government without appropriate regulation and the consequences were there for all to see. The ABC collapse could have been alarming and disastrous. It was the federal Labor government's quick and decisive action that ensured that childcare centres remained open across the country that saved the day. In fact, 90 per cent of centres remained open when most could have collapsed entirely. About 100,000 families benefited from the government's timely and effective action at the time. Since 2008 we have introduced a range of measures to ensure the financial viability of childcare providers is strengthened, and I will take this opportunity to outline some of those. These include strengthening the approval process, providing additional notification of the closure of centres and establishing a new penalty regime to have consequences for unscrupulous and unethical childcare operators. Until the 2010 budget we had invested $18.2 billion in early child care across the forward estimates, and that was increased in the budget last night. In 2010 that was $11 billion more than the former Howard coalition government, whose commitment to child care was wonderfully exemplified by the fact that they ripped $1 billion out of the childcare sector in almost the first act they undertook upon election in 1996. That was really an act of economic and familial vandalism of the sector. It had consequences in terms of not just economic development but productivity. In 2008, we delivered on our election commitment by increasing the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, from a maximum of $4,354 per child to $7,500 per child per annum. The Howard government had made it so that you could only claim it on a yearly basis or you could knock it down to quarterly, but we changed that and made it on a weekly and fortnightly basis. For a family with long day care needs earning about $55,000 a year, out-of-pocket childcare costs went down from about 13 per cent to seven per cent in 2010. This is not some esoteric piece of legislation that does not have consequences right across the country. That is evident from the fact that, based on the latest figures that I could obtain, there are 869,770 children in child care across the country. That is 627,980 families with parents working and building our economy while their children are in child care-and there are 13,899 childcare services creating jobs across the country. The legislation before us will improve accountability in the childcare industry and will protect the market, as I said, from unscrupulous operators. We have also invested another $273.7 million in the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care. We think it is important that there be nationwide consistency with respect to childcare centres-an arrangement which improves educator-to-child ratios, introduces educator qualification requirements and includes a new childcare rating system. Indeed, contrary to what the previous speaker, the member for Farrer, said, it goes about reducing the regulatory burden by establishing a single regulator. These reforms are very much based on and exemplified by international research into the first five years of life, which points to the importance of shaping the learning experience and social development of our young people. Indeed, I was pleased to see the press release issued by the Hon. Kate Ellis, the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare, on 12 April 2011, stating that a new report from Early Childhood Australia highlighted the importance of our national reforms to early childhood education and care. The minister welcomed the report and made the point that we are working with the states and territories to 'lift the standard of MAIN COMMITTEE care across the country'. The report 'clearly makes the case for quality in child care' and is at one with our position on the quality reforms for the childcare sector. There is little doubt that those on the opposite side of the chamber have manufactured hysteria and faux outrage as we have trumped them in this area of policy reform. They really have forgotten-but the childcare sector has not-that they failed miserably in this area when they were in power. The sector welcomed reform back in 1996, but the coalition came to power and just ripped the heart out of the sector. The sector was left desperately trying to recover, contacting and lobbying coalition members repeatedly. The coalition had failed them and were unsuccessful, much as they were unsuccessful in the aged-care sector during the 11½ years of Howard coalition rule. We are not going to be cowed by the white noise that those opposite not just perpetrate but also perpetuate, like the previous speaker. We are going to forge ahead because we think this is a meaningful reform agenda. This legislation is part of that agenda, improving accountability, consistency and quality. We want to make sure that parents have peace of mind, that employers and employees have certainty and, most particularly, that our young people have the kind of quality early childhood and care experience they deserve. Finally, I noted in last night's budget announcements that, under the portfolios of Mr Garrett, the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, and Ms Ellis, the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare, there was $32.4 million for an early childhood reform agenda, and I think that is important. There is $9.2 million for the recognition of prior learning package to assist early childhood workforce access training, and $23.2 million over four years for the Australian Early Development Index, to be met from existing resources. That brings the total to $28 million in relation to the AEDI for the next three-year cycle. I think that what I have outlined here in my speech shows the high priority that we put on early childhood education and how important it is, and not just for our economy. It is an absolute fact that the previous coalition government spent about one-fifth of our OECD competitors on early childhood education. It is a great shame that we spent about a fifth of what the Americans, the New Zealanders, the Canadians and the British spent. It seemed that the Howard coalition government had a real blank in this area. They just could not understand that this was an important part not just in helping mums and dads but in helping the economy. So a national quality reform agenda is absolutely crucial for early childhood education and care. This legislation, though amending legislation, is important. It is to be recognised that it plays out not just nationally but locally. Finally, I want to say that the best demonstration of this that I can think of in my electorate is the commitment we made to the Yamanto Early Learning and Care Centre, where the minister came out and made that announcement with me and we opened it together-a $1.6 million commitment. That is the best childcare centre in terms of facilities in the Blair electorate. Its collocation beside the Amberley District School means greater convenience for families in the growing suburbs in the south side of Ipswich, not far from where I live. It is about two kilometres along the road from where I live-in fact, it is on one of my running routes, and I run past it regularly. It is a well-attended childcare centre. That is a demonstration locally of the national approach we have undertaken since we were elected in 2007. MAIN COMMITTEE Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (10:17): I am quite pleased to rise to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care And Other Measures) Bill 2011. When this bill first came to my attention, back when caucus was discussing it, like most people I thought it was a fairly dull bill. It amends a whole stack of acts that have the word 'administration' in them. It deals with things like improving the effectiveness of the recovery of fees, allowing the government to pursue a childcare centre for return of overpaid fees and a whole stack of administrative things to do with the implementation of the national quality agenda. When you first have a look at it, it really does seem to be a lot of small administrative acts. But it underpins some very important reforms in what is perhaps the most important areas for many people in my constituency and beyond: the area of child care. It underpins ensuring that our childcare system is more efficient and it underpins the pursuit of the national quality agenda, and both are very important. Mr Deputy Speaker, when it comes to child care there is no doubt that times have changed since you and I were children, when usually only one parent worked and grandparents were available to look after the grandchildren even in their forties. My grandmother looked after me, and I look back now and think she would not have been much older than 45. She was certainly much younger than I am, and she looked after us from time to time. That no longer happens in quite the same way in modern families. So professional child care becomes a very important issue for families, and they care greatly about this issue-as you can imagine, because our childcare system takes care of their precious children for large parts of the day. They care that it is affordable, they care that it is available and they care overwhelmingly that it meets the standards that they expect. The Rudd and Gillard governments have been working very hard since 2007 on all three of those elements-affordability, availability and qualityand this bill underpins some of the work that we have been doing in that area. There is no doubt that the changes we have made since 2007 have already assisted families greatly. Most families now spend around seven per cent of their disposable income on child care, compared to 13 per cent in 2004. It is a substantial reduction from 13 to seven per cent of disposable income and I think we can be proud of that. There is no doubt that this is largely a result of the increase in the childcare rebate from 30 to 50 per cent, up to a cap of $7,500. The recent childcare update provides quite an interesting picture of the extent to which families are using child care across the country. Currently, 869,770 children attend child care benefit approved child care, an increase of 8.7 per cent on the June quarter in 2009. Again, that is a substantial increase and a significant help for families. Children spend an average of 21.6 hours per week in child care across all types, and almost one in four children between zero and 12 years attend child care. Almost 628,000 Australian families had at least one child in approved child care, an increase of 8.4 per cent on the June quarter. Overall we are investing around $20 billion in funding for early childhood education and child care over the next four years, and that is up by more than $12 billion since the last four years of the former coalition government. Again, that is a substantial increase, which has largely led to that change in out-of-pocket expenses from 13 per cent in 2004 to seven per cent in 2010. We also made a promise early on to pay the childcare rebate quarterly, and we delivered on that commitment. If you remember back to pre-2007, parents had to wait until the end of the financial year after the year in which they paid the expenses to claim their rebate. We also promised to make the childcare rebate payable fortnightly and we are delivering on that from MAIN COMMITTEE July 2011. These are significant improvements in the childcare system that is available for parents around Australia. But $20 billion is a lot of money and it is important that we do this efficiently. The amendments in this bill give the Australian government greater scrutiny over operators and their past practices. It enables the Australian government to offset and recover payments owed by one service from another service run by the same operator. Up until now, that has not been possible. The Commonwealth has only been able to pursue recovery of payments from the specific operator. This will ensure that operators who run up debts to the Commonwealth in one service can be held accountable for their actions via another service. For example, when an operator accumulates debts and then exits the market and re-emerges in a similar form, the government will be able to pursue that new entity for recovery. We know these accountability reforms are very important. In fact, we have been working to improve the financial accountability of childcare centres for quite some time. The collapse of ABC Learning in 2008 was unprecedented and it was quite a shock. The member for Blair has outlined some of the consequences of that. If the government had not acted quickly, almost 100,000 families would have had to find alternative care arrangements with very little notice. Since that time we have made quite significant changes to ensure financial viability of childcare providers, including strengthening the approvals processes and requiring additional notification of closures of centres. The new approvals process includes financial checks for new childcare centre operators to make sure they are viable from the outset and well placed to meet quality standards. These new amendments build on that work to ensure that we have a viable, efficient childcare sector-again, something that is very important to parents seeking affordability along with quality in child care. Affordability is, of course, a major issue for parents. As I said, we have made significant changes that have improved affordability for parents. Quality is another issue which parents care profoundly about. Recent reports indicate that quality is not always what it should be. A recent report showed that childcare centres accredited between 1 July and 31 December 2010 were not always up to standard. In some areas, around a quarter of them failed to ensure that potentially dangerous products, plant and objects were inaccessible to children or failed to ensure toileting and nappy-changing procedures were positive experiences. For parents who put their children in child care, I know that reading this report would cause great concern, which is why the national quality framework is incredibly important. This bill supports the government's $273.7 million investment in the national quality framework. The framework has already been endorsed by COAG. There has been significant work done on this in recent years. The framework aims to improve educator-to-child ratios so that each child gets more individual time and attention, and it introduces educator qualification requirements so that educators are better able to lead activities that inspire youngsters and help them to learn and develop. It includes a new rating system so that parents know the quality of care on offer and can make informed choices. I know that for parents in my constituency the ability to know exactly where they are putting their child and the quality of care that that child will receive is perhaps one of the most important factors in choosing a childcare centre. The amendments also reduce the regulatory burden, in spite of the opposition speaker's claim to the contrary, by requiring childcare centres to only deal with one regulator. We know that the first five years of a child's life shape their future. It is perhaps the MAIN COMMITTEE five years that have more importance in determining the path or your life than any other years that we live through. So it is incredibly important that we get this absolutely right. The new national quality framework enables the Commonwealth to share information with childcare services that are regulated by state and territory bodies, and this benefits childcare centres by not requiring them to provide the same information to more than one body. Again, while this bill seems to deal with rather dry administrative matters, it underpins some incredibly important reforms that the government has been undertaking for some time. I am pleased to support this bill. Ms HALL (Shortland-Government Whip) (10:27): Child care is one of the most vital services for which any government can take responsibility. Adequate child care provides parents with certainty that their children will be not only cared for properly but also given the opportunity to learn. So it is about care and also about learning, at an affordable price. Under the Rudd and Gillard governments, we have made a real commitment towards improving child care, improving accessibility to child care and recognising the importance of child care. Adequate child care is not something that is a privilege; it is the right of all parents to have access to affordable child care. That is why the government is providing $20 billion over four years for early childhood education and child care. This is almost $12.8 billion more than that provided during the last four years of the Howard government. That is a significant increase in funding for child care and children's education services. This says to me that you go to the Rudd-Gillard governments to look at outcomes for children, a commitment to children and learning, and to see how important child care is. Then you look at the record of the Howard government to see how undervalued child care was under that government. We believe that quality child care is the right of all families and all children. I think the other side of the parliament believes that quality child care is a privilege, not a right. The government is also providing $16.4 billion to help 800,000 Australian families annually with the cost of child care through the childcare benefit and the childcare rebate. This includes $9.2 billion over four years to reduce childcare fees under the childcare benefit and $7.2 billion to assist working families with out-of-pocket childcare costs under the childcare rebate. This is $10.2 billion more fee assistance than under the last four years of the Howard government. Once again, you have a government which recognises the importance of child care as opposed to the Howard government, which looked upon it as a privilege or something that was there for the wealthy. The legislation that we are debating here today will amend the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999, the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999, the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Management System and Other Measures) Act 2007, the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, the Student Assistance Act 1973 and the Age Discrimination Act 2004. The bill makes a number of amendments which allow the government to strengthen debt recovery provisions, compliance and administration of childcare benefits. These may be largely administrative changes-changes which look at compliance, accountability and recovery-but these are vital changes that will ensure the ongoing viability of our childcare system by a government which is totally committed to ensuring that all MAIN COMMITTEE children get affordable, quality child care. As I have already mentioned, this is something that the previous Howard government was not committed to. The bill improves the effectiveness of the recovery of fee reductions, enrolment advances and business continuity payments paid to approved childcare services. It clarifies provisions concerning the effects of a child's absence from care and authorises the minister to specify by legislation the circumstances in which these services will permanently cease providing care. That is quite an important change in this legislation and something that often causes confusion. I am really pleased to see that the minister has put this particular provision in the legislation, because it is all about clarification and certainty, not only to the families that enrol their children in childcare centres but to those childcare centres as well. I have been approached by owners of childcare centres who have found in the past that the provisions, uncertainty and lack of clarity in the act were causing them problems. The minister has set out very clearly the rules that are in place here. Because of this, families can have that certainty which was previously missing. There are a number of other amendments which look at the recalculation of childcare benefits and fees and information to allow the Commonwealth to share information about childcare services with the states and territories. These are all vitally important changes that will ensure the smooth operation of our childcare services. This legislation is very positive; it shows how committed the Australian government is to providing access to quality, affordable child care and to ensuring the long-term viability of child care. I would like to share with the House that since this government came to power I have noticed a big change within my electorate for the number of people that are waiting to access child care, and that is the MyChild website, which allows parents to look at the services that have vacancies and to compare fees and the services that are provided. It has been a very, very positive initiative that parents have embraced. It has helped parents and carers deal with the problems that existed previously of lack of access to services and not knowing where the services were and what was available. The introduction of this website has improved accessibility to child care. Given the state of my voice, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think I might finish there. In doing so I would like to conclude where I started, by emphasising the importance of child care for families and carers and the importance of quality child care for the children themselves. I congratulate the minister on the changes she is introducing here and on her commitment to child care and to the children of Australia. parliament to preserve a valuable asset and I thank the Government Whip and member for Shortland. Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (10:36): I thank the member for Shortland and all the members who have made contributions to this debate. This bill contains important amendments to the family assistance administration act and other legislation in order to improve accountability in the childcare sector. The government and, indeed, families right across Australia know just how important this is. We know that, and we were reminded by the overnight collapse of ABC Learning in 2008, which was entirely unprecedented. The government's quick and decisive action at that time meant that 90 per cent of those centres continue to operate for Australian families today. Had that government support not been MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Bills
166,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper,"It is always important for a member ofprovided, almost 100,000 families right across Australia might have been faced with the prospect of having to find alternative care arrangements with little or no notice at all. Since 2008 we have introduced a range of new measures to better ensure the financial viability of childcare providers, including strengthening approvals processes and requiring additional notification of closures of centres. We want to make sure that what happened in 2008 with ABC never ever happens again. The amendments in this bill today, the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011, represent a part of our commitment to improving accountability within the childcare market and protecting the market from unscrupulous operators. This bill broadens the powers of the secretary to refuse the approval of a childcare service for the purposes of family assistance law. Combined with other measures, this will give the Australian government greater scrutiny over operators and their past practices, including the power to look at whether service operators are fit and proper persons. The bill also enables the Australian government to offset and recover payments owed by one childcare service to another childcare service operated by the same operator. These measures will also enhance the government's ability to deal with phoenixing, where an operator who accumulates debts exits and then re-enters the market under a restructured company. Under current arrangements the government can only consider the exact operator and their history in the industry. We need to strengthen this. Importantly, this bill will also support the government's $273.7 million investment in the National Quality Framework. The changes to protected information will support the National Quality Framework by enabling the Commonwealth to share information on childcare services with state and territory regulatory bodies. This will benefit childcare services by not requiring them to provide the same information to more than one body. This framework, endorsed by COAG, will improve educator-to-child ratios so that each child gets more individual time and attention. It will introduce educator qualification requirements so that our educators are better able to lead activities that inspire youngsters and help them to learn and develop. It will include a new rating system so parents know the quality of care on offer and how to make informed choices, and it will reduce the regulation burden so services only have to deal with one regulator. We are doing this because we know from years and years of international research that the first five years of a child's life shapes their future, health, learning and social development. We want to make sure that that future is bright for Australian children. We know how important this is. We also know that, of the long day care services that received an accreditation decision between 1 July and 31 December last year, 25 per cent of those services failed to ensure that potentially dangerous products, plants and objects were inaccessible to children. Twenty-nine per cent failed to implement effective and current food safety and hygiene practices. Twenty-eight per cent failed to ensure that toileting and nappy-changing procedures were positive experiences, and 20 per cent did not act to control the spread of infectious diseases and maintain records of immunisations. This government believes that Australian children deserve better. As a government, we believe that we can and must do better when it comes to the safety, well-being and early learning of our children. MAIN COMMITTEE In summary, this bill makes a number of amendments that will improve transparency of the childcare industry and protect families from unscrupulous operators, and I commend the bill to the House.

Trans-Tasman Proceedings Amendment and Other Measures Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment and Other Measures Bill 2011. The coalition supports the passage of this bill which seeks to give further effect to the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement between Australia and our very good friend and partner New Zealand and, in particular, the Agreement on Trans-Tasman Court Proceedings and Regulatory Enforcement of July 2008. The latter agreement was substantially given effect to by the Trans-Tasman Proceedings Act 2010 which passed, again with coalition support. As mentioned in the bill's explanatory memorandum, this agreement will enhance cooperation between Australia and New Zealand in civil court proceedings, enable trans-Tasman disputes to be resolved more effectively and at a lower cost to businesses and individuals, and create conditions for increased trade and commerce across the Tasman. This bill makes minor amendments to the principal act to ensure consistency of language and application with the corresponding New Zealand legislation and to adopt the recommendations of the New Zealand Parliament's justice committee. Those recommendations were directed towards preventing spurious claims for a stay of proceedings based upon reliance on jurisdictional specific statutes. The bill also corrects a technical error in amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 in relation to court fees payable in respect of de facto relationship financial proceedings. It should be noted that this error was rectified prospectively through amendments to the Family Law Regulations 1984 which came into force on 22 November 2010. The Agreement on Trans-Tasman Court Proceedings and Regulatory Enforcement sets out the following objectives in the accompanying national interest analysis: to streamline the process for resolving civil proceedings with a trans-Tasman element in order to reduce costs, improve efficiency and minimise impediments to enforcing certain judgments and regulatory sanctions. The agreement increases certainty for trade by creating clear means through which to pursue civil litigation and will benefit both businesses and individuals involved in legal disputes across the Tasman. In conclusion, the bill is finetuning certain parts of the existing but not yet commenced legislation in order to harmonise more closely with its counterpart New Zealand legislation prior to the agreement coming into force. The coalition supports the passage of the bill and I therefore commend it to the House. MAIN COMMITTEE",200,Bills
167,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (10:42,"I rise to talk on the Trans-Tasman ProceedingsMs SMYTH (La Trobe) (10:45): Over recent months we have certainly heard the Prime Minister remark on many occasions about the strength of ties between Australia and New Zealand. Those ties are certainly cultural ties, but more than that they are increasingly economic and regulatory ties, and that is certainly a good thing for both countries. The practical effect of that relationship is reflected in the trans-Tasman proceedings measures which we are referring to today in relation to the Trans-Tasman Proceedings Amendment and Other Measures Bill 2011. The agreement on court proceedings and regulatory enforcement which was made between Australia and New Zealand in 2008 will certainly enhance cooperation in civil court proceedings, and it is intended to reduce transaction and litigation risks for businesses and individuals. It is expected and hoped that that agreement will allow trans-Tasman disputes to be resolved more quickly and more effectively and certainly at a lower cost. As someone who has acted for commercial parties in matters relating to foreign jurisdictions, I know that anything that can be done to facilitate those objectives is certainly meaningful. I know that the prospect of litigation in a foreign jurisdiction can certainly be a deterrent to plaintiffs pursuing a claim for a debt. Taking litigation of that kind can certainly be prohibitively expensive. It can cause cash flow problems and take up inordinate amounts of staff time. Anything to ease the means of taking those sorts of proceedings in other jurisdictions, as will be facilitated by this legislation, is of benefit. The agreement between Australia and New Zealand also forms one of the initiatives between Australia and New Zealand to strengthen economic integration, including the development of a single economic market, which is being undertaken under the umbrella of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement. It is good to see the practical consequences of those more widespread economic reforms being seen today. To implement the trans-Tasman proceedings agreement, Australia introduced certain legislation in 2010. In August 2010 the New Zealand parliament enacted its equivalent legislation. We know that several changes were made to the New Zealand act during its passage in response to both parliamentary committee reports and stakeholder concerns, and it is appropriate that this amending act be entered into to enable harmonisation and codification of both of those pieces of legislation. The bill will make equivalent amendments to Australian acts to ensure the effectiveness of the regime. It will also address certain internal inconsistencies that may have been found in the Australian acts, and it will make the provisions clearer and easier to understand. Stakeholders in Australia have certainly been closely consulted during the project, and we know that they support the legislation. In addition to those measures which are contemplated by the bill, there are certain family law fee measures. The bill contains technical measures to retrospectively validate fees charged for de facto financial matters in the Family Court and relevant state and territory courts for the period from March 2009 to November 2010. Without adding significantly to the last speaker's factual outline of the bill, I am very pleased to lend my support to it and will be happy to see it passed. contribution to the debate and their very supportive statements. The Trans-Tasman Proceedings Amendment and Other Measures Bill 2011 does make only minor amendments, MAIN COMMITTEE",202,Bills
168,Mr Mcclelland (Barton,"Attorney-General) (10:48): I thank members for theirit must be said, to the Trans-Tasman Proceedings Act 2010 and the Trans-Tasman Proceedings (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Act 2010, but the combination of the operations of those acts is significant. The minor amendments that we are discussing today will harmonise the language and structure of these acts with the New Zealand Trans-Tasman Proceedings Act 2010. That harmonisation is essential. It will ensure the clear, consistent and effective operation of the cooperative Trans-Tasman Proceedings Scheme, which is based on the 2008 Agreement Between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand on Trans-Tasman Court Proceedings and Regulatory Enforcement. This cooperative scheme will streamline and simplify the process for resolving trans-Tasman civil court proceedings and assists in creating optimal conditions for trade and commerce across the Tasman. By removing some of the barriers to simple and effective trans-Tasman civil dispute resolution for both individuals and businesses, the scheme forms an important part of the government's microeconomic reform and access to justice agendas across both countries. The bill also contains technical measures to retrospectively validate fees charged for de facto financial proceedings in the Family Court of Australia and certain state and territory courts between 1 March 2009 and 25 November 2010. It has always been the government's intention to have court fees apply consistently to de facto and matrimonial disputes. The measures in schedule 3 of this bill would ensure that the fees applying to de facto financial proceedings were the same as those applying to matrimonial financial proceedings and parenting matters in the relevant period. In conclusion, this bill provides the necessary amendments to ensure that Australia's harmonised application of the Agreement Between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand on Trans-Tasman Court Proceedings and Regulatory Enforcement is consistent with New Zealand. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Air Cargo) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Security Amendment (Air Cargo) Bill 2011 is designed to make a series of amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to enhance Australia's ability to respond to emerging threats and clarify existing provisions in the legislation. The coalition in government had a strong record of securing Australia's borders by strengthening aviation security. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001, the coalition took action to restructure Australia's aviation security regulations and over time implemented sensible changes to respond to technological advances and the broader security environment. We also undertook a range of new initiatives to help ensure that our borders were safe. We substantially upgraded the quarantine service, more than doubling it in one budget alone. We MAIN COMMITTEE",203,Bills
169,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Leader of The Nationals) (10:52): The Aviation Transportalso increased inspections at airports and made sure that almost 100 per cent of passengers coming into Australia went through a proper customs and quarantine check and therefore we could be confident that our borders were secure. Unfortunately, since the election of the Labor government, many of those measures have been eroded and last night's budget was no exception. Unfortunately, the government is continuing to reduce its investment in our borders and therefore exposing us to risks: quarantine risks, security risks and of course the risks of importation into this country of products and items that we do not want. Last night's budget imposed significant reductions on most of the border protection services: Customs, ASIO and even the Federal Police. This does not reflect a government that is serious about security. It comes into this chamber with amendments to transport security arrangements while, at the same time, it is eroding the investment in border protection services. There has been particular concern about the running down of the number of people in and expenditure on quarantine. We now have a situation where the government has insufficient funds to be able to deal with disease incursions into our country. The small allocation that was in the budget will go nowhere near dealing with the serious issues associated with the eradication of pests that have come into this country since the election of the Labor government. We also have to be concerned about the real lack of commitment to biosecurity issues and the associated risks to our environment, agricultural production and our way of life when pest and disease incursions occur in Australia. The government has lost its way in this area. It is a low priority for them and, unfortunately, the country will pay a very high price for this carelessness. Once, almost all passengers arriving in Australia could expect to have to go through inspections on arrival at our airports. Now many are simply waved through, because the government has so cut the numbers of Customs officers available on the front line that it is simply no longer possible to undertake the inspections that are really necessary if we are serious about these kinds of issues. So, on the one hand, the government talks its rhetoric, but, on the other hand, has been cutting the services that can actually deliver better security. On top of that, of course, this budget has sapped funds from all sections in border security to try and fund the enormous cost overruns-perhaps $1.9 billion-that are a result of the influx of asylum seekers. Labor's inability to manage our borders and secure our nation is a significant threat to our future. It is disappointing, therefore, that the government is not prepared to devote the resources that are necessary to deal with these issues properly. They have got the policies wrong and now they have not got the resources to be able to administer them. The soft approach that they are taking in relation to biosecurity issues-allowing imports from countries where diseases are prominent without taking appropriate measures to ensure that Australian industries are protected-is shameful. Frankly, it is shameful. And now there is the backdown in relation to New Zealand apples, which will effectively allow New Zealand apples to come into Australia without any special criteria at all to deal with fire blight. This disease has been the threat to the Australian apple and pear industry for generations. We have had tough rules to make sure that these diseases do not come to Australia and now the Labor government has agreed to protocols which make no different provisions for export of New Zealand apples to Australia than for countries that do have fire blight. There are no special MAIN COMMITTEE arrangements at all. I think that, again, is Labor asleep at the wheel-or it just does not care and is more interested in making friends around the world and getting a seat on the Security Council than in actually looking after the interests of our country. So on the one hand, there is talk about the importance of security through legislation of this nature. But in the really important things-the things that really matter-Labor is not prepared to devote the resources or make the appropriate policy decisions which will help secure the cargo coming into this country and make sure that our country is kept safe from and free of pests and diseases and security risks. This bill implements some of the measures that were announced in the aviation white paper released in December 2009. The coalition has generally supported the measures put forward in the white paper in relation to aviation security as a logical progression of the Wheeler review of aviation security, which was completed by the former coalition government in 2005. The bill is not major in its consequences. It makes four amendments. Firstly, the bill amends the definition of 'aviation industry participant' in the act to include accredited air cargo agents. The act distinguishes between registered air cargo agents and accredited air cargo agents. AACAs include smaller operators involved in the aviation industry who have less complex business operations, including couriers and contract drivers. Currently the AACAs are not defined as aviation industry participants, which means they are not subject to the same level of obligations that applies to RACAs in times of heightened security. Importantly, AACAs are currently not subject to special security directions. In late October 2010, terrorists operating from Yemen attempted unsuccessfully to send explosive devices inside printers to the USA. In Australia, increased security requirements were implemented for cargo from Yemen and Somalia, using the special security directions. Including AACAs within the definition of an aviation industry participant will mean that they are also subject to special security directions and will allow for a more consistent response to security threats. The amendments will also mean that AACAs must have a transport security program and will compel them to comply with incident reporting requirements. The burden on small business in having to develop and comply with these reporting requirements was a matter of concern to the opposition. These are small operators by definition. They are people who were previously not considered to be of such import in the chain that they needed to be included in the legislation. I accept that there is good reason to include in the legislation even those who may be just peripheral players, but it would be unfair if new legislation required the same kind of planning and regulations that apply to large businesses to also apply to these small operators. I have been assured that the burden on small business has been addressed, as the AACAs will complete an online application form which will automatically generate a transport security program which they can print off and keep for their reference-in other words, there will essentially be something on the shelf that they can use. We will need to monitor whether in fact that transport security program is relevant to their needs, is not unduly intrusive and delivers what is intended in relation to enhancing cargo security. Secondly, the bill extends the validity of the RACA transport security programs to 31 December 2012 unless revised prior to that date or cancelled at an earlier date. This amendment is intended to ease the burden on industry and the department during the transition to the new arrangements. The transition will allow industry to determine which MAIN COMMITTEE regulatory scheme is the most appropriate for their business, potentially therefore reducing compliance costs and streamlining arrangements for some of the participants. Thirdly, this bill allows for a legislative instrument to prescribe security training requirements for RACAs and AACAs. This amendment is designed to ensure consistency in training outcomes and in doing so raise the skill level of AACAs and RACAs to increase security across the industry. Again, let me emphasise the importance of not imposing unduly restrictive and time-consuming training components on these very small operators. The reality is that we need to make sure that they know what their job is and they know what to look for, but one would hope that these skill assessments and training programs do not so eat into their time that these often battling businesses are unable to remain profitable because they spend all their time away at training programs. Business feels overloaded at the present time by all of its obligations to undertake training. Training is important, but you can be highly trained and end up with no business if there is not a recognition of the fact that this kind of thing intrudes into the working time of the people who are doing the training, and it therefore may affect their capacity to do their real job. Allowing for a legislative instrument to prescribe the requirements, which will happen as a result of this legislation, rather than by notice, will increase transparency and allow for the scrutiny of the parliament of the prescribed levels of security training. That of course is the protection for small business if the department should adopt an unnecessarily heavy-handed approach on these matters. Fourthly and finally, the bill makes two minor technical amendments, one to remove certification provisions to reflect industry practices and the other to clarify terminology by replacing the term 'freight' with the term 'cargo'. I do not think too many people would know the difference, but in reality this is one of the changes that is included in the minor technical amendments in this bill. The matters before the main committee are relatively minor. It is typical of another tendency of the current government to introduce in almost every session a new amendment bill in relation to aviation security that deals with just trivial matters. I do not know why on earth they cannot get their act together and deal with all these things in a single piece of legislation. But I know that the minister, in his other role as Leader of the House, likes to get up at the end of the year and boast about the number of bills that have been passed by the parliament. This will be another one. It will pass with very little controversy, but why it was not included in last session's aviation security legislation, or the one that we will no doubt get in this session, is beyond me. If the objective is quantity rather than quality I do not think the government has got its priorities right. The coalition supports the sensible evolution of aviation security and screening measures, provided the new measures are fully explained and overall security measures are not diminished. However, we need to not just concentrate on the regulatory regime and making sure it is right, although that is of course important, but the government must devote the necessary resources to rebuild the quarantine services they have stripped away and make sure that Customs has adequate resources to do the border protection work that it needs to do. We also need to ensure that security flights and surveillance of our oceans, which have been axed in this budget, are restored so that we can be confident that our nation is protected from MAIN COMMITTEE threats to our security and so that our prized pest-free and disease-free status is maintained wherever possible. the member for Wide Bay, because, reading between the lines, I think he was trying to actually say that this government is maintaining a vigilance on these issues. I think he was complimentary of the fact that we do not take our eye off the ball when it comes to issues such as aviation security, particularly in respect to passenger and cargo movements. With the growing change that is occurring in that space I think the coalition is trying to say in a veiled way that not only do they support the carriage of this particular piece of legislation but also they are indebted to this government for being ever so vigilant on these issues. We are not simply putting them away and then having a big piece of legislation introduced every now and then. Instead we are doing things when it is required. This is an issue that is required. I too support the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Air Cargo) Bill 2011. Aviation security is a concern to all Australians, regardless of whether you are going to be a passenger or whether you are running a small business, as the member for Wide Bay referred to. People are using air cargo more and more these days. It is increasingly becoming more efficient as a way of doing business. Australian consumers want their product quickly, and one of the issues associated with that is the speed of delivery; therefore, airfreight forwarding is one of the fastgrowing sectors in the Australian marketplace. I know a bit about that, because I have worked very closely with the aviation sector in my past-particularly the Sydney Airports Corporation. I know the amount of space that is required, not only for airfreight but for any additional berths for air cargo transporters now, which are rapidly becoming very common in our aviation space. That being the case, we must stay very much in tune with the fact that there are growing security issues associated with it. As someone said a little facetiously about the member for Wide Bay, this is not a matter of sitting on your hands until you have enough to justify running a substantial document and saying that that is now the new documentation for this industry. We must be prepared to make amendments to finetune and to ensure that we stay ahead of the game when it comes to issues of transport security. Don't forget, it was only in late October that terrorists operating out of Yemen concealed improvised explosive devices inside a set of printers in an air cargo consignment that was destined for the United States. What occurred there was that people went onto an alert footing. The Australian government responded very quickly and took immediate action to protect the travelling public and the Australian aviation sector, strengthening measures against inbound cargo-in this case originating from Yemen and Somalia. That occurred through special security directions, as they are called, issued to the regulated air cargo agents, the RACAs. That worked very well. The product coming in required inbound screening-not only inbound screening but screening prior to being loaded. This is where one of the problems exists. We are also talking in this space of air cargo groups referred to as accredited air cargo agents, AACAs. They are not the same as regulated air cargo agents. They are smaller, maybe irregular. So under current legislation these special directions were able to be issued, for instance as a result of the Yemeni incidents, to RACAs. The same directives were not able to be sent to accredited air cargo agents. That is obviously something that must be corrected. That is why this piece of legislation is going through now. Unlike the member for Wide Bay, who might want to feel comfortable and be able to sit back MAIN COMMITTEE",204,Bills
170,Mr Hayes (Fowler,"Government Whip) (11:08): On behalf of the government I thankand wait until we accumulate a certain amount of issues before we do something, we know this is something that was very real in October 2010. It was very real, a determined and concerted attack using air cargo as the delivery device. As a consequence our agencies responded well, but they identified that there was an issue that needed to be tightened up, to put it beyond doubt-that all those receiving air cargo into this country should be subject to the same specifications. That has now occurred. The amendment is an important one. It fundamentally does four things: it improves Australia's capacity to respond to heightened security threats such as what occurred last October; it provides transitional arrangements to ease the regulatory burden on air cargo industry members while the new initiatives announced by the government in 2010 are enacted; it includes training requirements for the air cargo industry and improves the transparency and consistency of training amongst its members; and it also-almost as an efficiency measure-simplifies the air cargo clearance processes in this country. This amendment is important as we as a government must do all that we can to deter and prevent unlawful interference with our aviation industry. The very nature of what we are dealing with means that amendments such as these are essential for us to stay on top of our game in the security environment. This is something the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement is currently looking at again in terms of air transport safety and, in their case, maritime transport safety. Arrangements are such that we are capable of preventing and disrupting not only terrorist acts but also vehicles for organised criminals. The Australian government, as I said, in the Yemeni incident did not waste any time. It responded very quickly and it did so to protect the Australian public and the aviation industry that accesses Australian airspace. Nobody would expect anything less in that regard. This amendment also streamlines the importance of the systems that are in place by improving their transparency. It ensures that all players in the aviation cargo industry have the same training provisions and are subject to the same regulatory regime. Additionally, it provides for special security directions to be applied at times with consistency in times of heightened security. Another important aspect is that this amendment aligns Australia's air cargo practice with best practice in the world. To align ourselves with best practice is to ensure that both the travelling public and those who rely on cargo for commercial purposes are protected, as is our country, as a consequence of ensuring that not only Australia but all countries work to achieve the best outcomes in this particular space. That has occurred. This amendment was given rise to by an incident, a planned terrorist attack, in October 2010. That we reacted as best we could and discovered there were deficiencies within the regulations and have moved promptly to do something about that to protect the Australian travelling public as well as those involved in the aviation cargo sector should be something that is applauded, not something that the Opposition should waffle on about: apples coming from New Zealand or how you should hold a group of these together until you have got a big wad of documents to make a substantial change to legislation. We need to act and to act promptly in order to achieve proper outcomes for not only the travelling public but the Australian community at large. In closing, this piece of legislation will fundamentally increase flexibility in responding to heightened security threats to this country, it will reduce the regulatory burden and cost to industry members during their transition to the new air MAIN COMMITTEE cargo security framework, it will allow for greater scrutiny, consistency and transparency in the training requirements of the air cargo industry sector and it will simplify technology for the industry and reduce confusion. It will ensure that we as a country are best positioned, according to the information that we have available to us at this stage, to protect Australia and the travelling public. It will also ensure that those who rely on the importation of air cargo are protected and are not affected by the vile efforts of those who use air cargo as another means of delivering terrorist threats throughout the world. I commend this piece of legislation. I think the amendment bill should be supported by all. It should be supported for the right reasons-that is, that this is an instance where the government has acted promptly to ensure that we have a suite of regulatory provisions in the security environment that is world's best practice. I commend the amendment bill to the House. Amendment (Air Cargo) Bill 2011. The majority of legislation proposed by the government is ill-conceived and misguided, as we have seen, from GroceryWatch to pink batts to border protection. Just about everything they touch turns to a complete and utter shambles. As we witnessed last night with the budget, this mob would struggle to run a chook raffle. However, the coalition supports this bill, which demonstrates that on the very rare occasion when the government introduce a bill that will not damage our economic prosperity the coalition is prepared to support it. Airfreight is essential to the world's economy. Every year, over 26 million tonnes of goods travel by airfreight around the world. In value, 30 per cent of all international trade in goods is carried by airfreight. No other means of transportation is better equipped to meet the economic realities of the future, where global supply chains and just-in-time logistics require companies to receive and ship greater quantities of goods more frequently, quickly and reliably over long distances. Australia, as an island continent with no land borders and geographically isolated from the major markets of the world, relies more heavily on efficient and competitive air services than any other country. Although airfreight represents less than one per cent of our nation's trade by volume, it makes up over 20 per cent by dollar value. An efficient and competitive airfreight sector allows our nation to turn the tyranny of distance and our geographic isolation to our competitive advantage. Annually in Australia over 680,000 tonnes of airfreight are shipped, worth over $100 billion. An efficient and competitive airfreight sector also contributes significantly to the economic viability of passenger airlines, which are so vital to our tourism sector. The holds of passenger aircraft typically contain significant amounts of air cargo. Therefore, well-organised and economically efficient airfreight services are indispensable to the success of Australia's economy. However, there are risks to these efficient and competitive airfreight services. These risks are also a threat to our economic prosperity. These risks come from the threat of international terrorism, from anticompetitive practices and, of course, the delusional nonsense of a tax on carbon dioxide. In recent years we have seen this danger to the efficient and competitive airfreight industry of anticompetitive practices such as price fixing and price discrimination. Only late last year the European Union fined 11 airlines, including Qantas, a total of €1 billion for forming a global cartel for fixing airfreight prices. This illegal price fixing cartel conspired to fix fuel surcharges to ensure that, worldwide, airfreight carriers imposed a flat surcharge per kilo on all shipments. The cartel members also extended their MAIN COMMITTEE",208,Bills
171,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (11:21,"I rise to speak on the Aviation Transport Securityillegal activities by conspiring to introduce a security surcharge and refusing to pay commissions. In Europe, the Air France group received the biggest fine of €340 million. British Airways was fined €104 million, Singapore Airlines was fined €75 million, Cathay Pacific was fined €57 million and Qantas was fined €8.8 million. In addition, in the US further fines totalling US$1.5 billion were levied against airlines that acknowledged fixing fuel surcharges. In the US, Qantas agreed to pay a US$26.5 million settlement to resolve their liability under a US class action, and they still face a further $200 million class action in Australia. Hopefully, with these penalties, the threat of cartel conduct in the airfreight industry has diminished. Another threat to our airfreight industry is the threat of anticompetitive price discrimination. Put simply, price discrimination occurs when the same product is sold to different buyers in competition with each other at prices where the difference is not reflected in costs. The dangers of price discrimination to the airfreight industry were evidenced about 10 years ago in three cases in Europe, known as the Spanish, Belgian and Portuguese airport cases. These cases were brought under article 82(c) of the EC Treaty, which makes it unlawful to apply: … dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage. While Europe and the USA also have these protections against price discrimination, Australia, under our competition laws, does not. So, until this loophole is closed in our competition laws, the risk of anticompetitive price discrimination remains a threat to the Australian airfreight industry. The other major threat to an efficient and competitive airfreight industry is the threat of international terrorism. This threat of terrorism in Australia remains real. Only last December a group of Islamic extremists were found guilty by a jury of conspiring to plan a terrorist attack on the Holsworthy Army base in New South Wales, which is part of the electorate that I represent, the seat of Hughes. The jury heard that, armed with high-powered military weapons, this group planned to storm the lightly guarded base, shooting anyone in their sights until they were gunned down themselves or captured. The ringleader was seen on CCTV arriving at the Holsworthy railway station-a station which I often go to to give handouts to the many thousands of commuters who go through it every morning-walking along the perimeter fence of the Army base and approaching the gatehouse, which was manned only by unarmed private security guards. This attack was foiled only by the brilliant investigative work of our police, which potentially saved hundreds of lives. The threat of international terrorism to the efficient airfreight sector was also highlighted last October, when two bombs containing powerful explosives were sent from Yemen through FedEx and US. They were bound for the US but were intercepted by security officials in the UK and Dubai. Qatar Airways confirmed that the bombs intercepted in Dubai had actually been transported on two of its passenger jets, the first from Yemen to Doha and then from Dubai on a second plane. The first leg would have seen these bombs on an Airbus A320 and on the second leg they would have been on an Airbus A320 or a Boeing 777. The devices seized in the UK also went via Dubai and are believed to have passed through Cologne airport in Germany before being intercepted in the UK. Both parcels were addressed to synagogues MAIN COMMITTEE in Chicago, although it is believed that the bombs were meant to go off on the aircraft rather than at their destinations. Again, this plot was foiled by the work of our intelligence agencies. The air parcel bombs addressed to synagogues in Chicago have highlighted a major vulnerability in the global aviation sector: our airfreight, where the checks are far less stringent than in passenger travel, even though the larger percentage of freight is carried on world passenger jets. In my previous occupation I was the export management for our company and I would often have to take goods down to Sydney Airport. I was often concerned and surprised by how easy it was to get goods on board a plane, although I was also concerned that additional security requirements could delay the procedure and hold up international trade. From these security threats we know that it is human nature that each new security incident promotes a desire to introduce yet more security measures. But good security is all about comprehensive threat assessment and balanced risk management, not the elimination of every conceivable risk. We must also remember that terrorists measure their success by how much we overreact to their provocations. Therefore, a reasoned and coordinated response to this threat is essential. Security comes at a cost already measured in tens of billions of dollars to the world economy for aviation alone, and any new security procedures can be justified only when it is demonstrated that the benefits outweigh the additional burdens they impose on a society. Any new air cargo security programs need to be driven by a supply chain approach so that everyone from the manufacturer of the goods to the airport is responsible for the security of shipments. That is why the coalition is happy to support this bill. The Accredited Air Cargo Agent Scheme extends the existing Regulated Air Cargo Agent Scheme to cover small operators with less complex business operations, such as couriers and contract drivers. The coalition believes this bill gets the balance right to strengthen our air security, and we give our support to this bill. However, we must monitor the practical effects of the bill to ensure that small business is not unduly restricted by additional regulations which unnecessarily burden the efficient operation of our air freight industry, which is so vital to our ongoing economic prosperity. Amendment (Air Cargo) Bill 2011. The bill is designed to make a series of mainly technical amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to enhance Australia's ability to respond to emerging threats in aviation security and clarify existing provisions. The bill flows on from the action which was taken by the coalition after September 11, 2001, when we took necessary action to improve aviation security following the dreadful and appalling acts which occurred on that day. The importance of aviation security really hit home after 2001, and we saw that on two fronts. One is that the globe in many ways came to a standstill once it was realised that world aviation could be threatened by people who wanted to do nothing else but disrupt global air travel and to achieve nothing else but disrupt world trade completely. The importance of our aviation sector to global trade can never be underestimated. A country like Australia is wholly dependent on being able to export at least 80 per cent of what it produces, so if we cannot guarantee that those goods and services can access overseas markets by aviation then we put a hole in our national economy. Roughly 30 per cent of what we produce is reliant, in one way or another, on the aviation sector to get to global markets. Our tourism sector also is wholly reliant on our aviation sector.

We saw that some of the requirements put in place by the US and the European Union in the months that followed September 11 did have consequences for Australia's commercial interests. We have to plan so that, if there are future security issues in aviation, we make sure that the measures are balanced so that they do not impact on our commercial interests and fail to achieve the goals which they set out to do in our aviation security. Following the actions that the coalition took after September 11, in February 2010 the Labor government announced the Strengthening Aviation Security Initiative, which consisted of a number of measures designed to strengthen Australia's international and domestic security against emerging threats. It highlighted that the government would invest $200 million in new and improved security technologies, including increased policing at airports and enhanced security procedures, as well as strengthened international cooperation. The announcement included $54.2 million for the establishment of a regulated shipper scheme and funding to assist industry to procure approximate examination technology such as X-ray and explosive trace detection equipment to secure air cargo. The coalition has previously supported other measures in this package when they have come before the parliament, including the introduction of body scanners facilitated by the Customs Amendment (Export Controls and Other Measures) Bill. That is why we are also happy to support this bill. The announcement in February last year built on the enhanced aviation measures outlined in the government's aviation white paper, Flight path to the future, which was released in December. Once again, the coalition, correctly, generally endorsed this white paper because it was a logical progression of the Wheeler review of aviation, which was set up and completed by the former coalition government in 2005. I must say that it is incredibly pleasing to see that both sides of the House have proceeded in such a sensible and formal way with these measures. It shows that on this issue we can all work together to make sure that the aviation industry is securely protected. In the support we saw for the Wheeler review, followed by the aviation white paper, we have shown correctly that we are working well together on this issue. This is an important issue. In late October of last year we saw that cargo from Yemen had improvised explosive devices concealed inside printers. They were sent as air cargo consignments to the USA. If those devices had been detonated we once again could have seen the aviation sector grind to a halt, bringing with it all the economic and personal consequences that go with that. In Australia the government increased security requirements for cargo from Yemen and Somalia, using the relevant acts. The situation demonstrated that we do have the ability to respond quickly. That is very pleasing given all the work that has gone on from both sides of the House on this issue. This bill contains four measures designed to improve Australia's aviation security regime. The first amends the definition of 'aviation industry participant' to include accredited air cargo agents. This is a logical inclusion and once again one that we on this side support. Accredited air cargo agents include smaller operators involved in the aviation industry who have less complex business operations, such as couriers and contact drivers. By including them within MAIN COMMITTEE the definition, they will be required to have a transport security program and, importantly, it will ensure consistent and coordinated responses across the industry to special security directions. It will also compel them to comply with incident reporting requirements. The second part of the bill refers to and extends the validity of regulated air cargo agent transport security programs. Once again, this is fairly straightforward in that the amendment is intended to ease the burden on industry participants and the department during the transition to the new air cargo security framework. The transitional provision will allow the industry to determine the most appropriate regulatory scheme for their business, reduce compliance costs and streamline arrangements, all of which is to be applauded. The third allows for a legislative instrument to prescribe security training requirements. Allowing for a legislative instrument to prescribe requirements rather than by notice will increase transparency and allow for the scrutiny of parliament of the prescribed levels of security training. It is a sensible provision, especially in the fact that it allows parliament some oversight. Fourthly, the bill makes two minor technical amendments. It removes certification provisions to reflect current operational practices already applied in the industry. Secondly, the bill replaces the term 'freight' with the term 'cargo', which is more relevant for industry participants. The term 'cargo' is used in other parts of the bill, so this amendment makes terminology more consistent throughout the bill. This bill is supported by the coalition. We recognise the importance of aviation security. It obviously has consequences for the security of all Australian citizens. It is important for the flow of commerce, both to and from Australia. It is also vital to our tourism sector. I endorse this bill. Transport) (11:44): I thank members for their comments and contributions to the debate on the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Air Cargo) Bill 2011; indeed, I thank all members for their support of this legislation. Aviation security is something that should not be a partisan issue. It is important that we recognise that there are threats to our national security. There are people who would want to do us harm. It is vital that we have a debate in this parliament. The government is showing leadership on this issue by producing a comprehensive plan through the aviation white paper, which, I might inform members, is regarded highly, as it was when I had meetings in the UK at the time of the Yemeni package and threat that was mentioned by the member for Wannon. I was in London at that time and was able to meet with the head of transport security in London. We immediately put in place restrictions. But also the context of what we are doing here, the aviation white paper, is very highly regarded across the world. Indeed, just last month I attended in Singapore an invitation-only meeting of IATA that looked at the range of issues. There were industry leaders. There were only two ministers present: the minister for Singapore and I, as the Australian minister. It was a great honour to our country and to me to be able to represent Australia at such a forum. Next month, I will be attending the IATA General Assembly, where there will be that cross-dialogue occurring to ensure that we have that international cooperation. We here in Australia need to do everything within our power to ensure that security and safety are the No. 1 priorities when it comes to aviation and that we get that right before we talk about other issues. But we also need to MAIN COMMITTEE",212,Bills
173,Mr Albanese (Grayndler,"Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure andacknowledge and understand that, when it comes to security issues, we need international cooperation and we need to work in that global context with our regional neighbours. I thank those members who have made a contribution to this debate and I thank them for their support of this bill. This is important legislation. It will enhance the security of the air cargo supply chain. The Australian government has a specific role in relation to transport and supply chain security. The Office of Transport Security in the Department of Infrastructure and Transport regulates the security arrangements in the transport industry to minimise the risk of unlawful interference that could otherwise result in catastrophic consequences. The legislative framework of Australia's aviation security regime consists of a suite of measures to deter, detect and prevent acts of unlawful interference with aviation. The framework is constantly reviewed to ensure it adapts to evolving threats to the security of the Australian aviation industry. The security of air cargo is critical to ensuring Australia's compliance with the Convention on International Civil Aviation-the Chicago Conventionand also to ensuring that we meet the security requirements of key trading partners such as the United States and the European Union. Approximately 80 per cent of international air cargo is carried on passenger aircraft. Total air cargo exports for Australia in 2008 were valued at $31 billion. Air cargo is mostly lightweight high-value goods requiring urgent delivery. The Australian air cargo industry is a diverse and multimodal environment. The handling and processing of air cargo involves a complex web of multiple operators. The air cargo industry's ability to respond quickly to security threats to the transport of goods and services domestically and internationally is crucial. The government believes that security measures applied throughout the supply chain are the most effective and efficient way to manage security. I am pleased that there is bipartisan support for this sensible approach. The bill contains four key amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to simplify and strengthen the existing security regulatory framework for supply chain security. The proposed amendments increase flexibility and responsiveness to situations of heightened security threat; reduce the regulatory burden and cost to industry members during the progressive transition to the new air cargo security framework; allow for greater scrutiny, consistency and transparency of training requirements for air cargo industry members; and simplify terminology appropriate to industry practices and procedures. The amendments will provide the foundations for a whole-of-supply-chain security system which is sufficiently flexible that it can be adapted in line with new technology, parity with advancements in security arrangements applied by international counterparts and changes in the level of threat. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Customs Amendment (Export Controls and Other Measures) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. MAIN COMMITTEE Controls and other Measures) Bill 2011. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service are responsible for managing the security and integrity of Australia's borders. Customs officers work hard day and night to detect and deter unlawful movements of goods and people across the border. Customs have responsibility for protecting Australians through the interception of illicit drugs, weapons, unauthorised arrivals, and postal items, and they also target high-risk travellers. Australian Customs officers do a great job under tough circumstances, day in and day out. Unfortunately they are being stretched due to the government's mismanagement of our borders, which was particularly evident in the Labor's latest budget handed down last night. I would like to note at the outset that the coalition supports the purpose of this bill which is to amend the Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Act 1997 to strengthen the extent of Customs controls over export cargo and ensure consistent depot and warehouse licence conditions. As noted in the bill's explanatory memorandum, the bill will: (a) allow Customs to give directions relating to goods in the export environment; (b) allow Customs to seek additional information in relation to goods being exported; (c) ensure continued Customs control of goods at a prescribed place for export; (d) ensure depot operators do not breach licence conditions when complying with a direction of the Secretary of the Department of Infrastructure and Transport; (e) allow Customs to impose new conditions on depot and warehouse licences at any time; (f) address breaches of the conditions of a depot or warehouse licence; (g) strengthen the powers of officers to give directions to depot licence holders; (h) allow the Chief Executive Officer of Customs (the CEO) to suspend or cancel depot licences; (i) set out the timeframes within which the CEO must decide whether or not to grant a warehouse licence; (j) allow the CEO to vary the place covered by a warehouse licence; (k) refund the warehouse licence fee on cancellation of a warehouse licence; (l) remove references to redundant provisions, and (m) remove the requirement to make a report of cargo in certain circumstances concerning lost or wrecked ships or aircraft. While this bill makes some technical amendments which the coalition supports, the government has significantly fallen behind in the crucial area of national security, which was demonstrated in yesterday's budget which leaves Australia less secure than Labor has already made it. Among the vast array of cuts to Australia's national security agencies, it included a $9.3 million cut to the budget of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. Labor have also axed a further 90 staff from Customs, on top of the 250 cut in the 2010-11 budget. In an extraordinary move, the Labor Party have cut $6.9 million in funds to ASIO for their security checks of unauthorised arrivals at a time when they are being pressured to get through vast numbers of arrivals in an increasingly short space of time. To improve the budget's bottom line, the government have slashed $34 million from Customs in their passenger facilitation function at Australia's eight international airports. Clearly, that is going to make those airports less safe. MAIN COMMITTEE",214,Bills
174,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (11:51,"I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (ExportThese funding cuts will put immense pressure on our front-line border protection agencies that are already struggling to do more with fewer resources under this incompetent Labor government, who do not view Australia's national security as an important priority. This bill is being debated the day after it was revealed in the portfolio budget statements that the government is deceiving the Australian public on security at our ports and airports. It was revealed that the numbers of reported consignments of air and sea cargo have gone up significantly and are forecast to go up over the next four years. However, Labor has not increased the amount of air and sea cargo that is inspected or examined, which means that even less cargo will be properly checked under the new pared down regime. In the 2009-10 budget Labor cut the budget for Customs for cargo screening by a staggering $58.1 million. This cut to screening by the Rudd-Gillard government reduced the number of potential sea cargo inspections by 25 per cent. Labor's cuts also resulted in a staggering 75 per cent reduction of air cargo inspections. In the recent Customs annual report it was revealed that only 4.3 per cent of sea cargo is X-rayed and only 0.6 per cent of sea cargo is physically examined. It was also concerning to find that 95.7 per cent of all sea cargo consignments are not being X-rayed. With the latest budget predictions, these figures will be even worse, with higher volumes of sea and air cargo consignments expected to come into Australia through our ports and airports in the coming years. Customs officers have suffered at the hands of this government as they redirect scarce resources to pay for the government's border protection failures. We witnessed yesterday a staggering $1.7 billion blow-out in Labor's asylum seeker budget, which has exceeded even our worse expectations. I make the point that, very importantly, this is not money that enhances our border protection; this is money that is only being used to maintain the failure that has already occurred. It is just money to manage the people within our detention network. In just four years Labor's border protection failures have taken the costs of managing asylum seekers from less than $100 million per year under the coalition to more than $1 billion per year under Labor. That is a staggering 1,000 per cent increase. Coming into this budget, asylum seeker costs have already risen by more than $1 billion since Labor abolished the strong border protection regime they inherited from the coalition when they came into office. As we have seen, this year's budget takes these cost blow-outs to a whole new level of failure. The budget blow-out on asylum seeker costs has meant that other agencies-and, most importantly, our front-line national security agencies-have been forced to suffer. The cuts, coupled with the increased workload due to the flood of unauthorised arrivals, put extra strain on Customs officers working under border protection command. With myriad cuts to Australia's front-line border protection agencies, including Customs, it has become very clear that the Gillard Labor government are happy to let Australia's border security slip even further into the abyss of chaos that they have created, and they are not giving our front-line agencies a helping hand when they need it most. Border protection and national security remain at the forefront of the coalition's priorities. We support the progressive enhancements to security being made at Australia's ports and airports every day. As I said, the measures in this legislation are relatively technical and the coalition supports them. Quite frankly, what is happening on our borders and the cuts that the MAIN COMMITTEE national security agencies have had to endure under this budget are nothing short of a national disgrace. The coalition will be saying substantially more about these cuts in the days ahead. take the opportunity to support the Customs Amendment (Export Controls and Other Measures) Bill 2011 because, despite the rhetoric, he knows this is something that is properly balanced and duly targeted to strengthen Customs and border security of this country. I suppose that is one of the challenges in this place: to cut through some of the rhetoric occasionally. At least the coalition will vote the right way on this particular measure, but they will not waste an opportunity to try and target the budget or anything else. But it is important that they are all going to come in here, line up and support it. The reason they are going to do that is that this is the right thing to do. This bill will bolster our ability to monitor and respond to specific security concerns with high-risk cargo by strengthening our control over international export cargo. The bill forms part of this government's commitment to a strong and efficient Customs and Border Protection Service and seeks to streamline and strengthen the export and import processes. Smooth and safe international export processes are vital to Australia's trading and business environment. In my electorate of FowlerI am staggered by the amount of import-export businesses that act out of the south-west of Sydney. This clearly envisages that. I will go to some of the processes that will make their job easier by giving a greater degree of clarity in the way they go about their business. It is crucial that the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is able to respond quickly and effectively to any security concerns. Unmanaged risks in exports threatens Australia's trade and business. It is essential that our Customs and border protection authorities are able to manage high-risk cargo effectively and efficiently. This bill supports the other security improvement initiatives relating to export cargo and enables the chief executive officer of Customs to ensure compliance with the laws of Commonwealth, state and territory jurisdictions. It will also address breaches of licence conditions by introducing strict liability offences. These measures will increase accountability and compliance with the law. They will also make doing the right thing-and, let's face it, most of our businesspeople in our areas are in business to do the right thing-easier in terms of compliance and will make the path a lot easier for them by introducing a greater degree of clarity into the process. So clearer procedures and terminology is one aspect that will provide greater clarity to these licence holders. As I said-and I think this would probably go for most members in this place-import and export businesses do have a fundamental role in our modern economy, and this will give them greater clarity. It will streamline their activities and will give greater certainty. But in doing so it will assist Customs and Border Protection Service authorities to be able to manage areas which are potentially high risk in terms of our export trade. The bill aligns legislation more closely with the existing export business processes. Clearly these measures will streamline export processes and will not compromise legitimate export cargo. The changes it makes to existing legislation are proportionate and balanced. They are based on the findings of the joint Customs and Border Protection Service and Department of Infrastructure and Transport review. Many of the changes in the bill are made in response to industry stakeholders who have suggested many of the changes, particularly with respect to MAIN COMMITTEE",216,Bills
175,Mr Hayes (Fowler,"Government Whip) (11:59): Like the member for StirlingI alsothe reporting of cargo on board ships and vessels which has been lost and reports already made. But that is just an example of the issue of streamlining. Border security is an issue that is important for all of us. We are an island, albeit a very big island. But to ensure that we have proper competitiveness for our industries we need to be able to encourage proper and appropriate export practices and ensure security within this country. This bill is significantly part of that general regime and forms part of the government's commitment in this area. And, as I say, I certainly-together with members of the opposition-am only too happy to be supporting these measures. Whilst these are the matters before us, as I said, in terms of this particular space, ever since 9-11-now 10 years ago-our vigilance in these areas is not only ongoing; security in these areas changes and changes rapidly. I did hear, in the debate before last, concerning the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Air Cargo) Bill, the leader of the Nationals criticising the government for having the audacity to bring forward amendments. That particular amendment arose as a result of a terrorist event that occurred in October of last year. We as a government are not going to wait until we have a suite of possible amendments forming a nice round body of legislation to put through. As a government we are going to act appropriately. Where changes are required we will make those changes and make no apology for doing it amendment by amendment if necessary if that is what it takes to strengthen our industries and protect our industries, our people and our communities. I commend this piece of legislation to the House. (Export Controls and Other Measures) Bill 2011. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Act and the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Act to strengthen the extent of control that Customs has over our export cargo and to ensure consistent depot and warehouse licence conditions. The coalition is prepared to support this bill. However, we do note that the nature of this bill is contradictory to the government's general approach in many other measures. While this bill increases controls on our exports, at the very same time we have this government weakening controls on our imports, as we have seen with the soft approach on biosecurity where we have seen New Zealand apples being allowed into the country with the potential risk of fire blight. We have also seen the results of the government's soft approach to border protection and border security, with the financial and human disasters that this soft approach has caused and a blowout in costs of $1.7 billion-that is, $1,700 million-that could have been spent in other vitally needed sectors of the economy if it had not been spent on border security because of this government's failed policies. Therefore you would think that the government would err on the side of caution when it came to fiddling with our long-standing and successful biosecurity arrangements. However, the government are prepared to roll the dice, cross their fingers and hope for the best on biosecurity. But God help them if, by weakening our controls on our borders, we see fire blight take hold in this country. They will be held responsible for decades to come. So, while the coalition does support this bill, we say that its effects must be very carefully monitored to ensure that it does not tie down our exporters in red tape. For it is our exporters who underwrite our economic prosperity. We should be pinning medals on our exporters' chests, but instead this government's plans are to burden them with a tax on carbon dioxide MAIN COMMITTEE",218,Bills
176,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (12:06,"I rise to speak on the Customs Amendmentemissions, placing them at a competitive disadvantage. Therefore, although the coalition supports this bill, we say its effects must be monitored very carefully, especially its effects on small business. Exporting is hard enough. It is a time-critical business. And we cannot have the government burdening exporters with unnecessary red tape, which this bill has the potential to do. In conclusion, the coalition supports this bill. However, we will be monitoring its effects very closely. Amendment (Export Control and Other Measures) Bill 2011. The bill's purpose is to amend the Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Act 1997 to strengthen the extent of Customs controls over export cargo and ensure consistent depot and warehouse licence conditions. As noted in the bill's explanatory memorandum, this will allow Customs to give directions relating to goods in the export environment; allow Customs to seek additional information in relation to goods being exported; ensure continued Customs control of goods at a prescribed place for export; ensure depot operators do not breach licence conditions when complying with a direction of the Secretary of the Department of Infrastructure and Transport; allow Customs to impose new conditions on depot and warehouse licences at any time; address breaches of the conditions of a depot or warehouse licence; strengthen the powers of officers to give directions to depot licence holders; allow the chief executive officer of Customs-the CEO-to suspend or cancel depot licences; set out the time frames within which the CEO must decide whether or not to grant a warehouse licence; allow the CEO to vary the place covered by a warehouse licence; refund the warehouse licence fee on cancellation of a warehouse licence; remove references to redundant provisions; and, finally, remove the requirement to make a report of cargo. This bill makes some very sensible recommendations which the coalition support. They are obviously technical in nature and fairly straightforward and, as the two previous speakers on this side have quite clearly articulated, they will be supported on this side. While we are dealing with this bill, I think it is timely to remind the House that, although there has on the whole been support for the great role that our Customs officials undertake, it is a real shame that the government mismanagement and ability to spend on things which are not in the national interest have meant that in yesterday's federal budget we have seen a $9.3 million cut to the budget of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Command. Given the increased demand on our Customs officers and officials, we do not need at this time to see the government taking an axe to people who are on the front line and doing important work for Australia as a whole. It is sad that such mismanagement has led to this, because in many ways it would be fantastic if we had a Treasurer who had managed the budget in a much better fashion that meant that those out there on the front line did not have to suffer the consequences. It is potentially front-line officers who are doing very good work to make sure that all our goods are transported in a timely and safe manner and that our borders are protected safely. I will conclude my remarks there by saying that these non-controversial amendments are supported by the coalition. However, I also highlight that, due to the mismanagement of the Gillard-Swan government, we have seen $9.3 million cut out of the Customs and Border Protection budget, which means that on the front line Australia will suffer.

This bill will improve Customs and Border Protection's ability to deal with goods in licensed depots and warehouses as well as align the procedures and terminology that apply to the two schemes. This includes new provisions for the suspension and cancellation of depot licences. The amendments will also enable the chief executive officer of Customs to apply conditions to depot and warehouse licences to ensure compliance with other Commonwealth laws such as the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and associated regulations. The bill will ensure that a depot licence holder who is also a regulated air cargo agent will not be in breach of their depot licence conditions where the operator is required to comply with a direction from the secretary of Infrastructure and Transport. The bill also responds to recommendations made in the Australian National Audit Office report entitled Customs' cargo management re-engineering project by aligning the legislation more closely with the operations of the integrated cargo system for clearance of export goods. Finally, the bill removes the requirement for reporting cargo onboard lost or wrecked ships or aircraft, where a report has already been made, and it will remove some redundant provisions. This bill responds to some of the problems that have beset Customs over a long period of time. This is an improvement to the way in which we store goods, and indeed it provides better oversight by Customs of such goods-which is important at any time and which I believe is increasingly important, given the potential for threats to this nation at our ports. So it is a good bill, and that is why I said at the outset that the opposition support the bill, notwithstanding some of the comments that have been made. I understand they are comments on the budget. People want to make comments that are extraneous to the bill. They want to talk about matters that do not go to the matter before them. The reality is that the Customs and Border Protection Service do a remarkable job. As an agency they did a remarkable job under the Howard government and they are doing a remarkable job under this government, working with us in very difficult circumstances. We have an exponential growth in freight and passenger movements in our seaports and airports. We have a series of challenges that Customs have to deal with each and every day, and they do a great job. The fact that we have moved to much better risk-based assessments to examine cargo freight is a good thing, and we should deploy our resources where they are most needed, where potential challenges will arise. That has been happening over the last few years, under this government, with the full cooperation of the agency, and I appreciate the efforts of Customs and, in particular, its chief executive officer, Michael Carmody, for his leadership in this regard. I commend this bill to the House. It is an important change to the regulation of depot licensing conditions. Again, notwithstanding some of the rhetorical flourishes from the member for Stirling, in the end the opposition know it is a good bill and that is why they support it. Question agreed to.

MAIN COMMITTEE Gambling Reform Committee Report Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the report. Committee on Gambling Reform handed down recently that goes to and is entitled The design and implementation of a mandatory pre-commitment system for electronic gambling machines across Australia. It is no secret that I have very real and genuine concerns about the ineffectiveness of this report in addressing what, it was suggested, was the core focus of the committee-that is, to assist problem gamblers. Broader than that, I am concerned that the recommendations put forward by the majority of the committee, which did not include coalition members, will harm the industry significantly. We end up in a situation where, as a consequence of the committee's recommendations, Labor Party policy and the grubby deal that was done between Julia Gillard and the Independent member for Denison to form government, we are now faced with the situation where the likely policy outcome will be the implementation of laws that will see nothing happening with respect to assisting problem gamblers but will have a truly detrimental effect on the pubs and clubs sector across Australia. Why is this so, and how can I be certain: because of the valid concerns raised by members of the public and others with respect to the findings of the report. In summary, it is relatively straightforward. We know as a matter of history that the Labor Party is only motivated to do something in this space as a consequence of the Prime Minister's deal with the Independent member for Denison. We know as a matter of history that poker machine reform was not a burning ambition of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer or cabinet. It was not something that was on the radar for this government until such time as it was demanded by the Independent member for Denison that there be reform in this space, namely, through the implementation of a mandatory precommitment system, that Labor suddenly said, 'Yes, we believe in it too.' In fact the most concerning aspect of this is that it is now Labor Party policy to implement mandatory precommitment, which is what is driving this agenda. The reality is that if it were not Labor Party policy, if it were only the Independent member for Denison that wanted mandatory precommitment, then this would not happen. The reason why it will happen is that Labor has signed up to this holus-bolus. It is now Labor Party policy to have mandatory precommitment. What concerned me was that for those of us who were appointed to the joint select committee, it was not a case of being charged with exploring mandatory precommitment; it was not a case of having an inquiry into whether mandatory precommitment would work; rather the answer was already given: there would be mandatory precommitment and the committee's task was simply to look at the way in which that should happen. We already knew before we started that the Labor Party and the Independent member for Denison, as well as of course Senator Xenophon, were all committed to making mandatory precommitment happen.

I have heard Labor member after Labor member, the Independent member for Denison and others engage in rhetoric about how policy changes need to be effected to do something for problem gamblers. As if anyone who is critical of the recommendations or the findings of the committee was in some way not motivated to assist problem gamblers. We saw it just recently in the previous exchange between the member for Kingston and me where there is this disgraceful moral superiority that comes from those who back the recommendations of this report implying that in some way I and other members of the coalition who knock back and reject the recommendations are not concerned about problem gambling. It is disgraceful that members opposite would moralise on this issue, would claim a monopoly on assisting problem gamblers, when in reality they do not know the first thing about the impact of these recommendations on problem gamblers. That is the great disgrace, because the single most hard-done-by group as a result of these recommendations will in fact be problem gamblers. I will go into great detail to explain why because I understand this topic implicitly as well as on the basis of the evidence that has been supplied. I think it is time that Labor members, the member for Denison and Senator Xenophon, were held to account to back up their rhetoric when it comes to this report, because I know they will fail. The reason they will fail is that there are several fundamental flaws with this particular report and the recommendations of the majority of the report which cannot be overcome because they are illogical. The fundamental thrust from the member for Denison, from Labor members and indeed from the Independent senator, Senator Xenophon, was that mandatory precommitment would assist Australia's problem gamblers because of the fact that they would be required to precommit to a certain level of losses. On first principles, that sounds rational. On first principles, you would have to ask: who could disagree with that? If someone has a gambling problem, wouldn't logic suggest the very best thing you could do is make them commit to a certain level of losses and then be shut out of the system? It just seems like common sense. But what is clear from the evidence is that problem gamblers have a pathological problem. By definition, that is why they are called problem gamblers. By definition, someone who is a problem gambler-someone who is potentially losing their home, someone who is potentially losing their job, someone who is potentially engaging in criminal activity, someone who is potentially hurting the loved ones around them as a result of their gambling addiction-is not logical, is not rational. That is the very reason why, when you say to a problem gambler who is already potentially losing their home, losing their loved ones and putting their life on the line and who is potentially suicidal as a direct consequence of their gambling habit, 'Look, you are responsible for setting your own gambling limit. We think you'll be able to handle that,' it is doomed to fail from the outset. Problem gamblers-and we know this from international examples-will set a limit that is exceptionally high, well above what they can afford. As a consequence, this piece of technology which the Labor Party and the member for Denison like to hold out as the silver bullet solution will in fact fail miserably. Someone with a pathological gambling addiction will not sit there and think to themselves, 'You know, I can MAIN COMMITTEE only afford to lose $50 this week, so I'm going to set my limit at $50.' No, they are bound in a spiral of irrationality that will see them set a limit of $1,000 or $10,000. Who knows what the limit will be? But I guarantee you one thing, Madam Deputy Speaker: it will not be a rational limit, because this is a person who is battling an addiction, who is already losing their home and their family, who is having an impact on loved ones and who is potentially suicidal. Yet apparently they are meant to have this moment of clarity where they will say, 'I can only afford $50 this week. That will be my limit.' The reality is that problem gamblers have a pathological problem and they need medical intervention. They need support and assistance to make them realise that they cannot handle gambling and that they should not be gambling, full stop. That is what is required, because the only people who will stand by a rational limit are rational people who do not have a gambling addiction. We know from the psychological evidence that was given to the committee that problem gamblers chase their losses. They are of the view that if only they were given one more shot, if only they had one more big wager, they would be able to win back that which they have already lost. That is the psychology and that is exactly what drives them to set unrealistic loss limits on their cards. That is why this technology simply will not work. The people who will set rational loss limits on their cards are recreational gamblers-the 4.8 million gamblers out of the five million poker machine players. They will set reasonable limits. I welcome the member for Denison, who has just come into the Committee. These are the people who will set rational loss limits on their cards. These are the people who will recognise that it is having an impact on their lives. In addition to that, from the outset I have made it clear that without the integrity of a national database this system is doomed to fail. I was met with cries of protest from the member for Denison and from Labor members, who said I was scaremongering. They said I was scaremongering to suggest that there had to be biometric identifiers and that there needed to be a national database. This is where it all just conveniently slips through the net in the majority report of this committee, because they like to conveniently disregard the need for a national database. I have heard the member for Denison say this on numerous occasions: 'People don't have to worry because the information will be kept on the card.' Without a national database, there is nothing at all to prevent a problem gambler from going into-I will use a local example from my electorate-the Southport Surf Lifesaving Club, getting a card from the club after supplying their 100 points of ID, or whatever the regime may be for identity verification, setting their limit at $500 or whatever, expending that limit and then thinking: 'I've got to chase that loss. I'm going to go to the club down the road.' So they jump in their car and drive down to the Broadbeach Bowls Club. They go in there and say: 'I'd like to sign up for a card here. I want to play the pokies.' Without a national database there is no way that that bowls club can know what the surf lifesaving club has on their system. Without one, that person could have a card from every pub and club that they wanted. There must be a way to verify that this person is not using multiple cards in multiple venues. The only way to do that is to have a national database. Even the preferred, short-term political fix solution that the member for Denison and Labor members have proposed, which is that it be state based jurisdiction, does not overcome the problem that in tourism towns like the Gold Coast, for example, where we have a border right through the guts of it, people can swap across from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. There must be a national database. It is an absolute requirement for this to work. Otherwise, the person can have all of their particulars on their smart card from MAIN COMMITTEE the Southport Surf Life Saving Club-the assurance that the member for Denison and Labor members like to claim-but that does not mean anything if they get another card from another venue when they provide their ID and the venues do not know about each other. I have never heard members opposite address that, and I would dearly love to hear members opposite address that very issue. I invite members opposite to please tell me how you can get system integrity without having a central database. They know what I know, which is that you cannot. In addition to that, let us talk about the recreational gamblers. Let us talk about the 4.8 million Australians who play the poker machines once a month or once every three or four months. This is the person who goes to the Southport Surf Life Saving Club, provides their 100 points of ID, gets their card, plays their 50 bucks on the poker machines, walks away and does not think about it for three months. Three months later when they turn up to some other club or even the same club and say, 'I would like to play the pokies,' the club will say, 'Where is your card from three months ago? You are on the system as having a card already. We need to see your card.' If the person says, 'I'm sorry. I haven't played the pokies for three months. Can you issue me with another one?' isn't that situation going to present some challenges? Do they just issue you with another card? You would assume not because how would you know that the problem gambler who just had a massive loss the day before is not also turning up and saying, 'I'm sorry. I lost my card. CanI get another one?' Therefore, you would have to assume that there are some systems in place for the person who only had a punt three months ago, has not thought about it again since, does not have a card on them and wants another one. Again, I would love to hear from members opposite their solution to this, because I have never heard it. The devil is in the detail when it comes to this, and they have been scant on detail every step of the way. The single most offensive aspect of this-and it is offensive-that I have heard from members opposite with respect to the 70,000 people whose livelihoods rely on this industry and the 4.8 million recreational punters who do not have a gambling problem is the explanation that the reason the pubs and clubs are concerned is because there is going to be a massive deterioration in problem gambling revenue. The member for Denison and Labor members say that if you cannot survive as a club with deterioration in problem-gambling revenue then you have a failed business model. I have heard this time and time again. Indeed, the report itself deals with it. That is disingenuous, because their concerns are not about the revenue from problem gamblers. Their concerns revolve around the fact that the people who are going to be put off playing the poker machines are the 4.8 million recreational gamblers who do not have a problem. That is where the loss of revenue is going to come from-people who are not going to provide 100 points of ID in order to get a card, people who are not going to put up with a great big new federal bureaucracy in order to have a $30 or $40 punt on the poker machines. Time does not allow me to get into the issue of low-intensity machines. But low-intensity machines were not a central part of the committee's focus. They were a quick political fix that came in during the last several weeks. They deserve to be a core part of the focus of the inquiry of the committee. For reasons I will go into in another forum, they are also not the solution. MAIN COMMITTEE that was tabled in parliament this week by the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform, entitled The design and implementation of a mandatory pre-commitment system for electronic gambling machines. The reason that this committee has conducted the inquiry is that we have a problem. We have a problem with pokies addiction, and it is real. It is a public health issue, it is a family issue, it is a workplace issue and it is an economic issue. It will not go away as a result of the hysterical speeches of those who sit in the chamber opposite me. It will go away because members in this place have the courage to do something about it. The reason we have an obligation to do something about it is that governments license the existence of gaming machines. We derive revenue from them. Therefore, we have an obligation to ensure that they are operating safely and in line with community values. I can tell the members opposite and everybody else that the community simply does not accept the proposition that any business, organisation or government should profit from the misery of others. Our objective in bringing these reforms forward is to ensure that we are able to properly regulate this form of gambling which is proven to have an addictive and damaging effect on so many Australians. Throughout the 1990s there was a liberalisation of poker machines throughout Australia. It led to what the Productivity Commission has recently described as the maturation of the industry. In common speak, that has led to a growth in the number of machines in clubs, pubs and many other venues around the country. So we have the situation today where there are close to 200,000 electronic gaming machines in this country, and nearly half of them are in my state of New South Wales. As I have already mentioned, we have an obligation to do something about this because governments derive a source of revenue from gaming and poker machine revenue. States derive about $5 billion per annum from gambling-about 10 per cent of state revenue-and a significant proportion of that comes from electronic gaming machines. The total gaming revenue in the economy as a whole was $19 billion in 2008-09, which is about $1,500 per adult. As members opposite have indicated, Australians do not mind having a punt. I do not mind having a punt myself. I am amongst the estimated 600,000 people who play poker machines. Unfortunately, about 115,000 people have a problem with gambling. While these 115,000 people make up only about 15 per cent of the total gambling population, they contribute somewhere between 26 per cent or 40 per cent of gaming revenue. So we have a problem, particularly when you consider that hotels derive about one-third of their revenue, clubs about 60 per cent of their revenue and casinos about 78 per cent of their revenue from these machines. We have a problem and we have to deal with it. We can stick our heads in the sand, like the member for Moncrieff, opposite, begs us to do and say that what we are doing at the moment is good enough. But we on this side of the House do not believe that that is fulfilling our obligation to the communities that we represent. We have put in place a proposition which says nothing more than this: we do not give up on problem gamblers and we do not think that people who play poker machines, as the member opposite seems to suggest, are somehow mad and bad most of their lives. We understand and the evidence before the committee was quite simply that, yes, when problem MAIN COMMITTEE",223,Committees

But even these people have moments of lucidity and moments of reason when they go home and they have to explain to their wife, their husband or their kids, or when they have to go to work the next day and explain why they are asking for an advance in their pay, or when they have to go and cash in their television or their video recorder. They have moments of reason and they understand that the behaviour they engaged in last night, last week or for the last 10 days when they were on a binge-'chasing the losses', as the member opposite has pointed out-was wrong. The tools that we are proposing to put in place will give them some control over that gambling addiction. Mr Ciobo: But they are not rational. Ms Rishworth: They're not irrational all the time. have a problem all the time; they have a problem when they are in a gaming situation. They have moments of reason, moments of lucidity. Mr Ciobo interjectingIt might have been evidence that was delivered on some of the many days when the member opposite who is interjecting so much was not there, but it was very clear that the expert evidence before the committeeMr Ciobo: I rise on a point of order. I have a reasonably wide tolerance for being verballed, but statements of factual inaccuracy like that one should be withdrawn. I find them offensive. point. we believe the precommitment technology that has been the subject of this inquiry has a very good chance of solving or helping to resolve problem gambling is that it will prevent people who have been identified by experts as at-risk gamblers converting to problem gamblers. They will avoid doing that by using the precommitment technology to effectively set themselves a budget to punt, a budget to gamble, so that they know on a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis how much of their family income they are going to be able to put through a poker machine-how much they can afford to lose. So we have very good reasons to believe-we are not as cynical as those members opposite-that the technologies and the systems that we are proposing to put in place will work. We believe they will work because they will stop the conversion of at-risk gamblers to problem gamblers and they will give problem gamblers who have already crossed the Rubicon some tools, in those moments of lucidity and reason, to take control of their gambling addiction. Of course in and of itself it is not the complete solution. It has to be part and parcel of a package of solutions. The recommendations put forward by the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform go to a combination of solutions. Some objections have also been raised throughout the course of the inquiry about the egregious costs that this is going to visit upon the industry.

With that comment made, we do make the concession and we do understand that there is going to be a need, particularly for small clubs, for us to have a phased introduction of these technologies and we have recommended exactly that. I will make the point that the member for Moncrieff was alluding to and then going to quite pointedly in his contribution to the debate. I enjoyed his cross-examination of witnesses throughout the inquiry on this particular point. It goes to the issue of privacy and intrusion, that somehow the introduction of this technology is going to be the visitation upon every Australian citizen of some mammoth Big Brother database which is going to intrude upon every aspect of their private, social and working lives. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have ruled out quite early the use of biometric technology, despite the fact that many pubs are already introducing biometric technology as a condition of visiting their premises here and now. Many pubs in the state of New South Wales and elsewhere, I am reliably advised, are already introducing, beyond the pale of regulation, biometric technology-fingerprint scanners, retina scanners-as a condition of entering their premises. I believe, and I am sure that many right-minded citizens-and I suspect the member for Moncrieff-would agree with me, that this sort of activity should probably not be occurring outside the realm of regulation; but perhaps that is a matter for another day. The second point that I would make on the issue of privacy and intrusion is that it is a condition of the establishment of a club that they set up and keep a membership register and ensure that anybody who enters the premises of a club, at least in New South Wales or Queensland and I suspect everywhere else, has proof of identity which satisfies the requirements of the legislation and is able by one means or another to satisfy the occupiers of the premises-the licensees, the club owners and managers-that when they enter those premises and intend to use the facilities, including the electronic gaming machine facilities on those premises, they can show that identity. That is to say, the database already exists. Not only does it exist but it collects information about the gaming habits of individual club members and visitors and the clubs already use that data to market to those patrons they know who are frequenters of electronic gaming machines. They do such things-and I make no value judgment about this whatsoever-as send free tickets for meals and a courtesy cab around to a regular punter's home and say, 'Come on down, we've got a special deal for you today; we will put on a meal and free drinks and we've got a special pokies promotion going on.' I make no value judgment about that whatsoever. Clubs are entitled to market, but they are already using this data and we believe that the introduction of the mandatory precommitment technology is no greater intrusion on a club member or a club patron's privacy than already exists. In fact, through this mechanism we might serve to tidy up some of the practices that many within the community think are not meeting community standards and expectations. We are far more optimistic than those opposite. If their real issue is problem gambling and they think that we should do something about it and if their real objection is this just ain't the problem, we are a bit more optimistic. This ain't the solution. We are a bit more optimistic than that. One of the recommendations of the committee, as the member for Moncrieff knows, MAIN COMMITTEE is that there shall be a trial. I am quite confident that, as a result of the rollout of this technology and the trial that we intend to put in place, any of the teething problems that the member for Moncrieff is so passionately concerned about will be able to be dealt with. I am sure the member for Moncrieff and those he represents will get plenty more opportunitiesMr Ciobo interjectingprivacy. But I end my contribution where I began. Gambling addiction is real, it is a public health issue, it is a family issue, it is a family issue, it is a workplace issue and it is an economic issue and we cannot sit idly by and just identify all of the problems-for those of us who have the gumption and the courage to try to do something about it-without proffering some of the solutions that will make a real difference. Debate adjourned. Rose, Mr Lionel Edward, MBE Debate resumed on the motion: That the House express its deep regret at the death of Mr Lionel Rose MBE, place on record its appreciation for his outstanding service to world sport and to the Australian community and tender its profound sympathy to his family and friends in their loss. also spoken to by the Leader of the Opposition, about the death of the Australian boxing legend Lionel Rose. The reason I rise to speak about Lionel Rose is that I had the good fortune of meeting Lionel on quite a few occasions and entertaining him at my house on quite a few occasions. This was in 1980, after Lionel had finished his boxing career but when he was still well known and respected within the Australian sporting community. We all know that Lionel suffered some hard times during his life, but he always managed to use that spirit of his, the fighting spirit that Lionel had, to continue to get on with his life. I would like to put on record some information that I have researched about Lionel on the biography websites. Lionel Rose's career embodied the stuff legends are made of. In a boxing career begun in a makeshift ring in a poverty-stricken Aboriginal settlement, Rose developed a crushing punch that helped him become the first Australian Aborigine to win a world championship title and the second Australian to take home a world title in boxing. His win catapulted him to fame in Australia. His lifetime career of 53 fights with only 11 losses made him a legend in the world of boxing. Lionel Rose was born on 21 June 1948 and raised in Jacksons Track, a poor Aboriginal settlement 50 miles south of Melbourne. The eldest of nine children in an Aboriginal family, Rose was on the wrong side of a society divided by racism, mistrust and economic disparity. As a child Rose escaped racism through boxing. Rose's father, an amateur boxer, inspired Rose to don his first pair of boxing gloves at the age of 14. The pair trained in a ring made of chicken wire. Rose and his siblings also became avid fans of tent matches, which were popular boxing bouts that travelled the country, much the way a circus might. However, it was at a ring match in Melbourne that Rose found his inspiration in another Aboriginal boxer. MAIN COMMITTEE",228,Committees

191,Mr Irons (Swan) (12:55,"I rise to support the motion of the Prime Minister that wasI'd seen plenty of tent fights when I was younger, but the great George Bracken was the first boxer I saw in the ringRose told the website Vibe Australia. His great fighting style and speed really made me take an even bigger interest in boxing than before. Rose began his amateur boxing career under the guidance of trainer Frank Oakes. He later married Oakes' daughter Jenny. Rose won his first big fight in 1963, the day after the death of his father. By the end of that year Rose had won Australia's national amateur flyweight title. Flyweight is one of the lowest weight classifications in boxing, with an upper limit of 112 pounds. In 1964, Rose narrowly missed being selected for the Australian Olympic team. By that time Rose knew he wanted to make a career of boxing and decided to go professional. In 1964, Rose began his professional training at Jack Rennie's Melbourne gym. Rennie, a legendary figure in Australian boxing, worked Rose hard often pairing him with Mick Croucher, a more experienced boxer 20 pounds heavier than Rose. Croucher recalled to the World Boxing Foundation website: Champions are born not made and [Rose] had enormous natural ability. Some people work hard in training and are very dedicated but to be a champion in any sport a person must be born with a natural gift and Lionel was fortunate enough to have that. Under Rennie, Rose moved to the bantamweight division, with a weight limit of 118 pounds. He also developed what the Age described as an 'easy style married to a tooth-shaking straight left to the clenched jaws of all who came against him'. In September 1964, Rose won his first professional bout in eight rounds. He won his next four fights in a row. In all of 1965, Rose lost only one fight. Between January and October 1966, Rose won six of seven matches, qualifying to compete for Australia's bantamweight title. On October 28, 1966, Rose beat the reigning champion, Noel Kunde, in a 15-round decision to win the title. Rose went on to win his next nine matches, including a 13-round challenge to his title in December 1967. That fight made Rose famous in Australia, as his challenger Rocky Gatellari was expected to win. Yet that fame was nothing compared to what was about to come. By 1968 Rose had a fight record of 29 wins and two losses. He was the two-time Australian bantamweight champion and had developed quite a following in the boxing world. Boxing promoters at the international level took notice and offered Rose a chance to fight then bantamweight world champion Masahiko 'Fighting' Harada at a title match in Tokyo. The Japanese fighter was already a legend in the ring, having successfully defended his world title five times. Rose was eager to take him on. His trainer Rennie was not so sure. According to the World Boxing Foundation website Rennie thought Rose, then barely 19 years old, 'wasn't yet ready for a World Title shot'. Nonetheless, Rose accepted the challenge. Rose arrived in Tokyo six weeks prior to the fight to train extensively and assimilate to the Japanese culture. Despite his preparations, no-one considered him a threat to Harada's title. Boxing scholar Jim Amato noted on the Inside Boxing website: When this Australian entered the ring to face Harada he was a prohibitive underdog. Very few gave him a legitimate chance. Rose ignored the naysayers and entered the ring with confidence. The website actually says: 'An estimated 30 million Australians'-but I am sure it would have been more like three million-'tuning in by radio and television, entered with optimism.' The website further states: MAIN COMMITTEE Rose started the fight by holding back, a stance which caught Harada off-guard. I expected Rose to come in and attack first but he didn't. SoI started to take the initiative myself. That is where I made a mistake,"" Harada told The Age. After the third round, despite injuring his hand, Rose told Rennie, ""Don't worry about me; this bloke can't punch,"" noted The Age. That seemed true throughout much of the fight as Harada unleashed a volley of punches that Rose either ducked or absorbed without much notice. Meanwhile, Rose landed several stunning blows to the champ. ""By the end of the flight the desperate champion was chasing Rose round the ring,"" wrote The Age. After 15 rounds, Rose became the new World Bantamweight Title. The disappointed Japanese crowd was stunned, but gave Rose a respectful ovation as he struggled to hold aloft the massive title trophy. Rennie proudly told The Age, '[Rose] was a boy doing a man's work, and he did it well. He was in a strange country, among a strange crowd, and he did not let this worry him.' When Rose returned to Melbourne, he was met by an estimated quarter of a million people lining the streets to welcome him home. 'It was simply unbelievable,' Rose told Vibe Australia. 'To fulfil my ultimate dream and then be met by so many people was amazing. My picture was all over the newspapers and it made me realise how much it meant to everyone.' Later that year he was named Australian of the Year, the first Aborigine to receive such an honour. Rose had not only become an Australian hero; he had also become an Aboriginal icon. 'To see the way that my people looked at me and to know that I made a difference to them was an honour,' he told Vibe Australia. Rose refused to get involved in political issues, instead helping Aborigines, often children, at a grassroots level. One example occurred in 1999 when Rose gave his championship belt to an Aboriginal child who had been set on fire in a racially motivated attack. In the late sixties and early seventies, Rose continued to fight successfully He defended his title three times: in July 1968; once again in Tokyo; in December 1968, in Inglewood, California; and in March 1969, in front of record crowds in Melbourne. The Inglewood match was memorable for two reasons. The challenger was a Mexican boxer, Chucho Castillo, and the fans were evenly split, with Americans rooting for Rose and Latin Americans pulling for Castillo. When Rose won in a decision after the 15th round, the crowd erupted into a riot. Over a dozen people, including a boxing official, were hospitalised. Despite the sensation the riot made in the press, the most impressive moment for Rose during his California visit was meeting Elvis Presley: I was punching a heavy bag in a gym in L.A., and I hear a voice sing out, ""Hey, Lionel! What's doin'?"" ""And it was Elvis himself,"" Rose recalled to The Age. ""I was in awe of him, but he said he was in awe of me."" Music had been a part of Rose's life for even longer than boxing. He had learned to play guitar as a child and was never without one. ""You're never lonesome with your guitar,"" Rose told The Age. In 1969 Rose appeared on a televised variety show, singing along to his guitar. Australian producer and songwriter Johnny Young caught Rose's act and offered to pen a song for the boxer. The result was ""Thank You,"" Rose's first single. The song reached the No. 1 spot in Australia's country charts. The following year Rose, again, made the charts with a cover of the country classic Pick Me Up On Your Way Down. Rose began touring as a musician when not boxing and, in 1970, recorded two albums for the Festival label. One of those, Jackson's Track, is considered a lost classic in Australian country music circles. Back in the boxing ring, Rose had a couple more successful fights before he fought Mexican boxer Ruben Olivares in August of 1969. Olivares, who went on to become a boxing legend, knocked Rose MAIN COMMITTEE out in the fifth round, taking the world championship title. Rose fought seven more bouts over the next year and a half, winning five. However, he had begun to have trouble keeping his weight down to bantam levels. 'I used to spit a real lot in order to lose an ounce,' he recalled to the Age. By 1971 Rose was up to the lightweight category that had a weight limit of 135 pounds. In that division he fought unsuccessfully in a bid for the Australian lightweight title. By the end of 1971 he had gone down to the superfeatherweight level that had a weight limit of 130 pounds. In that category he made an unsuccessful bid for the world title in Japan. After that loss, Rose decided to hang up his gloves. He did not fight again for four years. Rose interrupted his retirement and returned to the ring in 1975. However, after losing four of six bouts, he retired from the sport for good in 1976. Over the next few decades, Rose worked odd jobs, including running a cafe and performing as a musician. He soon fell on hard times due to alcoholism. At his lowest point, he was arrested for his role in a robbery attempt. Despite these setbacks, Rose remained a hero for both Aboriginal and white Australians. In 1991, a biography of Rose, called Rose Against the Odds, was published. In 1995 a full-length movie of the same name was released. Ten years later, Rose was honoured with an Australian stamp bearing a replica of his boxing gloves. That same year he was honoured with a Deadly Award for lifetime achievement in sports, one of Australia's most prestigious Aboriginal awards. I would like to get on the record a couple of quotes by his peers. As the member for Bennelong will know, we all get a lot of plaudits when we are successful in sport but some of the most meaningful are the ones you get from your peers who played a sport with you. You understand those people. Jeff Fenech, who clawed his way out of working-class Marrickville in Sydney's inner west to win three world titles, told the Australian: Lionel was simply brilliant, arguably the most gifted fighter this country ever produced. Barry Michael, another famous Australian boxer, recalled: Lionel would often jab with triple left hooks and thrown at incredible hand speed. Australian boxing historian Paul Upham said: Rose's win against Rocky Gattellari, himself a former WBC flyweight world title contender, at the old Sydney Stadium, remains one of the best pound-per-pound bouts in the annals of the sport in this country. Lionel was to win with a knockout in the 13th round with a straight right hand and it was the very first boxing match televised interstate by the Seven Network. I applaud the career and the life of Lionel Rose. It was a pleasure to have met him and entertain him in my home during a time when he was going through a tough period. He was a champion bloke and an Australian legend. Sitting suspended from 13:08 to 16:00 Ms O'NEILL (Robertson) (16:00): I rise to put on the record my condolences on the passing of Lionel Rose, the famous Australian boxer. The condolence motion was discussed a little earlier this morning. Sadly, Mr Deputy Speaker Murphy, you were not here to hear the words of the member for Swan, who gave a quite detailed history and a very personal testimony to the life of Lionel Rose and what he contributed to Australian society. I also acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the member for Hasluck as the first Indigenous member in the House of Representatives. He shares with Lionel Rose that he was a first in Australian MAIN COMMITTEE history, as Lionel was the first Australian of the Year and I think the first Australian champion in his teens as well. So there are a number of firsts happening here. Lionel Rose was born in the late 1940s and grew up in Victoria in an Aboriginal settlement called Jackson's Track. The history is that his dad was a boxer, and the talent obviously ran in the family. Lionel Rose's talent was identified when he was quite young. Clearly Lionel saw an opportunity to use his talents to advance his life. By the age of 14 he was well engaged in boxing. By the age of 19, after a very short period of time-a space of just five years-he became the bantamweight champion of the world against Fighting Harada in Japan. I also recall, from when I was a young girl, not just the energy around that fight with Fighting Harada but also the fight with Rocky Gattellari. As much as I might not be the person in this parliament who is most associated with boxing, in the absence of there being an eldest son in my family I sufficed, as the eldest daughter, as my father's companion in watching the boxing on the television on many, many evenings. It was a great passion of his to follow the boxing, so I was given the commentary of his view of many fights over many years. I recall very fondly the time. I spent with my dad and the pride we felt watching Lionel Rose and his progress to the world championship, as well as the things that happened in the time that followed. We listened on the radio, as well, to the reports of that boxing match. I can still recall the energy all these years later, even though I was only a child at the time. I can still recall how it captured a part of the imagination of Australians that an Aboriginal person was representing us, and we were very proud to be associated with Lionel's great success. One of the images I also recall is the victory parade that greeted Lionel on his return. For me there is an image of him in a sports car and of a ticker tape parade. How appropriate that such great recognition by a quarter of a million people was given to such a fighting hero of our nation. The Prime Minister yesterday recorded Lionel Rose's success, a career of 42 wins from 53 bouts-no mean achievement-and, in fact, 12 knockouts amongst those successes. His refusal to fight in South Africa was also noted by the Prime Minister. We understand the courage and conviction of the man who lay beneath the fighter in that action. As much as I enjoyed watching the boxing with my father, I think a more enduring love in my life has been a love of music. I can absolutely recall as a young girl hearing Lionel Rose's voice singing I Thank You for Just Being You. What good words they are to have as we remember him today. He was the first Aboriginal person that I knew, through the television. In my world there were no people in my class who identified as Aboriginal. There were no people in my community that I was familiar with who were Aboriginal. Lionel Rose was the first Aboriginal person that I met through the media. I recall a man with a great smile, a man of humility, a man who was a world champion and a man who was seen as a hero. He is an inspiration and that is why I am pleased to be speaking here to this condolence motion. He is an inspiration to all young Australians, an ideal that teens might achieve great things, that they might become the very best in the world in their teen years and that success at that level is not only for the old but for those who have talent at any age. He is an inspiration to the first peoples of this nation: to follow your dreams, to believe in yourself and to achieve recognition not just in our own country as an Australian of the Year-the first Aboriginal Australian of the Year-but internationally, for the talents that lie within when they are unleashed are a great thing. MAIN COMMITTEE Also, for all Australians generally, he was a complex man. He lived a rich life-a tapestry of great times and also great sorrows, as we heard from the member for Swan. But he was a man of particular talents in the fields of sport and music. One of his own songs was titled I Thank You for Just Being You, but I am sure that there are many Australians today who would say, 'I thank you, Lionel Rose, for just being you and the great joy you brought to our lives.' Lionel Rose, an Aboriginal champion boxer, who served as an inspiration to many Australians but, particularly to Aboriginal people, he was a hero. Lionel Edward Rose was born on 21 June 1948 at Jackson's Track near Jindivick, Victoria, Australia and passed away at Warragul, Victoria, Australia, on 8 May, aged 62. In 2007 he had a stroke that left him partially paralysed. He had an impressive boxing record of 42 wins, with 12 wins by knockouts and 11 losses, out of a total of 53 fights. Lionel Rose was heralded as one of this country's greatest sporting heroes yet he was humble and down to earth. He will be missed by his family, but equally by the many he touched. I want to use the words of Alan Duff from his book Maori Heroes: Every family, group, tribe, race and nation needs heroes. Heroes give us someone to look up to. Heroes inspire us and provide a model and standard for people to aspire to. They represent what is best in us, the qualities of courage, determination, perseverance and humility and, yes, talent and intelligence. The first qualities listed are a necessity but the latter two are not. The most ordinary person is capable of being a hero. Lionel Rose was our hero. David Horton's entry in the Encyclopedia of Aboriginal Australia, published by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, appears on pages 954 to 955: Lionel Rose, Australian boxer. Lionel Rose was born in the early 1940s. He was one of Australia's most successful boxers. Lionel grew up in an Aboriginal settlement called Jackson's Track in Victoria. When Lionel was growing up he studied his father, who was also a boxer. Lionel saw boxing as an escape from the poor living in the country. He ended up winning his first Australian amateur flyweight title when he was just 15. One of Lionel's greatest achievements was winning a world title. Although he was not the first Aboriginal to win a world title he was the first boxer to do so. Rose won the bantamweight title in 1968 against Harada from Japan. He was also only the second Australian to win a world title while still in his teens. After Lionel missed out on the Tokyo Olympics in 1964, Rose turned professional. He was trained by a Melbourne trainer named Jack Rennie. Rose entered in a fight against Rocky Gattellari at Sydney stadium. Everybody was behind Rocky Gattellari but when Lionel Rose knocked him out in round 13 the fans had a new hero. When Lionel went to Japan to fight Harada, Harada already had five successful title defences to his credit. Harada was given advice that if he hit an Aboriginal in the legs he would fall immediately. He ignored the advice and hit him in the head, but this had no effect. In the ninth round Harada dropped to his knees from a short left punch to his chin. He then opened himself to more and more punishment and Lionel went on to win that fight. Lionel Rose became a symbolic figure in the interracial politics of the times. He won his world title just a few months after the referendum which gave the Australian government new powers to advance Aboriginal rights. Lionel was 16 when he made his professional boxing debut, and at 18 he won the Australian bantamweight title. At 19, we know that he went on to win the fight against Fighting Harada. He gained a considerable amount of weight and moved up several classes to the lightweight, but he was unable to emulate his success as a bantamweight and retired in 1976.

192,Mr Wyatt (Hasluck) (16:06,"I rise to speak with pride on the condolence motion forLionel Rose grew up in hardship, learning to box from his father, Roy, a useful fighter on the tentshow circuit. Lionel Rose began his professional boxing career on September 1964, outpointing Mario Magriss over eight rounds. The fight was in Warragul, but the majority of Rose's fights were held in Melbourne. He lived in Melbourne with Jack and Shirley Rennie, training every day in their backyard gym. His defeat of Harada made Rose an instant national hero in Australia, and an icon among Aboriginal people. He responded well to the public reception at Melbourne Town Hall, which was witnessed by a crowd of more than 2,000. The parade had more than 250,000 and at a point later when he was interviewed he acknowledged the impact of that crowd on him and the success that he had achieved. Lionel Rose of course was Australian of the Year in 1968, the first Aboriginal person to be awarded the honour. In 1996, Rose presented young burns-attack victim Tjandamurra O'Shane with his worldtitle belt, helping to speed the youngster's recovery. Tjandamurra had been the victim of a racially charged attack in Cairns the previous year. In 2007 Lionel Rose suffered a stroke that left him with speech and movement difficulties. I also want to share with you the person Lionel Rose was. I cite an article by Cathy Bedford in which she wrote a personality profile. This profile gives an insight into Lionel Rose the person. To do her work justice, I will quote her article faithfully: Lionel grew up in an Aboriginal settlement called Jackson's Track near the Gippsland town of Drouin in the 1940s. Born into a large family with tight budgets Lionel was forced to bring in money to support his eight younger brothers and sisters. He instantly looked to his father, a professional boxer in the travelling tent-show circuit. Tragically Lionel's father and greatest boxing mentor died when he was 14 before he could see his son fight professionally. I went from nothing to something, you know what I mean … in an instant ... I got the shock of my life ―He saw one amateur fight and I won that."" Lionel says. ""Of course he was over the moon about that. He used to talk all the time about the boxing he showed me the real fundamentals of it. So by the time. I got to the gym I trained under another fella named Frank Oakes; actually ended up marrying his daughter too.‖ Lionel's path to glory was not as straight forward. A young country boy taken swiftly to the bright lights of Melbourne. From small-time bouts to a chance at the big time. ―I went from nothing to something, you know what I mean…in an instant. When we got back to Melbourne so many people lined the streets to welcome you home at the town hall. And that‘s a memory that will never disappear from my mind. I got the shock of my life anyway. Especially because there were only 10 to see us off when we went over there to fight for the title.‖ ―I wanted to go home after a fortnight, I couldn‘t hack the noise it was all that."" Lionel says. ""You know the city and the country it‘s all differences you know. I was 16 or 17 and I couldn‘t be doing the things that other 16 year olds do today."" I ended up cutting the song at Armstrong Studios in South Melbourne and blow me down it became number one within a fortnight. And it stayed at number one for 32 weeks. ""I had to be up at 6 o‘clock running, I had to go to work during the day and then come home and train and then into bed again, I did that for six years… But it made a name for me and I‘ve met some terrific people in my travels.‖ ―That was in Los Angeles, we went out to MGM studios with Elvis Presley for about three hours. I was in awe of him anyway. We were the first allowed on his set in 10 years.‖ MAIN COMMITTEE But singing was to be Lionel's triumph too. Who would have thought the poor boy from Jackson‘s track could progress from the musical domain of his lounge room to the heights of the Australian musical charts with the song 'Pick me up on your way down'. ―I did a show on Channel Seven called Sunny Side Up and sung a song called Pick me up on your way down."" Lionel says. ""Anyhow, Johnny Young came around to the gym and look he said ‗I‘ve got a song here, I‘d like to record if you want to do it?‘ I said ‗Nah I‘m not into that I only sing in the bathroom or in the lounge room with the brothers and sisters‘."" ""But he persevered and I ended up cutting the song at Armstrong Studios in South Melbourne and blow me down it became number one within a fortnight. And it stayed at number one for 32 weeks that song."" But now, 25 years after he stepped out of the ring for the last time he has finally got his wish and returned to his roots in Gippsland. ―Well I‘m doing good at the moment, thank you very much. It‘s all clear ahead so I‘m just enjoying life at the moment.‖ ―My mum only lives 5 mile away in Drouin so I‘m back with my family, and I really am enjoying life immensely at the moment. I‘ve got a hell of a lot of friends here, so there‘s no shortage of that you know.‖ ―I‘ve got fond memories of growing up here. They were probably the best times in my life. But life wasn‘t too hard, we lived in a community, there were uncles and aunties living next door and down the road a bit so it was a family thing.‖ ―If you go down the track a bit and you look back, you realise that the days at Jacksons track were black tea and damper days but the fond memories I have of it are incredible.‖ Lionel Rose never lost his connections to his community nor his family. He cherished the times when he was boxing at the height of his career and many of the memories he shared with those of us who he knew. But equally he was as content back within his community, because the memories of where you grow up, your totems and the significance of the land around you, becomes important. Lionel, you gave all Australians a hero to be proud of. In keeping with the lyrics of your song, thank you for being you. Rest in peace in the presence of the Almighty. mourn his passing. I will not go through the facts and figures that I have before me that others have covered and will cover. I think of my times in the YMcA boxing ring and when I went to the local shows, with Harry Paulsen beating the drum and asking people to roll up. As a kid, I always rolled up. There were always plenty of Aboriginal fighters. I had the good fortune of playing football with many Aboriginal players. In fact, every club that I played with had at least one Aboriginal player. But in Tasmanian in 1968 they did not stand up and talk about their Aboriginality. Lionel Rose not only gave Australia a hero but gave Tasmanian Aboriginals a hero and made them stand that bit prouder. I remember in 1968 listening to him fight Fighting Harada. What a great feeling that was for Australia. I am involved with Australian Rules footy and each year we have an Indigenous round. We have people like Syd Jackson come down and talk to us about Australian Aborigines and what a wonderful contribution they have made to sport. BeforeI embarrass myself any further I just want to say he was a hero. I bought his songs, although I did not buy too many records. I think I Thank You was a great song for our nation at the time. Pick Me Up on Your Way Down-we could still live with those words today, couldn't we? And Please Remember Me-I certainly do. MAIN COMMITTEE",235,Condolences
193,Mr Lyons (Bass) (16:17,"I rise to acknowledge the life of Lionel Edward Rose. Icertainly did not embarrass yourself. of one of our greatest ever sporting legends. It is rather difficult to do this after my friends the member for Hasluck and the member for Bass so vividly demonstrated what Lionel Rose did for our generation in bringing us together. He was born and raised in Jacksons Track, southeast of Melbourne, one of the few remaining untouched Aboriginal communities at the time. Lionel grew up in the most difficult of circumstances. He learned to box from his father, Roy, who was an amateur fighter. Initially, when he could not afford gloves, he wrapped his hands in rags and he boxed in a ring made of fencing wire stretched between trees. There was no such thing as rope-a-dope for Lionel. He was given his first gloves at the age of 10 by a press photographer. Lionel commenced organised training at the age of 15 under a local trainer, Frank Oakes; Lionel would later marry his daughter Jenny. Soon after, he won the Australian amateur flyweight title. He turned professional in 1964 after missing out on selection for the 1964 Olympic Games. He moved to Melbourne and lived with Jack and Shirley Rennie. Jack became his trainer and they worked out every day in their backyard gym. Interestingly, Harry Hopman was a great friend of Jack Rennie and a great fan of boxing. He took two young Australian tennis players who were living and training with him at the time to see Lionel do his farewell spar before he went to Los Angeles to defend his title: Phil Dent and I got to meet Lionel at that time. We were so impressed with his gentleness and with his incredible modesty. He was already a world champion at 19. He built up a flawless record in Australia and New Zealand, leading to winning the Australian bantamweight title in October 1966. He continued to win belts, including a famous knockout win against Rocky Gattellari at Sydney Stadium. He then challenged the legendary national hero Fighting Harada for the world bantamweight title on 26 February 1968 in Tokyo. He was an enormous underdog; he was said to be too young to fight at this level. He made history by becoming the first Aboriginal Australian to win a world championship. He defeated Harada in 15 gruelling rounds. This win made Rose an instant national hero and an icon among Aboriginal Australians. He was welcomed back to Melbourne by 250,000 fans to celebrate his great success. Rose defended his title again in Tokyo and in California, where the disappointed local crowds started a riot; the referee needed hospitalisation and over a dozen spectators were also treated. He retired in 1971, with a brief but unsuccessful comeback attempt in 1975. Lionel Rose became the first Indigenous Australian to be awarded Australian of the Year in 1968, the same year he was awarded an MBE. In 2003, he was an inaugural inductee into the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame. He was featured on an Australia Post stamp two years later and also awarded the Ella Lifetime Achievement Award for contribution to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sport. Lionel went on to have a musical career. In 1970 he released two hit ballads: I Thank You and Please Remember Me. The song I Thank You was a nationwide hit, more recently used by the comedians Roy and HG as a substitute for the Australian national anthem during their sporting broadcasts. After retiring from boxing Lionel remained an inspiration for Indigenous Australians. In 1996 Lionel gave his world title belt to a six-year-old Indigenous boy, Tjandamurra O'Shane, MAIN COMMITTEE",237,Condolences

195,Mr Alexander (Bennelong) (16:20,"I rise to speak on the sad and premature passingwho was the innocent victim of a horrific schoolyard attack, suffering burns to 70 per cent of his body. Lionel hoped the belt would give O'Shane hope for a speedy recovery. In 2008 O'Shane completed year 12 and graduated from Woree State High School, providing a great joy for Lionel, who had suffered a stroke earlier that year. An award-winning film of his life, a documentary called Lionel, premiered at the Melbourne International Film Festival in 2008. The film explored his rise and his struggle with the dimensions of being a mythic sporting figure, showing the contrast between hero and the man. The film is not just a tribute to an icon but an honest portrayal of a complex and conflicted human being. The filmmaker added the by-line: 'Lionel's imperfections may be larger than life, but so is his heart.' Lionel Rose was an inspiration to his people, many of whom experience great hopelessness in white society. Lionel showed that anything is possible, that a poor young Indigenous boy could rise to be a world champion and become a national hero. It is a beautiful irony that, on the same day that Lionel passed, Daniel Geale, another young Australian with Indigenous heritage, won the IBF middleweight championship in Germany, becoming only the fourth Australian born boxer to win a title on foreign soil. Legendary trainer Johnny Lewis said: I think Lionel Rose showed indigenous Australians that they could achieve anything if they worked hard, but he was an inspiration for all Australians. Even current boxing champion Anthony Mundine, one not normally renowned for sharing the limelight, described Lionel Rose as the best Australian fighter ever. Lionel also became a symbol of the political discourse of the time, as debate on racial equality and Indigenous rights was the defining issue of the day. He turned professional the same year as the Freedom Ride and won his world title one year after the 1967 referendum. It is interesting that Lionel found his fame in the manly art of self-defence, yet he displayed the most extraordinary level of gentleness. I grew up with a girl called Evonne Goolagong. Evonne showed the same extraordinary gentleness, as did Cathy Freeman later on. All three shared an incredible physical grace. In Lionel's case it belied his speed and also belied the power with which he hit. This unusual mix of manliness and gentleness produced in Lionel Rose, our champion, a gentle man. Thank you. Ms HALL (Shortland-Government Whip) (16:27): My contribution will only be brief. I would like to place on record my tribute to a truly great Australian. Lionel Rose was a role model for not only Indigenous Australians but all Australians. WhilstI am not a person who is usually a boxing fan, I can remember where I was and what I was doing at the particular time that Lionel Rose won his world title. His win had a great impact in my community, which had a large Indigenous population. It had an empowering effect on those people, especially when he was made Australian of the Year. That showed just what a groundbreaking person he was and the impact he had on our society. The songs he wrote and the contribution he made crossed so many different layers of our society. I briefly place on the record of this House my appreciation and thanks for the work that he did. Rose MBE, who passed away on Sunday, 8 May 2011. I would also like to express my deepest sympathy and pass on my condolences to his family and friends. In 1968, when MAIN COMMITTEE",238,Condolences
196,Mr Matheson (Macarthur) (16:30,"I pay tribute to a great man and legend, Mr LionelLionel Rose beat Japanese boxer 'Fighting' Harada, Lionel became a role model for Aboriginal people throughout Australia. Lionel was a great champion and was rightly hailed as Australia's first Aboriginal world champion, with over 100,000 people attending a civic reception in his honour at Melbourne Town Hall. In that same year, Lionel was made Australian of the Year-what a great tribute to a great man. He was an absolute legend and a champion for his people and all Australians. Lionel Rose was a remarkable man admired by all. He was a wonderful human being and it is fitting that he will be honoured with a state funeral. In a Sydney Morning Herald article on 9 May, Australian boxing trainer Johnny Lewis said: It seems incredible that on the same day Lionel Rose leaves us Daniel Geale becomes a world champion. Mr Lewis goes on to say: Daniel is very proud of his indigenous background and the way was opened for Daniel by Lionel Rose and Tony Mundine. They were great role models. I think Lionel Rose showed Indigenous Australians that they could achieve anything if they worked hard, but he was an inspiration to all Australians. This was a wonderful tribute to Lionel Rose by the legendary boxing trainer Johnny Lewis. Only four Australians have won world titles overseas-Jimmy Carruthers, Lionel Rose, Jeff Harding and a local boy from my Macarthur electorate, Daniel Geale. Daniel is a resident of Harrington Park; he trains at the Grange Old School Boxing gym at Smeaton Grange. Even though Daniel was born in Launceston, Tasmania, in recent years he has resided in the Macarthur electorate. Daniel won gold at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester and turned professional in 2004. In December of that year, he won the world IBO middleweight championship. On8 May, Daniel won the IBF middleweight world championship-an amazing achievement. I am proud to say that my office gave Daniel the Aboriginal flag that he took with him to Germany for the world championship this year. Daniel Geale is the latest Aboriginal champion to become a role model for the Aboriginal youth in my electorate. I am proud to be the member for Macarthur, a place where Aboriginal heritage is valued and cherished. The Macarthur region is home to one of the largest urban concentrations of Aboriginal people in Sydney. There are more than 5,000 Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people living in the Macarthur region, representing approximately 2.3 per cent of the total population of my electorate. The median age for Indigenous residents in Macarthur is 17 years, compared to 32 years for the general population. Macarthur over the years has produced many Aboriginal role models in sports, the arts, policing and education. People such as Djon Mundine, our internationally recognised Aboriginal curator at the Campbelltown Arts Centre; Constable Brenton Magee, a Campbelltown police officer and a great role model for local Aboriginal youth; and Frances Bodkin, a botanical author, teacher and traditional storyteller at the at the Mount Annan Botanic Gardens, who was recently one of 100 Indigenous women across the country recognised for their tireless contribution to the community. That is to name just a few of our local Aboriginal people who have made a significant contribution to our community. I am sure that Lionel would not mind me mentioning other inspirational Aboriginal leaders here today. There are many throughout all our communities. Lionel Rose was a quiet, unassuming Australian, a role model not only for Aboriginal people but for all Australians. He was a national hero for us all. It has been said that Lionel Rose's decency redefined sportsmanship. MAIN COMMITTEE Lionel Rose led by example and remained a man of the people. There will never be enough accolades to celebrate the wonderful life of Lionel Rose and his contribution to humanity and Australian society. I am pleased to inform the House that Daniel Geale has these same attributes. I have no doubt that he will also become a role model for the youth of Australia and follow in the same footsteps as the great Lionel Rose, who will always be remembered. world titleholder, Australian of the Year and modest singer, who overnight became an instant Australian hero and an icon amongst Aboriginal Australians-indeed, all Australians. Rose stayed true to his roots and his life throughout the rags to riches tale. He came from very modest beginnings to the highest level of international sport, taking the hopes of a nation with him. On 26 February 1968, Rose made history by becoming the first Aboriginal Australian to win a world champion boxing title. That same year, Rose was also awarded Australian of the Year, making him the first Aboriginal Australian to be awarded the honour. Lionel Rose was born and raised at Jacksons Track near the Victorian town of Warragul. He grew up in hardship, learning to box from his father, a useful fighter on the tent show circuit. Yet it was a friendship Lionel Rose forged with local press photographer Graham Walsh, who later introduced him to local Warragul trainer Frank Oakes, which launched him into the fighting circuit. The making of his career was once described by boxing historian Grantlee Kieza as a boxer who 'sparred with rags on his hands in a ring made from fencing wire stretched between trees'. At the tender age of 16, Lionel Rose narrowly missed out on selection for the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. However, this was the year he began his professional boxing career on 9 September, when he outpointed Mario Magriss over eight rounds at a professional fight in Warragul. Over the next 18 months, Lionel Rose had a record of 13 wins, one loss and one knockout. It was on 26 October 1966 that he won the Australian bantamweight title. He won that title in a gruelling 15-round decision. Lionel Rose challenged Japanese boxer Fighting Harada for the world bantamweight title and won, again in a gruelling 15-round decision. On8 March 1969, Lionel Rose retained the title with yet another 15-round decision over British boxer Alan Rudkin, but lost the title five months later in a fifth round knockout. Thinking that his career was over, Lionel Rose continued to box, but only unknown fighters. However, after a 10-round decision on 10 October 1970, when he upset Japanese lightweight champion Ishimatsu Suzuki, he once again positioned himself as a world title challenger. All in all, in his professional boxing career Lionel Rose compiled a record of an impressive 42 wins, 11 losses and 12 wins by knockout. During his time off from boxing in the 1970s he became a modest Australian singer, releasing one album and two singles. His climb to the top from the lower end of society made him personable to Australians and a pillar to the Aboriginal community. In 2007, Lionel Rose sadly suffered a stroke which left him with limited speech and movement. However, it was a short illness which took his life on 8 May 2011, at the all too young age of 62. Lionel Rose was an inspirational man whose tale is recognised both nationally and internationally. The world has lost a boxing champion, Australia has lost a national hero and his own people have lost a wonderful role model.

Lionel did not want any attention whatsoever, as we have heard today from the very generous speakers who have spoken in this condolence debate and who have passed on their condolences to the family, as I do to the broader Rose family. As their local member, I am as distant from Lionel and his family as any other person of my background. But I am not distant from Jacksons Track, and I am not distant from the story of Jacksons Track. I do not think anybody fully understands the incredible story that Lionel Rose is, coming out of Jacksons Track. No-one understands the enormity of the journey of the young boy coming out of Jacksons Track onto the world stage. I do not think he had much time for politicians, or even NAIDOC Week, but he was out with his family; he was doing what he wanted to do. It was great to hear from members of parliament, especially the member for Bass, who obviously has a very deep and personal connection to Indigenous communities because of the work he has done with young footballers and sportsmen. Lionel, speaking to you now-we were there listening to you on the radio. I do not like boxing, because for all of my life, when I have listened to or watched boxing, my heart was in terror that Lionel Rose or one of his sporting colleagues was going to be severely hurt boxing on behalf of this nation, because that is what he was doing. Maybe it seemed that he was doing it for himself, but the nation was watching Lionel Rose. The nation was listening to Lionel Rose. The nation was hoping and praying for his well-being and his success. Fourteen people saw him off when he left to go overseas, and when he achieved that success 250,000 people crowded the streets of Melbourne-all the way from Essendon Airport and all the way in, there were people standing on the side of the road waiting for Lionel's car to come past. He was our new hero. And don't we love a hero! Jacksons Track was a disgrace. When Carolyn Landon wrote the story of Jacksons Track and put it in black and white, we had an issue. I do not cry reading books, but I cried many times when I was reading Jackson's Track. I had to put the book down, and I could not read the next page until I could get myself back to a state where the tears in my eyes were not destroying my ability to read the book Jackson's Track. As a local member, I know where this guy came from. And he must have had a burning desire within him. You would hear those who are competent in sport talk about his speed, his ability and the power that came from such a gentle soul. The only person I ever met in Lionel Rose on the number of occasions that I met Lionel was a gentle, quiet, unassuming, humble human being. That is the person I knew. He did not have the humour of Syd Jackson. He did not even have what you would call grace and style-but humble! Here was this guy who changed the world for Australia-to think that one of our Indigenous young people could go and tackle Fighting Harada and win. As you have heard from all of the people today who spoke about how he was rated, if he was on Sportsbet going into that fight, you would not have had any money on him at all. And he won. He won against the odds-as a child, as a teenager and as a boxer. He could sing as well. I thought he sang Telephone to Glory. MAIN COMMITTEE",241,Condolences

If this nation ever thinks that members of parliament do not care about our families, our Indigenous communities and all that goes with them, today is a perfect example of it being wrong. When tears were shed here today we all entered into that moment with the member for Bass. He said, 'I do not want to disgrace myself any more over this issue.' He was not disgracing himself. There was not a person here who was not standing with him. Vale, Lionel Rose. I am sorry that he suffered after his stroke, but I want to let you all know that what I saw in that room was not just a hero but a family gathered around an ordinary man in protection, in care and in honour. He could go back to his community near Jacksons Track to live and say, 'I am very comfortable,' as he said to Kathy Bedford. He said, 'I am back with my family and I am very happy. I am living life well.' His cousin, who was the chairman of the Boxing Federation, was interviewed by ABC Radio the other day. He said, 'He was never on time, so to get him to the footy on time we would always tell him that the football was two hours earlier, and then we would get him there.' He loved being there at the footy with his family, watching his family play. Even with his great talent and ability, his family's love of him was for his ordinariness-for his love of community, for his love of his family and just for the fact that he was nestled in their arms before he died. Rose and to do so after the members for Hasluck and McMillan. I say that because they both, in their own way, represent a part of this story. The member for McMillan represents the area in which the great Lionel Rose grew up. It was not a privileged background, as has been well set out. It was a tough, hard background, but he was an Australian who took an extraordinary journey. In my view, the definition of what we in this House seek to achieve for people is the opportunity to live the life of their choice. The title of a book by the great British explorer in the Danakil area of the Horn of Africa, Wilfred Thesiger, was The Life of My Choice. If that is what we aspire to bring in some small measure to Australia, Lionel Rose was the embodiment of that life. He came from the most humble of beginnings in the Gippsland area, an area adjacent to my own electorate. I know that on the Mornington Peninsula and in West Gippsland this is somebody they looked to as one of their own, and there was a great sense of affection many years-43 years-after he took on and beat Masahiko 'Fighting' Harada in Tokyo. He was looked upon as a local. He was looked upon as an Indigenous path maker and trailblazer. But above all else he was looked upon as an extraordinarily generous, decent and courageous human being. So in our part of the world there is this great sense of affection, connection and gentle love for Lionel Rose which goes back to the fact that he was a local who came from a background which should not have led him to the world stage but which did, and he did it on his own terms and in his own way-a way which inspired generations of young Australians from all MAIN COMMITTEE",242,Condolences

200,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (16:48,"It is a great honour to rise to speak in recognition of Lionelbackgrounds. But on top of that he, along with Evonne Goolagong Cawley, also helped pave the way for Indigenous Australians to be held in a higher level of esteem and to give themselves that sense of the possibility that they could do anything in this country. In that context we have somebody who was an inspiration to young locals in Gippsland and the Mornington Peninsula of Victoria and, more generally, Australia; a particular inspiration to Indigenous Australians; but, above all else-and this is where I want to finish in this very brief recognition and tribute-an exemplar to all of us of a life well lived. At end of day there is no doubt he was able to look back and, with family and friends around him and with his own set of achievements-yes, there was hardship at the start; yes, it was hard along the way; and, yes, there was hardship at the finish-look at a life well lived, believing and knowing that he had lived the life of his choice and done so in a way which brought honour to him and to his family and brought joy to millions of Australians. Lionel Rose, and I would like to associate myself with some of the comments of the previous speakers, including Mr Hunt and Mr Broadbent, whom I have just listened to here. I am sorry I did not get to hear some of the earlier speakers as well; I understand they also gave very moving and honourable tributes to this great man. Lionel Rose, as we all know, passed away last Sunday. He was a world champion sportsman, he was an Indigenous superstar and he was a great Australian. Of course, he is remembered primarily today by most Australians for being the first world champion boxer for Australia, and he won that title way back in 1968 in Tokyo, coming up against the world bantamweight champion at the time, Masahiko Harada. Lionel was just 19 years old when he took that fight on. He was the underdog. Few thought he would be able to win that fight against the world champion, but history showed that he did; and, in doing so, he changed sporting history in Australia forever. He also made an incredible contribution more broadly than that. Today, when we think about our Indigenous sporting superstars and other Indigenous role models, we have many. We of course have dozens of AFL footballers who dominate the football field. We have had people like Evonne Goolagong Cawley. We have had Cathy Freeman. We have had Nova Peris-Kneebone, Wendell Sailor and the like. We have had other outstanding Indigenous role models reach the peak of our community, including the member for Hasluck here, who is a fellow parliamentarian. But back in 1968, when Lionel Rose became the world champion boxer, we did not have such circumstances. He was the first real Indigenous superstar and real Indigenous hero. Of course, he won this only a year after the referendum on Indigenous affairs. It was a unique time in Australian political history in regard to Indigenous issues, as the referendum was passed a year earlier with 90 per cent approval of the particular measure which gave the Commonwealth power to enact laws to the benefit of Indigenous people in Australia. His win came a year after that and, in doing so, gave Indigenous Australians, from what I have read, a huge confidence boost. As I mentioned, he became Australia's first Indigenous superstar. It is interesting to note, when we reflect on his victory at that time, that the history books say it was not just Indigenous Australians who were celebrating like crazy over this incredible victory; indeed, there were 100,000 everyday Australians on the streets of Melbourne who gave him a tickertape parade when he returned. In some respects it was a remarkable act of MAIN COMMITTEE",243,Condolences
201,Mr Tudge (Aston) (16:52,"I also rise to support the condolence motion for the late Mrreconciliation, without it being called that at the time. All Australians probably thought, 'We're just proud of this guy, who's a fantastic Aussie hero.' I think that is worth reflecting on as well. He inspired all of us at the time with his sporting prowess and certainly inspired Indigenous Australians. Sadly, his victory did not mark a turning point in addressing Indigenous social and economic disadvantage. Indeed, in part the opposite is the case when we look back at some of the great social decline in Indigenous communities, particularly remote Indigenous communities, that started in about the late sixties and early to mid-seventies. While we are reflecting upon Lionel Rose today we should also be thinking about the disadvantage which still exists in Indigenous communities. Through Lionel Rose's memory we should commit to maintaining on the political agenda of this parliament the alleviation of disadvantage in Indigenous communities. Lionel Rose was not just a great sports star but also, as other people have noted in this chamber, a very principled man. The Australian, in its editorial yesterday, pointed out that 'Rose took pride in refusing a lucrative offer to fight in apartheid-ridden South Africa in 1970, where he would have been classed as an honorary white'. Also, in 1996, he generously gave his world title belt to six-year-old Tjandamurra O'Shane, who was the victim of a racially charged attack in Cairns, in the hope that it would hasten the child's recovery. All accounts are that he was a truly honourable man, a family man, a well-loved man and a principled man. We will remember Lionel Rose for all of that and more and we will remember him as an Australian hero. members to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places.

Claude Choules and to pass on my sympathy and support to his extensive family. Along with many others, I was saddened to hear of the passing of Mr Choules on 4 May 2011, aged 110-the last of our World WarI combat veterans. Mr Choules's passing brings to a significant end Australia's and the world's last living connection to World WarI and closes another chapter in world history. I note that Mr Choules served in the British Royal Navy during World War I, having joined at the age of 14, and I understand that he witnessed the scuttling of the German fleet in 1919. He also served with the Royal Australian Navy during World War II. So he has service in both World WarI and World War II. MAIN COMMITTEE",244,Condolences

204,Mrs Andrews (Mcpherson) (16:59,"I rise to speak on the condolence motion for MrIt is extraordinary to think that 70 million people served in World War I, with millions of these paying the ultimate sacrifice for their country. More than 750,000 Australians served during World War I, with 155,000 wounded and 64,000 losing their lives. Reading about Mr Choules's life, I was reminded of my own family. Some of the history of Mr Choules's life is contained in his book which is titled The Last of the Last. I understand that Mr Choules started writing this book when he was in his 80s, with the support of his daughters, and that the book was subsequently published in 2009, when Mr Choules was 108. My great-grandfather, William Glanville, and Mr Choules both served in the British Royal Navy in World War I. My grandfather, William Henry Glanville, and Mr Choules both served in the Royal Australian Navy in World War II. My father, William Weir, also served in World War II but with the RAAF. Fortunately, they, like Mr Choules, returned home safely to their relatives and friends. Our veterans fought for our country so that Australia and the world could be free from oppression and violence. Mr Choules's 20 years of dedication to the defence of this nation is a shining reflection of the loyalty and selflessness demonstrated and embraced by Australia's veterans. The McPherson electorate has an extensive veteran community, with the Burleigh Heads, Currumbin Palm Beach, Mudgeeraba and Tweed Heads and Coolangatta RSL sub-branches providing support to the McPherson veteran community. I know that they share my sorrow in Mr Choules's passing. Mr Choules can be assured that he has left behind a community that embraces our ANZACs. This has been demonstrated at recent ANZAC Day services across the country. Attendance at our Gold Coast ANZAC services is continuing to increase year by year. I understand that in excess of 10,000 people attended the dawn service conducted by the Currumbin Palm Beach RSL sub-branch, which was held at Elephant Rock on Currumbin Beach. That service was also telecast live throughout Australia. Mr Choules is survived not only by his extensive family but also by a grateful nation, who will forever remember the sacrifices diggers like him made for Australia during the world wars. As a federal member of parliament, as the daughter, granddaughter and greatgranddaughter of World WarI and World War II veterans, and as an Australian, I am tremendously proud of the legacy Mr Choules and other veterans like him have left. Lest we forget. Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (17:04): I join with other members in marking the death and honouring the life of Claude Stanley Choules, who was the last living combat veteran from World War I. In doing so, I endorse the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and those of my parliamentary colleagues. If there is a theme to all our contributions it is, understandably, that of remembrance. It is a fact of life that time marches ever forward and it is a part of the human condition that successive generations constitute the links we have between the present day and our history. Claude Choules was the last living contact we had with the combat experience of World War I. On hearing of Claude's death, my thoughts turned to my grandfather, who served in the Middle East in World War One and in the Pacific in World War II. Jesse Lilburn 'Pat' Parke fudged his age upwards to be involved in the First World War, and downwards for the Second World War. He died of health problems related to his war service, before I was born. I am sure it is the case for many Australians that the passing of Claude Choules resonates strongly with their memory of relatives who were directly involved in World War I. MAIN COMMITTEE As long as Claude lived, a human connection remained to that time, a human connection remained to the history that also involved our grandfathers and great-uncles. Now that thread has been severed and we will have to make a greater effort as time passes so that we continue to remember, so that children born this week, whose lives never intersected with Claude Choules, will nevertheless come to learn and understand the horrors of war and the incredible suffering and sacrifices made by Australians in the cause of peace. In this context I note that we will shortly mark the centenary of ANZAC, which I am sure will provide a significant opportunity for us to remember as a nation and to strengthen our capacity to remember. I am aware, for example, of an effort underway to have added to the war memorial in Fremantle a set of plaques that record the more than 800 local men who lost their lives in World War I. It is a project that I wholeheartedly support. I would like to note that Claude Choules has a special connection to Fremantle, for there was a time when Fremantle was both his home and to some extent his responsibility. Claude settled in Fremantle between the wars, and in World War II as a naval chief petty officer was apparently charged with the responsibility of rigging vessels in Fremantle harbour so that they could be blown up in the case of invasion. Thankfully, it never came to that. Of course, it never came to that because of the efforts of service personnel like Claude Choules, because of the military and civilian fortitude of tens of millions across the allied nations. After the Second World War, Claude became a cray fisherman, which was and continues to be a typical Fremantle profession. At 110, Claude Choules was the oldest Australian man and the seventh-oldest man alive, which is incredible. His life spanned a remarkable period of history, including the two most awful conflicts the human race has inflicted on itself. Claude's wife of more than 75 years, Ethel, a nurse, who he met on the ship out to Australia, died when she was 98. Claude cared for her until the end, sleeping on a canvas sheet on the floor by her bed. He is survived by three children, 11 grandchildren, 22 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren. Our best wishes and condolences go out to all of them, and I will be honoured to convey these sentiments to Claude's family at his funeral service, which is to be held next Friday, 20 May, at St Johns Anglican Church in Fremantle. On hearing the news of Claude's death, I called and spoke with Claude's daughter, Anne Pow, who lives in Palmyra in my electorate. Anne made the point to me that Claude hated war and the glorification of war. With all his personal experience, Claude Choules believed that war was pointless; and, as much as he was and is a symbol of remembrance, we should not whitewash the fact that he personally did not like to dwell on the wars. As I understand it, he only marched in ANZAC parades when he was ordered to. Anne wanted to impress on me the fact that her dad was a remarkably happy man. I think that is a quality that comes through even in the photographs that accompany the newspaper stories of his death. I like to think that one of the secrets of his long life was his happiness. He was also clearly a loving and good humoured man and a man devoted to his family. Those are the qualities I believe he would have most wanted to be remembered for. the Leader of the Opposition. The member for Fremantle and I have something in common: Claude was living in the electorate of Swan when he passed away but he also, as the member for Fremantle said, spent time living in the Fremantle electorate. MAIN COMMITTEE",245,Statements On Indulgence
205,Mr Irons (Swan) (17:08,"I rise today to support the motion by the Prime Minister andClaude was the last surviving combat male from World War I. He lived in WA in the electorate of Swan at the Gracewood hostel in Salter Point. For those who do not know Salter Point, it is a peaceful area along the Swan River, and I am sure it would have been a great and peaceful place for him to spend his last days. I know the staff of Gracewood will be missing him, as will his family and all those who knew him. In my small way, on behalf of the people of the electorate of Swan, I wish to pass on my condolences to Claude's family. Claude did not like war and he saw it as his job so he did what he had to do. He was typical of many veterans who do not glorify war, but at the same time he was a symbol of the men and women of the Allies who fought to preserve our way of life and the many freedoms and rights we enjoy as a society. He along with his fellow Allied force members, whether they be men or women, were prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for their countries. We have recently held ANZAC ceremonies all over Australia and other parts of the world to recognise the fallen members of Claude's troop and Allied forces in conflicts around the world, but particularly the ones Australian and New Zealand forces fought in. People like Claude are symbols and reminders to us of these valiant men and women. I have taken some details from the Sydney Morning Herald article by Gerry Carman, which gives us an insight into the man who was referred to as 'the last of the last': As a centenarian, he retained a sense of humour, insisting a laugh was good for the senses and the soul. Asked the secret of his longevity, he responded: ''Don't die.'' He was also the oldest man living in Australia when he died. Towards the end, a degenerative eye disorder, exacerbated by a fall, meant Choules relied on touch. But overall, he appeared to be in remarkably good health. His daughter, Anne Pow, attributed his long life to his overall fitness, healthy lifestyle and a happy, contented disposition that allowed him to eat and sleep well to the end. He didn't own a car until he was 50 and rode a bicycle everywhere. And, his wife, Ethel, a children's nurse, ensured the family always had a healthy, balanced diet long before modern health fads took hold. Claude Stanley Choules, who held dual British and Australian nationality, was born on March 3, 1901, at Wyre Piddle, Pershore, in Worcestershire, one of five children of Madelin and Henry, a haberdasher and gambler. His mother abandoned the family when he was a young child for many years he thought she had died and his older brothers were sent to different family homes while his father raised him and his sisters, Phyllis and Gwen. This would later shape his make-up as a considerate, conscientious and attentive father, polite to all. Choules dropped out of school at 14 and fibbed about his age to join the navy in 1915. The previous year he had tried to join the army as a bugle boy when he learnt that his brothers, Douglas and Leslie, were serving in the British Army. Both had fought at Gallipoli before going on to fight on the Western Front in France, where Douglas was gassed and died a year later and Leslie won the Military Medal for bravery. After initial training on HMS Impregnable, at one time a 140-gun square-rigged wooden battleship, Choules served in the North Sea on HMS Revenge, flagship of the Royal Navy's first battle squadron. He witnessed two historic events at the end of the Great War: the surrender of the Imperial German Navy at the Firth of Forth off Scotland's east coast, on November 21, 1918, 10 days after the armistice; and he was present at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands on June 21, 1919, when German admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered his interned fleet to be scuttled. Preventive action limited the scuttling to 52 of the 74 ships. MAIN COMMITTEE Between 1920 and 1923, Choules served in the Mediterranean before being seconded with 11 other Royal Navy personnel to come to Australia in 1926 on loan to the RAN as an instructor at Flinders Naval Depot on the Mornington Peninsula. On the way to Australia, on the passenger ship SS Diogenes, Choules met Ethel Wildgoose, a Scot on her way to Melbourne, and they married not long after. Choules asked for a permanent transfer to the RAN. He returned to Britain for courses to qualify as a chief torpedo and anti-submarine instructor and he was also on duty for the construction of the RAN's heavy cruisers, Australia and Canberra. He was part of the commissioning crew of HMAS Canberra, in which he served until 1931. Choules took his discharge from the RAN that year but remained in the reserve; he rejoined the RAN the following year as a torpedo and anti-submarine instructor, with the rank of chief petty officer. During World War II, he served as the RAN's senior demolition expert in Western Australia. Early in the war, he disposed of the first German mine to wash up on Australia's shores, near Esperance in Western Australia. During the dark days of 1942, he set explosives to blow up oil tanks and placed depth charges in ships unable to leave Fremantle Harbour in anticipation of a Japanese landing. Had the Japanese invaded, he would also have had to ride a bicycle about 500 kilometres south to Albany to blow up harbour facilities there. He remained in the RAN after the war and transferred to the Naval Dockyard Police, which enabled him to stay in the service until 1956, five years longer than regulations allowed for RAN ratings, who had to retire at 50. But Choules was not done with the sea. He bought a crayfish boat and spent 10 years fishing with Ethel. He also shot rabbits and culled kangaroos until he saw the film Bambi. Despite his military record, Choules became a pacifist. He was known to have disagreed with the celebration of Australia's most important war memorial holiday, ANZAC Day, and refused to march in annual commemoration parades. An excellent ballroom dancer, he had pumps made for his whirls across the dance floor doing the foxtrot, which he taught his daughters and grandchildren. He also loved to play the mouth organ; not surprisingly, his favourite tunes were seas shanties, including What Shall We Do with a Drunken Sailor? Ethel Choules died in 2006, aged 98, and Claude spent his last years at the Gracewood Hostel at Salter Point in Perth. His death follows that of American Frank Buckles, who died in February, also aged 110, and who, until then, had been the oldest surviving veteran of World War I. He'd been an ambulance driver near the Western Front. … Claude Choules is survived by his children, Daphne, Anne and Adrian, 13 grandchildren, 26 great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren. Claude Choules was a symbol of those before our time and our generation who gave to their country-did not ask what they could take from their country but were prepared to give to their country. A lot of us should remember those qualities and those character traits as we go about our daily lives and see what we can give to this country in memory of people like Claude Choules, to celebrate his contribution to Britain and to Australia. Ms O'NEILL (Robertson) (17:16): I rise to express my condolences on the passing of Mr Claude Choules. On Thursday, 5 May 2011 Mr Claude Choules, the last-known veteran to have served in World War I, passed away. While he spent his later life here in Australia and fought for Australia in World War II, it is Mr Choules's connection as a British serviceman to the First World War that I wish to reflect on here today. MAIN COMMITTEE As a teacher, I have had the opportunity to teach and learn about the war, so often called the Great War. So extreme the loss of life, so long the conflict, so broad the impact, it was a war that our forebears hoped would be the war to end all wars. Claude Choules was there in the fray as a serviceman in the British Royal Navy. He lived a life, as did his peers, impacted by the realities of that long and tragic conflict. But, while Mr Choules's passing marks the end of that historical period and our connection with World War I, it is important in my view to honour his passing by placing on the record in this place that he and those who served alongside him will not be forgotten. Recently, students from my electorate of Robertson undertook an excursion to VillersBretonneux and assisted with the ANZAC Day service there. They were supported and encouraged in this excursion by Roger Macey, who continues the tradition established by Mr Paul Salmon and his fellow history staff, and obviously very much encouraged by their school principal. I understand that all present at the service were described on the day as 'pilgrims', reinforcing the sense and depth of esteem held for those who served and died, or survived, on Flanders Fields. I offer my condolences and those of the people of the seat of Robertson to the Choules family at this time of great personal loss. I also offer them some comfort at this time in the observation of two young Aussies, Emily Rayner and George Margin, the school captains of Brisbane Water Secondary College, who were at Villers-Bretonneux this ANZAC Day. They both reported back to their school and gave a speech to the gathered assembly. Emily Rayner had the following to say: As young Australians it became incredibly emotional for us to experience first hand the physical and spiritual presence they left behind … those graves are ultimately a profound and visual statement depicting the sacrifice that each and every one of them gave for us.' George Margin, the boy school captain, responded to an epitaph that he read on the grave of an Australian soldier by the name of Philip Ball who died on the Western Front. The epitaph simply said, 'I fought and died in the Great War; did I die in vain?' George's response is: Philip Ball and all the thousands of other Australians, I say to you: You did not die in vain. We made this pilgrimage to honour your sacrifice. We will never forget. Claude Choules, the last of the last, we will remember you. We honour your service and your life. We will never forget you. passing away of Claude Choules, who died at the age of 110 in Perth in a nursing home. It is appropriate that we take this opportunity to pause at this juncture to reflect not just on his personal iconic qualities that have been so ably outlined by my colleagues here today but also on the fact that he was the last known combat veteran of World War I, the war that was to end all wars. When you reflect upon the life of Claude Choules, here was a man who signed up at the age of just 14 years of age in the Royal Navy and who served on famous ships, like the HMAS Impregnable and the HMAS Revenge; who was a commissioning crewmember of the HMAS Canberra before World War II and who served with her until 1931; who served in two world wars, the most famous conflicts of human history; and who was a person who rejected war as a means to an end, who never liked it and never commemorated it or regarded it as something that he would tolerate. MAIN COMMITTEE",247,Statements On Indulgence
206,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (17:19,"It is appropriate today that we reflect as a House on theWe are here today, because of the service and sacrifice of so many people like Claude, that great generation of Australians who volunteered to put themselves in harms way. I want to take a moment to reflect upon this conflict and Claude's contribution and the contributions of those Australians who did so much for us in World War I, because it is very important. Out of a population of just five million-a tiny component of the entire world-416,809 men enlisted in World War I. That goes to show what a great nation Australia truly is: in the cause of freedom, 416,809 people out of five million enlisted voluntarily to fight. That is the mark of the strength of a free society like Australia. The citizen soldier is something that I believe in quite passionately. Every free nation, indeed, needs a citizen soldiery. When you look at the great Australian military tradition that has emerged since our nation's formation, the citizen soldier-the ordinary person who steps forward to volunteer their life for their family, for their friends and for their country-is the hallmark of greatness. There is no other nation or system that can replicate that quality of a person putting themselves into harm's way by their own choice. They do not ask what their country can do for them; they ask what they can do for their country. Every free society that you look at has this. If you go back to Rome, republican Rome had the citizen soldier, and they conquered the known world. In Elizabethan England, privateers fought the Spanish and the closed markets. Minutemen in Boston in the United States of America were citizens who within minutes would take up a musket and fight the oppression of invaders who they regarded as taking over their country and their land. In Australia, we had those 416,809 men out of five million-men like Sir John Monash, who at the beginning of the First World War was a citizen, a successful engineer. At the end, he commanded the Australian corps; he was Field Marshall Sir John Monash. He was laden with honours. He was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George and Knight Commander of the Bath. He was mentioned in despatches five times. He was decorated by the French, Belgian and American governments. And he was an ordinary Australian, like those 416,809 men. They were ordinary Australians, not soldiers. They stepped up to save our country from oppression. It reminds me of that great story of the Australian who came back from World WarI to be congratulated on being a great soldier. That unknown soldier gave an immortal retort: 'I am not a soldier; I am a farmer.' That is why I am such a supporter of the citizen soldier and the reserve forces in our country today. That great Australian military tradition that has been passed down by men like Claude Choules through his life, his service and his belief that he should do something to make our country a better place. The life of Mr Choules spanned an incredible era of technological and other change. Yet that tradition of military service-that tradition of people doing something for other people, of stepping up to the plate and joining our Defence forces-carries forward. The service and sacrifice of those in the Australian Defence forces has a connection and a bond to those who have served our nation over a span of more than a century-indeed, the span of the life of Claude Choules. He would have been happy to see it. His generation nurtured and preserved a way of life that we embrace today. It is my hope in supporting this motion of the House today-and I commend the House for bringing forward such a motion-that we also let future generations be so privileged as to live under the same freedom and values of Australia through the dedication of the young people who are in uniform all around the world deployed on our behalf today. I want to thank Mr Choules and MAIN COMMITTEE those 416,000 brave men of that great generation of people who stepped up to fight for the cause of freedom in our world. I endorse this motion before the House today. an era. Mr Choules is The Last of the Last-the title of his autobiography. A significant chapter in world history ends with his passing. He was the last known living combat veteran of the Great War of 1914 to 1918 when he died in Perth on 5 May, aged 110. His death follows that of American Frank Buckles, who died in February, also aged 110, and who until then had been the oldest surviving veteran of World War I. Claude Choules was also the last surviving sailor of World WarI and served in both the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy. In fact, he was only two days younger than the RAN, which was established on 1 March 1901. In 1914, after hearing that his two older brothers, Douglas and Leslie, were serving in the British Army, Mr Choules tried to join as a bugle boy. However, a year later, at the age of 14, he fibbed about his age and joined the Royal Navy and served in the North Sea on the HMS Revenge, the flagship of the Royal Navy's first battle squadron. Claude Choules witnessed two historic events at the end of the Great War: the surrender of the imperial German navy at the Firth of Forth off Scotland's east coast on 21 November 1918, 10 days after the Armistice; and he was present at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands on 21 June 1919 when German Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered his interned fleet to be scuttled. During World War II, Claude Choules was acting torpedo officer of the HMAS Fremantle and served in the RAN until 1956. The knowledge and memories this gentleman possessed are beyond our comprehension; the changes and momentous occasions in world history he saw, experienced and felt is staggering. With his passing an historic curtain is sadly drawn. Although he scorned the glorification of war, Claude Choules was a fine example of the men and women who served and who serve so bravely for us-the price of freedom being eternal vigilance. He is an example of the servicemen who fight for peace and stability for Australia and who ensure that democracy prevails. As the member for Riverina, whose hometown of Wagga Wagga is also home to the soldier, with the important strategic and training bases of both the Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy, the death of a serviceman has always been felt deeply no matter the age. The selfless sacrifice and courageous commitment made by men such as Claude Choules ensures the spirit which exists within every person who wears a military uniform continues to burn brightly.

208,Mr Ruddock (Berowra) (17:28,"I first thank the Leader of the House for referring this Parliament of Australia in recognition of those people, former members, who have passed away between the last parliament and this parliament. Bruce Cowan's name is recorded in the honour record of those deceased members and senators of the Australian parliament who were remembered today. I wanted to note of Bruce, somebody I knew well and with whom I served, that he was a particularly remarkable individual. While his name was David Bruce Cowan, he was Bruce. He was born in 1926. He was educated at Oxley Island Public School and Taree High School. He worked as a dairy farmer, a real estate agent and a stock and station agent before serving as an alderman on Taree Municipal Council, rising to the post of deputy mayor between 1959 and 1965. He had earlier been unsuccessful in tilts at the state parliament, but he was elected as member for Oxley in a by-election in 1965. He retained the seat through five elections, during which time he served as Minister for Agriculture and Minister for Water Resources in New South Wales. He resigned the seat in 1980 to contest the federal seat of Lyne. He was elected and he held that seat until his retirement. What it does not state in recording those dates was that he served with my late father, who was a member of the New South Wales parliament and also a minister. They served contemporaneously. I still have photographs in my electorate office and in my home of Bruce and my father as they sat together in the legislative assembly of New South Wales. I thought it was somewhat ironic that at a later point in time Max Ruddock, who had also served in local government and in the state parliament, had one of his former colleagues, also a deputy mayor, in the federal parliament with his son. I came to see a lot of Bruce. I enjoyed his company. I think he had a very considerable contribution to make in public service. As I reflected on this motion today, one of the observations that have been made about him that particularly impressed me was that he was a very strong coalitionist. In his maiden speech he said: I am pleased to say that we have, particularly in the Federal coalition and in the New South Wales parliamentary National Country Party, of which I was a member, a very happy and very close association with anti-socialist policies which are so important to us. He was a man of his time. I note the Labor Party do not claim to be socialist these days, but I am sure they do not mind being reminded of it. He was a person who gave very considerable public service. It was recognised on his retirement in comments from a former leader, Tim Fischer, who had also served with Bruce in the legislative assembly of New South Wales and in the federal parliament. He noted that Bruce had given some two decades of dedicated and determined service. He went on to say that the member for Lyne had also suffered a horrific personal tragedy, of which I think many of us are aware, in losing his wife, Marion. The former leader went on to say that Bruce: … elected to carry on in the service of his electorate. I salute his service to this Parliament and to the widest range of community groups he represents. Nothing was too small or too large for Bruce to undertake. He finetuned my process of representation when I was a very young and new member of the New South Wales Parliament. He went on to say: In a sense he showed me the 'two-minute Tim' trick: the ability to be available in front of a post office or a council chamber and do a fair dinkum tour of one's electorate, being readily available to everybody. Bruce was a man of the people. He served the people of the North Coast with particular dedication. I had the opportunity, particularly as a member of the parliamentary delegation to MAIN COMMITTEE the United Kingdom and Ireland shortly after Marion's death in 1988, to travel with Bruce and with the late Glen Sheil as members of that delegation. He was great company to us. He was a fine mentor to those like my wife, Heather, who claims some Scots heritage. He and Glen Sheil both identified very much with that heritage. His service to the nation was recognised by the award of an OAM, I think richly deserved. I want to finalise my comments by noting that we all are very much concerned at the loss of him, at 85. I give my condolences to his now widow, Jan. Bruce was the father of Jane and Rosemary-the wife of my state parliamentary colleague and now New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell-and Mandy, Michael and Peter. He was the proud and loving grandfather of Tom, Will, Sheri, James, Xiao Lian and Xin Hu. Bruce Cowan is a person whom you miss. I miss him. I reflect upon him as a fine former colleague. I am delighted, as I said, that the Leader of the House has given us an opportunity today to pay this tribute to him. for Berowra, I extend my appreciation that the parliament has made a little time available for us to reflect on the life of Bruce Cowan. The previous speaker would have been in the federal parliament, I suspect, for the whole of the time that Bruce Cowan was a member of this House. Bruce Cowan's last term was my first term, so we crossed over by about three years. I have very fond memories of Bruce as a man. I got to know him briefly before I entered the federal parliament, but our relationship extended beyond the time of his retirement. Frequently when I went to the Taree or Port Macquarie area he made sure that he was around so that we could talk about issues. He was keenly interested in politics for all of his life, right up to his very last days. When I attended his funeral service in Taree and listened to people talk about his life it reminded me of how similar his early life was to my own. I could see many similarities in the way in which we grew up and, I suspect, the sorts of things that led us into politics. Bruce Cowan was born on a dairy farm on Oxley Island. It would have been a battle. Dairy farming has always been hard work. I was also born on a small farm. It had ceased to be a dairy farm by the time. I was born, but all the relics of the dairy industry were there. He had his start in the Junior Farmers organisation. So did I. That later became Rural Youth. It gave us, as farm children, a real opportunity to meet other young people in our district and to understand something about living and working with other people and broadening our own experience. Bruce then went into local government, as I did. He became Deputy Mayor of Taree City Council, where he served with distinction. By that time he had actually left the farm and was operating a stock and station agency and real estate business in the town. He was very active in his community and on a whole range of agricultural issues-and was so all through his life. I was interested to hear again, at his funeral, people talking about the things that he had been doing only in the past weeks in support of local community organisations, especially the church where his funeral was held, and his keen interest in community affairs. My fundamental description of Bruce Cowan, if I had to put it into one word, would be that this guy was a gentleman. He was a humble man, an able man, a man who cared about the people around him. He endured a great deal of hardship through his own life but always cared about others. He was keen to listen. He was always interested in the views of others. He certainly had his own views, but he was interested also to hear what other people had to say MAIN COMMITTEE",252,Statements On Indulgence
209,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Leader of The Nationals) (17:36): Like the honourable memberand was very keen to follow through on their concerns. It is also interesting that he never used speaking notes-he always spoke without notes and spoke from the heart. Speaking without notes enabled him to speak more freely than he otherwise would have been able to do. He certainly was a man of substance, but also he was a man of great warmth and great feeling. Bruce is one of the few people to have served in all three tiers of government. As mentioned earlier, he was on the Taree council, serving as deputy mayor; he moved into the New South Wales parliament, where he served as a minister under two premiers; and then he moved into the federal parliament. I am sure he would have wished also to have been a minister in the federal parliament, but that was not to be. Nonetheless, he always had the respect of his colleagues in this place. Indeed, it would be hard to identify any political or personal foe that he ever really developed in his life. He respected his opponents and generally got on very well with them. I met Bruce Cowan on the very first day I came to this parliament, at the airport in Sydney. The National Party was in a bit of trouble at the time because we had had a bad election result. Our leader had been defeated and the first job of new members of parliament coming to Canberra was to choose a new leader. Bruce had always been a lifelong friend of Ian Sinclair and felt deeply aggrieved that Ian had been deposed as leader. He felt that we needed to do the right thing and put Ian back as the leader of the party. He lobbied strongly and compassionately for that. His friendship with Ian lasted a very long time, right up to Bruce's death. Indeed, Ian and Rosemary were present at his funeral, along with a large number of state and federal political colleagues from New South Wales and interstate. In about 1987 his wife Laura was killed in a car accident. That was another very difficult time for the Nationals because at about the same time Noel Hicks, the member for Riverina, lost his wife in a car accident. Both women were at the time going about their duties as the spouses of members of parliament. It did draw to the attention of all of us the dangers of travelling on country roads over very long distances. They are the risks that we all take as people who need to be active around our electorates all the time. Losing Laura was a huge blow to Bruce, but he later married Jan Churchill and Jan, with her wonderful personality, was able to help Bruce in his work as an MP and then right through the rest of his life. The other thing we will always remember was Bruce's dedication and his commitment. He had two daughters, and one, Rosemary, is the wife of the new New South Wales Premier. Having met Bruce's grandsons, Tom and Will, I suspect there may end up being three generations of his family in politics. They are a wonderful couple of boys and I am sure they also have an enormous contribution to make in the future. Bruce was recognised with an Order of Australia in 1991 for his service to government and the citizens of the Taree region. He had served 35 years in local, state and federal parliament-a remarkable record. He was a very fine man. I felt that his farewell service at St John's Anglican Church in Taree was one of the most impressive I have been to. The town turned out and his friends were there-and his friends naturally included some well-known and famous people. But everyone attended not to be in the company of famous people but because they respected Bruce as a man. They acknowledged the contribution he had made to Taree and district, and those of us who regarded him as a friend-virtually everyone who knew him-knew that we had lost someone we cherished very deeply. I extend my sympathies to Jan, and to his daughters Rosemary and Jane and their extended families. They MAIN COMMITTEE can be very proud of Bruce for the role he has played and for the model and the lead he has provided for so many people. Cook and the member for Blaxland, some shocking news that came through in the middle of the jungle in Borneo was of the passing of Bruce Cowan, the former member for Lyne. It was the loss of a man who I considered a friend, both as a former member for Lyne and as a very active community member on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. I endorse the comments of the Liberal member for Berowra, the Father of the House and the Leader of the Nationals, the member for Wide Bay. It is somewhat reflective and symbolic of Bruce himself that we have a spread of the field talking in his honour on this condolence motion-that is, in the order of a father, a leader, and a local member, the three aspects of Bruce's life that I think he considered to be of importance in that order. He was a father first, and valued the wide family network that he had on the mid-North Coast and throughout New South Wales. Other speakers have mentioned that family network. As well, he was a community leader; even when he was outside the parliament, he was a leader of men. Right until his passing he was very active in many aspects of community life, sometimes hassling current local members to attend meetings, to address issues and, quite rightly, to remain focused on community life first and foremost. As well, he had some incredible skills in his time as a local member. His 13 years in federal parliament and his time in the state parliament before that left the reputation of a man who had an incredible memory for names and some very gifted skills in engaging with community; facilitation skills, negotiating skills and, as a community builder, uniting skills that have left a legacy to this day. He is, I can confirm to the House, widely and broadly respected on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, and his legacy certainly lingers well beyond his passing. Friends and family of the late Bruce Cowan honoured Mr Cowan's record of service to the parliament at a memorial service on the mid-North Coast on 11 April. Personally, I was devastated not to be there because of this trek, but I have let Jan and the Cowan family know that he is certainly someone held in high regard by current sitting members. This condolence motion will be well received by the family. Bruce, who passed away on 7 April, aged 85, served in the New South Wales parliament as the member for Oxley for 15 years before being elected to this place in 1980 and serving 13 years as a very good and well-respected member for the seat of Lyne up to his retirement in 1993. His contribution to community life, including eight years as an alderman on the Taree Municipal Council at the time-now Greater Taree City Council-was acknowledged with his appointment as a member of the Order of Australia in 1998, and the award of the Centenary Medal in 2001. They are small symbolic gestures of a lifetime of service to community. On behalf of the mid-North Coast and the electors of Lyne, I confirm that our community has lost a good man. Our thoughts, along with those of many in our community are with Mr Cowan's wife Jan and his family at this time. and stock and station agent, Rotarian, member of both the New South Wales and federal parliaments, family man, local champion.

He served with distinction as state member for Oxley from 1965 to 1980 and federal member for Lyne from 1980 to his retirement in 1993. On top of his time in local government for Taree Council from 1957 to 1965, that is a fine record of service to public life, a record of distinction, of dedication, ofas is the motto of his beloved Rotary club and he enjoyed membership of the progressive Taree club for 37 years-service above self. Bruce Cowan was eloquently remembered by New South Wales Nationals Chairman Christine Ferguson. 'Bruce was loved by all,' Mrs Ferguson said. 'He was one of those good old-fashioned Country Party-National Party people, quiet and unassuming. Someone who achieved great things for his community through hard work, through knowing the people he represented, through always being in touch with the grassroots of his electorate and the party he represented. He was above all else a gentleman.' This is a sentiment echoed by the Nationals leader in his tribute. Bruce Cowan, friend to all, local champion, may he rest in peace. He was also particularly proud of the Nationals success in the recent state election, especially the elevation to Premier of his son-in-law, Liberal leader Barry O'Farrell. My sincerest condolences and those of the National Party family go to Mr Cowan's extended family and friends. Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 2) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment (2011 Measures No. 2) Bill. Like all tax law amendment bills, this makes a number of changes to the tax law and the administration of tax. It does so in this case through five schedules, all essentially unrelated. I will run through each of them briefly. Schedule1 adds some deductible gift recipients to the existing schedule-namely, the Charlie Perkins Trust for children and students and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation. It adds those to the relevant list allowing donations over $2 to be tax deductible and thereby encouraging public support for charitable activities. The second schedule deals with some changes with respect to self-managed superannuation funds. The provision in this schedule will allow the government, through regulation, to impose rules on self-managed superannuation fund investments in personal use assets, such as collectables and artworks amongst a number of other things identified. Members would be aware that the sole purpose test of the relevant superannuation act requires that assets of a superannuation fund be held for the sole purpose of generating retirement income. The recent Cooper Review, the review of the entire superannuation system, recommended that selfmanaged superannuation funds be prohibited from investing in personal use assets and that those assets, to the extent that they existed within those funds, should be disposed of within five years. The review found that personal use assets lent themselves to personal enjoyment and therefore failed that sole purpose test that I just outlined. The government announced back in July last year that it did not support those conclusions of the Cooper review but said MAIN COMMITTEE",256,Statements On Indulgence
212,Mr Tony Smith (Casey) (17:52,"The coalition will not be opposing the Tax Lawsthat it would tighten the requirements around personal use assets rather than take up the recommendation to prohibit them. That is what this schedule seeks to do-to provide the government with the power of regulation to impose rules relating to investment of personal use assets by self-managed superannuation funds. The Assistant Treasurer, the member for Maribyrnong, outlined in his second reading speech back on 24 March the government's intentions in this regard when he said that the amendments would allow regulations to make rules relating to how self-managed superannuation fund trustees make, hold and realise investments in collectables and personal use assets. He said that the purpose of the rules would be to ensure that these investments are made for retirement income purposes and not for current day benefit. He further advised that the content of those regulations is being developed in consultation with the industry. We believe that this reflects a sensible balance. We understand that it is supported by the SelfManaged Super Fund Professionals Association of Australia. The third schedule deals with tax file numbers with respect to locating superannuation accounts in order to facilitate consolidation of those accounts. It allows super fund trustees and retirement savings account holders to use tax file numbers to locate accounts and facilitate consolidation of multiple accounts. At the present point in time, there are some restrictions on the ways that super funds can use tax file numbers. In particular, they are not permitted to use tax file numbers to locate accounts for the purposes of the very consolidation that this schedule deals with. This will not replace account or membership numbers, but will simply remove the requirement that super funds use other methods for searching for multiple funds before using tax file numbers. Apparently, individuals can still choose not to give their tax file number. There are not changes to the consequences for failing to do so. We agree on this side of the House that it is important to maximise individual retirement savings and for small accounts to be consolidated as easily and as quickly as possible. The fourth schedule deals with the goods and services tax and specifically the issue of the determination of Australian taxes, fees and charges with respect to the goods and services tax. Currently, the federal Treasurer determines by legislative instrument those Australian taxes, fees and charges that are not regarded as consideration for a taxable supply and therefore not subject to GST. That determination is an administrative process involving the Ministerial Council for Federal Financial Relations and the formal agreement of state and territory treasurers. The instrument is updated twice yearly and over the now more than 10 years of the operation of the goods and services tax it has grown, I am advised, to over 600 pages. The government's view is that this is becoming a significant administrative burden on all levels of government. The amendment means that the default position will be that Australian taxes, fees and charges are not subject to GST and therefore will not need to be listed. Regulation may be made to treat the payment of an Australian tax, fee or charge as consideration for supply and therefore as subject to the goods and services tax. On the subject of goods and services tax, my friend opposite would think it remiss of me not to remind the House that I always welcome in tax law amendment bills schedules that consolidate and protect the goods and services tax which this side of the House fought so hard to implement and those opposite fought so hard to prevent coming into existence. Now that they are in government, perhaps they realise the errors of their ways, and it is good to see them preserving and protecting the goods and services tax which their former leader and former Prime Minister said on the day of MAIN COMMITTEE its introduction would be marked down 100 years from now as 'a day of fundamental injustice'. I had been unfair in the past that no-one would remember Fundamental Injustice Day declared by the member for Griffith back in 1999, when the legislation for the goods and services tax passed through the House. I think in the years from now he will remember Fundamental Injustice Day, but it will not be the day that the goods and services tax passed through the House; it will be 24 June 2010. Schedule 5, the final schedule, as is often the case with these tax law amendment bills, simply makes a range of corrections, additions and the sorts of changes and improvements you would expect to see in taxation law. We do not oppose this bill, and I commend it to the House. opposition talking about their past record as the highest taxing government in Australia's history, and it is great that the member for Casey took the opportunity to remind us again. He should not be so modest, though: it was not one year that they were the highest taxing government in history; they held the record for four years in a row. It is a terrific record, and we love the way you always come out to remind the Australian public. We love the way that you remind them that your government was the highest taxing government in Australia's history and it has been this government that has gone about reforming tax to make sure that ordinary Australians are not slugged to the extent that they were when those on the other side had the Treasury benches. I am not sure that I would necessarily be making the boast about being the highest taxing government in history, but that is something the member for Casey obviously likes to remind us about on many occasions-and I encourage him to continue to remind us about the former government's record in relation to tax! Ms Owens: My pensioners remind me. reminded by our constituents, particularly those on fixed incomes or those on pensions, of the high-taxing history of the former government. I rise to support the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 2) Bill 2011. It has a number of schedules, and I will go through each of those schedules to look at what they are actually proposing. The first schedule is about deductible gift recipients. Under the current law taxpayers can claim income tax deductions for certain gifts to organisations with DGR status. Division 30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 sets out the requirements for organisations to be granted DGR status. Organisations must either fit one of the general categories of DGR or be specifically listed under these provisions. This schedule lists the Charlie Perkins Trust for Children and Students and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation. It also changes the name of one deductible gift recipient from Guides Australia Inc. to Girl Guides Australia. The Charlie Perkins Trust was established in late 2002 in memory of the late Dr Charles Perkins AO. The trust's aim is to advance the education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders through the provision of scholarships to Indigenous persons for study at overseas institutions such as Oxford and Cambridge University. The Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation was established in 1990 and works to advance the education and life MAIN COMMITTEE",257,Bills

214,Mr Craig Thomson,"As the member for Parramatta points out, we are constantlyopportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and provide additional assistance, such as assisting with the cost of relocating families and partners, to female Indigenous scholars undertaking programs overseas. Listing the Charlie Perkins Trust for Children and Students and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation means that the organisations will be in a significantly better position to attract private and corporate donors, and to raise funds for their ongoing work supporting Indigenous Australians to undertake higher education at prestigious overseas universities such as Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard. Schedule2 is in relation to self-managed superannuation fund investments in collectables and personal use assets. This measure will allow implementation of the government's election commitment to tighten legislative restrictions on self-managed superannuation funds, investments and collectables and personal use assets. The Super System Review recommended that SMSF investments in collectables and personal use assets should be prohibited because these assets lend themselves to personal enjoyment and therefore can involve current day benefits being derived by those using or accessing these assets. This recommendation was restricted to SMSF investments because of the closely held nature of SMSFs, where members have direct control over the investment of their retirement savings. In response to criticisms of the recommendation by SMSF and art industry representatives, the government rejected this recommendation in recognition that collectables can be legitimate investments for some SMSF trustees. However, the government also announced that it would tighten the legislative standards applying to SMSF investment in collectables and personal use assets to ensure that such investments do not give rise to current day benefits for SMSF trustees. The legislative standards that will apply to SMSF investment in collectables and personal use assets are being developed in consultation with the industry, and will be set out in regulations. These measures will enable those regulations to be made. This measure also removes a reference to the provision that was repealed on 24 September 2007. These amendments will allow implementation of the government's election promise to tighten legislative restrictions on self-managed superannuation fund investments in collectables and personal use assets to ensure that they do not give rise to current day benefits. It will give authority for regulations to make rules in relation to how these investments are made, held and realised. It will also give the regulations authority to impose a penalty of not more than 10 penalty units for contraventions of the regulations, and to provide for the transitional period of existing investments held prior to 1 July 2011. The regulations being developed in consultation with industry will be released for public consultation prior to being finalised. These amendments, as I have also said, remove reference to a provision that was repealed on 24 September 2007. Schedule3 relates to superannuation tax file number amendments. Schedule3 makes a number of amendments which will improve the operation of the superannuation industry. It allows superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings account providers to use tax file numbers to locate members' accounts without first having to use other methods of identification, and will facilitate account consolidation. The new law will allow superannuation fund trustees and RSA providers to use tax file numbers to locate a member's account details. However, the law will not allow the fund to use tax file numbers to replace their existing account numbers. The aim of the law is to remove the impediment for funds to use other search methods before tax file numbers are used. It will not replace existing account MAIN COMMITTEE identification methods, such as account or membership numbers. This ensures that the amendment operates in accordance with the National Privacy Principle 7: that tax file numbers should not become a national identifier. The amendments will also allow superannuation fund trustees and RSA providers to use tax file numbers to facilitate the consolidation of multi-accounts held by the same person in the same superannuation fund and across multiple superannuation funds, provided the requirements of the regulations are met. These amendments will improve the administrative efficiency of the superannuation industry, and make it easier for superannuation fund trustees and retirement saving account providers to locate member accounts and to facilitate account consolidation. These amendments will be subject to appropriate privacy safeguards. In keeping with the current guidelines governing the use of tax file numbers, it will remain voluntary for individuals to provide their tax file number to their superannuation fund or to their RSA provider. The measure is part of the government's package of stronger super reforms, which were announced on 16 December 2010. Allowing for the greater use of tax file numbers is the first of a number of initiatives from the package that will improve the administrative efficiency of the superannuation industry. Regulations will be enacted to support the use of tax file numbers and to facilitate the account consolidation process. This will include requirements for member consent and other procedures and processes that superannuation fund trustees and RSA providers must follow before consolidating accounts. These regulations will, again, be developed in consultation with the industry. Schedule4 exempts Australian taxes, fees and charges from the goods and services tax. Currently, Australian taxes, fees and charges are exempt from GST by being listed in a determination made by the Treasurer under division 81 of the GST act and agreed to by the states and territories. The determination has grown to over 680 pages, and its compilation is a cumbersome and time-consuming process. The schedule will repeal and replace division 81 of the GST act to allow entities to self-assess the GST treatment of a payment of an Australian tax or an Australian fee or charge in accordance with certain principles. Under these amendments, government entities will no longer need to have an Australian tax or certain categories of Australian fees or charges listed on the determination in order for those taxes, fees or charges not to be subject to GST. The amendments will amend the GST law to replace the current mechanism for exempting Australian taxes, fees and charges with a legislative exemption with effect from 1 July 2011. Generally, the measure will provide the same outcome as the current mechanism but in a more efficient manner. This measure will provide increased certainty to taxpayers and government agencies in relation to the GST treatment of new taxes, fees and charges, as the tax treatment is not dependent on the item being listed in the determination. A legislative exemption will provide a more effective and transparent approach to exempting Australian taxes, fees and charges from the GST compared to the current exemption mechanism. Schedule5 relates to the 12-month export period for the GST-free supply of boats. The legislation provides that the supply of a new recreational boat will be GST free if the boat is exported from Australia within 12 months of delivery or certain other events in the case of payment by instalment. This is subject to certain conditions. There are two main sets of conditions: conditions relating to the nature of the boat-the boat must be a new recreational boat-and the boat must not be used in any form of disqualifying activity, with certain exemptions. Under the conditions for a new recreational boat, essentially the boat must be MAIN COMMITTEE constructed in Australia; not be a substantially reconstructed boat; not used, sold or leased since completion, except in connection with the supply or acquisition of the boat as trading stock, or in connection with the particular supply or acquisition by the purchaser under consideration; be principally designed or fitted out for recreational purposes and not be a commercial boat. The first two conditions essentially ensure the boat is a new boat; the last two conditions ensure the boat is a recreational type boat. Under the disqualifying use conditions, the boat cannot be used as security for a loan except a loan to buy the boat itself. It cannot be used to carry on an enterprise in Australia. It cannot be used to carry on an enterprise outside Australia, except for private or domestic purposes or for a private recreational pursuit or hobby. The former exemption may embrace the latter exemption, which has been added out of caution. Essentially, an overseas business may buy a new recreational boat in Australia and allow its employees to sail around Australia in the boat, or live in it while it is moored somewhere for 12 months and for consideration except where the employee of an overseas business is allowed to sail or live on the boat as above, or the boat is used to compete in a race or sporting event. Essentially, these conditions are designed to use the boat for commercial purposes or financial gain while in Australia. The actual supply of the boat by the supplier to the purchaser relates to the carrying on of an enterprise, but is not a disqualifying activity. The commissioner has the discretion to extend the 12-month export period as he does under the existing 60-day export period for a GST-free supply. An exemption from disqualifying use has been provided to the use of the boat in a private capacity by the purchaser to participate in a racing or sporting event. This is in recognition that Australia is home to world-class sporting events including boats, such as yacht races and waterski events, and that participation in such events with a new boat built for Australian conditions could encourage some purchasers-in particular, foreign purchasers-to buy a new boat in Australia. The measure was not implemented via a refund system, as proposed by several submissions, for administrative and legal reasons. A refund system would relieve the supplier of any further GST obligations after he paid the GST to the government. However, a mechanism was not available within existing resources to pay refunds of this nature. Further, these submissions suggested that a control permit be deemed to have been granted to the purchaser immediately after the boat was purchased and the supplier forwarded the GST. This would have been a necessary component for the use of a refund system to implement the measure. However, to grant and control permits in this way would have required more complex legislative changes than in this bill, and this would have delayed considerably legislation to implement the measure. Schedule6 is in relation to other amendments. Schedule6 makes various other amendments to the taxation laws. The amendments seek to ensure that taxation operates as intended by correcting technical or drafting defects. It is essentially a technical schedule. While this may not be the most exciting piece of legislation, it is nonetheless an important piece of legislation. It is part of this government's ongoing reform in relation to taxation generally. It is part of making sure that business in Australia is simpler and more streamlined. For those reasons it is important that this legislation be supported. I commend the bill to the House. MAIN COMMITTEE Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (18:15): I am very pleased to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 2) Bill 2011. It is very satisfying to speak on bills such as this one because they reinforce some very responsive and progressive reforms that this government is pursuing. I thank the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation for his commitment to creating a better future for all Australians. This bill demonstrates the commitment of the government to fulfilling its election promise of increasing the level of education for Indigenous Australians. This bill also takes steps towards fulfilling the government's election commitment to the creation of a stronger and fairer superannuation industry. Both measures are an investment in the future, the former by assisting Indigenous Australians to achieve educational equality and the latter by ensuring the provision of a comfortable retirement for all Australians, including many in my electorate of Greenway. This bill does a number of important things and I would like to focus on three of them. The bill grants deductible gift recipient, or DGR, status to two educational trusts designed to support Indigenous education. It enables the regulation of investments by trustees of selfmanaged superannuation funds to ensure that there is no misuse of superannuation assets and it allows the use of tax file numbers by trustees of superannuation funds and retirement savings account providers to locate and consolidate member accounts. These important measures will result in a better future for all Australians by increasing the level of Indigenous education and by providing a comfortable retirement for working Australians. Schedule1 of the bill adds two organisations to the list of DGR recipients. These two organisations are the Charlie Perkins Trust, for children and students, and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation. The Charlie Perkins Trust was established in 2002 in memory of the late Dr Charlie Perkins AO. Dr Perkins was an inspiration to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians alike. In a life full of achievements, Dr Perkins was responsible for the organisation of the famous Freedom Ride, which exposed the discrimination suffered by Indigenous Australians, in 1965. He was the first Indigenous person to graduate from university, in 1966, and he was appointed to a number of influential roles, such as Commissioner of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, before being awarded the Order of Australia in 1987. The Charlie Perkins Trust seeks to continue the inspiring work of Dr Perkins by providing for the advancement and education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The trust provides scholarships for overseas study at institutions such as Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard, which provide Indigenous students with the opportunity to access their unlimited potential and which will undoubtedly pay dividends to Australia in the future. The second organisation is the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation, which was established in 1990. Dr Sykes was another inspirational Australian whose legacy will surely be long. Dr Sykes was a poet and author who was heavily involved in the Aboriginal land rights movement and who, among other roles, was the Executive Secretary of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in 1972. Among her many achievements, Dr Sykes was the first Indigenous Australian to attend an American university, receiving a PhD from Harvard. She was later awarded the Australian Human Rights Medal, in 1994, in recognition of her tireless campaigning for Aboriginal rights. The Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation also MAIN COMMITTEE aims to advance the education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and specifically provides additional assistance to female Indigenous scholars undertaking programs overseas, such as assisting with relocation costs for partners or family. By being specifically listed as DGRs, the Charlie Perkins Trust and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation will be in a significantly better position to attract private and corporate donors. The increased donations will allow these great organisations to help even more Indigenous Australians to reach their potential. I am very proud to support these measures which will provide such a tangible benefit to Indigenous Australians and the future of our country. It is a strong demonstration of the commitment of this government to the advancement of the education of Indigenous Australians. It is very important for my electorate of Greenway as the Blacktown local government area is home to the largest Indigenous population in New South Wales, something which is not very well known. Another feature of the bill I would like to comment on is being implemented as part of the government's election commitment to a fairer, stronger and simpler superannuation system. With this measure the government lays the foundation to regulate SMSF investment in collectables and personal use assets. SMSFs account for 99 per cent of all superannuation funds in Australia, numbering approximately 430,000. They hold over 30 per cent of all superannuation assets and, in recent years, they have enjoyed an annualised growth rate of 20 per cent. These statistics are very real and they can be found in APRA's Annual Superannuation Bulletin, published on 19 January this year. As a popular vehicle for superannuation management, which forms such a significant portion of the superannuation industry, it is vital that SMSFs maintain a high standard of governance. Indeed, one of the key messages from the Cooper review and the government's Stronger Super response relates to the importance of these high levels of governance amongst SMSFs. The bill implements measures which will ensure that SMSF trustees do not derive any current day benefits from investments in collectables and personal use assets. These new measures will ensure that SMSF assets cannot be misused by an SMSF trustee, for example, by 'collecting' and then driving high-end sports cars or 'investing' in expensive artwork which is then displayed in the trustee's home. The government recognises that investment in collectables and personal use assets can be a legitimate investment for some SMSF trustees. Accordingly, the measures implemented by this bill do not call for a blanket prohibition on SMSF investment in collectables and personal use assets. The government is certainly aware that to completely prohibit such investments would unreasonably prejudice certain industries, such as the significant art industry in this country. Instead, in fulfilment of the government's election promise, the measures allow the investment in collectables and personal use assets to continue, but remove the ability of the SMSF trustee to derive any current day benefit from such investment. The bill does this by allowing the creation of specific regulations regarding collectables and personal use assets with which SMSF trustees will need to comply. The regulations can relate to the making, holding or realising of such investments, and may prescribe penalties for non-compliance. These new measures will ensure that, as the number of SMSFs grows, their standard of governance will remain high. In this way the government is fulfilling its election commitment to create a fairer, stronger and simpler superannuation system for the future. MAIN COMMITTEE The third measure under this bill I would like to discuss fulfils another election promise of this government. Under schedule 3 of the bill, the government proposes to amend legislation and grant to superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings account providers the ability to use the TFNs of members to locate and consolidate the superannuation contributions of those members. This initiative is also consistent with the government's commitment to the creation of this fairer, stronger and simpler superannuation system. This is an extremely important item. There is currently some $18.8 billion in lost superannuation in some 5.8 million lost superannuation accounts. While lost superannuation is still held on trust by the trustee of an eligible rollover fund, or in some cases the trustee of a superannuation fund, the lost super moneys are not being managed at the direction of the member for whose benefit they are held. It is vital that every Australian is able to enjoy a secure, comfortable retirement. Ensuring every working Australian is in full control of their superannuation is critical to achieving this outcome. An efficient way of tracking down lost superannuation is by using the TFN of a fund member. However, while many account holders supply their TFNs to superannuation funds, it is actually against the law for trustees to use a TFN as the primary search method for lost accounts. This is a significant impediment to efficient administration of the superannuation industry. This new initiative will allow a trustee to locate and consolidate lost accounts using the TFNs of superannuation fund members without first needing to exhaust all other avenues. This will improve the administrative efficiency of the superannuation industry, which in turn will result in better returns to members. It is also important to note that privacy safeguards will not be compromised by this initiative. It will remain voluntary for individuals to provide their TFN to their superannuation fund or retirement savings account provider, and TFNs will not replace account numbers as primary identifiers. These amendments are consistent with the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988, the National Privacy Principles contained in that act as well as the TFN Guidelines. To ensure that the account consolidation process is carried out in the most efficient way, regulations will again be developed in consultation with industry. Among other requirements, member consent will be required for the consolidation of accounts, and processes and procedures will be created which superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings providers must follow before beginning the consolidation process. There are several benefits associated with this bill which I have sought to highlight. With the passage of this bill it is evident that many Australians will achieve a tangible benefit from these measures to be implemented. These actions are also a genuine reminder of this government's commitment to policy delivery and fulfilling its vision for the future of Australia. It is a great example of the Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, and the people on this side more generally, listening to the needs of our constituents and responding to important policy issues. The bill delivers on multiple election promises that will undoubtedly have a very positive impact on sectors such as Indigenous communities throughout Australia and will assist in addressing some of the very real challenges facing the superannuation industry now and in the future. I commend the bill. Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (18:26): I take the opportunity to speak briefly to schedules 1 to 4 and 6, which have been covered quite extensively by the member for Casey and my MAIN COMMITTEE colleagues the member for Dobell and the member for Greenway. I will just touch on those briefly; then I want to go to schedule 5 in particular. Schedule 1, as has been indicated, has added two additional organisations to the list of deductible death recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997-that is, the Charlie Perkins Trust for Children and Students and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation fund. As was indicated by the member for Greenway, both organisations are established in the names of significant and important Indigenous Australians with a very worthwhile cause at the heart of their activities, and I think this is something that will be well supported across all members of the House. Schedule2 amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, and that is to permit the regulation to impose rules on self-managed superannuation fund trustees that make, hold or realise investments involving collectibles and personal-use assets. As indicated, the intention was to ensure the appropriate use of assets within those trust funds and was a commitment in the election campaign. I would also commend that. I understand from the contribution of the member for Casey that it is also supported on the other side. Schedule3 amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act and the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 to allow the use of tax file numbers for a very specific purpose in order to locate member accounts without having to use other methods that may be less accurate and appropriate, but within a very strict and specific purpose in order not to breach the privacy considerations that need to be used when utilising tax file numbers. Schedule4 amends GST law to replace the current mechanism for ensuring Australian taxes, fees and charges are not subject to GST, with a legislative exemption which allows for the making of regulations to treat an Australian tax or an Australian fee or charge in a particular way. The amendments allow the GST treatment of an Australian tax, fee or charge to be determined against legislative principles, providing the same outcome as the current mechanism but in a more efficient manner. SoI would support all of those first four schedules. Schedule6 is a range of miscellaneous amendments which I would also support. I particularly want to take the opportunity to speak to schedule 5 because it is something that I have worked on for quite a few years-indeed, since we were in opposition-in conjunction with a local business called Seawind Catamarans. Seawind had approached me during the period in which their sector of the industry was campaigning around these reforms in order to support their international competitiveness. I am a great supporter, as many of my colleagues are, of the manufacturing sector of this country, and this is an important local manufacturing business. The dilemma that they faced was that the way the GST rules operated meant that people who purchased one of their catamarans had to export it within 60 days under the GST application. That creates a problem in a number of areas. Often these people are buying their first large boat, and they need to be taught how to navigate it properly. Often that is best done by sailing up and down the coast. The other advantage of that for us as a nation, of course, is not only the selling of a locally manufactured boat but also the fact that they then visit ports up and down our coastal areas, spending tourist dollars and participating in our tourist based areas as well. The concern was that we needed to have a way to extend the amount of time in which they could utilise a boat for a private purpose in Australia beyond the standard 60 days. This particular schedule extends that to 12 months, but it does put very appropriate conditions and controls around that to ensure that the intention is achieved in making our manufacturing MAIN COMMITTEE sector in the boatbuilding area competitive. Certainly since I first started working with them on this particular amendment, I was conscious that for something like Seawind Catamarans we have seen the global financial crisis and the very high Australian dollar and, like many in the sector, these things are putting real pressure on this local industry. They have a building facility in my electorate, which the Treasurer has visited, in fact, and there is also a second site in Nowra. They employ a significant number of people, and we are, obviously, very keen to see that business continue in our region. To be able to add a small bit to making them internationally competitive through this particular amendment is particularly important. I think the schedule is well worth supporting, and I particularly commend the work that has been done to put it together in a way that means it does achieve what it is intended to achieve. The member for Dobell went through all the detail of that, so I will not repeat that, but I do welcome that particular schedule on behalf of our local industry. I commend all six schedules in this bill to the House. and Superannuation) (18:32): Firstly, I would like to thank the members who have contributed to this debate: the members for Dobell, Greenway, Cunningham and, indeed, Casey. Schedule1 amends the deductible gift recipient-DGR-provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for gifts to organisations that are DGRs. This schedule adds two new organisations to the act: the Charlie Perkins Trust and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation. It also recognises the name change of Guides Australia Incorporated to Girl Guides Australia. Making these organisations deductible gift recipients will assist them in attracting public support for their activities. Schedule2 allows regulations to make rules relating to how self-managed superannuation fund-SMSF-trustees make, hold and realise investments in collectables and personal use assets. Collectables can be a legitimate investment for some SMSF trustees. However, there is a risk that SMSF trustees may gain current day benefit from these investments due to the nature of the assets. These amendments allow regulations to be made that will ensure SMSF investments in collectables and personal use assets are made for retirement income purposes, rather than current day benefit. The schedule also removes a reference to a provision that was repealed in 2007. Schedule3 will improve the administrative processes of superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings account providers by removing the requirement for funds to use other search methods before tax file numbers are used. It will also allow superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings account providers to use tax file numbers to facilitate the consolidation of multiple superannuation accounts held by the same person, provided the conditions in the regulations are met. The accompanying regulations will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to support the use of tax file numbers, facilitating the account consolidation process and to protect the privacy of members. Schedule4 will amend the GST law to replace the current mechanism for exempting Australian taxes, fees and charges with a legislative exemption with effect from 1 July 2011. The GST law currently specifies that Australian taxes, fees and charges are exempt from GST if they are included in a determination of the Treasurer. This measure will allow the GST treatment of an Australian tax, fee or charge to be determined against legislative principles. MAIN COMMITTEE",259,Bills
215,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial ServicesGenerally this measure will provide the same outcome as the current mechanism, but in a more efficient manner. This measure will provide increased certainty to taxpayers and government agencies in relation to the GST treatment of new taxes, fees and charges, as the tax treatment is not dependent on the item being listed in the determination. A legislative exemption will provide a more effective and transparent approach to exempting Australian taxes, fees and charges from the GST compared to the current exemption mechanism. Finally, schedule 5 to this bill covers other amendments to tax laws. These amendments are part of the government's commitment to the care and maintenance of the tax law, and include some legislative issues raised by the public through the tax issues entry system. This bill deserves the support of the parliament. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. opposite-to the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011. This bill has two schedules, dealing with separate issues. It amends the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 to modify and streamline the structure of that act. The act will, as a consequence of this bill, be shortened. It will omit almost all of the schedules to the act and instead incorporate treaties by reference to other accessible resources, principally the Australian Treaty Series online database of treaties. This was outlined with great clarity by the Assistant Treasurer in his second reading speech on 23 March 2007, and I am quite happy to point that out. It was outlined by the Assistant Treasurer with great clarity, and we recognise him for that on the basis that it happens ever so rarely. This schedule will substantially reduce the size of the act and is a sensible housekeeping measure. Schedule2 of the bill amends the same act to give force of law in Australia to new taxation arrangements with Aruba, Chile, the Cook Islands, Guernsey, Malaysia, Samoa and Turkey. It does so in those cases to cover the allocation of taxing rights and transfer pricing adjustments. With respect to Chile, Malaysia and Turkey, the agreements deal with different issues; they will cover the avoidance of double taxation and tax evasion. Legislation in this area is a regular feature. Australia is participating in these types of agreements all the time for the betterment of the tax system. This legislation like so many others is representative of Australia's commitment to international agreements to avoid double taxation, to codify tax allocations and to combat international tax avoidance. It has the support of the coalition. Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (18:39): I rise to discuss some of the issues arising from the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011. While seemingly innocuous and straightforward, the bill touches on some broader issues regarding taxation in Australia, and I MAIN COMMITTEE",267,Bills
216,Mr Tony Smith (Casey) (18:36,"I rise to speak ever so briefly-I alert thosewould like to expand on these issues. The bill broadly solidifies the agreement between Australia and a number of other nations to avoid double taxation. This is a step in the right direction. After all, lower tax is always the preferred scenario. I encourage this government to minimise taxation where at all possible. The bill is also designed to crack down on tax evasion with respect to taxes on income, the aim being to ensure that the government continues to collect income tax earned overseas at all costs. Reform elicited by this bill will go some small way to ensuring that people like Mr Parishan, in my electorate of Tangney, are no longer unfairly targeted through double taxation-but, sadly, only in a handful of nations. Mr Parishan is on the verge of selling his family home in order to pay a $250,000 tax bill. This retrospective tax bill is on income earned during two of the five years he worked in both Qatar and Dubai as a structural engineer. While Mr Parishan paid various duty, tariff, import and export taxes, the fact that his income was not directly taxed in the United Arab Emirates nations means that Australia's Treasury is within its right to effectively take my constituent to the cleaners. While income earned by Mr Parishan in Dubai and Qatar is not subject to an income tax, other receipts including money, duty, tariff, import and export taxes-paid in addition to the cost of living burden in these countries, must surely, in any just taxation assessment, be taken into consideration when making any rulings on whether income has been fairly taxed overseas. While a selective focus by the Australian Treasury on income tax is unfair, it is also a lost opportunity for our federal government coffers. Tax receipts from other streams of income earned overseas are largely ignored or only minimally taxed. A focus on the single income tax model narrows the federal government's receipts and pressure to meet mounting deficits forces drastic and overzealous actions when chasing taxes the government believes they are owed. This can only be to the detriment of our citizens. There is not an agreement between Australia and either Qatar or Dubai for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to withholding tax, tax on income or in respect of administrative provisions. At present, the general proposition under Australian law is that treaties which Australia has joined are not directly and automatically incorporated into Australian law. While amendments contained in this bill will give Australia's tax treaties the force of law through streamlined arrangements, the fact that we are not reciprocal signatories with countries of significant Australian expatriate investment and development is of most concern. Why are our citizens who work in countries with no income tax, but with other excises and tariffs, attacked by the Australian Taxation Office? Let us look at whether it is even necessary to have an income tax at current indexation levels-or indeed an income tax at all. Should we look at a greater focus on consumption taxes and the like to improve efficiencies and drive down bureaucratic waste? I believe that income tax and the money it generates for the government is the facilitator of government growth and waste, including those moneys earned overseas. The Treasury will tell us that an income tax is imperative. After all, it addresses what would inevitably be a shrinking revenue base. However, this is what Treasury is tasked to do. It is their job to ensure that government spending can be met by reciprocal taxation receipts. This relationship is fundamentally flawed. It places the onus on the government of the day to constantly keep a check on its budget growth. This trust that we have placed in the federal government to selfregulate its spending has been betrayed, with both parties massively increasing the size of the MAIN COMMITTEE federal government over successive governments. Real issues arise from this growth in the federal government, most importantly the issues of economic and social freedoms. The federal government has expanded far beyond its proper constitutional limits, regulating virtually every aspect of our lives. There is no real argument about whether we live in an over-regulated society; the fact is readily accepted and backed up by numerous studies. Big government and numerous departments and bureaucracies take billions of dollars out of the legitimate private economy and penalise productive behaviour, with most Australians giving a large chunk of their income and other monies to the federal government. Philosophically this is taking money directly from some Australians to give to others, with inefficiencies resulting from bureaucratic process. The ridiculous complexity of our tax laws makes tax time a nightmare for both individuals and businesses. These factors are made worse by our electoral cycle. Come election time Australians are given the false choice between bigger and bigger government; between which party can promise and redistribute wealth to a greater extent while maintaining a facade of fiscal responsibility. These are two choices from the same side of the coin. The Australian people need to grasp the concept that the more government spends, the more freedom they lose-both personal and economic. All things considered, Australians should be dismayed by the income tax mess and the tragic loss of liberty and freedom which has ensued. Yes, reductions in income taxation would force the federal government to be massively reduced, but that is a good thing. It would force a debate on spending levels. Again this is a good thing, but we ought not to be debating whether we can save a million here or a million there; we should be debating whether whole departments, agencies, and programs funded by the budget should exist at all. Little cuts here and there do not address the big picture problem. To get to this small government place we need to get away from the idea that big government makes our lives better, that government can do anything other than redistribute and then waste economic resources from the productive private sector and citizenry. Examples of government overreach are everywhere. The hot button issue at the moment is cost of living pressures. It is a problem government cannot make better, but can make infinitely worse by meddling in the affairs of private citizens. Every attempt at providing handouts and stimulus merely inflates the economy and makes life harder for everyone. So why not try the opposite; why not less government, less tax and reduced expenditure? If the average Australian was to look at how much they pay in tax and then cut that number in half, this would go a long way to solving the cost of living pressures and inflation in the economy. The answer is less, not more. Perhaps US Congressman Ron Paul said it best: I believe income taxes are responsible for the transformation of the federal government from one of limited powers into a vast leviathan whose tentacles reach into almost every aspect of American life. In our case, all that needs to change in that statement is to substitute 'Australian' for 'American'. Money, duty, tariffs and import and export taxes must also be considered when making judgment on taxation owed to the government to ensure double taxation does not occur even under amendments contained in this bill. Most tax discussions are based around simplification for taxpayers and ensuring a solid revenue base for the government. But we also need to discuss how much of our private citizens' money should be entrusted to a government and for what purposes. This inevitably will require a review of the way taxes are MAIN COMMITTEE collected. While amendments contained in this bill will give Australia's tax treaties the force of law through streamlined arrangements, a discussion of the fact that Australia is not a reciprocal signatory with countries of significant Australian expatriate investment and development is an issue that must be placed on the table. Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011. I expected my speech to be short, somewhat lukewarm and even turgid and it probably will be, but I cannot resist responding to the member for Tangney. They are a broad church, those Western Australian Liberals, aren't they? The member for Tangney talked about a false choice; the only false choice we have are those opposite who claim that they are supporters of the market, free enterprise and small government. But John Howard never found a rort for the middle class that he did not want to fund. He funded them in every chance he got. They were the architects of big government. In the mid-2000s the proportion of tax to GDP under the Howard coalition government was way above this government. In fact, one of the first things we did was reduce the size of government compared to tax revenue and GDP. It is extraordinary that the member for Tangney could come in here and say that. I thought he might be starting to go on as an apostle of Reaganomics, but he is even quoting Ron Paul. Not even mainstream Republicans would quote Ron Paul as someone in the mainstream of conservative thought. The member for Tangney would have us believe that we should get rid of taxation. The income taxation system, as cumbersome and as difficult as it is-and I studied the Income Tax Assessment Act when I was at law school all those years ago; you had to virtually weigh it because it was so heavy, you could not read it-it is the method by which we civilise this country. It is the way in which we provide for education, health, roads, infrastructure and community grants. It is the way we support the poor, the weak, the oppressed, the disadvantaged and the disabled. We do it through the Income Tax Assessment Act and the taxation system. In the dog-eat-dog world of the member for Tangney and those opposite they would not even provide for these people. They do not want the government to civilise. I actually do believe the member for Tangney, having listened to his speech on this bill, is a devotee of Margaret Thatcher. He said there was no such thing as society, only families and individuals. There is a community, there is a society and the Income Tax Assessment Act helps us to provide for health and hospital funding in our electorates and schools, roads and the kinds of things that our communities expect and, I think, our nation expects as well. What we do with the Income Tax Assessment Act and taxation income helps fund our prosperity and economic development because the market cannot provide for everything. Those caucus colleagues of yours in the National Party, those Queensland Nationals, will tell you how important it is to fund those areas that the market cannot provide for. I reckon if he goes into the National Party caucus room any time when parliament sits in May with that sort of speech they would probably chuck him out. Having heard his speech, there is probably not a party in parliament that the member for Tangney feels comfortable in. We know that those opposite tried to get rid of him a couple of times, but they just could not do it. I speak in support of this legislation and I will be turgid and brief now. It will come as no surprise to anyone that, like the Income Tax Assessment Act, the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 is a pretty cumbersome piece of legislation. The bill before the MAIN COMMITTEE",268,Bills
217,Mr Neumann (Blair) (18:49,"I speak in support of the International Tax Agreementschamber fulfils two important agendas. I think it modifies and streamlines the structure of the act and it provides a legal basis to combat tax avoidance and evasion in a number of different jurisdictions: Aruba, Chile, the Cook Islands, Malaysia, Guernsey and Samoa. The bill will simplify the presentation of the operative provisions of the act and incorporate the treaties that we have undertaken with these foreign entities by reference to accessible online resources. Schedule 2-and this bill, like a lot of bills, provides for schedules by which we pass the legislation-gives the force of law in Australia to new bilateral taxation agreements with Aruba, Chile, the Cook Islands, Guernsey, Malaysia, Samoa and Turkey. The Chilean and Turkish treaties reduce taxation barriers to bilateral trade and investment and that is a very good thing. These treaties will improve the integrity of the taxation system by providing a framework through which the Commissioner of Taxation can have cooperative bilateral arrangements with his counterparts to prevent taxation evasion in other jurisdictions. That is also a good thing, because the Department of Homeland Security in the US has said that the flow of offshore money between countries in a way that prevents proper taxation is a $16.2 trillion industry; they hide it in tax havens all over the place. This accountability, this idea of the commissioners speaking to one another, is a very important thing. The agreement with Malaysia will amend the current Australia-Malaysia tax treaty to update the exchange-of-information article in that treaty to the current international standards endorsed by the OECD, the G20 and the United Nations. Malaysia is a neighbour. It is growing in importance to Australia. Certainly on our side of politics we think that, when it comes to border protection, asylum seekers and refugees, Malaysia is not just an economic partner but a cooperative regional partner in the regional framework we have for dealing with these issues. The other agreements with Aruba, the Cook Islands, Guernsey and Samoa seek to eliminate double taxation on certain income derived by individuals such as government workers, students, business apprentices, pensioners and retirees. These four agreements also provide a mutually agreed procedure for the resolution of taxation disputes involving transfer pricing adjustments. This is another example of the federal Labor government's commitment to improving and streamlining the taxation system. It is not something you might take to the gym every morning but it is something that might assist the Australian public. With this bill it becomes even harder for those who seek to deny our nations a share of the prosperity of their companies and to avoid paying tax. We do not mind if people make the arrangements lawfully and legitimately but we do not want them engaged in tax evasion. That is a problem across not just our country but our region and the world. Taxation, as I said, contributes to the health, education, well-being and prosperity of the whole country, including the people in the electorate of Blair, in Ipswich and the Somerset region. This legislation is an example of our commitment to ensuring accountability in the national interest, and I commend the bill to the House. and Superannuation) (18:57): First of all, I would like to thank the members who participated in the debate on the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011.

This bill will give effect to both of these commitments by giving the force of law to new bilateral taxation agreements between Australia and Aruba, Chile, the Cook Islands, Guernsey, Malaysia, Samoa and Turkey. Each of these agreements will strengthen Australia's bilateral economic relationships with these jurisdictions and, directly or indirectly, will help to discourage taxpayers from seeking to use offshore arrangements to avoid Australian tax by increasing the probability of detection. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Main Committee adjourned at 18:59 MAIN COMMITTEE Official Development Assistance (Question No. 107) Mr Bandt asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 25 November 2010: How is the Government going to build on official development assistance policies covered by the current Water and Sanitation Initiative after its funding expires in June 2011, specifically: (a) what amount of funding will be allocated to water, sanitation and hygiene in the aid program in (i) 2011-12, (ii) 2012-13, and (iii) 2013-14; (b) how will water, sanitation and hygiene be integrated into the Government's priority programs of health and education; and (c) how many of the schools constructed with Australian official development assistance include the required number of child-friendly toilets for girls and boys, and safe drinking water supplies. Mr Rudd: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Future allocations of Australian Official Development Assistance, including for water, sanitation and hygiene, will be considered in the context of the 2011-12 Budget. (b) Australia's approach to development assistance in education emphasises that school infrastructure should meet basic standards, including separate sanitation facilities for girls and boys. This is integrated into the design process for AusAID programs. The inclusion of appropriate sanitation facilities in schools will contribute to achieving education targets and should decrease the incidence of diarrhoeal disease, which prevents children from attending school. Appropriate facilities also assist greater enrolment of girls in education. Water and sanitation programs are part of a broader approach to improve children's health, which also includes supporting vaccine initiatives and access to basic health care. (c) While AusAID does not collect statistics on the number of schools with child-friendly toilets and safe drinking water supplies constructed using Australian Official Development Assistance, toilets and water supplies are typically included in the construction projects. For example, in Kiribati, AusAID supported the construction of a specially designed toilet block which has made it safer for technical and vocational education and training students and teachers to attend school, including students with disabilities. Also in Kiribati, AusAID has commenced an education program which includes rehabilitating government schools to meet the National Infrastructure Standards and is working jointly with United Nations agencies to improve water and sanitation facilities on schools on the Outer Islands. In Nauru, all six infant and primary schools have been fully refurbished with improved water and sanitation facilities. In Laos Australia contributed to the construction of 125 primary schools with toilets and water supplies between 2007 and 2010. Additionally, Australia funded the construction of 258 latrines and 300 water supplies for primary schools in Laos through the Access to Basic Education program between 2006 and 2011. In Indonesia schools built with Australian support include separate toilet facilities for girls and boys. Since 2008 all schools built in Indonesia with Australian support have ramps and accessible toilets for children with disabilities, making more than 1,000 schools more accessible. The Government of Indonesia now requires all new schools to have disabled access, including toilets, as a result of Australia including disability access in Australia Indonesia Basic Education Program schools. Digital Television (Question No. 127) Mr Christensen asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 25 November 2010. (1) Is the Minister aware that entire rural communities like Hideaway and Dingo Beach in the Whitsundays and Guthalungra (just north-west of Bowen) are going to be left without easy access to digital television when the switchover happens in 2011. (2) What action is the Minister taking to remedy this inequity, specifically, would the Government consider funding the upgrade (to digital) of local blackspot transmitters in these areas (currently managed by local councils) so that residents can receive digital television at no extra cost to residents in city areas. (3) If no action will be taken to remedy this inequity, how does the Minister justify the fact that residents in these regional communities will have to pay extra for both set-top boxes and satellite transmitters in order to receive digital television, when everyone else will receive it for just the price of a set-top box. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) No communities will be left without easy access to digital television when digital switchover happens in regional Queensland in late 2011. Residents in areas without access to a broadcaster operated transmitter, such as Dingo Beach, Hideaway Bay and Guthalungra, will be able to receive the full range of 16 digital television services and a local news service by way of the new governmentfunded direct to home Viewer Access Satellite Television (VAST) service. (2) The government is not generally funding the upgrade of self help towers. The government is providing funding for the delivery of digital television to people throughout Australia without access to broadcaster-operated transmitters through the VAST service. There is no local black spot transmitter designed to serve the area in which Guthalungra lies however viewers here will be able to receive digital television via VAST. Hideaway Bay and Dingo Beach both rely for their analog television on a terrestrial retransmission of the remote broadcasters' Aurora satellite service. This means they currently only receive four television channels: ABC Queensland, SBS Queensland and the remote area commercial channels of Southern Cross Seven and Imparja Nine, with none of the local regional news services broadcast by the commercial broadcasters in the Queensland Central Coast and Whitsundays licence area. Under VAST, they will have access to their local news on WIN, SCM and 7 and receive the full range of 16 digital channels. This is the equivalent level of content as Australia's metropolitan centres and most regional areas. In addition to the significant improvement in their television content, VAST will also alleviate the financial burden on local communities such as Hideaway Bay and Dingo Beach in running and maintaining a local terrestrial self-help transmitter. Broadcasters are converting some self help facilities to digital. The choice of facilities to be converted is a matter for broadcasters. Communities will retain the option of converting their self-help facilities to digital themselves because they are not being converted by the broadcasters, rather than accessing the VAST service, but must make their own arrangements to assess and implement this option. (3) Residents in communities that currently receive their television services through self help facilities that are not being converted to digital by broadcasters, such as Dingo Beach and Hideaway Bay, will be eligible to receive assistance to convert to the VAST service under the government's Satellite Subsidy Scheme. Under the Satellite Subsidy Scheme, eligible households will pay a predetermined co-payment-which is expected to be between $200 and $350-directly to the installer. The co-payment will be fixed as part of the contract between the Government and the service providers, and households will be clearly advised of this co-payment in advance of the installations taking place. Contracts have not yet been entered into for installations in regional Queensland, so final co-payment amounts have not yet been determined. After this initial outlay, Dingo Beach and Hideaway Bay residents will face few if any further costs to receive the VAST service, and the Whitsunday Shire Council, which operates the Dingo Beach retransmission facility, will no longer have to bear the capital and ongoing costs associated with the retransmission of all commercial and national channels. Guthalungra is an area which has always had poor terrestrial television coverage because broadcasters have not established a local transmitter to serve the area. Some people in the area may already be receiving their television services through the existing Aurora direct to home satellite service. These people may convert to VAST now for the cost of the VAST set top box. Other viewers in the area will have to purchase a satellite dish and a VAST set top box to receive the VAST service. This is no different from the situation for viewers in metropolitan areas who have to go to the VAST service because they are unable to receive a terrestrial signal.

Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: In June 2010, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Act 2010 (the Digital Television Act) amended the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the BSA) to facilitate the delivery of commercial digital television services by satellite to viewers in areas of inadequate digital terrestrial reception. The services licensed under section 38C of the BSA are collectively known as the Viewer Access Satellite Television (VAST) service. To preserve the integrity of existing commercial television licence areas, access to the VAST satellite service is subject to conditional access arrangements. The Digital Television Act introduced policy objectives for a conditional access scheme for the VAST service. The policy objectives identify several categories of access to the VAST service as follows:  CategoryA – viewers in remote licence areas and all viewers in non-remote areas that currently receive free-to-air services under an out-of-area service authorisation;  CategoryB – areas in regional and metropolitan areas that are deemed to have inadequate reception of terrestrial commercial television broadcasting services; and  Category C-areas that are neither CategoryA nor Category B. Viewers in CategoryA can access the VAST service from its commencement. Viewers in CategoryB or CategoryC cannot be granted access to the VAST service until six months before switchover in their area. The purpose of these timeframes is to allow commercial terrestrial broadcasters time to rollout their planned digital terrestrial infrastructure before switchover. The commercial broadcasters have agreed to upgrade a number of analog self-help retransmission sites to digital and to rollout a number of gapfillers to improve the coverage of digital television. The commercial broadcasters will upgrade the selfhelp retransmission sites at Long Flat and Telegraph Point on the mid-North NSW Coast and rollout a gap-filler at Bonny Hills. The final list of sites to be converted by the broadcasters is subject to negotiation between the licensee of the site and the broadcasters, and will depend on detailed assessments of the commercial or technical viability of the sites. If, six months before switchover in a licence area, a viewer is still unable to receive adequate digital terrestrial reception, they will be eligible to apply to access the VAST service. This means that viewers on the mid-North Coast that reside in the Remote and Central Eastern Australia licence area are able to immediately apply to the scheme administrator to access the VAST service. Viewers on the mid-North Coast that reside in the Northern New South Wales licence area will be eligible to apply for VAST service six months before switchover in their licence area which is in the second half of 2012. Viewers are able to check their eligibility for the VAST service, by visiting the mySwitch website at: www.digitalready.gov.au/MySwitch.aspx. As the Mildura/Sunraysia licence area switched to digital-only television signals on 30 June 2010, residents in the Mildura/Sunraysia licence area who are unable to receive adequate reception of terrestrial digital commercial television services are eligible to apply to access the VAST service now. Similarly, viewers who cannot receive adequate digital terrestrial reception in the regional South Australia licence areas and the regional Victoria licence areas, which are due to switchover on 5 May 2011, are also eligible to apply to access the VAST service. Superclinics (Question No. 195) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 21 February 2011: (1) Without identifying any individual medical practices or any individual medical practitioner, how many Medicare provider numbers have been issued in total to the (a) eight GP Super Clinics which are operational, (b) remaining 28 GP Super Clinics from 2007-08 election commitments which are not yet operational, and (c) 28 GP Super Clinics which are 2010-11 commitments. (2) How many of the provider numbers in part (1) have been issued to medical practitioners who are recognised as general practitioners by Medicare Australia. (3) How many services have been billed to Medicare against the provider numbers in (a) part (1), and (b) part (2). Ms Roxon: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The GP Super Clinics Program does not collect this information. The Australian Government does not own or operate GP Super Clinics and recruitment and engagement of service providers is the responsibility of the owner/operator of each clinic. Provider number registration is therefore a matter for the owner/operator and the individual health professionals. (2) Refer to (1) above. (3) Refer to (1) above. Under the GP Super Clinics Program, self reported data is collected on patient presentations to GPs and allied health professionals. This data is not collected on the basis of Medicare/non-Medicare services. This reflects more completely the multidisciplinary nature of the services being provided in GP Super Clinics, some of which are not Medicare eligible services.

United States of America: Australian Trade Missions and Consulates (Question No. 203) Mr Crook asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 22 February 2011: In respect of trade missions and consulates in the United States of America (USA) during 2010-11: (a) how many staff in his department are located in (i) the USA, and (ii) Australia, but supporting his department's operations in the USA; (b) what staffing costs are associated with part (a)(i) and (ii); (c) how many staff from Australian Government departments other than his are supporting his department's operations in the USA; (d) how many consultants are engaged by his department in the USA, and at what cost; and (e) what is the total budgeted expenditure for his department's operations in the USA, and what sum has been spent to date. Mr Rudd: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) (i) 45 Australian-based DFAT employees and 112 locally-engaged employees (as at 31 January 2011). (ii) There are 10 departmental officers currently working in the United States Branch of Americas and Africa Division (AAD) (as at 31 January 2011).

Australian Public Service Implementation Network (Question No. 207) Mr Fletcher asked the Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity, in writing, on 24 February 2011: In respect of the Advisory Group on Reform of Australian Government Administration's report Ahead of the Game: Blueprint for the reform of Australian Government administration (March 2010, page 44), has the Policy Implementation Network been formed; if so, has it met to consider lessons learned from the Home Insulation Program, the Green Loans Program and the Building the Education Revolution program; if so, what was the outcome. Mr Gray: I am advised that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Planning for the formation of the APS Implementation Network is underway and is being progressed in conjunction with a broader capability development agenda. It is expected that the first meeting of the Network will be held in May 2011. Superclinics (Question No. 210) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 28 February 2011: For each of the 64 locations of the GP Super Clinics, (a) is it classified as a District of Workforce Shortage on her department's database, (b) what is the Medicare utilisation data, (c) is the Medicare utilisation (i) above average in comparison with the national average, (ii) below average in comparison with the national average, and (iii) at the same level as the national average. Ms Roxon: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Refer to Attachment A. Noting that the locations for the GP Super Clinics were determined against five different criteria: Poor access to health services; Poor health infrastructure; Where a GP Super Clinic could help take pressure off emergency departments; High levels of chronic disease and/or populations with high needs, such as large numbers of children or the elderly; and Areas currently experiencing, or anticipated to experience, rapid population growth. (b) This information is confidential under the secrecy provisions (Section 130) of the Health Insurance Act 1973 as it would provide activity and billing information for individual medical practices. (c) Refer to (b) above.

Ms Roxon: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Noting-Of the 64 GP Super Clinics, expenditure to date relates to the original 36 GP Super Clinics. The processes in place for the additional 28 GP Super Clinics were identified by the Minister in her media release of 28 October 2010. These processes are proceeding. The following figures reflect recurrent funding and relocation incentives at an aggregated level only as there are commercial-in-confidence and privacy protection considerations in releasing these figures on an individual clinic level. (a) and (b) As at the end of February 2011, a total of $127,316,804.55 (GST exclusive) GP Super Clinics grant funding had been provided (representing 70.1% of total funding available for the first tranche of 36 GP Super Clinics), including: (i) a total of $126,689,204.55 in funding for capital works; (ii) a total of $625,000 for recurrent funding; and (iii) a total of $2,600 for relocation incentives. Superclinics (Question No. 212) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 28 February 2011: Of the $280.2 M allocated to the 2007-08 GP Super Clinics Program, what sum has already been paid to the funding recipients. Ms Roxon: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The $280.2 M allocated to the GP Super Clinic Program assumed an amount for Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) flow ons. Therefore of the total, $181.7 M was specified for grant funding. Of this, approximately $127 M has been paid to funding recipients to date against milestones outlined in the relevant Funding Agreements. Superclinics (Question No. 214) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 10 February 2011: In total and at each location of the nine operational GP Super Clinics, how many (a) services have been delivered, (b) GP services have been delivered, (c) allied care services have been delivered, and what type of allied health care, and (d) specialist medical services have been delivered. Ms Roxon: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There are currently 10 operational GP Super Clinics. The Department of Health and Ageing provides self reported numbers of service presentations at an aggregated level only. Self reported services numbers for individual clinics are not made publicly available as: (i) there are commercial-in-confidence and privacy protection considerations around releasing data at the individual clinic level; and (ii) service numbers are not comparable (depending on when the Clinics commenced services, the size of the community, the number of service providers engaged etc) and could be open to misinterpretation. (a) As at the end of January 2011, the GP Super Clinics reported over 280,000 presentations at these clinics. This includes those clinics which have offered early services prior to officially opening. (b) Of the services at (a) above, over 196,000 were GP services. (c) Of the services at (a) above, approximately 84,000 were allied health services. The self reported data is aggregated at an overall allied health level and does not specify the types of allied health care. (d) The GP Super Clinics program is aimed at supporting integrated, multidisciplinary, patient centred, primary health care services. Medical specialist services are not classified as primary care and are therefore not specifically captured.

Mental Health (Question No. 225) Mr Christensen asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 2 March 2011: (1) What is the Government doing about the major shortcomings in the current mental health system in Mackay, reported in the ABC's program Four Corners on 9 August 2010. (2) Given the above issues, and Mackay's proactive Division of General Practice particularly in relation to mental health, why was Mackay not chosen to be part of the recent Mental Health Forum. (3) Why has there been no increase in the Medicare incentive payments under the Mental Health Nurse Incentive Program (MHNIP) since its inception by the previous Government almost five years ago. (4) Why are nurses working under the MHNIP still paid the same money as almost five years ago when in that time, there has been a number of increases in wages to almost every other sector of the community. (5) Why is mental health nursing no longer a recognised speciality area under the national registration scheme. Mr Butler: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Mental health is an important component of the Government's second term agenda. At the COAG meeting of 13 February 2011, COAG agreed to consider mental health at its next meeting. Work on future mental health reform options for discussion by COAG is currently underway. To assist in informing Commonwealth consideration of reform options, the Government is undertaking a broad stakeholder engagement strategy (including consulting with the National Advisory Council on Mental Health, establishing a Mental Health Expert Working Group, national forums with mental health consumers and carers, and receiving written comment and feedback). This will assist in informing the development of a cohesive strategy for mental health reform to provide a more effective and sustainable system over the long term for all Australians affected by mental illness. Under the Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) initiative the Department of Health and Ageing engages Divisions of General Practice to allow GPs to refer patients who have been diagnosed as having a common mental disorder such as depression or anxiety, of mild to moderate severity, to an allied health professional to provide short term focused psychological strategies services. Under its current funding agreement, Mackay Division of General Practice will receive $418,632.63 (GST Inc) to provide ATAPS services for 2010-11. New arrangements under a second tier of funding have been introduced to allow ATAPS to be more flexible and target particular situations and needs, including the need for psychological services associated with disasters. On2 March 2011 Mackay Division of General Practice submitted a proposal for additional funding to assist people affected by the 2010 Queensland floods and cyclone Yasi. This proposal is currently being considered by the Department. In the 2010-11 Budget the Government committed $58.5 million to provide funding for flexible care packages of clinical and care coordination services to better support up to 25,000 people with severe mental illness in the community. An additional $60 million was committed under the Mental Health: Taking Action to Tackle Suicide election commitment package for non-clinical support services such as structured social activities, personal helpers and respite services for carers to enhance the flexible care packages and to enable wrap around care to be tailored to the needs of the individual. The Government has also begun to roll out eight highly-targeted programs ($113.2 million) as part of the $274 million (over four years) Mental Health: Taking Action to Tackle Suicide election commitment package. This package includes $115 million to boost frontline services and provide more services to those at greatest risk of suicide, including psychology and psychiatry services and including the non-clinical support to assist people with severe mental illness and carers with day-to-day needs. The Mackay Division of General Practice is expected to receive additional funding under this new measure in 2011-12. (2) I have held 14 face to face forums around the country with mental health consumers and carers to hear their views on options for progressing mental health reform into the future. The Mental Health Council of Australia (MHCA) coordinated the arrangements for the forums including invitations. A list of the dates and locations of the forums is below: Location State Date1 Adelaide SA 30 November 2010 2 Mandurah WA 02 December 2010 3 Perth WA 02 December 2010 4 Sydney NSW 03 December 2010 5 Newcastle NSW 03 December 2010 6 Brisbane Qld 06 December 2010 7 Canberra ACT 08 December 2010 8 On-line with the Inspire NSW 08 December 2010 Foundation (ReachOut.com) 9 Tamworth NSW 09 December 2010 10 Launceston Tas 13 December 2010 11 Hobart Tas 13 December 2010 12 Melbourne Vic 14 December 2010 13 Darwin NT 16 December 2010 14 Cairns Qld 17 December 2010 15 Atherton Qld 17 December 2010 I also heard views from young people during an online forum hosted by the Inspire Foundation on 8 December 2010. There was a high level of interest in attending these forums, and to ensure those who could not attend had an avenue to express their views, members of the public and interested organisations were also invited to provide submissions about future mental health reform options. The closing date for submissions was 15 February 2011. (3) The Mental Health Nurse Incentive Program provides incentive payments to eligible organisations, including Divisions of General Practice and private psychiatry practices, that engage mental health nurses to provide coordinated clinical care to patients with severe and persistent mental illness. The Program is structured as an incentive based program to encourage eligible organisations to engage the services of mental health nurses and is not intended to provide a full wage subsidy. The Program continues to grow under the current level of incentive payments. (4) Under the Mental Health Nurse Incentive Program, incentive payments are made to the eligible organisation. Wages are negotiated between the organisation and the mental health nurse. (5) Decisions relating to the recognition of nurse specialty areas are taken by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia, which is the organisation vested with standard setting for the regulation of nursing and midwifery under the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme. Bankruptcy Petition (Question No. 226) Mr Christensen asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 2 March 2011. In respect of Bankruptcy Number 5091/1998 of Queensland, why did the Official Receiver of the Insolvency Trustee Service of Australia sign the applicant's debtor's petition when on page (a) 9 of that petition, it showed a District Court judgement and costs order of 1 September 1998 against the applicant, and (b) 19 of that petition, (i) it showed two District Court actions against the applicant, (ii) the applicant was asked to provide all summonses and writs to the trustee and therefore should have shown the Official Receiver that there was one summons to appear in Townsville Court on 9 October 1998, and a writ for possession of the applicant's assets, (iii) it showed the applicant's assets had been transferred to the applicant's own trustee company for $1 406 000 on 25 September 1998, and (iv) it showed that the applicant had gained a cash surplus of $360 000 as a result of a transfer of assets which was allegedly invested in a superannuation fund on 25 September 1998. I am advised by the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (ITSA) that a debtor's petition signed by the bankrupt (Bankruptcy Number 5091/1998) and dated 7 October 1998 was presented under subsection 55(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 ('the Act') to ITSA on 9 October 1998 and accepted by the Official Receiver's delegate at 9.48am on that date. The petition was endorsed accordingly as required by subsection 55(4A) of the Act. The petition was not rejected under subsection 55(3) of the Act, which sets out when the Official Receiver may reject a petition, as it complied with the approved form, was accompanied by a Statement of Affairs which the Official Receiver's delegate did not consider to be inadequate. I am advised there were no grounds on which it could be legally rejected by the Official Receiver.",272,Bills
219,Mr Mcclelland: The Answer To The Honourable Member's Question Is As Follows:,"Bankruptcy Petition (Question No. 227) Mr Christensen asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 2 March 2011: In respect of Bankruptcy Number 5091/1998 of Queensland, (a) did the Insolvency Trustee Service of Australia (ITSA) consider it an offence that the applicant's cash surplus of $360 000 (that had been gained as a result of a transfer of assets and allegedly invested in a superannuation fund on 25 September 1998) was, as subsequently shown in a creditors report, to have been transferred from a trust fund to Vanuatu on 30 September 1998, (b) when ITSA received advice from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) that offences had been committed by the applicant, did it refer the matter to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) as it had indicated to creditors it would, (c) why did the matter not continue to prosecution, (d) what written advice on this matter was given by the CDPP and the AFP, (e) why did ITSA's trustee not comply with the findings and directions of the Federal Court on 20 August 1999 in respect of dealing with assets, and instead, (i) not recover any assets, and (ii) allow the applicant to carry on his business activity by receiving payments and transferring, registering and selling assets, and (f) will ITSA's final creditors report be made available to creditors; if not, why not.  In respect of the matters raised in parts (a) and (b) – Yes.  In respect of the matters raised in parts (c) to (d) of the question, Mr Dunwoody was charged and found guilty by the District Court of Mackay of two counts of disposing of property with the intent to defraud creditors and was sentenced to two years' imprisonment on each count . This followed lengthy investigations by ITSA and the Australian Federal Police.  As to the matter raised in part (e) of the question, I am advised that the judgment of the Federal Court delivered by DrummondJ on 20 August 1999 (Q 7131 of 1999) involved proceedings between Bechrose Pty Ltd ('Applicant') and the initial trustees of the bankrupt estate ('Respondents'). The initial trustees were subsequently removed by the creditors and the Official Trustee was appointed by operation of law under section 160 of the Act.  The Federal Court proceedings brought by the Applicant sought a review of the Respondents' ruling to admit their claim to vote at a meeting of creditors called to consider a composition proposal by the bankrupt under subsection 73(2) of the Bankruptcy Act 1996. The only order made by the Court was to dismiss the application. The Official Trustee was not a party to the proceedings and no directions were made with which it was required to comply.  As to the matter raised in part (f) of the question, a final report to creditors by the Official Trustee was issued to creditors on 14 August 2006. A copy of that report was reissued to certain creditors by the Official Trustee on 10 November 2009, following a request by the former Member for Dawson, the Hon Mr James Bidgood MP, on their behalf on 9 October 2009. North Queensland Fishing Industry (Question No. 228) Mr Christensen asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in writing, on 2 March 2011:",290,Questions In Writing
220,Mr Mcclelland: The Answer To The Honourable Member's Question Is As Follows:,"(1) What measures is the government taking to help the North Queensland fishing industry recover from the effects of Cyclone Yasi, where the catch per unit (of fishing) effort levels in affected waters have been significantly lowered. (2) Why is the fishing industry not included in the national disaster relief arrangements. Mr Burke: I am advised that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Government is supporting the Queensland Government in providing a range of assistance to all eligible businesses and primary producers that have been affected by Tropical Cyclone Yasi under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. Assistance includes concessional loans of up to $250,000 to support businesses that have suffered direct damage from the cyclone. Enhanced concessional loans of $650,000 with grants of up to $50,000 are available for businesses that have suffered extreme damage. Businesses may also be eligible for clean-up and recovery grants of up to $25,000. The Australian Government is also providing wage assistance for up to 13 weeks for businesses in the areas most heavily affected by Tropical Cyclone Yasi and who are unable to pay full wages for their employees during the recovery period. This assistance complements the Disaster Income Recovery Scheme, which provides income support to small business owners and employees whose income has been reduced as a result of the cyclone. Fishing businesses are not specifically excluded from the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. They are able to access the same types of assistance with the same eligibility criteria as other businesses in disaster affected areas.",291,Questions In Writing
