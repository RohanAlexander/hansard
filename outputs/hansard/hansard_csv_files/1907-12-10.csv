Minister of Defence, without notice, whether it has been reported to him that at the last King's Birthday Review, held in Adelaide, owing to the fact that the day was very hot, over twenty cadets fainted, and had to be removed from the ground on which the review was held; whether he knows that' this has had the effect of rendering the cadet movement .to some extent unpopular, and also if he does not see his way to carry out a suggestion already made by me, that cadets should be examined as to their physical fitness before undergoing military training? tion the suggestion made by the honourable member. On general principles,. 1 agree with him as to the necessity for ascertaining the physical fitness of cadets for the work they are asked to perform. Instructions have been given to all the responsible officers in the various States to 'see that no boy physically unfit for such work is permitted to join the cadets. Further attention will be given to the matter. of Defence, without notice, whether his attention has been directed to the following paragraph headed, ""Training Citizen Soldiers: Field Work Blocked"":The announcement made last month, with a great flourish of trumpets, by the Victorian District Commandant that the parades for the King's Birthday were to be of a service and not a show nature, seems to have exhausted the efforts of the head-quarters' staff in this direction. at present is that, some years ago, Mr Although it was pointed out then that tlie usefuD parades were the work of the regimental commanders, it would seem that their attempts t c continue this really valuable work are to be rendeied nugatory.

As there arc several salary increases to the heail-quarters' staff list this year largely ex-' ceeding this sum, and as a moving camp is oneaf the very necessary war condition practices, of which the local troops have too' little oppor-. tunity, it is to be hoped that personal consideration will be given by the Minister to the matter.

I do not intend in connection with Tariff legislation to discriminate in favour of any section of the community. It appears to me that the Government proposal is a mos't flagrant attempt to confer an advantage upon' the printer who imports ink in large quantities, as against the individual who imports it in small quantities because his needs are small. In view of the magnificent and sustained appeal which the Treasurer made yesterday, when he declared that he was absolutely opposed to anything that might even be considered a discrimination, he should, in common fairness, adopt the principle which he then advocated in respect of this item. tend to vote in favour of extending equal treatment to every employer engaged in the printing business. occurred lasf night,' and I wish to say, as a matter of personal explanation, that I . was extremely anxious that nothing should be done which would confer an advantage upon the metropolitan newspaper proprietors, as compared with their country brethren. I believe that in a f u l l Committee the vote would go in favour of the country press. Had a division been taken last evening, however, I am satisfied that it would have gone against the country press.. It was for that reason that I voluntarily left the chamber. I might have been seen walking out of the vestibule arm-in-arm with the honourable member for Capricornia. I absolutely deny the suggestion that I was forcibly detained outside the chamber. In regard to the item immediately under consideration, it is incumbent upon me to do all that I possibly can to prevent Tariff discrimination in favour of the city press. I shall therefore vote for the lowest possible rate of duty. this item was being discussed this morning, many honourable members were labouring under a riiisapprehension. Indeed, I believe that a majority still imagine that it relates to news printing ink. As a matter of fact, it does not. It relates to printing and stencilling inks, n.e.i., news printing ink being specifically mentioned in the next item. Capricornia has stated that"" printing and stencilling inks can be purchased for 3d. per lb. by the large printing firms can. be purchased for that amount. cannot. The ink with which we are now dealing is known as letterpress ink and lithographic and printing ink, and is used in connection with the better class of printing. is used in country newspaper offices. for South Sydney and the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who are practical printers, declare that that is not the case. of the words, "" and in packages of not 0 less than 1 cwt."" in item 355? promised to eliminate those words, but I am not sure that in so doing he will be taking a wise step. I hold in my hand the catalogue of an English firm, which A little episode quotes the cost of the various classes of ink with which we are now dealing. As regards black letterpress inks, the prices per dozen lbs. run as follow :-Poste r from 4s. to 1.2s., jobbing, from 9s. to 18s., book work from 12s. to 30s., and blueblack from 18s. t.o 60s. not quoting the prices of news printing ink. or ordinary printing and stencilling inks, which come under this item, whereas news. printing ink comes under the next item. If we take the. other colours of printing ink, which are admitted by every one to be more expensive, we find that the price of red runs from 12s. to 36s. per dozen lbs., blue from 3s. to 7s. 6d. per lb., magenta, maroon, and others from 3s. 6d. to ios. per lb., and cobalt 30s. per lb. The prices of the inks vary, and that is the reason why a differential duty has been proposed. I believe that had this information been known to honourable members generally last night there would not have been a misunderstanding, and we should not now be dealing with the duty on the ink which is used by the newspapers in the electorate of the honourable member for Capricornia. I am just as anxious as any one to safeguard the interests of small country newspapers.

They cannot use the inferior ink which is used in connection with the large rotary machines in the offices of the big metropolitan dailies. I hope that the duty will be reduced. We have had a great deal of what is assumed to be expert evidence from certain members of the Committee who have been connected with the printing trade. not know in what capacity they were connected with it , but admittedly some of them have not been connected with the trade for many vears, and it is quite possible that will meet the honourable member's objection. important changes mav have taken place in the meantime. have facts to bring before the Committee duties are too high; in the next place I do which absolutely refute many of the statements that have been made.

Collie and Company, who stateWe give the quantities of news ink, purchased from lis, by some of our clients, country newspapers, who draw all their supplies from us :Cornish R., "" Star,"" Woodend, 3 x 1 doz. lbs., at 6d.

That, shows that extraordinary prices are not charged for news ink, aiid that those newspapers are using the Colonial article in preference to the imported. It also proves that country newspapers, if they so desire, can get their news ink made here instead of purchasing the imported. I only received that letter this morning, and I quote it because it shows that the ink is being made here, and is used exclusively by a number of country newspapers. about the tax on the raw material. do. I understand that the tax on the raw material checks to some extent the profitable local manufacture of news ink.

I will accept him as an authority, but we have to deal with the Tariff as it stands. to come out of the next item. I shall move accordingly. jection to the duty of 6Jd. proposed by the Minister on this item is that, as a large proportion of the inks come in at between od. and is. per lb., it will be over ioo per cent, on the 6d. inks, while it will be over 50 per cent, on the is. inks.

198,Mr Dugald Thomson,"If thatThen they have to submit the importation valorem-for every i d . per lb. upwards. Consequently, they must use the ad valorem system. While I object to the alternative duty, my principal objection to the item is the excessive rates which I have pointed out. I shall support the amende ment .to make the duty 4d. per lb., which even then will mean 66Â§ per. cent, on 6d. inks, and 33J per cent, on is. inks. : go straight for ad valorem duties ? so, but we cannot do .so now after the tangle we got into this morning, when a motion to that effect was rejected. local ink is, in most cases, from my own experience, better than the imported at the price. So far as higher-class inks are concerned, we can get the locally-made article at a lower price than the imported, and of equal value, while it has the distinct advantage that there is no deterioration. There is no surface caking, as the' ink is got fresh from the mixer. We are justified, from every point of view, in imposing a duty on imported inks. There is very little risk of undue advantage being taken of the duties proposed, because there are several firms engaged in the manufacture of ink locally. I have it on the authority of at least one manufacturer in Sydney, that-he is well satisfied with the present duties, without increasing prices, as he can now retain his present market. Nothing could be more satisfactory than the statement by the honourable member for Macquarie, that the inks made here are of good quality, and a credit to Australia. The point is, however, that a' composite duty may penalize certain, inks. An ad valorem duty would have been much more acceptable. As to the Customs officers discovering whether high-quality inks are introduced at the lower rate, there will be no more difficulty than there is in discovering whether cotton goods are being brought in as woollen goods In either case, the services of an analyst has to be obtained. nearly always done up in small packets. both seen and purchased them. The honourable member for Coolgardie intends to move an amendment to omit the word "" news,"" and that is quite proper, because so long as it remains we can do nothing; to another assessment-a d the inks must be described as job printing, and so forth, of certain colours and qualities. In my opinion a composite duty is mischievous, and always leads to trouble. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) [4.53] I have listened to the arguments on both sides very carefully, and, I hope, with a fair and open mind; and I have not heard the scheme of duties submitted by the Commission successfully challenged 'up to the present, except in one cletail. This was referred to by the honourable member I think for Coolgardie, who has proposed to increase the invoiced amount in item 355 from '3d. to 6d. That amendment will, I think, enlarge the area of the ad valorem rate, and meet most of the difficulties suggested. I should like to point out to the honourable member for Wide Bay that the fixed duty, or arl ad valorem duty, whichever is the higher, cannot be described as a composite duty in the accepted sense of the word. A composite duty is a combination of dutiesthat is a duty, plus a duty-wherea s the duty under discussion is an alternative duty, which is justified in certain cases. The higher fixed duty of 6d. per lb. is intended to operate on'low-grade inks which it might be difficult to analyze and classify, ancl which, must cause the Customs officers difficulty in checking. A firm generally includes in its orders various grades of ink, low grade, medium, and high grade; and the evidence given before the Commission shows that the average price is about 2s. 66. per lb. The fixed duty of 6d. is intended to operate on the average as represented by the 2s. 66. per l b . ; and it is not fair to say that it will mean 100 per cent. The ad valorem duty is intended to operate when the inks are above the average I have just mentioned. The fixed duty of 66. per lb. might be infinitesimal in the case of high-class inks, worth from 5s. to 6s. per lb. per cent, or 80 per cent, of the inks used are of the lower value? Sir JOHN QUICK No t in reference to the item in which the fixed duty is imposed, and which is intended to cover the superior grades of ink. The lower classes of ink averaging from-3d. to 5d. per lb. T h a t is so. I have are brought uncier the ad valorem rate in item 355.

There seems to have been a mysterious misunderstanding when the last division was taken. Many honourable members were not aware of what the actual question was, pr what the effect of their vote would be. The honourable member for Coolgardie wants to bring all printing ink invoiced at 6d. and under per lb. under an ad valorem duty of 30 or 25 per cent., according to the country of origin, so that all European or American inks invoiced at 6Jd. per lb. would have to pay a duty equal to 100 per cent. get away from that fact. If ink is invoiced at 6Â£d. per lb. in Europe or America, and the duty is fixed at 6Jd. per lb. in Ihe general Tariff, it will be taxed at the rate of 100 per cent. invoiced at over 6d. per lb.

WhatI voted for was to assist newspaper proprietors in the country districts. advised that if we made the invoice standard 3d. per lb., as the printers of small papers in the country do not import in bulk, they would have to pay a higher rate of duty. ment of the honourable member for Coolgardie raising the exemption from 3d. to 6d. allows printers of country newspapers to get their material in at the same rate of duty as is paid by the proprietors of the large newspapers in the big centres.

I do not know why misleading information should be supplied, but I am not prepared to have too much faith in the honesty of some honourable members who are whirling this Tariff through the House. We should have some explanation of the Minister's action in proposing a duty of 30 per cent., when this material was free under the old Tariff, and the recommendation of the Tariff Commission was that it should remain free. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [6.6] I wish to move to make the item free. I have samples of the article here, which I ask the Minister to look at. It is used for binding in the making of paper boxes, and is not made in Australia. inform me that it is made in both Melbourne and Sydney. Mr J. H . CATTS -It ismade chiefly by the Stein Machine Company; those who make the machines manufacture the paper and cloth as well, which, I am told by persons in the trade, are not made in Australia. The samples which I produce are from Mr Firth's card-board factory in Sydney, and were imported. The Minister proposes to put a duty only on stay cloth cut to a width of. not more than 2 inches, which I takit would allow it to e be imported in bulk free. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [6.9] -It is proposed to make stay cloth of not more thsn 2 inches in width It has been ascertained, however, dutiable because hitherto an attempt has been made to evade the duty by making it a little over an inch in width.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [6.23] I cannot accept the amendment. It would benefit only a few wealthy . newspaper proprietors, whilst it is well known that these supplements can be produced here. Coloured supplements, the work of Australian artists, lithographed and printed by the three-colour process, are produced in Australia, and I see no reason why their I am informed that production should not be protected. coloured supplements without some letterpress on them ? done either before or after they are imported. Usually the only letterpress on the supplements are the word's at the head of the sheet, "" Supplement to "" such and such a journal, with the title of the picture underneath. Some very fine supplements are being produced in Australia ""to-day; and I do not see why we should not encourage the artistic sense in the community. The Town and Country Journal and the Sydney Mail, for instance, usually issue a coloured Christmas supplement, and these are produced in Australia. If we decided that such coloured supplements should be admitted free, an inducement would be given to people to look outside the Commonwealth for them. I object to the proposed amendmait. Splendid pictures are taken at Mildura, and are then sent to Germany to be printed as post cards, and really what the honourable member for Balaclava desires is that we should have all our coloured suppleeffect of the amendment, because these supplements can be produced more cheaply in Germany than anywhere else. If it is the objeict of the honourable member to encourage German as against British and Australian artists, I am not with him.

Honourable members opposite, times out of number, have asked how many men are employed in an industry, and whether we can make an article here. In this case we are making bicycles here complete, and equal to any made in any other part of the world. When that is so, let us impose a duty, which will prevent the foreign bicycle from coming in at all. Â«xcept the tyres, is made here. made here. Perhaps there are certain parts that are not made here, but there is no part that cannot be made here if the opportunity is given. If we allow cheap shoddy stuff, that people in other parts of the world will not use, to be dumped into Australia, we will never make anything. Â£7.53] -The answer to the honourable member for Batman, who; of course, knows all about the intricacies of bicycle manufacture as of every other industry by this time, as the Committee has been made painfully aware during this long Tariff debate, is that bicycles are not made here. They are at the most assembled here. The parts are not made in Australia, and in all probability will not be for many years to come, no matter what duties are imposed upon them. Are we therefore to impose these inordinate rates for the mere sake of taxing out bicycles, and making them dearer to the public? That is the only question that we have to ask ourselves. This is no strangled industry. It has never begun to be an industry in Australia, so far as the bond fide making of bicycles goes. All that happens is that the parts are imported and put together. I have no doubt the honourable member for Batman would call that a very elaborate process of manufacture. If he relies upon the Tariff Commission to buttress up his case, he will find small comfort there, and small encouragement for the vigorous propaganda which he seems to be waging on behalf of the local bicycle makers. Only two makers gave evidence before the Commission. I should like to hear from the Chairman of that body their reason for proposing an exorbitant duty of Â£ 5 , with an alternative of 25 per cent. It seems absurd on the face of it that Â£ 5 [* 6j S should be regarded as the equivalent of 25 per cent, ad valorem. There is no relation between the two. Upon a highlyfinished machine, Â£ 5 might possibly be equivalent to 25 per cent., but on the cheaper bicycles it means 100 per cent, and over in many cases. sold in England for 25s., it would be 400 per cent. that a bicycle sold at 25s. would be a danger to life and limb. There is no doubt that the machines are made. very cheaply in places where their manufacture has been specialized, and where the output and the market are very large. We can never hope to equal the skill developed from the specialization of the industry in those parts of the world. We have therefore to depend upon the parts which are sent out from the Old Country. As all that is done here is to assemble the parts into the completed machine, it is the height of absurdity even to suggest these extraordinary high duties. The Minister will, therefore, do well to strike out the fixed, and leave only the ad valorem, rate. So far as I can ascertain none of the witnesses before the Commission advocated an increase in the duty on bicycles. One individual said that he would not object to an increase from 20 to 25 per cent, on the finished article. free bicvcle parts. duty on the parts reduced to 10 per cent. that. not manufactured in Australia, that strikes me as a most reasonable request. I could understand the honourable member for Bendigo recommending a duty of Â£ 5 per bicycle if the parts were being made here, but they are not, and may not be made here for a generation to come. I do not know what the honourable member could have been thinking of to submit this recommendation. I should like to hear him explain it. I point"" out to the honourable member for Batman that the process of putting the machines together is neither elaborate nor costly. 1 was speaking just now to a gentleman who is a practical mechanic, and here are the charges in the business for the putting together of these machines: To put together",36,Pairs

That is all that the bicycle builders asked for \yhen they gave evidence before the Tariff Commission; they stated that if the duties were made 10 per cent, on the parts, 'and 20 per cent, on the finished machine, they would be sufficiently high for all protective purposes. finished parts was only 10 per cent, under the old Tariff. the case of some of the parts, but other parts were charged 15 per cent, and 20 per cent. Ai r they ask is that parts shall be made uniformly dutiable at 10 per cent., without any increased protection on the finished article; but the Treasurer proposes to increase the duty on the latter to 35 per cent, and 30 per cent. Parts will not be made here for many years to come, and, therefore, the impost is simply an exorbitant revenue duty. duties have been the subject of much criticism in the press. We have learnt, many of us for the first time-fro m the honourable member for Bass, I believe-that eight bicycles, valued at Â£ 1 each, were landed at Launceston, and that, instead of a few shillings, the duty amounted to Â£ 4 0 . Then a gentleman from Queensland, when the TaTiff was introduced, asked that he might be allowed to unbraze imported frames, as the brazed frames were not worth, as much 'as the amount of the duty. The honourable member for Parramatta has read out figures honourable relating to the labour cost, but, as I said in relation to the printing ink duty, very few honourable members can make themselves cognizant with the whole details of any industry. According to the honourable member for Parramatta, 12s. is .the labour cost of brazing the frame together. the building of the frame.

Of course, I realise that the Government having abandoned the fixed duties which appear in the schedule, it is hopeless for any honourable member to fight for them. I believe that by acting as they have done the Ministry have struck a heavy blow at many men who have equipped their shops with the appliances necessary for the building df machines from imported parts. members may have noticed that one of the standard makers of bicycle parts has recently increased the price of those parts. I have received, from a gentleman in the country, a letter which emanated from an exporter of bicycles in England. In it the writer points out that English manufacturers would be able to beat the Customs authorities even if the fixed duties which appear in the schedule were retained. He declared that British manufacturers did not contemplate losing the Australian trade. Personally, I want to see our own people retain as much of that trade as possible, and that result cannot be achieved if we agree to the proposal of the Treasurer. glad that the Treasurer has proposed the abolition of the fixed duties in respect of this item. I hold in my hand an invoice which gives the average value-exclusiv e of anv charges-of thirty-six bicycles which are at present in bond. The value is set down at Â£ 5 9s. 6d. each. The total consignment is valued at ,Â£197 3s. 6d. So far from these machines having been dumped, I am informed that the price I have mentioned is a fair one for a good article, The charges upon the consignment added to the duty amount to ^207 s. 3d. They work 9 out as follows-f.o.b . charges Â£ 2 is. 3d., cost of packages Â£ 5 5s., freight and primage Â£ 8 16s. 1 id., duty at Â£ 5 each ;Â£i8o, landing charges at 6s. per ton Â£ 1 8s. u d . , insurance, exchange, interest, & c , Â£ 9 17s. 2d., or a total of .Â£207 9s. 3d. on a declared value at the port of exportation of ^197 3s. 6d. These charges are equivalent to a tax of Â£ 5 each upon machines which are exported for Â£ 5 9s. 6d. each. The old duty upon that consignment, instead of But I do amounting to Â£180, would have amounted t 0 Â£ 4 3 7S. 6d. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommend a duty upon this item of 25 per cent. We must not seriously regard the alternative duty of Â£ 5 per machine recommended by that body. As the honourable member for Yarra suggested, it was framed with a view to prevent dumping. Now, assuming that a consignment of bicycles were invoiced at Â£ 1 each or a little over, instead of a duty of 25 per cent, being charged upon themwhich was the rate assumed by the Commission to be necessary for protection-the Customs authorities would have power, under the original proposal of the Government, to penalize the importer of these dumped machines by imposHonorable ing a duty upon them of ^Â£5 each. That is a very large power to place in the hands of a Minister, because by an arbitrary assessment of value upon a mere allegation that dumping was taking place he would be able without the importer having a right to appeal to charge a duty of Â£ 5 per machine. This is a power, which ought not to be granted to him. I say, therefore, that the true duty recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission was 25 per cent., and I do not think that we shall be acting wrongly if we adopt that rate. commended upon high-class bicycles. mended without any qualification whatever. I am assured that Â£ 5 9s. 6d. per machine represents the fair value of a good bicycle, and that it is the true import price is shown by the invoice to which I have alluded.

An idea of those possibilities may be gathered from the fact that during the last two or three years bicycles and motor cycles to the value of over ,Â£250,000 havfe been imported. That shows that there was a wide area of trade for a good sound protective duty to operate upon. And these fixed duties were undoubtedly the most effective and operative part of these proposals. The deputy leader of the Opposition has challenged my reply regarding the work and labour involved in this industry. I think he said that it cost only 12s. or 13s. to assemble or put together the various parts of a bicycle. amount that is spent locally in building a bicycle depends upon whether finished or unfinished parts are utilized. If the parts are finished, no doubt the work involved is not so great as would be the case if the parts were unfinished. But it is claimed that in building a bicycle out of imported unfinished parts every cycle manufacturer in the Commonwealth gives at least thirtysix hours' employment to Australian workmen. turers to build factories, and provide plant locally made or imported, giving work to a considerable number of men in the production of bicycles. orable member mean by unfinished parts? Sir JOHN QUICK which require local treatment such as enamelling, brazing, filing down, and fitting. of an unfinished bicycle gives four days' work, at about Â£ 2 a day, to local labour. Let us now consider the class of work that is involved. The deputy leader of the Opposition has said that it simply means the fitting together of some parts. able members will listen to an extract from our report they will get an idea of. the processWhen the component parts, unfinished, are imported, and made into complete machines in Australia, the following work is done locally, namely :-Cutting and fitting all tubing and parts together, brazing same, filling same, nickelplating, enamelling the frames, front forks, back stays and wh4el rims with three or four coats of enamel, placing the same in ovens for the purpose of rendering the enamel hard and solid, thereby being less liable to chip and peel off, decorating frames with fancy transfers and I do not names, and other ornamental work. The bicycle frame is then ready for the assembler to take in hand the fitting of other parts, such as tyres, chains, pedals, cranks, bearings, handle bars, and saddle pillars, to make the cycle complete. We were of opinion that the most effective way of encouraging the industry was by substantially increasing the duty on finished bicycles and frames, as well as by placing on the free list certain bicycle tubes. now give us a little information about the wages paid to the men who manufacture the bicycles here?

He really does not seem to know where he is. The honourable member for Bendigo tells us that bicycles can be brought to this country for a mere bagatelle, and that it was because of the importation of these weak and dangerous machines that he proposed a fixed duty. But the honourable member evidently forgot that these inferior machines can be imported in parts and made up here, when they can be sofd more cheaply than the good machines, with which they compete. It seems to me, however, that this item does not merit so much discussion as has been devoted to it. If we make the duty high, and the parts are put together here, and it only costs 24s. to put them together, it seems to me that there will be no demand for complete imported machines. The freight alone would make it almost prohibitive to import them as compared with the cost of putting .together the parts here. The honourable member for Bendigo has told us that it takes a man thirty-six hours to put a machine together. The honourable member for Parramatta says that it costs 24s. to put a machine together. The honourable member for Boothby also says that the cost of buildthey are imported. Enamel covers a muling a bicycle from imported parts is 24s., and he speaks as a practical man. Evidently, if it takes thirty-six hours to conber for South Sydney. struct a machine, and the wages paid are 8d. an hour, that works out at 24s. If the Committee wish to do something for the benefit of the industry, they should' give it the parts free. Then it will flourish, and locally-built machines must take the place of impoitations. Therefore, when we reach item 375 I shall support the proposition that parts 1Â» admitted free, so that all the bicycles required in Australia may be made in the country. There is no advantage in importing machines if they can be put together in Australia. We have been tol3 that bicycles are dumped into Australia. It is a remarkable thing that I never get any of these goods dumped into my backyard. I never have a chance of buying dumped goods. But a few years ago I looked into a bicycle factory at Coventry, England, where the best machines in the world are made, and the head of the firm told me that they could have sold 5,000 more machines during the year if they had had time to make thiem. I have never yet heard of an upi-to-date machine being dumped into any country. It is the out-of-date Mr Henry Willis. machine that will be dumped, to get rid of it. This story about goods being dumped into Australia is a mere fiction, and I hope that the Committee will not be induced to' believe it. However, I am more interested in item 375 than in that under consideration. I should like the duties to be made as low as possible. Whether we make the duty high or low on this item, however, it will not make a bit of difference, so long, as we make the duty on parts low. a great deal from the Melbourne and suburban members about locally-produced bicycles.

I pay a boundary-rider more than that for sitting on a horse and riding round my fences.

As soon as those engaged in it member for Melbourne Ports, where be found, say times out of number that if he had his way he would wipe out an industry that could not pay better wages than these.

We know that many of these bicycles are made of tin tubes. A man in Rockhampton wanted to sell me a bicycle which he said would carry a ton. He gave me a trial, and I brought it back to him like a concertina. This was a Colonial-made bicycle, and it is clear, therefore, that the remarks of the honourable member for Bendigo about cheap imported bicycles should not carrymuch weight. I am pleased that the Treasurer has seen fit to abolish the fixed duties proposed. It rests now with the Committee to decide what the ad valorem duties shall be. I have no wish to crush the local bicycle industry. I am prepared to vote for a reasonable duty Victorian duty of 10 per cent, the industry could be carried on, those concerned in it should be satisfied with a duty of 2.5 per cent., for which I am prepared to vote. feel sure that the arguments of the Chairman of the Tariff Commission will have great weight with the Committee.

I am quite prepared to support an ad' valorem rate of 35 or 40 per cent, in view of the fact that we have alreadv inteased the cost of the construction of these vehicles. the exception of the very highest class of vehicles, such as barouches and landaus, and some of the cheaper classes of buggies, there is a very small importation of vehicles into the Commonwealth. The reason is that the foreign vehicles are built too lightly to withstand use on Australian roads. very heavy. of importation is considerable, because vehicles take up a large quantity of space. If we compare the importation of vehicles into the Commonwealth prior to Federation with the present importation, we shall find that there has been a tremendous falling-off. From the Statistical RegisterI gather that in 1900 the value of the importations under this heading was as follows:-Ne w South Wales Â£11,382, Victoria Â£5,902, Queensland Â£1,436, South Australia Â£5,669, Western Australia Â£1,113, and TasmaniaÂ£ 9 6 , or a total of />5,6oo.

In regard to the opinions of the coachbuilders, some evidence which was given before the Victorian Tariff Board is very interesting reading just now. shows that even so far back as then, when the industry was not in nearly so flourishing a condition as it is in to-day, the coachbuilders did not want any more protection. In fact, many of them complained that the high Tariff was really a source of irritation to them, if it did not indeed involve them in considerable loss. argument, but it will not go down. with the honourable member; but may I remind him that it is evidence given by the coachbuilders themselves? the witness? one witness, but several witnesses.

The Minister has not given any reason why the old duty should be increased, nor is the increase supported by anything I have seen in the reports of the Tariff Commission.

On that large amount of consumption the imports that entered into competition last year have been reduced to less than Â£10,000. According to the Minister's returns, the imports for the year 1906 were only ,-Â£9.500. The honourable member for Lang has informed the Committee that, according to the Commonwealth statistics, prior to the introduction of the first uniform Tariff the importations amounted to something like Â£25,600. free importations into New South Wales. were partly, but not wholly, accounted for by the free importations into New South Wales. The total imports into New South Wales were about Â£11,000 out of a total of Â£25,000. Since the imposition of the duty of 25 per cent, under the old Tariff, the imports have been reduced down to the very small figure of Â£9,500 in a total consumption of Â£2,500,000 per annum. Those figures show how completely the local manufacturers have . captured the trade, and that they have nothing to fear from importations on the basis of the old Tariff.

No distinction is drawn; and that means that the taxation will fall heavier upon those who are compelled to use the cheaper conveyances, such as sulkies, dogcarts, and spring carts, which are generally used in the country districts rather than in the cities, and especially by graziers and settlers, to do their lighter work. -The honourable member for Dalley asks the Committee to agree to omit the word ""each,"" and to . impose a fixed duty.

545,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"-duties on buggy hoods? The proposal is absurd. A continuance of this kind_ of thing would make anybody not only tired .and bored, but sick to death. A duty of 35 per cent, is proposed on one of the simplest forms of manufacture, when we have -put only 25 per cent, on some of the -most complicated forms of manufacture in Australia, requiring the greatest possible :skill and ingenuity in construction.

None of these chassis are likely to be made here during our 'time, but the carriage part could, and should, be made in Australia. glad that the Treasurer has submitted this amendment; but I suggest that steel stamped panels which, are used for the stiffening of the seats, and are made by only one firm in England, should be made .subject to the same duty as the chassis. This would encourage the-building of the -bodies of the car in Australia, which are -worth from Â£ 3 0 to Â£ 6 $ , according to the style and finish. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) .[n.53] 1 think I have made the most liberal provision.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE. (Hume-Trea surer) [11.56] -It. strikes me that if I omitted the. words ""including tires when accompanying vehicles,"" then the. duty will refer only to the cars, and tires will come under another item. think thatwould be so, because the tires will come in as part of the car. I think that the suggestion of the honourable member for Mernda might be adopted. the words to which I have referred, that will dispose of this duty on the tires, and I can move a sub-paragraph to make them subject to a duty of 5 per cent, and free. tires on a motor car will come in as part of the car, and be subject to duties of .35 and 30 per cent.
