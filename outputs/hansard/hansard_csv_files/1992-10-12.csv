The Deputy Leader of the Opposition makes a big I have made the point on many occasions point about the fact that the world economy that, rather than denigrating this as an outlook is not growing very fast. That is precisely the for the Australian economy, we should be same point that I have been making when I reflecting on the fact that we in Australia are have said that the Australian economy is doing rather better than practically every other growing faster than most of the rest of the OECD country.
