Power is given to the Governor General to restore, by proclamation, the provisions of the enforcement legislation, and the effect of proclamations, directions, notices, &c, issued under it ; but now that the new Government of New South Wales has given the assurance that it will meet its interest obligations, this legislation should certainly be suspended so long as a real effort is being made to observe the conditions of the plan that has been adopted by the other State Governments. of that? for a judge. qualifications. is that the suspension will not affect the rights and liabilities created by the emergency acts. committed an offence, or incurred liability while they have been in operation, will not be relieved of liability by the legislation we are now considering. In conclusion, I remind honourable members of the actual financial obligations of New South Wales to the Commonwealth to-day. The gross default of the State in regard to interest obligations which had to be met by the Commonwealth was £4,301,827. Deducting Commonwealth contributions to interest which were withheld-£729,354-the net default of the State was £3,572,473. Australia has had to pay. £612,414, which has been recovered by the be allowed to that State to put itself Commonwealth from the State. Thereright financially. It would be unfortunate fore the net amount 'now owing to the if an attempt were made to collect immeCommonwealth by New South Wales is diately all the money in arrears, because £2,960,059. I say to the people of New South Wales, and particularly to the taxpayers of that State proper time, but that is not what I am saying now. When this bill has been passed, the taxpayers of New South Wales will be again in the position which they occupied before the recent Commonwealth emergency legislation was introduced. Every tax, and every payment due by individuals or companies to the Treasurer of New South Wales, should be paid by them in the same way as before default was made by the recent State Government. Such payments should again be made to the State authority, and not to the Commonwealth. I am as pleased in being able to introduce this bill as I was sorry to have to bring in the measures which it suspends. I desire to express my gratification at the suspension of hostilities between the State of New South Wales and the Oommonwealth, .and to express also my pleasure, which I am sure is shared by almost everybody in Australia, and all well-wishers of this country outside the Commonwealth, that New South Wales has^again acknowledged and adopted the Australian and British tradition of honesty. As a citizen of New South WalesI am glad that the conflict has Any person who has ended, and that the anarchy that was rampant there has ceased. The people of New South Wales heaved a sigh of relief, which I suppose was heard even in the other States. It was possibly heard in Victoria on Saturday last, when it was known that Mr Lang was no longer in office, carrying out his policy of hostility to the Commonwealth Government and to the rest of Australia. Everybody agreed that it was scandalous that such a position could have arisen, and now that the circumstances have changed, I trust that the Commonwealth Government, in these very difficult times for taxpayers, will see to it South Wales in arrears with its interest except for payments, a certain period of time will",10,Second Beading

29,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper) [3.13],"the charges have heen running on for several months, and the revenue of the State has been spent in other directions, with the results that the amounts due can be obtained only by increased several years without general hardship. That is quite a reasonable request, because New South Wales is suffering, not merely from the outburst on the part of Mr Lang, but from other actions that have tended to strangle production and progress in that State. I hope that New South Wales will never again have a similar experience, and that ut the election to be held shortly in that State, at which the people will have an opportunity of expressing their opinion on this matter, the electors will make it known clearly where that State stands, for the next three years at any rate. I hope that the Federal Government will take an early opportunity of making the position safe for the future. There has been no reason in the past to expect that any State in Australia would definitely break any agreement such as that which was abrogated by the Lang Government. Consequently no provision was made in that agreement to cope with such a position as that in which New South Wales was placed by that That was why it was necessary for the pass the emergency legislation. It was reasonable to anticipate that the conduct of one government in its dealings with another government representing the same people and the same class of people throughout Australia would be such that there would be no need for a penalty clause in any agreement between those governments; but unfortunately after the experience we have had we cannot trust certain governments in this regard, and the Federal Government would not be justified in failing to take steps to prevent which such a proposal has been made. a repetition of the recent trouble. I hope that action will be taken by this Parliament during the next few months to put the people of any State in the position of being able to bring to book at the earliest possible moment any parliament or government of that State which deliberately transgresses against our accepted standards of tradition and honour. I understand that the leaders of Dr. Earle Page. the two parties represented in the new Government in New South Wales have definitely pledged themselves on the subject of the subdivision of New South Wales. There may be difficulties in taxation extending over obtaining the assent of the Parliament of that State, because the Legislative Council is not an elective body. I trust that the Commonwealth Government will take steps to ensure that the will of the people of that or any other State which desires to express itself in such a matter can be carried into effect without any delay. I am not opposing this measure, I think that the emergency legislation should be obliterated from the statute-book, and not merely suspended. I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without expressing my opinion as to the change of front that has been brought about through the action of the Governor of New South Wales, the legality of which is questionable. It makes one wonder whether we are living in a true democracy when one man can dismiss a Ministry that was elected by the people with a greater majority than that recorded in any other State. That change of front has been brought about simply because the present Government has been put into office in Government. New South Wales by autocratic means. This new government has decided that it Oommonwealth Parliament to will carry out the Premiers plan to the letter, and that entails the enslavement of the people of this country in order that the overseas bondholder may be paid his interest. It is designed to inflict a reduction of wages on the whole of the workers, and effects reductions in the amounts provided for social services such iu child endowment, widows' pensions and compensation. The Premier who has been dismissed in New South Wales opposed a reduction of the workers' standard of living at every Premiers conference at Mr Lang is to be commended for the stand he took on behalf of those who could not afford to have their standard of living further reduced. He declared that the debts of New South Wales should be paid by those who could afford to pay, and he advocated a reduction of the rates of interest on the public ddbt. That would have placed the burden of main-",11,Second Beading

Even those men ment are not earning sufficient to provide the bare needs of themselves and their families. Because Mr Lang would not reduce his people to the coo'lie standard of living, the legislation which this Government now proposes to suspend, was enacted to deprive him of financial supplies. When that proved ineffective, the Commonwealth stole the revenues of the State by putting the bailiff into State departments. These extreme measures not yielding the results that were anticipated, somebody else, whom the Nationalists first ridiculed in the press, but to-day laud as a hero, because he has taken up the cudgels in behalf of the Nationalists and the foreign bondholders, was drawn into the dispute.

Yet we claim to be a democracy! It is entirely wrong that a Premier of a State should be subject to the insults that were recently directed in this House at Mr Lang. Nothing has been bad enough to say about him, yet I claim that he is a truer representative of the poorer section of the community than those who have vilified him. He has at least endeavoured to help the poor and needy rather than those who have wealth aud plenty. Mr Lang adopted a Christ-like attitude, and now the Prime Minister and his followers are prepared to crucify him as Christ Himself was crucified by people of the same type. and my associates in this House are pleased that at least for the time being the futile financial legislation, recently introduced by this Government, is to be suspended. We have been assured from time to time that the many amendments to the original act were introduced without political bias, and that the only desire of the Prime Minister( Mr a request for a special subsidy from the Lyons) in introducing them was that the State of New South Wales should honour its solemn obligations to the bondholders. Yet the second clause of this measure gives the clearest indication that the original legislation was designed as a threat to be held over the heads of the people of New South Wales. When that legislation was introduced in this House, the default of New South Wales amounted to a little more than £900,000. To-day we are assured by the Prime Minister that the default of that State totals over £3,000,000. That indicates how utterly futile this legislation has been in remedying the difficulties that confronted this Government in collecting its dues from New South Wales. The provisions of this bill clearly indicate that the act is being manipulated for purely party purposes. No other inference can be drawn from it than that if the Labour party is returned to powerwliich I feel sure will be the casethe financial emergency legislation will again come into force. It seems that is ihe event of the so-called Stevens Government being returned to power, the Commonwealth Government will not only susbut will also provide additional assistance for New South Wales. We are assured by the Prime Minister that if a ""real effort "" is made by the new Government of New South Wales, the enforcement legislation will not again become operative. What is this "" real effort"" referred to by the Prime Minister? We have heard him eulogizing the Premier of South Australia, holding him up as a pattern to the Premier of New South Wales, because he has faithfully carried out the Premiers plan. At the Premiers Conference, the Premier of South Australia, a so-called Labour man, openly boasted that in that State wages were lower and taxes higher than in any other part of the Commonwealth. mier of South Australia is honest. is. The net result of the action of the Premier of that State in making a "" real effort"" to carry out the Premiers plan is his contemplated visit to Canberra with Oommonwealth of £2,000,000, which the people of New South Wales will have to assist to pay. Is that what we have to anticipate in respect of the new Government of New South Wales? If it makes a similar effort to carry out the Premiers plan, and then approaches the Commonwealth for a special subsidy of £2,000,000, will it receive the consideration which the Premier of South Australia is expecting? The whole thing reeks of political bias. Who is to be the judge of what constitutes a "" real effort"" ? Statements have been made by supporters",13,Second Beading

Is that to be the "" real effort"" which the Government of New South Wales must make in order to receive tbe assistance of this Government? If so, the Prime Minister and his supporters will be sadly disappointed when the Lang Government is returned to office, because, irrespective of whether this emergency legislation is again put into operation, those social benefits will never be taken away from the people of New South Wales by a Labour government. The position is obvious. Every facility has been made available to the Stevens Government, though it is in a minority in the State House. In New South Wales we have the peculiar spectacle of a self-governing State being under the control of a government which receives the support of less than one-third of the elected representatives of the people. That Government does not dare to meet the Parliament of the State. people. to help it, the Commonwealth Government is restoring to it all the facilities which it took from the last Government. enforcement legislation is to be suspended, so that the new Government may have funds with which to pay for social benefits until after the State elections, though I feel fairly confident that, should the present Government be subsequently returned in New South Wales, those social benefits will cease. I go so far as to say that the "" real effort"" Wales is the abolition of those benefits, so that the Government may be in a position to honour its solemn obligations to the bondholders. Let me assure honourable members opposite, however, that they are likely to be disappointed. Mr Lang will the be returned by an overwhelming majority, and social benefits will not, as this Government anticipates, be abolished. We am quoting welcome this bill, because it provides an opportunity of pointing out how utterly futile the enforcement legislation has been, so far as its original intention was concerned. When the firstenforcement act was passed, the amount in default was something over £900,000. That sum has now grown to over £3,000,000. No matter what government is elected in New South Wales, it will be faced with the same difficulties that confronted the Lang Government. Apparently, the Commonwealth Government proposes to use the enforcement legislation as a threat against the people of New South Wales, lest they should be tempted to return Mr Lang as Premier. It is becoming increasingly evident that the' enforcement legislation was never intended to be anything more than a political instrument for the purpose of helping the Commonwealth Government's political friends in New South Wales. The trick is too transparent, however, and must be seen through by even the most dunderheaded elector. I predict that, no matter what government may be returned after the elections in New South Wales, the Commonwealth Government will not have the courage to administer another dose of enforcement legislation. gratulate the Government on its prompt action to remove the restrictions which were necessary while the Lang Government was in office, but are unnecessary now that a group of honest men The form the Government of New South Wales.

The Ministerf o r the Interior( Mr Parkhill) stated, when a member of the Opposition, that the increased duty had been by alleged that a certain member of the last Ministry, who is not now in this Parliament, was a shareholder of a company in Brisbane that distributed Lysaght's products. He wished it to be inferred that the duty had been increased because a certain member of the last Ministry was a shareholder in Brett and Company, which was only oue of a number Lysaght's' products in Queensland. Yet, the present Minister for Trade and Customs has not reduced the galvanized iron duties, which he said were a disgrace to Australia. member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) is also a member of the Government that has approved of the duty that it strongly condemned when I introduced it. arguments which I used as Ministeri n support of the duty were employed by the present Minister on the 25th February last. Some of the extravagant statements which the Minister made are reported in Hansard of the 16th September, 1931, as follow:It would be a much easier matter to-day to make out a sound ease for a reduction of the existing duties, because of the falling costs works. associated with the industry. . . . It is finite unfair-in fact it is an outrage at this period of Australia's affairs-to ask Parliament to put Lysaght Limited on to a normal dividend-earning basis. The tariff was never intended to be used in that way. . . . I recommend all honourable members to examine the Tariff Board's report on this matter, and I challenge any of them to read it with an impartial mind, and still support the duty proposed by the Minister. The board's report is one of the strongest, most convincing and most logical documents of its kind which has ever been submitted to this Parliament. . . . The Tariff Board recommended a specific protective duty of £4 10s. a ton, but only on the condition that the wholesale price should not exceed £25 a ton. I cannot understand why the Minister departed from a specific recommendation of that kind. By inference and innuendo the Minister tried to create the suspicion that there was something wrong in my action. press took the matter up, and published a Mr Forde. I was subreport of his statement under black headlines. The Minister did not then know that within six months he would succeed me as Ministerf or Trade and Customs, and would have to assume responsibility for making a decision in this granted to Lysaght Limited matter which would be of far-reaching way of compensation, and he importance. I invite honourable members to hear what the Minister said in his speech in this House on the 25th February last, in justification of my rate of duty which he condemned last yearAs everybody knows these companies have been suffering the full effects of tbe depression, and are enjoying anything but full prosperity at the present time. Some of the companies were actually carrying on at of companies distributing a loss when prices were reduced. One company has not paid a dividend for two years. . . . It may be added that Lysaght Limited have placed returns before the department showing that tbe selling price which will operate after the 1st March will not return The honourable any profit or margin for depreciation. The company has offered the fullest accountancy investigation into its affairs . . . The board's recommendation, which I was reluctant to pass by, was based upon an anticipated The annual output at the Newcastle works of liO.000 tons per annum. The output for last year was approximately 33,000 tons, and the present rate of output is slightly in advance of that figure. I found that the factors upon which the Tariff Board based its findings had changed to such an extent during the previous twelve months tliat I did not feel on safe ground in adopting the report. I feared that the adoption of the report might lead to heavy imports, with considerable unemployment, not only at Lysaght's . . .; but alsoat the Broken Hill Proprietary Company's The responsibility associated with ministerial office has caused the present Minister to adopt my line of argument so f a r as galvanized iron is concerned. Now let us see what Lysaght Limited have done in order to retain the £5 10s. duty which is necessary to the life of the industry, and which the Minister is now convinced is justified. so, and got his Cabinet to agree to the duty when he left it in the schedule. He stated that he had had the accounts of the company carefully examined, and, before taking action in the matter, I , too, instructed accountants The to examine the company's books. I also got an officer of the Treasury, Mr .",19,Taripe Proposals N O 3 Customs Duties

These accountants stated that every increase was justified. duced by £2 per ton immediately I took office. pany agreed to a reduction of £2; but let us consider what that means. The Minister for Trade and Customs, and presumably also the Minister for the Interior, now agree that a duty of £5 10s. per ton is necessary even on full production, and the company has sacrificed the whole of its profits, in order to retain the protection which I gave. The practicability of a reduction in price by £2 a ton depended on increased production as the result of the continuance of the present duty. The company is working without profit and without provision for depreciation to-day, and the subscribers of their capital are receiving no return. The Minister said on the 25th February lastLysaght Limited have placed before the deam reading now, because I had investipartment returns showing that the selling price which will operate after the 1st of March will not return any profits or leave any margin for depreciation. The company has offered the fullest accountancy investigation into its affairs. That was the Minister's justification of his failure to reduce duties below those imposed by me. If all the duties I imposed emerge as successfully from the test, and arc similarly defended in this Parliament by the Minister for Trade and Customs, and the Minister for the Interior, it will be obvious that many of the alleged serious mistakes of which I was accused in September last were mythical, and that my schedule was attacked merely for party political purposes. The honourable member for Swan interjected regarding the importations of galvanized iron before the prohibition was imposed. I remember ascertaining by inquiry at the time that no unusual importation had taken place, and I have more recently made extensive inquiry into this allegation. submitted to the Tariff Board. taken of an ex parte statement before the Tariff Board by an interested competitor ? statement. an interested person be believed?

When the new extensions at our Newcastle works were completed in August, 1930, we found that the demand had fallen off to such a marked extent that instead of our being able to provide for two-thirds of the total requirements of the Commonwealth, as had been anticipated when the extensions were arranged for at Newcastle, we were in a position with our increased productive capacity of 80,000 tons per annum, to provide nearly twice the quantity that was being sold in the Commonwealth, and there was no longer any necessity for any outside importations.",20,Taripe Proposals N O 3 Customs Duties

So far from importing large quantities of galvanized bounty ? iron just prior to the embargo, we had, for several months prior to this, reduced importament did not assume office unti l after tions and cancelled numerous orders given these importations had been made.

Our any case, the honourable member always importations for 1929-1930 compare as follows, professes to favour bounties rather than viz.:Tons. 1929 1930 Out of the total importations made in 1930, 6,627 tons were for Queensland and Western Australian consumption, which markets it was not, in our earlier calculations, expected to supply at present from Newcastle, and which it was found only possible to provide by reason of the general falling off in the demand for the whole Commonwealth. Of the 13,865 tons imported in 1930, 11,050 tons were received between January and June, and only 2,815 tons after the 1st July. The embargo was proclaimed on the 3rd October, 1930. We enclose herewith statement showing our total importations of galvanized iron for the years 1929 and 1930, and think that the information given is an effective answer to the statements Those figures reveal a steady fallin g off made. In conclusion we would like to add that in importations. As soon as the company we received no financial benefit whatever from had installed eight additional mills at the embargo, and that the realization of our Newcastle, it was prepared to supply the stocks of English galvanized iron has cerwhole of the requirements of Australia. In tainly not been a profitable matter, as we have not been able at any stage, to cover the full normal times, that would have been diffieost of exchange upon such importations. Years ago, this company imported from pany was able to supply more than the their works in England, 75 per cent, of local market required. the galvanized iron used in Australia.

91,Mr Forde,"Its capacity is noworable members who now occupy responsible positions in this Government. Two of the most important issues which confronted the Scullin Government on its assumption of office, were: (1) the application of a protectionist policy to the industries of Australia; and (2) the rectification of the adverse trade balance. It was obvious that the application of a policy of effective protection to our industries would go a long way towards the solution of the second major problem. The Labour party's platform provided for the adequate and effective protection of both primary and secondary industries, and, in 1929, we had received from the people an unmistakable mandate to put that policy into operation. last long. that given to the Bruce-Page Ministry in 1928; eleven months. The fact that a change of government has taken place in recent months does not mean that the people of Australia have gone back on the policy of protection. believe in the protection of all industries ? be rectified. The following statement by lieves in the adequate and effective protection of all industries. I do not advocate conditions which will enable the importer to maintain a fight with the manufacturer, thus increasing overhead and selling costs, which would be eliminated if the whole market were enjoyed by one or the other. Those who say that public opinion in regard to the tariff has changed must not forget the momentous meeting between the representatives of the United Australia party and the manufacturers on the eve of the 1931 elections, when the anti-Labour forces feared that the manufacturers' votes and influence would go against them. Definite assurances were then given by the present Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) and the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) that there would be no drastic writing down of the tariff if a Nationalist Government were placed in power. Experience has shown that the protectionist policy has been a success. Australian manufacturers have responded to the call made upon them, and have produced goods of a quality exceeding the most sanguine expectations of even many ardent protectionists. New factories have sprung up. Overseas firms, in order to continue to exploit this market, were obliged to get within the Australian tariff wall, and, as a result, the prices of their commodities fell from 20 per cent, to 50 per cent. As a protectionist, I am fearful, not so much of the tariff alterations that have already been, but of those that may be made in the future. I am particularly sorry, however, to note that the alterations made by the Minister, affecting two great primary industries, have caused consternation among the tobacco and the cotton growers of Australia, although the cotton growers have been somewhat appeased by his subsequent tariff alterations. He already has had three bites at the cotton duties-on e on the 25th February, and two others later. Yet, when I , that Government lasted only as Minister for Trade and Customs, brought down alterations to the tariff, I was subjected to severe criticism. The Minister now realizes that it is impossible to bring down a tariff schedule affecting many items without some anomaly creeping in which later has to the Minister when introducing his tariff proposals on the 25th February caused me much apprehension:What has heen done in this schedule can he taken as an indication of the trend of the Government's future policy. I should like the Minister to elaborate that statement, because I am concerned, not so much with what he has done, as with what he may do, although he has already dealt a severe blow to the tobacco, pearl buttons, woollen hoods, cotton, corkboard, and other industries with which I shall deal at length when we are discussing items. ""When I was Minister, I found, on going to the Trade and Customs Department, that previous administrations, in giving effect to what they called a policy of protection, but, what I term pseudo-protection, invariably carried the duties to a point at which the local industry was subjected to intense competition by overseas manufacturers. The result was to establish an incessant struggle between importer and local manufacturer. Each retained a portion of the trade, and neither could make any",22,Taripe Proposals N O 3 Customs Duties

94,Mr Maxwell,Does the Labour party,23,Taripe Proposals N O 3 Customs Duties
95,Mr Forde,"The Labour party beheadway against the other. The result from the consumer's point of view was to increase the cost of its purchases, as overhead, advertising, and distribution expenses generally were at their highest point. Had the whole market been given to either tbe importer or the local manufacturer, reduced selling prices would have resulted. This obvious fact was never realized by previous administrations. They simply toyed with the protection policy. The bold and courageous policy of the Scullin Government, which has been the subject of favorable comment by all sections of the community having the interests of Australia at heart, has aroused the ire and spleen of free traders, little Australians, and geographical protectionists; but since that Government put its policy into operation, the elections of Great Britain have given an overwhelming vote in favour of a similar policy for that country. Some people have an inferiority complex in respect of Australia's future. In this connection, Mr Charles Hardy, senator elect and free trade evangelist, of the Country party, recently stated that Australia would never become a manufacturing country. As Australia is already a manufacturing country, Mr Charles Hardy stands disclosed as a false prophet. In any country, and particularly in Australia, the interests of primary and secondary industries are the same. Farmers, wool men, graziers, foundry men, weavers, food makers, clothes makers, amusement makers, are fundamentally one class-the y are manufacturers, and their interest should be to develop Australia. We hear a great deal from certain honourable gentlemen opposite about Australia having to depend on its exports. The following statement was made by Sir Otto Niemeyer after he had investigated the conditions of Brazil:It is impossible to consider the economic position of Brazil without being struck by the entirely disproportionate role played by coffee, which alone accounts for (>0 per cent, ment's new fiscal policy in the course of a reply in value of Brazilian export. So one-sided a development causes the very greatest difficulties. I am glad that in Australia to-day there is taking place a comprehensive development of both primary and secondary industries. Many of our secondary indus-. tries, as a result of the tariff protection Mr Forde. affordefi by the Scullin Administration, are manufacturing, not for only Australian requirements, but also for export. I want our manufactures to develop to a greater extent. Our men on the land are producing superfluous quantities of primary products, and many of these have to be sold at a loss. I know that honorahle members who are free traders advocate the lowering of the costs of production. What has been the experience of Ouba? That country,-which under black labour grows sugar and other articles for export, is to-day practically ruined. The European nations were taught a bitter lesson by the war, and many of them are now growing their own grain. The wool market is glutted. South Africa, twenty years ago, was a negligible competitor of ours; now it is a serious rival. France is developing her wool industry in Algeria, and in ten years' time will be self-contained in respect of that commodity. Australian farmers are being forced to depend more and more on the custom of Australian industrialists. In the last twenty years the number of persons on the land has fallen from 473,000 to 419,000a decrease of 54,000 -ye t production has increased enormously in wool and butter, and the acreage cultivated is now nearly double that of 1911. In view of the necessity to develop Australia, there is no justification for resorting to huge imports of goods. Professor Giblin has rightly saidOur future development must be chief!}' by secondary industry. To attempt at tbe present any great extension of primary industry will be to knock our heads against a brick wall. Tbere is no gainsaying the statement of Professor Giblin, who is not an avowed protectionist. In support of the tariff policy of the Scullin Government, let me quote a statement of the President of the British Board of Trade, who was reported in the Age of the 7th May as follows:LoNnorr, 5th May. The President of the Board of Trade( Mr Runciman) warmly championed the Governto a debate in tlie House of Commons to-day on the latest import duties order. Mr Runciman emphasized that since the beginning of the Government's new tariff policy in February there had been no rise in prices. On the contrary, the cost of living had actually fallen. Moreover the British export trade had shrunk less than that of any other manufacturing country. The inference was tliat Great Britain's trade held ita own better than that of her competitors in regard to the balance of trade. It was a remarkable fact that we were able to keep out of the country by tbe present policy £10,000,000 worth of goods. In a few months we will know how difficult it will be to obtain a reduction of tariffs anywhere in the worid, but the Government believes it is going in tlic right way, and tliat for the first time the Commonwealth, during that period, ih three generations it is in a position to drive bargains abroad, which are not only an advantage to Great Britain, but to universal trade. Another member of the House of Commons, speaking during the same debate, said that employment in the Bradford trade had been halved as a result of the abnormal import duties on textiles. The first problem which the Scullin Government, on its assumption to office, had to consider was Australia's financial position, and interwoven with that was, of course, our overseas trade. As the state of the finances of this country was disclosed, it became evident that it was worse than we expected to find it. The overseas position had developed into a crisis of the first magnitude. fallen by £200,000,000 per annum. In 192S-29 ""it was £640,000,000, and in 192930 £440,000,000. income credits had to be established to meet, not only commitments at home, but also commitments abroad. Previously those payments had been met out of exports and borrowings. As £40,000,000 a year had been borrowed abroad during the regime of the Bruce-Page Government, the London money market was closed against Australia, and we could no longer look to that source for payment of imports. The importation of goods of a luxury class which were being manufactured in Australia was not only adding greater difficulties to our already precarious financial position overseas, but was also jeopardizing the existence of many .of our secondary industries, and forcing thousands of employees out of work, and on to the dole. Had the trade balance in any one year been adverse, stringent measures might not have been necessary to rectify it ; but the history of Australia's external trading during the seven years' period prior to 1929 showed that the growth had become malignant, because the value of imports had exceeded the value of exports by £78,000,000. That was only part of the financial picture. During the period of seven years our loan indebtedness abroad required an annual interest payment of approximately £26,000,000, or a total of £182,000,000 during the Bruce-Page Government's period of office. In respect of our adverse trade balance and interest commitments, became indebted to the extent of £260,000,000. The Labour Government, therefore, had to decide upon a course of action which would rectify our adverse balance of trade and enable the country to live within its means. It had to decide which of the following policies would he of the greater benefit to Australia in the rectification of the adverse trade balance:-(a ) Dependence upon the exchange rate solely; (b) combination ""of restriction of imports and exchange rate. In considering the first alternative, due regard had to be paid to its likely effect on government finances. Our overseas interest payments at that time approximated £29,000,000 per annum. Our national income had Every increase of 1 per cent, in the exchange rate meant an increase of £295,000 annually to the burden Out of this national which Australian governments have to bear. An exchange rate of 50 per cent -whic h was the least that would have stemmed the tide of imports-woul d have cost the Australian governments an extra £14,500,000 a year. Even without exchange, our annual overseas interest payments amount to almost £4 10s. per head of population. The superhuman task involved in meeting this payment may be appreciated when we compare our interest obligations with the obligations of Germany under the Dawes plan, which fixed, according to her estimated capacity, the indemnity which Germany was to pay at £125,000,000 a year, or approximately £2 per head of population. It was found that Germany could not carry the load, so another plan was adopted, called the Young plan, under which Germany was to pay £85,000,000 a year, or less than 35s. a head. Seeing that our interest burden, without any increased exchange rate, amounted to £4 10s. a head, it was obvious that we could not depend on an increased exchange rate alone to check imports. It was recognized that, by a reasonable increase in the exchange rate, a bonus would be given to the primary producers on their exportable produce, and that bonus is now worth to them from £28,000,000 to £30,000,000 a year. The extra cost involved to Australian governments by the increased exchange rate is between £7,000,000 and £8,000,000 a year, but no one who is familiar with the plight of the primary producers will begrudge them the assistance they are receiving. upon the exchange rate solely to rectify the adverse trade balance would have allowed importers of luxury goods, and goods which can be, and are being, made in Australia, to compete for funds in the overseas market against Australian purchasers of raw material, and other essential commodities. I now come to another factor which influenced the Scullin Government in taking immediate steps to prevent the importation of goods which could be manufactured in the Commonwealth. cumulative effects of a policy of deflation adopted by certain nations were making themselves manifest when our Government came into power. The general fall in price levels abroad gave some indication of what was to follow. Manufacturers overseas were being forced by the banks to diminish their overdrafts, and it became necessary for them to turn their stocks into liquid assets. This meant that sales had to be effected quite regardless of the cost of production, and the greatest problem facing overseas manufacturers was the finding of foreign markets. In order to prevent the introduction of an era tion, for what he produces, he must of dumping, the Scullin Government introduced its tariff resolutions of Novemsecondary industries, which provide him ber and December, 1929, followed by special duties and prohibitions in April, 1930, and the consolidated tariff schedule of June, 1930. The introduction of these schedules raised a tariff barrier which prevented the dumping of overseas goods on the Australian market. Those who are loudest in their condemnation of the tariff fli*e they who claim to mary products at prices that. will be at speak on behalf of the primary producers. They are for ever condemning the policy of protection when it applies to something made in Australian factories, but they are satisfied enough with protection when it applies to the product's of their own farms. Let us have a little consistency in this matter. I propose to show that primary producers have definitely beneilr. Forde. fited from protection, and that they receive assistance in other ways which compensate them for any burden indirectly imposed upon them by the tariff. The Bruce-Page Government appointed a* economic committee, which estimated that the total cost of protection to the Oommonwealth was £36,000,000 annually. Dependence Of this sum, £10,000,000 was the estimated cost of protection to primary industries, and was made up as follows:Sugar .. 4,000,000 Butter .. 3,000,000 Other primary products .. 3,000,000 Other forms of assistance to primary producers were estimated by the economists fio cost another £12,000,000, making a total of £22,000,000 paid by the community for assistance to primary pro1 ducers. The calculations of the economists did not include the cost to the The community of the bounties on gold, cotton, wheat, flax and linseed; nor the export control votes for dried fruits, canned fruity dairy produce, wine and other primary produce, overseas marketing vote*, and cattle tick control. Some of tJhe £26,000,000 which protection of secondary industries is estimated to cost should properly be debited against primary production, because many classes of goods classified as secondary are mainly comprised of primary products, such as sugar, butter, obc. If the primary producer desires protecrealize the country's obligation to protect with a local market. If our secondary industries suffer from the blight of insufficient proteotion, unemployment will become rife, and there will occur a marked falling off in the demand for primary produce. On the other hand, the healthy development and extension of our secondary industries will create an increased demand in Australia for prileast payable to the farmers. Let us examine the effect of protection on the butter industry, in which the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) is particularly interested. Australian butter producers are, in effect, receiving a libnnty of £3,000,000 from the people of Australia. Consumers in this country hare to pay 4d. per lb. more for their butter than would be charged if the bounty on exported butter were not paid. primary products which receive protection. They include milk, butter, cheese, bacon, hams, pork, lard, wax, poultry, eggs, live-stock, and pigs. Of these foodParis frocks "", but as "" buying what we stuffs, Australia produced, in 1929-30. £49,389,000 worth. The value of such goods consumed in Australia was £40,819,000, while exports were valued at £8,579,000. Thus Australians consumed 82£ per cent, of the food products mentioned in this group, and only 17£ per cent, was exported. In 1929-30, we exported 107,000,000 lb. of butter, valued at £7,000,000. During the same year we consumed in Australia 191,000,000 lb. of butter, valued at £15,000,000. Our total production of butter for that year was 299,000,000 lb., valued at £22,000,000. our imports. The Scullin Government The average wholesale price of butter overseas was Is. 3-Jd. per lb., whereas in Australia it was Is. 7|d. per lb. Thus the margin for the farmer in favour of the local market, compared with the overseas market, was 4d. per lb., to which extent the primary producers benefited. Does it not, then, pay the primary producers to build up a local market in which they can sell their products to contented artisans employed in Australian factories? In the year to which I have referred, the Australians consumed butter per cajrita to the value of £2 9s. In the United Kingdom butter to the value of only £1 3s. 3d. per capita was consumed. It is evident, therefore, that one Australian consumer is worth to the Australian farmers more than two consumers in the United Kingdom. should remember this when they feel disposed to disparage the local market, and to say that we should place our confidence only in the export market. Where would the butter producers be to-day if they were duties invariably result in increased depending wholly on the export market? Let us examine the effects of the lastMinister for Trade and Customs, proved Government's tariff proposals. By far conclusively that prices have been conthe most important is their effect on our siderably reduced since the Scullin duties external trade. As a direct result of were imposed. A study of the prices the measures adopted by the Scullin Gocharged for agricultural implements in vernment, an adverse trade balance of various free trade countries, which have £32,000,000 for 1929-30 was converted no agricultural manufacturing industries into a favorable trade balance of of their own, is most illuminating when £28,000,000 for 1930-31, despite the collapse in prices of our principal exportable product. Australia is now living within her means. Real prosperity should not be defined as "" an inordinate sense of pride in the satisfaction of wearing foreign hats, eating English biscuits, and clothing oneself in imported suits and can afford of Australian products."" Australia can never develop if we accept the doctrine that it is easier to buy than to produce. will probably admit that the depression may have had a little to do with rectifying the trade balance. do with it, no doubt; but we must remember that the depression affected the volume and value of our exports as well as of brought about a scientific restriction on the importation of luxury lines. As a result of its negotiations with the banks, credits were made available only for necessary imports. Australia may now be said to be on an even keel again, due to the tariff policy of the Scullin Administration, a policy which Great Britain herself two years later has seen fit to adopt. I was pleased to read in a recent leading article in the Melbourne Herald the following statement:Australia's trade figures lend themselves to varying deductions, but in the main they tell a story of satisfactory achievement. Two years ago, or less, a favorable trade balance of £28,500,000 sterling-the amount of credit anticipated for the financial year which ends with June-wa s too remote to enter into calculations. My only regret is that the Melbourne Primary producers Herald did not see fit to give any of the credit for this achievement to the Scullin Government, to which it belonged. It has always been contended by those opposed to protection that increased prices. The results of investigations which I was able to make when I was",23,Taripe Proposals N O 3 Customs Duties

The tariff has also been the means of introducing a large amount of overseas capital into the Commonwealth, which has been invested in our secondary industries, and has opened up new avenues of employment. In all, 34 new branch firms of important overseas companies have engaged in manufacturing operations in the Commonwealth since the tariff was introduced. Having been granted adequate protection, 75 notable new companies with Australian capital have become established, and have engaged Percentage deduction. themselves in the manufacture of goods.

K . Nock, of Nelungaloo, now the honourable member for Riverina, was one. Those gentleman showed the cost of 400 acres of wheat cropped, including 250 acres of fallow. The net cost of production was £873, the cost of interest being £386, or 45 per cent, of the cost' of production. After working for nothing, the farmer concerned would lose £182 for the year; every 1 per cent, in interest of 3d. per bushel. I should like to know why we do not hear more about high rates of interest. protection granted by the Scullin Government is of inestimable value to those who produce our milk, butter, cheese, rice, bacon and hams, pork, lard, fruit, honey and waxes, poultry, eggs, and live-stock. I remind the Minister that the duties on corkboard, pearl buttons, chains, almonds, glass, and wool hoods need to be reconsidered, otherwise many persons will be thrown out of employment. I also urge the Minister to give heed to my representations with regard to certain items that have been dropped out of the schedule, and placed on the 192S-29 basis. I listened with interest to the carefullyprepared apology of the honourable gentleman who was Minister for Customs in the Scullin Government. as the right honourable gentleman knows. ing on its quality; but it was somewhat belated. It should have been delivered to the people of Australia prior to the last general election, for the electors were then produced on the farm and of those proasked to judge as to the merits of the Scullin tariff. They did so, and definitely rejected the party which had produced it. It is worthwhile, for a few minutes, to examine certain of the points that were raised by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde). He said that for many years prior to the advent of the Scullin Government there had been a huge adverse trade balance. The Commonwealth Year-Book discloses that in the year 1928-29, the last, year of the administration of the Bruce Page Government, our exports were £144,850,000, £143,647,000, which proves that there was a favorable balance of trade in the year immediately preceding the election of the Scullin Government. It was claimed by that Government that Australia's difficulties would be surmounted, unemployment would vanish, and our progress be unchecked if we could only secure a favorable trade balance. We have established a favorable trade balance of rate meant a difference £28,000,000, yet unemployment has grown to even greater proportions. A favorabletrade balance is not the only remedy for The effective tariff unemployment, which will continue to grow until we do something to the tariff entirely contrary to what was done by the Scullin Government. Statistics demonstrate that, in the years when we have an excess of imports, unemployment is at its lowest ebb, also that our trade is balanced every ten or fifteen years. In the depression of the 'nineties, there was none of these astounding tariff increases. At that time Mr George Reid was Premier, and, despite the free trade policy of his Government, there was a favorable balance of trade, due very much to causes which still exist-the poverty of the people, and their inability to buy overseas. The Labour party has frequently told the fable that they are the only friends of the farmer. We know how successful that statement was at the last general election. Everybody in Australia is looking for some means to bring our unemployment to an end. The world generally is becoming agreed as to the way in which that can be achieved. It can be done only by the restoration of the equilibrium between the prices paid for goods duced in the factories. That has been made clear in every report that has been presented on the financial position of Australia. In his report in 1930, Sir Otto Niemeyer pointed out that the cost of goods needed by our exporters must come into harmony with the prices received for our products on the overseas market, otherwise our people would have no purchasing power. The experts who were appointed by the Government to make a survey of our economic problem stated that there must be certain reductions made in rents, interest, and governmental and our imports expenditure, and especially must there be a revision of the tariff, so that people",27,Taripe Proposals N O 3 Customs Duties

She is now no longer willing to duce into this Parliament a measure to provide fov the enforcement of the agreement to which I have referred, because the march of events in the next eighteen months will force any government which may be in office in reducing the tariff generally to do exactly what the Country party and the' TJnited Australia party agreed to do in October or November of last year. quite satisfied to leave the fulfilment of that agreement to the future for I know that economic forces will make it inevitable that we must adopt the principles which were then agreed upon. That is one reason why, although I did not get an assurance from the Prime Minister that his Government would give effect to the agreement, I felt easy in my rnind as to the future course of events in regard to the tariff policy. I knew that it would be impossible to make any real improvement in the condition of Australia until something had been done in the way of tariff revision. The tariff is only one cog in our the prices of farm and manufactured machinery of government that can bring goods must be made to harmonize before down costs, but it must be put into the right place. You cannot make even a Eord car go unless you put all its mechanism in the right place. We shall not be able to advance the interests of Australia unless we put our different legislative enactments to reduce costs of living and production in proper relation to each other. There can be no doubt whatever that the people of Australia understood that if the United Australia party were returned to power it would adjust our tariff definitely in the direction of lowering it, and I consider that so long as nothing is done in this direction tbe recovery of Australia will be impeded. The prices of farm goods and finished goods must be brought into conformity with each other. What Britain is doing at present in regard to the tariff is quite clear. present protectionist policy of Great Britain/is intended as a bargaining instrument to force the general tariffs of the world down to a lower basis. We all realize that up to the present Great Britain, with her free trade policy, has provided a dumpitig ground and a safety valve for protectionist counallow herself to be used in that way, and has adopted a tariff policy of her own. But the principles of the British tariff have been made abundantly clear. We have been told by members of this.

The opportunities are unlikely to be vigor100 per cent, protection to Australian ously exploited except under the pressure of a downward revision of the tariff. The report then goes on to give specific illustrations of how certain industries have been adversely affected by the tariff. Let me mention, for the information of honourable members, the index figures relating to the prices of farm products, as compared with those relating to manufactured products. The honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin) represents a constituency which benefits by low duties, because its development is dependent on the success of primary exporting industries. In 1911, the index figure of 100 was used by the Commonwealth Statistician to represent the wholesale prices of farm products and manufactured products in Australia. In 1928, immediately prior to the general slump in world prices, the index figures with respect to those commodities rose to 175 and 179 respectively ; but in January, 1931, after practitection because of the depreciation of cally every schedule of the Scullin tariff had been imposed, the figures had fallen to 119 for farm products, and to 193 for manufactured products. In December, 1931, while farm products were represented by 118, or almost the 1911 price, manufactured products had an index figure of having exactly doubled since 1911. That statement shows the result of the present tariff policy. We must get the prices of manufactured goods back, by some means or other, to the old level; but it cannot be done if the tariff on secondary goods is exploited as at the present time. Six months ago the price of galvanized iron was £24 10s. per ton, and to-day it is £29 10s.; in fact I recently asked for a quotation at Grafton for eight-feet sheets, and the price demanded for'a fair number of tons was £32 per ton. Cement, which was selling at £4 10s. per ton some years ago, is now quoted at about £7 10s. per ton. Take fencing wire, or even hats, and compare the present prices with those ruling three years ago, when the prices obtained for primary products were almost double what they are to-day. These high prices are being extracted from the public under cover of the tariff. When the Leader of the Opposition was in power he was an ultra-protectionist. He declared that he would give practically industries. The right honourable member imposed a tariff which he regarded as prohibitive, and he probably said to himself ""Nothing from overseas can get inside the protective wall which I have built round Australia "". In December, 1930, when the last but one of the tariff schedules of his Government was brought down, the exchange rate was 6 per cent. The right honourable member then thought that the high-water mark of protection had been reached. The present Minister for Trade and Customs attacked that tariff most vigorously, and said that it was too high; but, when he came into office, the additional protection against Great Britain, by reason of the rise in the exchange rate, amounted to 25 per cent. Against Germany, France, and the United States of America, which are all great manufacturing countries, there was practically a further 30 per cent, prosterling. So our manufacturers enjoy an increased protection amounting to 55 per cent, against the principal manufacturing countries of the world over and above what the right honourable member who leads the Opposition thought to be necessary. Yet the present Minister, who 200, the latter prices said that this Scullin tariff was too high, has increased the duties on eleven tiddly-winking items, and has asked the committee to believe in the sincerity of his protestation that he desires to bring duties down. There are 79 reductions of duties in the present schedule, varying from 5 per cent, to 25 per cent.; but there is an increased protection of 55 per cent, against foreign countries. Yet the Minister would now take credit for having reduced that 55 per cent, to 50 per cent. duties ? them. The Minister said that it would be scandalous for an industry like the tobacco industry to have a duty of 300 per cent.; but in this schedule he has brought down a fixed duty which, I think, he said was abhorrent to him, of 7s. 6d. on smoothing irons.",32,Tariff And Arbitration
113,Mr White,What about the tobacco,33,Tariff And Arbitration
114,Dr. Eable Page,"I shall deal withTo-day the wholesale eost of an electric smoothing iron in America is 2s. 6d.; therefore we have a fixed duty on this article of 300 per cent. The reason, I think, why the Minister put on this fixed duty is that smoothing irons have depreciated so much in value in the United States of America that an ad valorem duty of. 70 per cent, was not considered sufficient, and so he imposed the fixed duty which, according to his own words, would be a scandalous impost to apply to tobacco. I understand that the Government's imposition of high duties, but it recomdefence of this extraordinary attitude is mends heavy duties on account of the that it is following a recommendation of recognized fiscal policy of this country. the Tariff Board; but will the'Minister This Parliament should determine the tell the committee why the Government basis for decisions whether certain indusdid not act on the Tariff Board's recomtries should or should not receive enmendation galvanized iron?

India, like Australia, is a primary producing, rather than a manufacturing, country, and there Sir David Chadwick, I think, laid down similar fundamental principles to those to be observed in Great Britain. It seems to me that we have got into difficulties with our tariff policy because we have coddled many industries which employ, on an average, probably less than 40 or 50 persons. To permit these industries which supply 25 per cent, or 30 per cent., or even less than that, of Australia's requirements of the articles produced by them to be heavily protected a heavy impost has been placed on the back of the exporting industries, and on every consumer and wage-earner in Australia. ister delivered his policy speech, did the A tariff correlating or. reconciling the right honourable member take exception to his statement on the tariff on the ground that it was not in consonance with the agreement which had been made? granted that the Prime Minister would announce a tariff policy in conformity with that arrangement.

I draw the attention of the the formulation of its customs tariff. The first condition was that if . possible the fiscal policy of Great Britain should be more or less stable, and not subject to violent fluctuations periodically. One of the most serious complaints against the tariff policy of the Scullin Government was that it was continually changing, as many as six schedules being introduced in one year. During that Government's period of office no less than ten tariff schedules were submitted to this House, and these constant variations were almost as vexatious and oppressive to the trading community as were the actual duties. In Great Britain, in order to obviate uncertainty, an attempt has been made to secure agreement on tariff policy between those parties which are in unison on certain fundamental political principles. Mr Walter Runciman, a free trade Liberal, was appointed president of the Board of Trade, and he and a conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer are serving under a Labour Prime Minister. views of the three principal parties in the TJnited Kingdom is not likely to be attacked with any successes, and the customs policy of the country is more or less fixed for a period. Certain Liberal Ministers in the Cabinet objected to even what Mr Runciman had accepted, and this difference was fought out in the House. But the general outlines of tariff policy were fixed by this inter-party arrangement. No such agreement has been reached in Australia, and many tariff proposals are likely to be introduced during the life of this Government, which later will inevitably be changed. One of the main conditions of the protective policy of Great Britain is that protected industries shall increase their output per employee, thus cheapening the cost of production and enabling a reduction of the selling price. That should be one of the fundamental objects of tariff protection. The London Times, in a leading article on the tariff on the 5th December last, said that the new tariff must be combined with safeguards so as to minimize any immediate increase in prices, and to guarantee that within a short period British goods should be comparable, quality for quality, and price for",34,Tariff And Arbitration

I suggest as a means of determining what industries should first be investigated that we should compare the prices being charged in Australia by local manufacturers with the prices charged for similar goods in the TJnited Kingdom or other country_ of supply. If there is a huge disparity-as there is in connection with galvanized iron, the Australian price of which is only a few shillings below that of the imported article, after exchange, duty, freight and insurance have been paidthe duties should be reviewed. butter? Australian butter in London, of a quality comparable with the best Danish, is almost identical with the price charged in Australia. [Leave to continue given.] In South Africa 16-gauge galvanized baling wire is 18s. 2d. a mile, as against 31s. 3d. in Australia; 16-gauge black wire is 15s. 2d., as against 24s. 4d. in Australia, and 14-gauge barbed wire is 14s. 3d., as against 23s. 6d. in Australia. The South African producer of wheat and wool is able to buy wire and other requirements much more cheaply than the Australian farmer, who has-to compete with him in the markets of the world. Another point emphasized in England is that no industry should be entitled to protection which is not prepared to render itself efficient. The London Times saysII the basic assumption is that any indushas been given, and declare that they try can claim a tariff as a right to safeguard it from foreign competition, then the experience of Australia may be repeated in this country, the incentive to reduce costs may be impaired, and the tariff may shelter serious inefficiency. Those principles should guide us in the revision of our tariff policy. I have beeu informed by makers of iron and steel that if general costs can be reduced they will be able to export to the markets of the world. The Canadian exports of iron and steel products are valued at £22,500,000 annually, yet Australia can only export primary products. Years ago, before the high tariff duties were imposed, Hoskins and Company, of Lithgow, were able to tender successfully for cast iron pipes for the goldfields water scheme in Western Australia in competition with manufacturers in other parts of the world. A representative of a great machinery firm told me recently that if materials were as cheap now as they were when the firm built up its big business at the time of the Reid Administration in New South Wales, it would not ask for a duty higher than from 10 to 15 per cent., and with that protection would export competitively across the Pacific, as well as supply the Australian market. Great Britain has appointed an advisory commission practically the same as our Tariff Board, not only to determine what protection shall be given to individual industries but also to report bienially on the comparative efficienoy of each protected industry, in comparison with its principal foreign competitors, the progress in the output per employee, the volume of production, the prices charged for the home market and for export, and the development of the industry during the two years, especially in regard to.the export trade, as a means of assessing the competitive efficiency of the industry. The basis of the retention of duties would be evidence of a high output per man employed, reasonable prices,, and success in the home, Empire, and foreign markets. A ll protection, it is declared, should be conditional upon the efficiency of the protected industry. I challenge honourable members to go tlirough the reports of the Tariff Board upon the Australian industries to which increased protection contain satisfactory evidence of the efficiency of those industries, or of the need for increased duties. I recollect that in a report made four or five years ago on the irdn and steel industry, those tests were not applied at all. The London Times, of the 27th February, laid down two guiding principles for the formulation of a tariff policy-first , that the danger of inefficiency should be met by a determination that the tariff should not be adopted for any individual industry unless that were clearly in the general interests, and, secondly, that it should be realized that the height of the tariff is of little importance in comparison",35,Tariff And Arbitration
129,Mr James,What about the price of,36,Tariff And Arbitration
130,Dr. Earle Page,"The price ofwith what happens behind the tariff wall. That principle is applicable to our tobacco industry. High duties on tobacco will do no harm if no undue advantage is being taken of such protection, aud that the industry is not attempting to exploit the public is shown.by the fact that its product is selling at 4s. per lb. below the price of the imported article. 1 am not a free trader; I desire to see big industries established and expanded, and an export trade built up in secondary, as well as in primary products. But we 3hall not be able to export either primary or secondary products unless the cost of living is reduced by the removal of protection from insignificant industries, the bolstering of which forces up the costs of commodities, necessitating higher wages, and bringing about stagnation and unemployment. The community is prevented by this burden of uneconomic costs from encouraging many of its natural industries, such as the manufacture of boots and shoes from Australian hides, and biscuits and cakes from locally-grown maize, rice and flour. These industries, of which the raw material is available in Australia in abundance, should play a part in the export trade, and they could do so if we were to adopt a policy which would enable industrial equipment to be imported at reasonable prices so that industries could be made efficient and u p to date. Such a policy would bring about a return of prosperity in Australia more quickly than in any other country. I commend to the Government party, first a careful study of the policy to which its leaders agreed on the eve of the general election, and, secondly, immediate action to give effect to this policy, because until commendation of our performance up to that action is taken Australia will remain in the doldrums, and unemployment will continue, if it does not increase.

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition praised the effect which the tariff policy of the Scullin Government had had in the correction of the balance of trade. I definitely challenge his statement. The correction of the balance of trade, or the great falling off of imports, was Drought chiefly by one great that was the depression, or the drying up of the purchasing capacity of the Australian people.

I have little to quarrel with in the speech of the Leader of the Country party ( D r . Earle Page), except that I think he completely misstated and totally misunderstands the tariff policy of the present Government. I think that I shall be able to show that we have adhered meticulously to the tariff policy as disclosed and expressed by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) in his policy speech, and endorsed by an overwhelming majority of the people. The Leader of the Count r y party spoke a good deal about an agreement which was reached in Sydney between the representatives of the UnitedI was not "" run "" by the Australia party and the United Country party some little time before the election took place. I am astonished that the right honourable gentleman should quote the terms of that joint agreement in this chamber, and then have the audacity to suggest that this Government has in any way departed from it .

The agreement under the heading "" Tariff and Arbitration "" readsTo create employment and to lower the cost of living, it is agreed that there must be a reduction in the cost of production and disAlthough on a number of tribution in both primary and secondary industries. This can largely be achieved by a revision of the industrial situation and a revision of the tariff, which must be carried out equitably.

Tliat brings home the facts that had the Country party been returned to power, before taking any steps towards tariff revision, it would have referred proposals for duties to the Tariff Board. Where then is the ground for the protest of the Leader of the Country party that we are . not carrying out the policy laid down in the agreement reached by the two united parties prior to the election? Sir agreement between the leaders of the parties, or between the parties themselves ? leaders and the deputy leaders of the two parties. I now come to the policy speech of the Prime Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, just before the last general election. I propose to read that section of the speech dealing with the tariff, because I wish to emphasize the manner in which it honours the agreement to which the right honourable member for Cowper was a party. It also enunciates the same tariff policy as that favoured by the right honourable member for Cowper in his own policy speech as Leader of the Country party. The then Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons) spoke on the tariff as follows:Let me say at once that the majority of the members of the party which I lead have taken strong exception to the tariff schedules introduced into the last Parliament. This attitude has inspired propaganda by the extreme section of the protectionists, directed to prove that the Opposition is a party which stands for a policy of low protection that would not safeguard sound Australian manufacturing from excessive overseas competition or uphold Australian standards of living. Electors w ill bear in mind that on the Opposition side of the House there is no "" whipping "" on the tariff. Dr. tobacco ? a t t it u d e was determined by the f a c t t h a t from the electors of the country, and we it d i d not r e g a rd the d u t y on tobacco solely as a protective one. I am surprised that the right honourable member for Cowper who, for some years, was Treasurer of the Commonwealth, should pretend to be ignorant of the fact that our attitude towards tobacco was dictated by our concern for the revenues of the country. The speeoh continuesMembers vote as they please. One fact, however, shines out clearly. The Nationalist party, which is now included in the TJnited Australia party in the Federal Parliament, has ever been, like its predecessor, the old Liberal party, staunchly protectionist. In fact, with very little exception indeed, the Nationalist and Liberal parties have been responsible for the protective tariff under which Australian manufacturing has grown up and flourished ao impressively during the past 30 years. That policy is s t i ll maintained by the Opposition. Tho Nationalists and the Country parties stood firmly behind tlie Pratten tariffs. A substantia l majority of the Opposition object to the tariff-making of the Scullin Government on two main grounds-the wholesale raising of duties reference to the Tariff Board, and to the subsequent brushing aside of Tariff Board recommendations. Further, they object to tariff-making of a prohibitive kind which they deem surely calculated to breed monopolies. They did nol object to the special emergency tariff prohibitions and surcharge duties for the adjustment of the balance of trade, although they did ask that a time l i m it should be placed upon them. They believe, too, that such emergency measures should be subject to ratification by Parliament within a reasonable time. As to the future, the United Australia party would not, even where it has any disagreement with particular tariff items, engage in sudden drastic change's upon ministerial initiative, and without investigation by the Tariff Board. We helieve that tariff changes of such a character may easily prove bad for industry and business generally, and consequently for employment. Where the tariff has been raised to what may be considered excessive levels without reference to the Tariff Board, we would submit cases for hearing as soon as practicable, and wewould in broad principle abide by the recommendation of the board. We do not believe it possible to remove tariffmaking from Parliament, but we strongly favour f u l l investigation by a non-political tribunal before duties are altered. We fully recognize the great importance of local manufacturing and of the dependence of a great section of our farmers who do not produce for export, upon the consumption demand of the industrial workers. agreed upon by the party leaders.

The right honourable gentleman would have the committee believe that Australian manufacturers enjoyed that difference in the way of protection. true,* but when the right honourable gentleman suggests that it jvill be very easy to overcome the difficulty this causes, he showed that he has given very little attention to the problem. He overlooked the fact that the exchange against Japan is only about 15 per cent. If , as suggested, the Government reduced the tariff by 55 per cent., the position of imports from the TJnited States of America would be where it was when Australia was on par, but the tariff would be some 30 per cent, lower than if we were at par in respect of Britain, and very much lower in respect of Japan. The right honourable gentleman must remember that we are concerned with ""British as well as foreign exchange. Had he reflected upon that he would be seized of the extraordinary difficulty associated with any attempts to adjust the tariff by allowing for exchange. upon the raw material. of Australian industries would have to be taken into consideration. that if exchange remains where it is, plus L'31] 10 per cent, primage, it is impossible to get the tariff on to a sound basis. Moreover, exchange is of paramount importance in respect of the Ottawa conference. If the right honourable member for Cowper has any idea that he considers would be helpful on the matter, I should be exceedingly glad to discuss it with him in the friendliest possible way, but it is not at all helpful to the Government merely to lay the charge that it has not effected a reduction of the tariff. There are a few increases in the schedule based on sound Tariff Board reports, and I trust that the committee will accept them. The Government does not turn from Tariff Board recommendations even for an increase, because it recognizes that it would be remarkable, if, over the wide range of potential Australian manufacturing, there did not arise, from time to time, some sound and legitimate extension deserving of tariff assistance. I look forward to that extension confidently in the years to come. When an attractive item comes along soundly That may possibly be supported by the Tariff Board, I shall recommend it with just as much goodwill as I would a reduction from the high rates imposed by the Scullin Government. It may be thought that the Government is proceeding slowly and with excessive caution, but it is following its policy. I think that within a year from now, it will be found that the Tariff Board has covered the main features of the schedule, and will have made important recommendations as to the majority of our tariff items. Any delay in refusing excessive duties may prove of advantage to us economically ancl industrially. So long as we have an exchange and primage position against the importer of some 35.per cent, we have what is more or less a prohibitive tariff, even assuming that it is on the 1921-28 level. If this big task is carried through within some twelve or eighteen months of the election of the Government, this Administration will have conscientiously and effectively given effect to the policy upon which it went to the country.

147,Mr Gullett,"Yes. Quite a numberthey have been adopted only because the Tariff Board reports on the subject were conclusive. assured that in such instances the board has made it abundantly clear that those industries should never have been brought into existence by my predecessor in office, that they are in the fullest sense exotic, and a tax upon industry and the people rather than a benefit to them. When tariff making is carried to extremes, a crippling burden is placed upon the proper development of really worth-while industries. If I were to express what I consider to be an ideal protectionist policy for a country such as this, it would be oue giving an adequate measure of protection for carefully selected industries of magnitude for which there was opportunity here, having in mind raw material, climate, and particularly a sufficient market. Having selected those industries, I should service them with the cheapest supplies to be found anywhere in the world. In my deliberate opinion such a policy would quickly place quite a range of Australian manufacturing industries upon a limitless market. It would lead to the employment of a very much larger number of people than we have in the Commonwealth to-day and, with better industrial conditions, would make a stronger industrial Australia'. outset I should like to say emphatically that the farmers of this country are not free traders. It is utter nonsense to assert when he mentions in his annual report continually that they are. They are prepared to see our secondary industries established and prosperous, on sound, economic lines; and the burden on the community must not be out of proportion to the advantage derived from the protection that is given to manufactures. Towards the end of September we obtained the 1931 report of the Tariff Board. It so strongly exposed the injustices and iniquities of the tariff schedule, and supported the Country party's view regarding the stranglehold of the tariff upon living costs and the primary industries, that when it was suggested to come to terms on a common policy with the TJnited Australia party, the Country party insisted that one of the main conditions should be an early revision and reform of the tariff, to cheapen living, and to give primary industries a chance. This The committee may be condition was accepted by the party now in power. It was advocated by several of the Ministry, was submitted to the people, and the numbers of the United Australia party and the United Country party in the House demonstrate the people's approval of it. But what do we find? The Governor General's address was far from reassuring, and now the mountain in travail has brought forth a mouse. When the people in the country assert that our party has been "" sold a pup "", we have no defence. If to-day's schedule were analysed, and allowance made for primage and the economic protection through exchange, it would be difficult to find an item in it on which Australian manufactures have not more protection than in 1930. Indeed, any member who has troubled io analyse the new schedule will have noticed that, with the exception of the material for gramophone records and the marble for our tombstones, about which few of us worry until it is too late, there are but two items where there seems any prospect of even a small reduction in the price of the. commodity. One is welded links over half an inch, and links for machinery. The other is tools of trade. If this is the Government's conception of a revision of the tariff to reduce costs, its impotence is apparent. It is no wonder that Mr John Heine, president of the Metal Trades Employers Association, chuckles that the assurance from the Honorary Minister for Customs that "" he will not disturb or alter the existing tariff schedules"" will be of great value to manufacturers. A perusal of the reports of the Tariff Board, in which instances are given of applications for increased tariff where balance-sheets show a profit of 12£, 37 and 100 per cent on capital, makes it evident that the profiteering of manufacturers needs checking. Irrespective of the approaching conference at Ottawa, it is time for action to be taken in regard to the tariff. There is no justification for the Government's delay in putting the pruning knife into the tariff as promised, so that production costs may be reduced. Today, primage, shipping costs and ex-",41,Eable Page Wha T About That Is The Very Same Policy Which Was
148,Mr Nock (Riverina) [8.40],"A t thechange, which aggregate 50 per cent., should be ample protection for any efficient economic industry in Australia. Every one knows that even the most unnatural industries can be established in Australia-a t a cost; but if protection is given to any industry to secure an advanced price, some other section of the people must contribute the cost of it. In not a few industries so fostered, the bounty or added prices have exceeded the actual wages paid, and if equity is to be restored in tariff matters, all interested in too dear for people to buy. In spite a tariff's effect should be considered. Excepting the Government, with its revenue view-point, there are four parties interested in the tariff, namely, the manufacturer, their employees, other producers who need partly manufactured goods as their raw material, and the consuming public. But in the past the industrial manufacturer and his employees seem to have "" scooped the pool"". I say very definitely that I am not prepared to support the continuance of such a policy, or a government that permits one section to charge another section unreasonable prices for their tools of trade, machinery or goods, and disregards its responsibility to protect the consuming public from exploitation by over-protected monopolies. Our manufacturers harp on the influence of the wage rate on the price of goods, and we know that that is a big influence; but it is not the only one. Capital in industry demands its interest, and where this has been watered or inflated by the issuing of bonus shares, the higher overhead has as much effect on prices as the wage rate. What we need is cheaper services, cheaper interest,and cheaper goods; then, with cheaper living, we may ask for a lower wage and equalize the sacrifice. One of the greatest causes for complaint to-day is the lag in the price-drop of retail goods, after wages have been cut. If the price of secondary products had been reduced like the price of primary products, tliere would be very little standard, even at a lower wage. It is reasonable to ask the manufacturers to see that there is no delay in passing on the drop in wages, interest, rent, and material from which they have benefited. It seems to me that the only way to force them to face the music is hy reducing the tariff. In my opinion, the test of the justification for a tariff should be the employment provided in relation to the price burden on the people. In 1928, there were 259 items of the tariff at 40 per cent, and over, and to-day there are 600 such items. In how many items has the employment versus burden test been applied? Because it has not been applied, the cost of living has mounted and many classes of goods have become of the jubilation of Mr Bennett and the manufacturers when the last Government capped the tariff edifice, we find that, with the highest tariff on record, hundreds of factories have been closed, and unemployment was never worse. I recognize that the generalities in my criticism of the present extreme policy, and the expression of my opinion that a change is necessary, need support in detail. I shall, therefore, refer to a few specific tariff items to show how they add to the cost of living, and directly menace the extension, and even the existence of our primary industries, and how the repercussions, and the higher costs, through dearer living, are like tentacles encircling and crushing the very industries it is desired to help. It has frequently been claimed, and many Tariff Board reports confirm the opinion, that many of our industries seek and need protection, hecause of the high Australian cost of the materials they use. Consequently, the first item with which I shall deal is the big basic industry of iron and steel. 1ST© one denies the value of a key industry. I recognize that in ore production, coal production, and the smelting and rolling processes, the iron and steel industry provides a great deal of employment. But any economic analysis of its value to the community must be assessed by a comparison of the labour with its cost. I claim that with the prices that the steel works charge for their products to-day, which are made possible by our high prodrop in the living tection and monopoly control, the industry has become almost an incubus, instead of an asset to the country. It is adding to the cost of transport, and oppressing every other industry that needs its products for development, production, and construction or as raw material for other manufactures. Whether it be the metal for a railway engine, or the rails that the locomotive runs on, whether it be the metal in a concrete mixer, the girders * in a boot or clothing factory, the farmer's plough, a roll of wire, or a pound of nails, each carries the burden, and the people affected are appealing for relief. I recognize that in dealing with these matters the most convincing argument is the price list, and for that reason I bring before honourable members a few prices which prove my assertions. I shall deal first with pig iron. windows, costs so much more than in I quote the following prices:-English, £3 5s. per ton, Continental £2 13s., and Australian, £6. I find that though there is a natural and economic protection of over 100 per cent., there is a further protection by the primage of 11 per cent., and by tariff of 20s. and 40s. per ton. In the case of rods and steel bars, the English f.o.b price is £6 5s., the Continental price £4 10s; and the Australian price £12 6s. 3d. I am not referring to the ordinary retail price quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald once a week. I believe that that figure is between £16 and £17 per ton. The figures I have quoted represent the lowest wholesale price. and exchange in relation to rods and steel bars amount to £4 12s. 6d. in respect of the English product, and £3 12s. 6d. in respect to Continental; and tariff and primage duties add £4 .8s. 9d. to the English, and £6 9s. lOd. to the Continental products. The total protection is, therefore, £9 Is. 3d. on the English product, which costs £6 5s., and £10 2s. 4d. on the foreign product, which costs £4 10s. This works out at a protection of over 140 per cent, on the English product and 220 per cent, on the Continental. I come now to channels and girders. The position in this case is very little better. The f.o.b. price of this proa reform of the tariff brings cheaper duct in England is £7 12s. 6d. per ton, on the Continent £4 15s. per ton, and in Australia £12 15s. per ton. Exchange and transport charges amount to £4 8s. Id. in respect of the. English product, and £3 3s. 9d. in respect to the Continental. Tariff and primage account for £4/ 6s. 9d. in respect of the English product, and £6 15s 6d. in respect of the Continental. The total protection in this case is, therefore, price, and many have no idea of the 115 per cent. English, and 209 per cent. Mr Nock. Continental. With galvanized hoop iron the position is just as bad. The price of this in England is £15 10s. per ton, and in Australia £26 16s. per ton. Tariff, primage, transport, and exchange account for £11 6s. 7d., and on this item, the local producer is using every penny of this protection. What chance have our factories to export their products or to compete with imports, when their machinery, their roofing, their shafting, every girder in their building, and even every pane of glass in their other countries? This compels them to charge higher prices, and to demand a high protestion to carry on. That is what makes living dear, and artificial wage rates necessary. It maintains high production costs, and makes it quite impossible for our secondary industries to share Australia's burdens by producing goods for export. Surely the tragedy of the position is apparent. No one objects to supporting a healthy industry in its infancy, but surely it is time some of our industries got off the bottle. . The potentialities of Australia are unequalled; its mineral, coal, its primary products, are available at the lowest prices in the world; Shipping costs with hides, wool and wheat it is the same; yet by the time any of them reach the secondary stage they are too dear to export. I believe that the Government knows that the extreme tariff is the cause of these-conditions. Certainly the-people recognize it, and they are impatiently looking to the Government, and expecting it to redeem its promise of a real tariff reform. Let us take, by way of example, farm machinery. As I pointed out before, with these high costs of raw material, no machinery maker can compete with imports, without some tariff assistance. If living and wages, and cheaper material and transport, then not only machinery, but also the things produced by machinery could be turned out at prices that would pay, industry would extend, and men would get back to work. As a farmer, I pay tribute to the excellent quality of the Australian farm machinery, but we do object to the increased burden on farmers in this direction. It is not necessary to go back to 1902, when the price of the 6-foot binder was £32; in 1914, it was £38, and to-day it is £76. In 1914, a mower was £21 15s.; to-day it is £36 15s. A 6-leaf set of harrows with swing in 1914 was £6 10s.; to-day it is £11 18s. 6d. The 8-foot reaper thresher in 1914 was £133; to-day it is £175. A horse rake in 1914 was £10 10s.; to-day it is £21 10s. When one reviews the extreme protection which the machinery industry enjoys, the reason is apparent. Let me give you a few more figures. If we add the duty and primage to the natural protection on a binder to-day they amount to 147 per cent. On a hay rake this protection totals 141 per cent; on a reaper thresher, 135 per cent; on a combine harvester, 124 per cent.; on duplicates, 100 per cent.; and on an oil engine, 159 per cent. If the tariff and the primage duty were removed, these machines could be sold to the farmers at practically the 1914 p""rices. Within the last few days, I obtained a quotation, and allowing for the tariff and the primage duty, the price was practically the same as that charged to the Australian farmers in 1914. of which the honourable member has quoted the 1914 price imported? to the average farmer would these price variations make in a year? ence less than 100 per cent., and it amounts, in some instances, to 159 per cent. On the average, the local prices are within a margin of 15 per cent, of the prices which the total protection would enable the manufacturers to charge. The prices demanded by the manufacturers of machinery are within from 15 per cent, to 18 per cent, of those which could be charged under the high protection that is enjoyed. Is the farmer of Australia to be expected to supply the world's markets with his commodities, and compete with producers in other parts of the world, whose machinery is obtained on a free trade basis? farmers have to grow their products in a protectionist country, and sell them on the world's markets. It is the responsibility of the Government to see that the industries which provide much of the real wealth of the country are fairly treated. a free trade basis. tariff position generally as it effects the farmers. Quite recently, when the new tariff came into force, certain prohibitions were removed from some of the machinery that the farmers had been accustomed to import, and last year the local manufacturers allowed a 5 per cent, discount off the prices of their machinery. On Friday last, I inquired whether that reduction still held good, but I was informed that it could not be given at the present time, and that it was not known whether it would be allowed this season. Despite the excessive protection enjoyed, the manufacturers have practically raised their charges by 5 per cent. The buying capacity of the farmers is not sufficient to enable them to pay the high prices now demanded for machinery. Railway returns at Albury show that last year less than 100 harvesting machines were transshipped across the Victorian border into New South Wales, compared with an average of over 500 a year for the previous three years. Perhaps one of the most outstanding instances of the hurdens imposed on the consumers by local industries is furnished by the price of galvanized iron. Neither the Newcastle Steel Works nor the machinery manufacturers can be accused of using in their prices the f u l l protection available, but in the case of galvanized iron, no consideration has been shown for the consumer. Indeed, the Tariff Board estimates that this industry has cost the community no less a sum than £300,000 a year. For some time the Australian company was getting a bounty of £4 10s. per ton, which exceeded the aggregate sum paid in wages to the employees in the industry. Thus we had the extraordinary anomaly of the. people providing a private company with the whole of the labour required by it, and Our the consumers paying a higher price for their iron than was charged in any other country in the world in which it is manufactured.

Naturally, the farmers want to know how this comes about, and a careful analysis shows that between 30 per cent, and 40 per cent, of the extra cost is directly due to the tariff. I submit , on behalf of the primary producers of Australia that it is an iniquitous injustice that these burdens should be heaped upon them by protection, to subsidize another section of the community, when they are compelled to sell their products in the free trade markets of the world. Mr Delprat declared at the opening of the Newcastle Steel Works that their industry would be able to compete against overseas manufacturers without tariff protection, because of the natural protection available to it. As I have already indicated, the Australian iron and steel industries are no longer in the infant stage; they should be able to stand on their own feet. I desire to go a little deeper into the causes of these high Australian prices. It is said that there has been collusion between the manufacturers and the employees to secure a high tariff, regardless of the effect on the consumers. effect of such a policy is that the whole community suffers, by reason of the increased cost of living. During the time in which have risen 100 per cent., the living standard has probably not been improved by more than 1 per cent. Theincrease of nominal wages has not been to the advantage of the workers, but has caused material hardship, and has increased the cost of production in the primary industries. obligation upon the Government to hold the balance fairly between the manufacturers and the industries which need their products. Let me delve a little further into the cause of the high prices in Australia. I have referred to collusion between the representatives of the, manufacturers and the industrialists for what appeared to be their mutual advantage, regardless of the effect on the consumer; but, when the tariff habit took possession of industry, prices of goods were found to jump more than the wage increase; turnover decreased, the cost of living increased, and hands were reduced. The manufacturers now shelter behind the workmen, and blame the wage rates as the cause of the high prices of their goods. Some will say that the cost of production has increased of late years, but I submit that the application of science and improved machinery to industry has counteracted the advance in wages. In Pittsburg, in the United States of America, the price of steel is within three dollars per ton of the price 60 years ago; yet in Australia every bridge or factory that needs a steel girder, a machine, or a pane of glass, is handicapped equally with the farmer, while the worker is getting the blame. Even in the last tariff debate the then Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) claimed that the higher tariff on these commodities was necessary to enable the Australian wage rates to be maintained. It is the tariffs that have raised living costs, and although we cannot continue to protect one industry so that it may pay five times the wage rate of Belgium, four times that of Germany, nearly three and a half times that of France, and almost double that of EngThe land, while those who supply the employees with foodstuffs are not receiving even £1 a week, I quite agree with the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr the wage rates Forde) that wages alone must not carry the blame. On this point the Tariff Board has already made a "" showdown "" in quite a number of the industries. The price of copper wire, made from local metal, with a 30 per cent, duty, plus natural protection, was 47 per cent, above the English maker's price, although he Surely there is an had to pay freight on the raw copper from Australia. As the total wages were but 10 per cent, of the cost, the 47 per cent, margin certainly looks suspicious. Paper pulp is admitted free, and the direct labour costs of manufacturing 17,000 tons represented only £76,000. Yet the users were paying £212,000 more than if the finished product had been admitted free of duty. When the excess charge for the local article is 200 per cent, more than the total wages paid in the industry, we are entitled to ask whether the cause is inefficiency or exploitation. The manufacturers of superphosphate, giving evidence ""before the Tariff Board, said that the labour cost was 7s. per ton. The margin between the lowest price charged and the cost of material was £1 Is. lid. a ton -In this instance, there was a natural protection of 17s. 6d. per ton, even before the increase of the exchange rate, and tariff protection of 17s. 6d. to cover 7s. worth of few general remarks on the tariff. I have wages. In connection with galvanized iron, when the bounty payment covered the whole of the wage costs, there was still a difference of several pounds per ton facturers and those who speak for between the prices charged by Lysaghts Limited and those quoted at the English factories. AlthoughI admit that there must be an adjustment or levelling up in the distribution or the division of the national income to all parties, I submit that in many instances, after the whole of the wages paid had been deducted, the prices charged would still need a good deal of explanation. We read recently, that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, with reserves of £6,380,000, representing over 100 per cent, of its capital, was paying a dividend of 12£ per cent., and yet was seeking a 10 per cent, cut in wages. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company, despite the fact that it has paid off a large number of debentures, has accumulated reserves to the amount of £3,710,000, although its capital is only £2,927,000. these profits came from the Newcastle factory or from the mines, but we do know that, although the company has availed itself of the statutory reduction of interest on its debentures, although coal prices were reduced during the last two years, and although protection by exchange and primage amounts to 36 per cent., the tariff has remained high. It is quite clear from the facts I have mentioned that by many industries the tariff is being abused. I could mention many other items such as holts, plough chains, split links, road machinery, and water pipe fittings, in respect of which the users have been sacrificed to the manufacturers. But we can deal with them when' we are considering the schedule in detail. The people in the country are becoming impatient.. They were promised that the Mr Nock. tariff would be reviewed and that duties would be reduced to give the primary industries a better chance. The sincerity of the Government's promises will he judged by the extent and value of the tariff reductions it effects during the next twelve months. The country is looking for this relief now; I pray that it may be given soon. advantage of this opportunity to make a been struck by the predominance in all tariff discussions of those who take up the cudgels on behalf of the manuthe workers. Listening to these advocates, the impression is given that the community is divided into these two classes only. But, important as they are, they represent probably only from one-third to one-half of the total community, which is entirely composed of ..consumers, and it is the interests of the consumers I wish to stress this evening. Australia is almost unique in its remarkable indifference to the interests of the consumers. In most other countries political parties vie with each other in their enthusiasm to espouse the cause of the consuming masses, by endeavouring to keep down the cost of living. This indifference to the cost of living in Australia is largely due to the existence of our machinery for industrial arbitration which considers the We do not know whether question of the ability of those working under awards to meet upward variations in the cost of living. The Arbitration Court affects not to be concerned with the cost of living, in that as the level rises or falls the wages of the workers are adjusted accordingly. But there is a large body of people in the community for whom there is no wage-fixing machinery to adjust their income to their outgoings. I refer to pensioners, small shopkeepers, and people with limited fixed incomes, who have not the benefit of coming under any wage fixing tribunal. We know where the disregard of the cost of living has led us in the increasing upward spiral of higher tariff protection and higher nominal wages. The time has gone by when we can be indifferent to the cost of living. The relation of the cost of living",45,Eable Page Wha T About That Is The Very Same Policy Which Was
155,Mr Casey (Corio) [9.21],"I taketo the cost of production is manifest, and the relation of the Australian standard of living to world conditions and prices has been brought home forcibly to us during the present depression. seems evident that in the future the world will experience lower prices, wages, costs of production, and lower cost of hiring capital; whilst the levels may be higher than they are at present, they will be low compared with what they have been in the past. If we are to maintain the highest, possible standard of living in Australia, we must give closer attention to the cost of living than we have done hitherto. Tariff protection is a concession given by the community as a whole to relatively few manufacturers, and the mass of the people can legitimately demand the greatest possible efficiency in the conduct of industry. The consumer is justified in requiring the maximum value for his money, and unless protection goes hand in hand with the utmost efficiency, it becomes merely an additional tax upon the people and increases the cost of living. The employees in the secondary industries are at the mercy of four factors-first , and possibly not the most important, the height of the tariff wall; secondly, the rate of exchange; of an article of consumption would be a thirdly, the purchasing power of the community-and this is one of the most important; and fourthly, the ability of the world to absorb our primary products at prices satisfactory to the producers. I am leading up to the simple point, that if , at this moment, the Tariff .Board is under instructions to take into account efficiency of industry, it should be definitely told to have more regard in future to that factor in determining the advice to be given to this Parliament regarding the level of the tariff. I am not sure whether the board is allowed to take into account the selling prices of goods in any industry under its observation, but if not, that is a point which the board might legitimately be asked to consider in the future, and include in its recommendations to Parliament. I feel justified in offering a few words in reply to the complaints which have been made of the secondary industries, particularly in relation to the duties and embargoes imposed by the Scullin GoIt vernment. Honourable members must not overlook the fact that the banks demanded that action should be taken to stop the inflow of imports with a view to correcting the adverse trade balance. That result has been produced by the operation of the tariff, and the present Government is enjoying the benefit of an improved trade balance. I have great sympathy with the man on the land, but many of his complaints of the undue protection of the secondary industries are not justified. Examining the tariff schedule, we find that on nearly every primary product the duties are higher than those on manufactured goods. On raisins the duty is 6d. per lb. Australian butter is 6d. per lb. dearer here than it is in London. A duty of from 4s. to 6s. per dozen half-pints is imposed on asparagus tips, and there is a duty of 2d. per lb. on peanuts, which grow as readily as wild oats. On all primary products Parliament has imposed duties of from 100 per cent, to 200 per cent. Suppose that we admit-and I do not admit it that the tariff makes commodities dearer, then a 10 per cent, increase in the price bigger tax upon the people than an increase of 100 per cent, in the price of a commodity that would last for 40 or 50 years. If some honourable members had their way, we should all be hewers of wood and drawers of water. We can make, in Australia, every requirement of mankind. We have the best workmen in the the world, and the rails manufactured here compare favourably with those manufactured elsewhere; in fact, they are submitted to a more severe test. During the war, the transcontinental railway was built. The BrokenH ill Proprietary Company, whose works are in my electorate, supplied the rails for that project, and although the imported article was unobtainable, the company did not increase its price. When the price of imported galvanized iron was £80 a ton, there was no protest by the farmers. Because of the high prices ruling, Lysaght Limited was invited by a previous government to establish a branch of its works",48,Eable Page Wha T About That Is The Very Same Policy Which Was
156,Mr Watkins (Newcastle) [9.27],"in Australia. When the works were established here, a bounty was paid on production, but the company, time and time again, asked for a protective duty in place of the bounty. Everything that is used in the manufacture of galvanized iron is produced in Australia. The company has reduced the price of its products, and when its works are capable of producing 80,000 tons, it is prepared to carry on under a lower duty as recommended by the Tariff Board. Why should we purchase abroad articles that can be made here, and thus take employment from our own people ? The iron and steel duties are not affected by the tariff proposals under discussion, and so long as some honourable members refer to them, they will get a Roland for their Oliver. The honourable member for Swan( Mr the community, but of all parties, and all Gregory) has complained that Lysaght Limited varies its prices. Let me inform him that the company will sell its products to any farmer in Australia. lished its letter to the contrary. the agent to whom the honourable member refers, asked for a rebate on the purchase of a ton of material. Although the company will not allow rebates on quantities of less than two tons, it is prewhile we have protected industries we pared to sell its products to anybody, whether farmer or agent. The people of Western Australia are not prepared to manufacture for themselves. I know of one man who was refused permission to draw wire there. What is the transcontinental railway and air service costing this country? The air service, which is competing with the railway, is costing this Government £32,000, and the railway itself is costing £1,500,000. We do not complain about that, because we want this country to develop in order to keep our own workmen and artisans in employment. To-day the value of our imports, taken on an average, exceeds that of our exports by about £15,000,000 per annum. That is clear evidence that our doors are not locked against imports. One industry, which has recently been established, has interests in Western Australia, Queensland, and New South Wales, but unless it is given increased protection, it must go out of existence. am fully aware of the importance of these tariff proposals. Most economists and people who are studying the world depression agree that the three predominant causes of it are war debts, reparations and tariffs. Our tariff policy, as at present applied, is one of the definite causes behind the depression in Australia. If we are to rehabilitate Australia we must adopt some measure of tariff reform. We have definitely dealt with wages, rents, interest and other things, but the subject of tariff reform still remains to be dealt with by this Parliament, and, I hope, by this Government. Our policy of extreme protection to-day is the result of the action not of any one party or section of sections of the people of Australia. I do not speak as a free trader. I believe in protection, and protection wisely used can be, and has been, of great service to Australia. It is a developmental policy, tending to enlarge the scope of employment, and the market for primary proI understand that ducts, at the same time giving a sense of financial stability to Australia. If we were to rely solely on exports we would have to depend for our revenue on the idiosyncracies of foreign buyers, but have a certain financial stability. Australia early in its history adopted the policy of protection, with the idea of developing its industries. The idea was also evolved that we should, to some extent, protect our workers against the workers of other countries, and to that end, a Customs and Excise Act which embodied that idea, was passed'in 1906. It was, however, declared unconstitutional in 1908. Later that idea was embodied in Arbitration Court awards, with the result that to-day the workers, or at least many of them, are in an enviable position compared with workers elsewhere. They are protected against the excessive tariff. During the war that was particularly noticeable, because the Arbitration Court increased wages in accordance with the increased cost of living. After the war, when the slump took place, and Australia was threatened with an inundation of cheap foreign goods, many tariff increases took place. In 1908 there were only 88",49,Eable Page Wha T About That Is The Very Same Policy Which Was

159,Mr Hutchinson (Indi) [9.39],"Iitems of duty of over 40 per cent., whereas at the end of 1928 there were 259 such items. The growth of the protection policy in Australia, which was mainly to assist secondary production, led to a great deal of adverse criticism throughout country districts. Then the cry of country representatives was for tariff reform; but oi late years that cry, particularly in this Parliament, has practically ceased. They have definitely dropped their criticism of the protection policy, and have endeavoured to apoly it to their own interests, with the result that to-day we have a huge protection of not only 'secondary industries, but also primary industries. The increased protection of secondary industries through the Arbitration Court awards, has had the effect of imposing burdens upon the primary industries, and the increased protectectiou of primary industries has, through the Arbitration Court awards, had the effect of throwing back the increased costs upon secondary industries. The result has been that we have become involved in a cycle of rising tariffs and rising costs, which have placed Australia at a disadvantage compared with the rest of the world in the competition for markets. We have been too obsessed with our national policy of protection, and have failed to recognize the fact that this country, in common with all others, is in tbe grip of economic forces which cannot be permanently ignored. The cost of protection for the year 1927-28 was estimated to be £26,000,000 for secondary industries, and £10,000,000 for direct protection to primary industries. In addition to the direct protection, primary industries received further assistance to the extent of £12,000,000 as a result of railway construction and other developmental work. our protection for secondary and primary industries, direct and indirect, cost in that year £48,000,000. Not only were most of our secondary industries protected, but a good many of our primary industries were receiving protection. At that time a protective scheme for wheat was under discussion. Dealing with this subject at the time Mr Giblin stated, in the course of a paper read before the economic section of the Australian SocietyIt looks as if the day wore not far off when the whole burden would fall on wool. The vision that comes is of Australia as one enormous sheep bestriding a bottomless pit, with statesman, lawyer, miner, landlord, farmer and factory hand all hanging on desperately to the locks of its abundant fleece. While high prices ruled for Australia's primary products, and while loan money was coming into the country at the rate of £40,000,000 .p. year, the burden of protection could be borne; but to-day we must face facts, and realize that prices for primary and manufactured goods must be brought more nearly into accord. The Tariff Board is one of the brightest spots of our protective system. It has on more than one occasion drawn attention to the influence of tariffs and arbitration awards upon costs of production. In its report for 1925-26, the board stated that, if the cycle of increasing costs were maintained, it could see nothing but financial disaster ahead, and that at no very distant date. To-day we are actually facing financial disaster, and tariff reform is necessary. In 1928, a group of economists was appointed to investigate the working of the Australian tariff, and, in the course of their report, they stateOur conclusions on effects indicate that the total burden of the tariff has probably reached the economic limits, and an increase in this burden might threaten the standard of living. Despite this warning, the Scullin Government made increase after increase in the tariff, so that, in 1930, 418 items bore duties of 40 per cent, or over, and on 70 items the duty was over 75 per cent. At the present time over 600 items are in receipt of high protection. The effect of high protection is felt chiefly by our main exporting industries. Australia to-day needs to increase the volume of its exports. One of the main effects of the protective Therefore, policy has been to divert production into the protected industries. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Porde) stressed the fact that, during the last' decade, the number of employers in secondary industries exceeded those i» primary industries. Between 1920 and 1927 employment increased in secondary industries by 38.3 per cent., while that on farms decreased by 5.5 per cent. The main increase in employment in primary industries was in those which were in the enjoyment of protection. The pastoral industry, which has to depend upon world prices, showed an increase in employment of only 9.2 per cent., while in dairying, a protected industry, the increase was 26.3 per cent. The honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin), when speaking on unemployment relief measures, stated that, during the earlier part of Australia's history, the drift of population was from the coast into the interior, but that, durevidence that the manufacturers who made ing the latter part, the drift has been from the interior back to the beaches. To a large extent, our protective policy has been responsible for this. Wo have overcapitalization in the cities, and before we can obtain real prosperity there must be a return of population to tbe country. This can be brought about only by decreasing the cost of producing goods for export. In 1927-28, economists estimated that the burden of protection on the exporting industries was equal to 9 per cent. Today, with reduced prices for primary products, and increased tariffs, that burden must, at a conservative estimate, be 12 per cent, or 14 per cent., and this notwithstanding the fact that our main exporting industries are selling their products at less than the cost of production. If we are to settle those areas now on the fringe of civilization as we know it in this country, one of two things must be done, and in this regard I speak as one who knows something of the areas I refer to. We shall either have to find new lands of sufficient productivity to enable the settlers to bear the present heavy costs involved in our protective policy, or we must subsidize the industries carried on by those settlers. To subsidize primary to thrive on inferior lands would be impracticable, so that the only practicable alternative is to reduce costs of production. In other words, we must reduce the cost of protection to primary industry. To-day, we have extreme protection of secondary industries. When high duties are imposed there generally follows a rush to get into the protected industry, and this involves over-capitalization, duplication of managerial expenses and increased overhead costs. Thei'e are too many factories in Australia, and this leads to high production costs, making it impossible for us to export our secondary products. Mr Hutchinson. Proposals (No. 3). High protection has provided a shelter for inefficiency and exploitation. "" The Tariff Board, in its last report, deals with this matter of exploitation carried on behind high tariff walls. The report statesIn several cases dealt with by the board in the period covered by this report there was requests for increased duties or supported proposals for such duties could, by reducing the selling prices of their products, have secured a considerably greater output in competition with imported goods. There was also evidence that the manufacturers concerned, although earning profits which justified such action, had made no attempt to reduce their prices. Instances came under notice where requests had been made for increased duty, or support had been given to increases embodied in tariff proposals, by manufacturers earning abnormal profits. One manufacturer in an industry supplying goods to the value of £100,000 per annum was making 100 per cent, per annum on the capital employed in his business. Another company with an output of £30.000 per annum had paid dividends ranging from 22-i per cent, to 12$ per cent, over the four years preceding the inquiry. In another industry a company having an annual turnover of over £1.000,000 made, over a period of seven years, profits ranging from 37 per cent, to 13£ per cent, per annum on the capital employed. Those profits were not made during depression years, it is true, but the report shows that exploitation had taken place to the detriment of Australian consumers. Before the Great War, when our duties were on a much lower scale, we had an average unemployment of about 6 per cent. During the years 1922 to 1929, when things were booming in Australia, when we were obtaining high prices for our primary products, and loan moneys were coming in plentifully, our average industries to enable them unemployment was 10 per cent., with a rising tendency, which has reached its present peak That shows conclusively that high tariffs did not create employment, despite the fact that conditions overseas had altered in favour of Australian manufacturers; that wages had been increased and hours shortened. If we reach a state in Australia where employment cannot increase without subsidy through the tariff, we must either have a reduction of costs or accept a stationary population. We all realize that one of our principal needs is a greater population, and that to accept a stationary population would be to accept a policy of stagnation and despair. If we are to continue to go ahead, to increase population and increase employment, it is essential that there should be a reduction of' costs, and it has been convincingly demonstrated that that can take place along the lines of tariff reform. An increase in national income can take place only along the lines of profitable production, and if profitable production is to be maintained a reduction of costs becomes imperative. The tariff measures that ha^e beeu introduced by the Government are but a small step towards the desired end. I hope that the promises of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Gullett) will be carried into effect in their entirety. I confidently believe that tariff reform will he tbe means of reducing the gap between primary and manufacturing prices, of putting our exportable industries on a more efficient basis, and of enabling the primary producer to become, as in the past, a greater purchaser of secondary articles. I believe that tariff reform will have a tendency to reduce unemployment, increase population, bring lands thataro at present undeveloped into production, and help Australia in every way to fulfil its destiny.
