34,Mr Palmer,"I desire to ask the Minwho are by preference engaged by the public Departments of the Commonwealth? the ethics. The ethics of the Home Affairs Department is that the men must give nine "" bobs' "" worth of work every day for the nine "" bob "" they get. Home Affairs observed in this morning's newspapers that the former manager of the Singer Sewing Machine Company was in receipt of a salary of .£4,000 a year, with £ 2 a day expenses; and, if so, what does the Minister think about it? up of asking a number of questions based on paragraphs in the newspapers. All parliamentary authorities point out that questions ought not to be asked on mere rumours that appear in the public press. However,. I have followed the practice of the House, and never intervened in the asking of these questions; but the practice seems likely occurred, that is no guarantee that accidents will 1 to grow; and, sooner or later, will have to be stopped. The question of the honourable member for Capricornia, and the question of .the honourable member for Echuca emphasize the position to which I am now referring. Neither question has anything to do with ' the business of the House. I must ask honourable members not to continue to ask such questions. LATE POSTAGE FEES AT RAILWAY whether the Minister of External Affairs, who represents the Postmaster-General, will ask that honourable gentleman to delay the issue of the regulation in regard to the postal fees at railway stations until time has been given for further representations to be made on the matter ? asks me if I am prepared to ask the Postmaster-General to delay the issue of this regulation. I am not prepared to do so, because I am in favour of the regulation. ' APPOINTMENTS. to a question which was asked some time ago, to lay upon the table of the House a paper giving information regarding appointments to the Naval and Military Forces. Ordered to be printed. ister representing the Minister of Defence*. upon notice1. Is it not possible to make Karrakatta Rifle Range absolutely safe by the erection of a simple stop-butt, as is done at the Port Mel' bourne Rifle Range, with complete immunity from accident? 2. Is not Karrakatta Range constantly in use,, and since the position of the firing line has been, changed, is it not a fact that no accidents whatever have occurred? honourable member's questions are:1. No. The Port Melbourne Range has thef u l l danger area reserved behind the targets inaddition to the stop-butt. a. The Karrakatta Range is still in use, but special precautions have to be observed, and it i» anticipated that in the near future, owing to the extension of building operations, these precautions will not suffice to make the range safe. The Minister is not aware of any accidents having occurred since the alteration to the firingline, but assuming it is a fact that none have not happen in the future. the Postmaster-General, upon notice1. Has his attention been drawn to a letter from the Deputy Postmaster-General, Perth, dated n t h July, 1912, addressed to MrF . P. Strickland, of Gourie, Dalwallinu, in which it is stated that the mail service from Dalwallinuto Gourie, being "" a public convenience, thefacility must be made available by the Department to the whole of the settlers, irrespectiveof whether or not they may contribute to the cost"" ? 2. If it be correct that some persons are receiving gratuitously the benefit of a mail servicefor which Mr Strickland is obliged to pay, does he not consider it equitable that Mr Strickland should be placed on the same footing as otber settlers, and be relieved of his contribution to the cost of the mail service referred to? honourable member's questions are:1. Yes, by the honourable member. 2. The reports of the Deputy Postmaster-General, Perth, indicate the service was established on the usual conditions, the Department bearing half the loss and the settlers, on whose behalf' Mr Strickland is understood to be acting, the other half. The Department is not aware of filenames of the settlers contributing. The conditions of personal contribution is a matter of arrangement by the settlers concerned. ter representing the Minister of Defence,. upon notice1.

To my mind, it is rather dangerous to strike out the minimum penalty without reducing the maximum, because by so doing very great latitude. will be allowed to the Courts. a less sum. it is always better that we should give directions to the Court rather than that we and Allowance Regulations should have to forward a request to the Attorneys-General of the States asking them to issue instructions to the magistrates as to what shall be the amount of the fine inflicted, or whether a fine shall be imposed or nota request which was very properly resented by the Attorney-General of South Australia.

66,Mr Glynn,"I quite realize that. Butthe obligations of section 135, or if he fails to attend a compulsory drill, or commits a breach of discipline whilst on parade, he will be liable to a very severe penalty under the Act as.it is proposed to amend it. I wonder what constitutes a breach of discipline? I saw a very excellent review of 5,000 young fellows in Adelaide the other day, and I was exceedingly gratified at the evidence of the discipline to which they had been subjected. They did their work very well; but, with that nimbleness of mind which even politicians display on occasions, they at one stage threw up their hats with joy in saluting. toss on a very large scale. I understand that that was a breach of discipline. for the future. throughout the British Empire in similar circumstances. is not defined what a breach of discipline is. A ll I say is that, for the future, we are adding to the list of offences something that may subject a boy to a penalty under section 135, and also to something else. I want to know what that something else is. At present, if the Senate's amendment of the amendment is not carried, the penalty, if not paid, may be recovered under subsection 10 in any of the State Courts. If the penalty is not paid, and cannot be levied by distress upon the goods, what happens? I throw out the suggestion to the drafting department to consider the matter, because imprisonment does not generally follow unless there is no distress availmeans, not by regulations under the Act, able to recover the penalty. But, as you cannot get distress in the case of a youth,, the result would be, in all cases, arrest for non-payment of the penalty. I suppose that is the experience of the Defence Department. At any rate, it seems to be the effect of saying that the method of levying the fine that is imposed in section 135 is to be that prescribed by the State law-that is, the law of the State in which the penalty is imposed-and the rule is, I believe, that where you cannot get it by levying upon the goods youmay ask for a period of imprisonment. That period may vary in the different States. In some States, I understand, the periods of incarceration are prescribed in proportion to the amount of the fine. In others a fairly liberal discretion is allowed to the magistrate as to the period for which he will send to gaol a person who has not paid up. There, again, I hope the drafting department know what they are doing, because we may have a diversity of sentence under the diversity of State laws. Although this is one law for the Commonwealth, there may be in one State a bigger penalty of imprisonment than is possible in another, with consequent grudging and dissatisfaction. for unification? not yet come for the proposal which the honourable member foreshadowed last year. amending Bill, is there power to send a boy to gaol ? changed the name. What do the Govern-' ment intend by striking out subsection 10,. No; it is accepted which enables the penalty to be recovered as a debt, with consequent imprisonment if the debt is not paid ? It seems to me that what will be done then is to send the lad to a Government institutiona fortress' or in-' stitution, or gaol, if you like to call it so. He may be sent to a prescribed place for not conforming to the rule as regards drill in the first place. Subsection 4 of section 135 saysl a addition to any penalty imposed . the Court may, if it thinks fit, commit flier offender to confinement in the custody of any prescribed authority Sub-section 7 refers to the possibility of escape from the prescribed authority, and says that if a boy escapes he may be rearrested and sent back to the "" institution or place."" "" Prescribed authority,"" therefore, means a place, and "" prescribed , r but by the military authorities, and we cannot check them. It is set forth that "" prescribed "" means "" prescribed by this Act.""' It therefore does not mean "" prescribed by regulations under the Act,"" and I think the Acts Interpretation Act says that, unlessthe contrary intention appears, the word ""prescribed"" may mean by regulation. In saying that, I am speaking from memory. The matter then, if the placeis not fixed by regulation, is left absolutely to the ipse dixit of the military authorities, who have generally a very high idea of their authority in matters of discipline. I speak with the greatest respect of them, but the old tradition of military discipline was that the best way to makea boy's spirit was to break it.

The next question is, for how long? Sub-section 8 says, "" For such time, not exceeding the time for which the Court could, tout for this sub-section, have committed the person to gaol in default of payment of the pecuniary penalty imposed, as the Court thinks fit."" When first arrested for disobedience of the mandate to do drill, he is to be kept for sufficient time to train him ; but, when re-arrested for non-payment of the penalty, the limit of his incarceration is as prescribed by the State law. The Government, therefore, are knocking out the name of "" prison,"" but are restoring it under the name of ""fortress"" or ""institution,"" and may keep him there as long as the State law allows.

I used the word fortress, because, as a matter of fact, in Switzerland, I believe, and in Germany, it is to fortresses that people who commit breaches of military law are usually sent. WhatI want to know is, what the Minister desires to accomplish by this amendment? Whether it is desirable to have these various periods of imprisonment cumulative upon imprisonment for not fulfilling the requisite drill is questionable. I only want information, and I believe that the inference which I have drawn is, on the whole, correct. [3.41] I do not understand our method of procedure in cases of this kind. If ever there was a Bill which ought to be considered in Committee this is one, and why it should be dealt with in the HouseI do not know, unless the reason be to save a little time. Eventually I do not think it will. It is much better to come face to face with difficulties that arise-and settle -them, than to consider them at arms' length as we are compelled to do in a set debate in the House. I regret that I was hot present to take part in the debate on the subject on Friday. The more I look into this matter the more it seems to me that honourable members who imagine that by these means they will escape from severe, penalties to a lighter form of punishment will find that they have merely rushed out of the frying-pan into the fire.

91,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"gaol is that it is a place where persons are deprived of liberty. Nowadays, when we apply humanitarian methods to the punishment of criminals, the essential point in connection with a gaol is that in it a person is deprived of freedom, and from that point of view a boy will be just as much in gaol when placed in a military place of detention as he would be if sent to one of the regular gaols of the country. I admit that the surroundings will be better, and that, perhaps, is a great consideration. But consider what we are doing when we submit these lads to the care of permanent officers of the Military Forces, who will draft stringent regulations providing for the sternest and strictest discipline within the walls of the places where the boys are detained. It occurs to me that with the minimum fine struck out the punishment of the lads will be very much more severe than it was by means of the infliction of a nominal fine by a magistrate. imagine that they are going to get the boys out of trouble by this amendment are making a woeful mistake. doing nothing of the kind. They are simply putting the boys under military regulations. penalties are to be revised, it seems to me thnt it would be very much better to leave them as they are. after taking out the minimum fine. For instance, I would leave a magistrate to fine an offender from as little as is. up to £100. able member do if a cadet refused to pay the fine? what the Bill prescribes, commit the offender to the custody of the military authorities. All that we are taking out of the Bill is the power first of all to inflict even for their parents than the method the present fine, and next to enforce the fine by garnishee. forceable by distress. a debt owing. Is distress to be levied on a hov of fourteen or fifteen j'ears of age? I do not think that the Government would get much by levying distress on lads. At present, the trouble falls on the fathers, and that is the reason for the alteration proposed. But remember that, while you are letting off the boy who can only pay is., and, in all probability, would be fined no more than is. by a magistrate, you are also letting off the boy who could afford to pay £ 1 0 0. treated alike, whatever their rank in society may be. the criminal law provides to-day. Equat justice does not necessarily consist in equal treatment. of bread, he may get twelve months, while a man who defrauds the Customs of £10,000 may get three months. cumstances do enter into the infliction of punishment for offences. A magistrate takes into account the circumstances of an offender. He exercises some discretion, and does not treat all alike. But we are now making it practically certain that all will be treated alike, supposing all to be equally recalcitrant. The boy who is fined £100 under the new proposal may refuse to pay, and can be treated in precisely the So that honourable members who same way as the boy whose circumstances would be met by the fine of is. If any one imagines for a moment that any wilt They are be allowed to escape by the mere elimination of the power to garnishee, they are making a very serious mistake. It pracUnless the whole of the tically means that we are giving up the civil power for the purpose of punishment, and resorting to military methods and regulations. Since we have removed civil interference with the boys, and have turned them over to the military authorities, we may depend upon it that those authorities will insist very sternly on the requisite number of drills being performed, and that the boys shall do what the law says that it is their duty to do. I see no escape from real penalties under the new proposal, and I am not sure that the former method of punishment would not, in the long run, have been better for the boys, and better which will be left in the terms of the It will still be enamendment.

In the absence of any such power a boy will be committed to a place of military detention, and may be made to do his drill under very stern conditions. Honourable members know now exactly what is likely to take place by adopting the Minister's proposal, and I should like the honourable gentleman to tell us why the Government in this ca_e are setting aside the advice of their own Minister of Defence? when this matter came before the Senate the other day, the Minister of Defence voted against the striking out of this civil process. Government apparently supporting that which he voted against. Notwithstanding what the opinion of the House may be they actually propose the acceptance of a proposal which the Minister of Defence voted against in another place. We ought to hear from the Minister whether they are taking this step as a compromisewhether they have counted heads in this Chamber, and know that they cannot do anything more, and whether, on the whole, they think that in view of the coming elections it is wise to appear to be relaxing these Spartan methods. Minister must take the responsibility for whatever happens in connection with this B ill , but it seems to me . that there will still be penalties, no longer in reserve, but in actual operation. will have to makt up their minds whether they would rather trust the civil authorities to impose on the boys penalties in the shape of fines that are recoverable, and in the majority of cases do not need to he accompanied by any order as to imprisonment, rather than accept a provision under which boys will be committed to the control of the Spartan military authorities -eve n the Honorary Minister himselfnot quite realize the exact scope and purpose of this measure. T can understand that it is the desire of Ministers, with the exception of the Minister responsible for the defence of Australia, to meet an agitation which has recently been expressed in this House and to the country against the imposition of penalties for non-attendance of drills. But it is rather astoni .hing that the Minister who is responsible for the defence of Australia should resist in the interests of his Department the proposals now made, and that the Minister representing the Minister of Defence in this Chamber should be prepared to accept them. It is also extraordinary, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Parramatta, that once these proposals pass, the only alternative to civil action will be military action. It possibly has been realized by the Minister of _ Defence, since these proposals were submitted in another place, that he will still have that powerthat while appearing to make this concession to those who desire votes more earnestly than the defence of Australia, he will have all the time up his sleeve this According to the newspapers, power to enforce his will in places of military detention. We should have information as to what the Ministry are relying upon when they make this volte face. We now find the rest of the We are entitled to know why it is they now think that the interests of the Defence Department are secured, when in the Senate last week they thought they were endangered, by these proposals. The Ministry will have to give up posing as the guarantors of Australian defence if they collapse so readily at the mere sign of opposition on the part of one or two members of this House.

So far as the prescribed authority is concerned, that is in existence. The youth will go to an Area Officer, who will put him through the ordinary drill of which he is deficient. In my opinion, the Act will not be weakened by the omission -of the proposed subsection. move what, perhaps, in the minds of some persons would be regarded as an unnecessarily harsh feature, but one which I hope will never be required. We do not desire that our lads shall be subjected to imprisonment, or to any penalty, but it is our wish that they shall be trained for the effective defence of their country -should occasion arise for calling upon their I s it an impertiservices'. This system of training is entirely new in Australia, and I agree with the honourable member for Bendigo, that at its commencement it must be administered with the utmost discretion and leniency, compatible with effectiveness, and that its success must not be endangered by insisting upon harsh features. thing more than a sham, and we ought to vented from snapping their fingers at the authorities. The Minister has occupied out. sufficient importance to justify a dispute between the two Houses. has amply described the provision as a second string to the bow. I am inclined to think that it will be better not to pass it into law.

It may happen that the magistrates of one State will be able to commit for much longer periods than the magistrates of another State. The youths of one State may find that defaulters are committed to the charge of the prescribed authority for a month, and, in another I hope that the State, that they are committed only for a week. This might give rise to a good deal of difficulty, and therefore it would be well for the Government to provide a definite period of commitment, to prevent differential treatment. No doubt the proI t may revision under discussion gives the offence which is made punishable a quasi-criminal appearance which is not desirable, but if youths are handed over to a "" prescribed authority "" they may find that a much worse punishment.

187,Mr Bruce Smith,"The Ministerduty, and in another State the prescribed authority may be a man of a very drastic turn of mind, who will act roughly. for his position. that he will be occupying the position. The honourable member's interjection reminds me of a story of a man who was visited in gaol by another, who said, on hearing his case, "" My dear fellow, they cannot put you in gaol for that "" ; to which the reply was, "" But I am in gaol."" The Government should prevent differential administration by adopting definite provisions. There might, for instance, be a limit to the period of commitment. The Minister has told usI do not know whether the statement is final-that the prescribed officer will be the Area Officer. I am surprised that one occupying a higher position has not been chosen. Area Officers are young men receiving only £15 0 a year, and giving only part of their time to their work, and some of them may not be of the calibre and experience that one would wish to find in the authority to whom defaulting lads are to be committed for training. if we acquiesce in the Senate's amendment of our amendment, the Government will not escape the odium of being responsible for the imprisonment of boys. If a boy is handed over to somebody who stands in the relation of a court-martial towards him, I can promise the Government, from my knowledge of human nature, that they will incur more odium from practically imprisoning the boy in the control of such a person, than they would by any other process. established with the principle of training. been exercised to anything like the extent it will have to be if the figures put before more mature positions.

But the "" string"" that is left will be more drastic in many ways. It will not have that quasicriminal odium about it, which the word ""offence"" conveys; but it will prove very unpopular with those people who do not wish to do their duty. I am not putting that forward as a reason for removing the provision, but only as a reason which the Government ought to take into serious consideration. I suggest that in a matter of this sort the question to be determined ought to be relegated to some person in a Even superior position to that of an Area Officer, who is a layman and may be a farmer, storekeeper, medical man or lawyer. I quite sympathize with the desire of the Senate to remove this clause; but I think that the limit of the period during which the boy is handed over should be the same throughout Australia, and that the officer, into whose charge he is given, ought to be some one in a permanent position who is thoroughly imbued with the military spirit. I do not mean that the officer should be imbued with the military spirit in the sense of wishing to dictate in an arbitrary way; but that he should be some one of sufficient experience to have grown out of that exceedingly militant attitude which we find in young soldiers before they have reached the hundreds of boys, as in the metropolitan areas, who have to be dealt with, it would be absurd to throw the onus of practically acting the part of a court-martial on an Area Officer with £ 1 5 0 a year, and perhaps only a few years' experience. Perhaps the Minister will reconsider the suggestion thrown out in his own speech that this duty should be relegated to a permanent officer.

We have cause to regret it, unless the old method is replaced by some other effective means of bringing the people into close touch with the actual cost of the work that they are authorizing, coupled with a criticism of that cost and its results, as well as a forecast of what these will be if pursued further. At present Parliament and the people appear to be quite content to sit still and allow the National Government, in its motor car, to make off with the finances, with but the briefest of expositions. I venture to repeat a suggestion that is not new; that, especially in these circumstances, and in this country, a real Committee of Finance is earnestly called for. That would be a Committee, representing the whole House, which, without attempting to review the whole of the finances, and certainly without any intention of supplanting Parliament, the control of Parliament, or even its criticism in any degree, would scrutinize the finances in respect to their method and manner of presentment, ascertain the checks"" and counter-checks which ought to be applied, and discover how far they are or are not fulfilling the purpose for which they were designed. terial control away, would you? the Ministerial nor the Parliamentary. The Committee of Finance, from which I must pass without explaining its full functions, would inquire, investigate and report to the Minister and to Parliament, chiefly upon methods, and, where necessary, upon their results. It would be not only a guarantee to this House, but a support to the administration of the Treasury, one of our greatest and most important Departments. At the very outset, I must indicate some obvious errors of comniission and omission, many of them inherited, and, so far as I know, none of them original, which have been adopted and allowed to obtain in the Commonwealth Budget, if not in those of all the State Legislatures. They existed there when I knew those bodies better. In order to relieve myself from the suspicion of making a direct or indirect attack upon the present administration of the Treasury in the preparation of the Budget-papers, I repeat that the present system is mainly inherited. But the manner in which the case is presented to us a. present leaves a very great deal to be e! d .

The need for that instruction has been gradually dropping out of sight, and has been practically ignored during the last tnree years. Take the present Budgetspeech. Here the Prime Minister has pushed the partial practice of previous tunes to its completion. Of the pages of Hansard in which that speech is reported verbatim, twelve pages were simply read. Only three pages were not read, and those dwelt lightly on the six important topics with which they dealt. There was no comprehensive review of the whole situation, no general survey, no attempt at relation, which would assist us to disentangle the details. Consequently,",31,Budget

212,Mr Deakin,"Certainly not, neitherit was purely a skeleton Budget. It certainly was not a complete Budget. In that respect it reflected the features of the printed material in the hands' of honourable two previous Budgets. The twelve pages read contained a number of useful and necessary details, which would have been much more serviceable if placed at our disposal by the simple practice of distributing them in print prior to the delivery of the Budget-speech. As it was, they were mere materials, and overloaded the fragment of a speech. Our great difficulty is, amongst the facts laid before us, to ascertain the real position of the country in any particular. Our perplexities arise from the following of precedents which have been retained and added to with that conservatism which seems to be inherent in-every Department. They were taken over when the first Commonwealth Departments were established. number of the old papers, and introduced new ones. the Budget stands, I venture to say that, valuable and informing as are many Budgetpapers, there is enormous room for improvement. What we are given is nothing like what we desire, or what a Budget might be made. A Committee of Finance would give us a good deal of help in that regard. What we want in a Budget; if we can obtain it, is a statement of principles, of policy, of results, and of forecasts. To give us that, the Treasurer should be relieved of that burden under which he has had to stagger for three successive sessions-the burden of a number of facts and details, which would be better placed in the hands of honourable members in print at an earlier hour of the day. All that the Treasurer should be called upon to do should be to make a systematic, connected, and explanatory statement of the finances of the Commonwealth. -to me if I could follow that course. making the suggestion in the interests of *he Treasurer, and of future Treasurers.

By way of test-and it is the only test that I could think of I set myself the task of looking over the report of the Budget-speech in Hansard, asking myself where I ought to look for a statement of our financial position in regard to Defence. This is one of the most vital matters affecting this country, of special importance at the present juncture owing to the attention it is receiving and the sums of money expended in connection with it. I said to myself, "" For the sake of a test, let me take the Budget-speech and the Budget-papers, to obtain an up-to-date account of our present position in Defence."" I find that in the second paragraph of the Prime Minister's Budgetspeech he made a reference to a sum transferred for future expenditure to the Construction of Fleet Fund. In the third paragraph there is another allusion to a sum transferred for the Construction of Fleet Fund. In the opposite column there is an amount included in last year's revenue, being the balance of the Defence Trust Fund Account. Following that again, there are some special appropriations referring mainly to the Fleet. Turning over the leaf, I find two pages of figures and tables. In the first table is an account of the revenue derived from Defence, naturally a small amount. Then we come to the Naval Agreement and its cost. On the top of the next column of the same page1574-is a table of expenditure not including the amount under the Naval Agreement. After that, we find a series of thirty-six items relating to Defence, from the construction of the Fleet to miniature rifle-ranges for cadets. I venture to add that if any ment.",32,Budget

My criticism relates to all other subjects as well as Defence. It is difficult to get any one to inquire into political matters in ordinary circumstances, and the present method of distributing the details prevents them from looking into political questions of which all ought to be masters in a general way. The consequence of this system is that the delivery of the Budget, instead of being the chief event of the session, exercises little effect. There is scanty public interest in it, and debate can do little to revive or restore it. Yet a Budget balance-sheet for the year before us can be fathomed with comparative ease. Any questions that would be likely to arise in the mind of the average citizen outside can be answered without much difficulty by proper compilations. Why should he be puzzled? His first inquiry would probably relate to the general state of the Treasury, which for the last three years has been in the happy condition known as ""overflowing,"" and he would perhaps ask for a simple explanation of the finances. If he looked, he ought to be able to see at once that the chief factor in the entire transformation of the financial situation that has occurred during the last three years has been the coming into operation of the Financial Agreement drawn up at the Conference of Commonwealth representatives with the State Premiers. This, in the exact terms then agreed upon by us so far as the present term of years is concerned, is now in operation. ment, the Braddon section was set aside, and an entirely different distribution directed, under which the States obtain 25s. per head of the population yearly, while the Commonwealth takes the balance. The result of that alteration is that in the last three years, out of £42,000,000 collected from Customs, the States have obtained £17,000,000, instead of the £31,500,000 which they would have obtained prior to Ihe Financial Agreement; whereas the Commonwealth has obtained £25,000,000, instead of the £10,500,000 with which it would have had to be content. In order to obtain the first grip of the present position, we have only to turn to these flourishing figures, which furnish an immediate answer to the question. The next query that the man-in-thestreet very likely puts is, "" How has that revenue been disposed of by the Commonwealth?"" The answer is that, taking even the expenditure for 190910, the last year prior to the coming into force of the Financial Agreement, and multiplying it by three, we find that under the new system the Commonwealth during the three years just closing will have expended on defence ,£8,000,000 more than it would have expended if it had adhered to the expenditure of that year. I take 1909-10 as being the nearest, and also the highest prior year, and therefore the fairest for comparison. But, even allowing for that, the circumstances of the Commonwealth have permitted us tb expend out of revenue £8,000,000 more during the three years, including the present financial year, than would have been expended in the three previous years under the Braddon clause. Then, again, the Postal Department, following up large grants that we made in previous years, has secured still larger grants, so that £5,000,000 extra have been expended in works connected with it. In respect to the Northern Territory, which is a new expenditure, we also find provision to the amount of about £1,000,000. I do not propose to follow these calculations further. They represent, in rough outline, the simple questions and answers showing the extent of the change since the coming into operation of the Financial Agreement of 1909-10. The Government have also imposed a land tax, which in the time mentioned has yielded them £4,000,000.

The next criticism of the man in the street will probably be, "" But under this satisfactory state of affairs, has not abundant provision been made for public works?"" The answer is, "" Undoubtedly."" Has not what might be termed the surplus been set aside in temporary Trust Funds for public purposes? The answer is that it has. U p to the present year there have been appropriations in Trust Funds that have been of considerable service, and will be of service this year. future which perhaps does it credit, the Government has taken care that none of these funds shall be available beyond the present year. They are all allocated to be spent in one direction or another, and it is certain that, by the 30th June next, there will not be a copper left in the Commonwealth cupboard for any successors to the present Government. a prudential treatment of available fundsPossibly the object is that if fresh levies require to be made owing to unfavorable seasons or other causes, it will he necessary that they should be made by the party on this side, and an increase of the public burden may then be pointed to as a necessary consequence of Liberal finance. need not trouble about that. Air. DEAKIN The n why take such careful precautions against the possibilities of the future? Ministers have revelled in the fruits of the Financial Agreement. They have been able to enter upon relatively lavish expenditure, but at no time, and under no proposal, and by no Act, have they in any way reduced the burden of the taxpayers of Australia. They have thriven, flourished, and received largely; they have spent what they received freely; but they have in no direction diminished the burden which the taxpayers of Australia have been and are carrying. On the contrary, indirectly and incidentally they have added to it. They have not even maintained the protection we had at the Customs House. We have not seen any consideration shown in regard to the States. been enjoying was not discovered by any happy accident -The great bulk of it, as In both respects there I have said, flows directly from the operation of our Financial Agreement, but our fellow citizens and constituents share in its benefits only so far as current expenditure affects them directly or indirectly. might make a reference to the introduction of penny postage, so that he may make no error when he says the taxpayers have been relieved of no taxation. might inform the Prime Minister, was a proposition which was submitted to this House, and for which preparations were made by previous Governments.

The amount is a mere estimate, at all That indicates events, and therefore I did not deal with it. The situation is clear. There has been much more fuel for the Commonwealth Government's motor, and just so much less for those of the Governments of the different States. What the people of Australia have to realize is that, so to speak, the game has been a game within ourselves, a transfer from one to another a transfer from the six States to the Commonwealth, in no way increasing the wealth of Australia.

246,Mr Deakin,"Until the people of the question of the fiscal policy has been brought up each session, instead of revising it, as I have urged in every session, and as I did on the Address-in-Reply in this session, nothing has been done in that regard. The important thing to remember is that by universal assent of honourable members opposite, and, I think, by general assent, it is recognised that there have been continuous rises in prices in Australia, as well as. in other parts of the world. rises in prices and the rises in wages in Australia having increased the cost of living and the cost of earning, they have been diminishing the small margin of Protection which the manufacturers and farmers of Australia enjoyed. in many cases in Australia, to bring us into an active and serious competition of importations from abroad with what our people are or were producing or manufacturing. Deputy Leader of the Opposition say to this? the country will say, irrespective of his fiscal opinion, is that that statement is true; and that the necessary consequence is that the margin given by Protectionist duties-mos t of them affording only partial Protection from the commencement-ha s necessarily been reduced by the increased prices and cost of living throughout the Commonwealth. The importer from abroad has been placed in a position of advantage, and the revenue of the Commonwealth has been swollen, while the producers and manufacturers of Australia have been suffering. has just said that there has been a rise in the cost of living in places outside of Australia. countries, But in .capturing a market a good deal is spent by the long-headed men in other countries with which we do business. This other side of the picture requires to be taken into account. The public are more than a little puzzled why we have not a large surplus to distribute. They are a little puzzled to understand what the present flourishing state of the Federal finances is costing them as citizens of the States and the Commonwealth. Their position is, perhaps, best illustrated by a glance at the Customs returns, in which we find a good deal calling for reflection. It will be remembered that the Tariff we have is that of 1908, and the circumstances under which it was framed and passed will be fresh in the minds of most of the honourable members present, and must be familiar in other ways to the remainder. It is well known that 1908 was particularly a time of close and harsh economies in every direction in the Public Service. We were The endeavouring to prepare for the payment of old-age pensions, putting away money for the purpose; we were making some preliminary preparations for defence, putting away money for the purpose; and, in addition, we had demands from the Post The result has been, Office and elsewhere which could not be denied, and yet could not be f u l l y met. The consequence was that a Tariff was shaped which was not a protectionist Tariff, except to a minor degree and in particular portions. A number of duties which are nothing but, and never were anything but, revenue duties, were imposed, and the greater portion of the protectionist duties were so far diverted from their main W h a t every citizen of object as to be made revenue producing, though supposed to be protectionist as well. Broadly speaking, it was as much a revenue Tariff as, if not more than, it was a Protectionist Tariff. It was the best which we could obtain then. Now, as a revenue Tariff, it possessed features which made it particularly distasteful to honourable members who are now sitting on the Ministerial side. It will be remembered that in 1909-10, the present Prime Minister was Leader of the Opposition, having been previously Prime Minister for the first time. He spoke at that date on this question, not only as the late Prime Minister and Treasurer, but as the head of his own party. What he stated on tlie 25th August, 1909, is to be found in Hansard, at page 2569. Here is his summary of the in different situation when the Tariff of 1908 was just and to different extents. coming into forceTaxation on the necessaries of life, speaking generally and according to absolute fact, falls most heavily on the toiling masses who have Iareer families, and who, themselves and their t families, consume proportionately * a larger amount of dutiable goods than the wealthy do. revenue duties to which I was referring.

This statement was made in 1909 when the operation of the Tariff of the previous year was beginning to be perceived. same debate, on page 2567, the Prime Minister saidThe Statesman's Year Book informs us that in the United Kingdom the average return from the Tariff per head is £ 1 gs. 8d.; in Canada, £ i 19s. 2d.; in Australia, £ 2 6s. iod.

That was and is the right honourable gentleman's opinion-46s . iod. per head was his maximum. I have pointed out some of the factors which have been operating to reduce in effect the Tariff of 1908, but 1908 surpassed 1906-7. Now, it is being broadly asserted at the present time by those who are entitled to speak, that the increases of wages granted by the Wages Boards throughout Australia, or in connection with the decisions of the Arbitration Court, are nullifying such protectionist duties as we have. Look at the taxation per head of population as measured by the revenue duties to which I have been alluding. In 1906-7 it amounted to 47s.; by 1910-n it had risen to nearly 59s.; while in 1911-12 it had risen to 64s. 6d. per head. £14,500,000 was the net receipt. and Excise. the Customs revenue is derived from duties which are either wholly or chiefly revenue duties. looked into the matter. year is practically the same.

IRVINE -The honourable member means that two-thirds of the Customs returns are derived from revenue duties. two-thirds of the Customs duties are revenue producing. Two-thirds of the Customs taxation is received from revenue duties. That is what I meant, as my argument shows. The Prime Minister, after he had been at the head of the Treasury Department, said, as spokesman for his party, that no well-governed country should be taxed more than 47 s. per head from all sources; but this country is being taxed 64s. 6d. per head.

A burden of 43s. in Customs taxation alone, for every man, woman, and child in a family even of only three or four is sufficiently heavy. The total taxation retained by the present Government for three years is far in excess of what the Leader of the Labour party said should be the maximum. Complaints about the great increase in the cost of living come frequently from the other side, and we are entitled to ask how much of it is due to this heavy burden of Customs taxation. During the last three years honourable members opposite have had abundant opportunities to readjust the Tariff, to relieve the people of this .burden. directly to our own people. The taxpayers That would have been something just and wise. They should also have revised the duties intended to operate protectively; but instead of doing so have remained content to draw from revenue duties alone a sum practically as large as that their leader named in 1909 as sufficient to draw from all sources of taxation. The taxation of the Commonwealth from all sources in 1901-2 was 45s. 6d. per head of population; but to-day it is 72s. iod. per head; so that this is fast becoming one of the most highly-taxed countries in the world of its grade of civilization. Our Federal taxation has increased 27s. 5d., and the State taxation 8s., a total of 35s. 5d. per head. Vet honourable members opposite profess to be surprised at the growing cost of living. Mr Braddon, the President of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, and the editor of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, apparently by independent calculation, have both estimated the taxation of New South ales at vv £ 5 per head of population. what they are talking about. They must have included the cost of services such as railways. head is even greater if municipal taxation is added. Sydney Daily Telegraph, the Commonwealth taxation is: From Customs and Excise, £3 14s.; and from land taxation, 8s. 6d. per head; the State taxation in stamp 7s. 9d.; in licences, is. 6d.; a total of £S 5 -; but it is explained that, as some s Customs duties are paid on goods consumed in other States, it would be more correct to fix the amount at £$. tax. cluded in that estimate. The Prime Minister said that if the revenue was permitted to go above 47s. per head, Protection was absolutely abandoned. It is now evident, on the confession of the Prime Minister, that Protection has been abandoned by this Government. The taxpayers' load, instead of being diminished, has been increased. A wiser policy would have prevented this, and fostered Australian industries. Again, nothing is more important, or so important, as our future finance; nothing will ultimately come home so must first recognise that the recent shifting of the burden from the Commonwealth to the States has given the people no help; there is no change in the circumstances of Australia as a whole; the only change is in State revenues. Now there was, and is, and has been from the first, an opportunity for achieving a national end, which at the same time would be extremely beneficial to every part of Australia; which, I regret to say, remains neglected. I speak of the handling of the State debts. The movement and negotiations for the nationalization of the State debts proceeded for many years. I still look on this, as I always have, as the keystone of our finance. When, as early as 1905, a former member of this House, Mr Knox, moved for the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate this question, I cordially supported the proposal, sayingIt is not too much to say that if there is one problem with respect to which the Commonwealth Government should welcome every opportunity to obtain further knowledge, research, and consideration, it is the very proposal witb which this Commonwealth will be called upon to deal.",38,Budget

When later, in 1907, I had the honour of officially visiting London, I took the opportunity of placing myself in immediate relation with the directors of the Bank of England, and one or two leading financial authorities. With the directors of the Bank of EnglandI had the opportunity to discuss the whole question which we were busily shaping, with a view to action. My inquiries were, in a sense, anticipated by a visit which the right honourable member for Swan had paid, at his own expense, to England in the preceding year, when he discussed the same subject with the leaders of the money market. member for Swan attended the Premiers' Conference in Brisbane, he was prepared to lay, and did lay, before that Conference our four proposals. I have not time to read them, but, as an indication of their nature, quote from a statement of the right honourable member, who pointed out, as an inducement to their acceptance, thatBy the time the whole of the State debts were redeemed or converted into Commonwealth stock, it.would mean a saving to the States of ^26,000,000. That would be the saving if the whole was pooled and allowed to accumulate. If , on the other hand, the amounts were paid over to the States as they were made, it would mean a saving of ^15,000,000 in about fifty years, when the last loan now in existence would a matter of the gravest moment to the people. come to an end. We then endeavoured to shape a Council of Finance, on which both Commonwealth and States should be represented, charged with the responsibility of adjusting all proposed Australian loans, vvhether Commonwealth or State. In order to avoid competition in the London market, we intended, by mutual aid, to reduce the cost of flotation and improve our position as much as possible. ceeded in obtaining from the Conference of Premiers in Melbourne a resolution authorizing a joint investigation into the conditions and methods of our co-operations prior to the acceptance of some such proposal, which should prove acceptable after full examination. The present Prime Minister himself made his first statement on this subject on the 19th October, 1905, in a debate on the proposal by Mr Knox for a Select Committee. On that occasion he asked his colleagues and the HouseWhy not face the question now? I have no confidence in the suggestion that the matter State debts.. should be referred to a committee of experts, Minister as Leader of the Opposition, I because, in my view, it is wholly a political matter, which must ultimately be submitted to the electors and determined by Parliament honourable gentleman saidThe question is an urgent one, and it is desirable that it should be dealt with, but a Select Committee will do very_ little in regard to it during the present session. the right honourable gentleman as the spokesman and leader of his party.

I touched lightly upon the question of debts. I think if the debts were taken over it would be a great help to Australia, and as I have already said two or three times, I view with horror another borrower in Australia, nnd at present there is no agreement as regards the taking over the debts.

We have appealed to them to co-operate with the States, but there has been no response. As a result every State is having to act on its own and secure immigrants as best it can by its own efforts. A colleague of the Minister, Senator Findley, equally rash, announced that the introduction of the Federal land tax was "" primarily to entourage people to these shores, and to provide them with land."" Had he forgotten that one-third of the Federal land tax is paid on city properties, and that only two-thirds operates on country properties, under the restrictions I have already mentioned ? "" The Commonwealth was quite prepared to co-operate with the States,"" said Senator Findley three months later than the Minister. That was the same old song over again, in the teeth of the resolution of the Premiers' Conference of 1912, embodying a practical proposal to the effect that the Commonwealth Government be asked to provide 25,000 assisted passages for immigrants. The Minister of External Affairs knows the rest, and knows, also, the reply he sent, to the effect that this would cost approximately £150,000 a year, and that "" it woufd not be wise to introduce a divided control into the matter, as such a course would Be only productive of difficulty.""

Let me now refer to the Minister's misguided efforts in relation to the Northern Territory, so far as concerns the development of its agricultural resources. What we needed was that Ministers, when they first took office, should establish a Federal Department of Agriculture, the chief direct responsibility of which would naturally have been to deal with the Northern Territory. It would, also, have been in touch with every Department of Agriculture in the States, and, co-operating with them, would have brought to bear on our problems in this relation a great deal more knowledge, properly focussed and directed, than we at present possess. In this way it would have enabled the Northern Territory to be better dealt with, and probably with less expense, than in present circumstances. That opportunity still remains to. the",42,Budget

As he has proved quite willing to endow the Northern Territory with all that was deemed necessary in other regards, why not establish the one body that can link up all the Agricultural Departments of Australia and induce them, for their own benefit, to join in their common task? In that way only will the resources of Australia, and the people who are coming here, receive the opportunities to which they are entitled. In the last resort, everything depends upon the extent to which we make use of our natural resources. Everything depends, too, upon our strength, upon the number of people we bring here, or entourage to come here, in order that they may take their share in the developing and peopling of this country. fence.

It would be a sorry day for Australia if any future Parliament of the Commonwealth had to recognise that the time foi multiplying its population had passed that suitable settlers could no longer be attracted to us.

Amongst the conditions making against -us, and rendering it more difficult to attract population, and certainly more difficult for those who are here to provide for themselves as adequately as they should, is the heavy taxation imposed upon us by merely revenue duties.

Since then, not a year has passed in which I have not urged upon the attention of the Government the all-important functions of this body, and pressed them to make it a special feature of their policy. The Prime Minister is in favour of it now, but in 1910, in reply to my appeal, he merely said that he regretted the absence of a proposal to create an Inter-State Commission, and that was all. In 1911 he was a backslider, stating that '' the appointment of the Inter-State Commission is not a quesOur social struction of such urgency as to call for serious comment.""

Therefore, it is with amazement, as well as with delight, that I find that the Government propose to bring forward a Bill for the establishment of the Commission. It should be a special feature of their policy. But in this regard recent appointments made to responsible positions in Australia have rather destroyed confidence with respect to the possible choice that might be made. I have no need to mention instances, or the exercise of patronage. They are perfectly well understood.

This has placed a very great and serious obstacle in the way of our dealing with the State debts and other questions of that kind, in which the co-operation of the States would Be invaluable. man thinks that we did not pander to them sufficiently; that we should have been more subservient to the States? opposite of what I am saying. ( We must pursue our own independent course, but regard the Commonwealth as a whole, and we should continue to do so; but, in connection with matters in which -the whole of the people are concerned as citizens of the States as well as of the Commonwealth, it would have been perfectly easy to recognise both obligations young yet, and it would be better for us, without the least sacrifice of national honour and principle, but with a great strengthening of our national organization and action. conviction, and I reiterate it here. When the Prime Minister finds himself dissatisfied with the results of his efforts in regard to the taking over of the State debts and other matters, I venture to say that a great many obstacles in his way are of his own raising. He might have established the Commonwealth Bank without offence or injury to any of the States. He might have imposed a land tax no less productive than the present, but so framed as to leave State land taxation a free field within its own proper sphere. He might have taken his fair part in adding to our citizens from, the Mother Country. So, in other matters, besides pinpricks, a want of national action between the parties interested has sown difficulties in our path, and will continue to We do so. When it is said that the Commonwealth, as a Commonwealth, has nothing to fear from these conflicts, I might agree, if the Commonwealth could be separated from Australia, and wrapped up in its own fortunes.

It must be recognised that local organizations cannot but look forward with apprehension to the proposals which, are to be repeated at another referendum, varying only in particulars, as we are given to understand, from the great endeavour of 1911 to practically obliterate the States. Here, again, every State is being unnecessarily antagonized by the inclusion amongst these objects of some which could have been accomplished better, or at least as well, T h a t is exactly the by co-operative action on the part of the Federal and State Governments. At all events, our differences on many points might have been minimized, and an approach might have been made much easier if a less haughty and dictatorial tone had been adopted towards the States generally in regard to the sweeping changes proposed in their forms of government. Australia is even though we should run the risk of a slight retardation, to postpone for a short time concessions which some believe to be That has been my firm necessary rather than to have taken action so as to range against us a very strong body of public opinion. This is now making its resistance felt in a variety of ways, weakening the true spirit of Australia, with its sense of national unity and readiness to * sacrifice much for national ends. But I draw hurriedly to a conclusion. Our Federal Union was based, in the first instance, on the confidence of the people, and requires to be retained by as much judgment, discrimination, caution, and friendliness of approach to the States them-",46,Honourable Members Hear Hear

Thus we do not enter into our larger labours with the impetus and unity around us that we expected to obtain. I regretthat nothing has been done towards reciprocity, immigration, and other matters to which I have alluded. This Budget, from my point of view, is bad, because it is based upon burdensome taxation, and prolongs that burdensome taxation long after it has been justified. In three years nothing has been done to improve the position of Australian industries to prepare a national policy of finance and development embracing all the interests of Australia. The great task of the State debts is still untouched. Never have there been such opportunities before, and it may be long before they recur. The motto appears to have been to tax the goods the gods provide, ancl to take care to spend the proceeds. I am not here to challenge the general purpose of the Government expenditure, or to raise questions of economy. All these matters will arise, so far as they can arise at all, in connection honourable member has not dealt with the with another line of argument by other speakers. The argument I have thought it desirable to attempt is based on the broadest lines; and, whether mistaken or not-an y one of us may be easily mistaken-is national in all"" intents and purposes. I have no ambition for Australia, ancl neither hope nor faith in our future, except so far as the Australian citizens are .content to rally to the support of the Governments they have created. I say deliberately, "" the Governments which they have created,"" excluding none. I must confess, if a choice between them has to be made in the future, that many of us will be strongly biased by our sense of the value of national unity to throw our weight into this scale. But whatever is done ought to be led up to in a conciliatory and patriotic mood. That could have been done; it ought still to be done. I disclaim and distrust any proposition submitted by any party which makes for the severance of our citizens, which destroys our sense of :i common country, with common aims, and common principles. I trust yet to see Australians rally to our Federal standards, irrespective of minor local issues. When we have learned to thoroughly sift our national from our domestic and local issues, we may place absolute power over purely national issues in the National Government. Then wherever greater efficiency can be gained by local Governments, as it can be in a great number of instances in this huge country, so sparsely populated, and of which the development must be based upon the best local foundation and upon practical interests, advantage should be taken of them, l t must never be forgotten that Australia, in the. last resort, rests on the intelligence, the judgment, the courage, and the spirit of the whole of its people. We should, therefore, antagonize none, but welcome all under a common standard, to uphold their States under a National Government supreme, but never tyrannical. Air.

I take it that the discussion on the Budget of the country is, perhaps, one of the most important discussions in which Parliament can be engaged. I wish to congratulate the Treasury Department upon having produced what I believe is the largest Budget that Australia has yet known, and produced it at the time when they did. I think, taking into consideration the size of the Budget, and the date of its presentation, it establishes a record. It is an old saying that ''financeis government, and government is finance,"" and that a Government which cannot stand to be criticised on its finance cannot stand to be criticised on anything. The most important part of the criticism from an Opposition should be devoted to the financing of the Government, and if this is not sound the Government is not fit to retain its place on the Treasury bench, no matter what its legislation may be. Seeing that the ladies and gentlemen, outside the chamber, who support honourable members opposite have, for the last twelve or eighteen months, been scouring the country with charges of extravagance against the Government, it was surely the duty of their leader to point to one item of their expenditure which is extravagant; to point to one item in the Budget which he, if in",47,Honourable Members Hear Hear

When he was interviewed on the Budget, two days after it was delivered, by a Melbourne newspaper, he made this comment: "" Taking a general view ""-h e always takes a general view, never a particular view; he does not itemize or specialize-""of the taxation disclosed, and the proposed expenditure, it is a heavy and unwarrantable burden."" One would have expected that in this debate the honourable member would show where the burden was unwarranted, what item of expenditure there was no warrant for, and in what way he would relieve the taxpayers if he came back to the Treasury bench. That is what -we ask that the Opposition should do in all fairness. To-day the honourable member repeated, to some extent, his statement when he referred to lavish expenditure. I took the opportunity, in his electorate, to make n prophesy, and it was that, notwithstanding all his talk about an unwarrantable burden upon the people, when he came to discuss the Budget in Parliament he would not point to one item of expenditure to which he objected, and I venture to say that honourable members will agree that my prophesy has been fulfilled. The honourable member for Parramatta, too', had a word to say on the Budget to the press. He said, "" The Budget is more political than financial. It has been constructed with an eye on the approaching elections."" What does that mean ?

In what way has the Budget been framed? It is a mere statement of the financial position, and, naturally, I agree with the honourable member that it ' will have an effect upon the electors at the 'next election.

Yet the debate on the Works Estimates was longer than on any previous occasion, and a whole day was occupied at the report stage, which establishes a record. The charge against the Government is that it seems anxious to get things done. ment. ber has led a party, and is more culpable than any one else for talking about things without doing them. has not made one correct quotation. orable member's words.

That might be a good thing to do; but whatever honourable members opposite discuss, they suggest the appointment of a committee to scrutinize the proposals of this Government. Why did they not appoint these committees during the ten years that they had the opportunity to do so? The burden of the criticism of the honourable member for Ballarat was that he does not like the arrangement of the Budget, and that it is difficult to find in it this, that, and the other item of information. He told us how many places a certain item was to be found in, and on how many pages it appeared. I have not had much experience in the examination of Budgets, but 1 know that, in comparison with previous Budgets, including even the last, this position of Australia that I have seen.

357,Mr Scullin,"I took down the hon<us with having shown no consideration to the States, and with not having diminished taxation. We have been told that the expenditure of the Government has been lavish, ancl that taxation is burdensome. But the right honourable member for Swan, who was Treasurer of the Fusion Government, stated when the Works Estimates were being discussed that."" in building up this great Australia we could profitably spend much more "" than it was proposed to spend; and complained bitterly that, ^£86,000 having been voted for a particular work, only £37,000 had been spent. ""Why was not the other £49,000 spent?"" he asked. If this Government is extravagant, how does it come about that the Treasurer -last year did not spend all the money voted was, and is, the honourable member would by Parliament? There was hardly a proposed vote in the Works Estimates whicli honourable members opposite, and some on this side, would not have increased. In Vicaccepted. toria the main charge against the Government is its expenditure on the Federal Capital; but the supporters of the honourable member for Ballarat would spend much more on the Capital. -June, the honourable member for Lang said that the expenditure on the Federal Capital is "" shamefully small."" ber for Lang said, "" 1 should have been .willing to spend £3,000,000.""

The expenditure is set down -at £20,000,000; but, strictly speaking, the if the present duties are revenue duties, he Commonwealth did not spend more than .,£14,000,000. The remaining £6,000,000 was handed to the States, for which the Conunonwealth is merely the tax collector. We spent about £5,000,000 on Defence, about £4,000,000 on the Post Office, and about £2,200,000 on Old-age and Invalid Pensions. bonorable gentlemen opposite reduce that -expenditure ? The honourable member for Ballarat made the startling statement that two-thirds of the revenue from Customs comes from revenue duties, a staggering remark frbm one who was at the head of the Government which introduced the Tariff. No one regrets more than I do the swelling imports of Australia; but the honourable member for Darling Downs, in a pamphlet entitled Nation Braiding, giving the record of the Deakin Government, referred to the Tariff as "" scientific and all comprehensive,"" language worthy of his leader. the time. have made it worse, had he had his way. mendations of the Tariff Commission were Opposition complained that the Tariff had been mutilated by Parliament.

The honourable member is silent; he will afford the House and the country no information as to where he would obtain revenue. The natural corollary of his remarks, if he is logical, is that he would impose more direct taxation, or would reduce the expenditure. If the latter, what items of expenditure shown in the Budget would he eliminate? Would he reduce the expenditure on defence? Would he abolish old-age pensions, as suggested by some of his colleagues? Would he repeal the humanitarian legislation of this Government? Would he remove the telegraphic and telephonic facilities that have been afforded to the people? What items in the Budget would he remove, or whatj class of direct taxation would he impose? I find that in 1908-9 the Customs revenue was £8,600,000, while in 1909-10 it was £9,500,000, so that in the last year of the Fusion Government the revenue increased nearly £1,000,000. Was there any suggestion then made to amend the Tariff? Did the honourable member for Ballarat dare to suggest an amendment of the Tariff when he had the opportunity and a strong majority? Was he advocating an effective Prdtectionist Tariff when he went to support the candidature of that ultra Free Trader Mr Conroy in Werriwa? I have been an uncompromising Protectionist all my life, and I regret that it has been necessary for the Tariff to be partially sunk at any period in Australia's history. We can say, however, that there are gentlemen on this side who are prepared to give up the Free Trade principles that they have held for years, if they are given power under the Constitution to associate new Protection with the Tariff. Are honourable members opposite -prepared to make a similar definite statement to the country ? Are they prepared to back up the statement made by their leader in a memorandum issued by the Attorney-General of his own Government, that Protection was not complete unless it carried with it the protection of the wage earners, or words to that effect? T venture to say that the honourable member for Parramatta, the honourable member for Lang, and other Free Traders opposite are more opposed to the new Protection than they ;ire to the old Protection. This GoSfr. SniJlin. If the honourable vernment have stated that, given power under the Constitution to protect the manufacturer, the wage-earner, and the consumer, they will give all the Protection necessary to the people of the country. bition ? yes. Before leaving the question of the Tariff, I desire to compliment the Department of Trade and Customs on their economy in collecting the revenue, for I find that, while in 1909-10 the cost was £ 2 6s. sd. per. cent., it amounted in 1911-12 to only £ 1 ' 18s. per cent., showing a saving of 8s. 5d. per cent. I come now to the question of defence. Honourable members opposite are very fluent when talking about the growing expenditure; and there is no doubt that the present Government have spent more money than any other Government on defence-million s more. But have the Government wasted the money? It is not the size of the expenditure that the people have to consider; it is how the money has been expended. Has the money been expended in the direction that the people have desired ? It is an idle sort of argument to say that so many millions were expended under the Liberal Governments, and that the Labour Government are spending so many more millions. If a business has a turnover of £1,000 a year, and the expenditure is £900, showing a profit of £100, and a new manager is introduced, who, on a turnover of £10,000 a year, expends £9,000, showing a profit of £1,000, what would be the use of the old manager urging that the new one should be discharged because under him the expenditure had grown? Such a proposition would be laughed at. If we can show the people, as we can, that we are giving them something that they never had before-facilitie s through the post-office such as they never before enjoyed, and that we are laying the foundation of an effective defence scheme, which was talked about for ten years, but in regard to which nothing was done ber say that nothing was done for defence before this Government came into power? member for the question, because it givesme an opportunity to emphasize the statement that, in regard to defence, nothing practical or effective was previously done.

371,Mr Scullin,"I thank the honorableat all, because there can only be waste. There are some things that we can do partially, but defence is not one of them. I am not speaking as an enthusiast for militarism, because I have always been an opponent of it ; if I had my way I should put those who cause wars in the first firing line to receive the first shots. But we must not be foolish; we must either have an effective defence or none at all. I leave it to the common sense of the honourable member for Wimmera to say whether there was anything worthy of the name previously done in the matter of defence. From 1901 to 1910-al l years of Liberalism with the exception of very brief periods-ther e was spent £9,500,000 on defence; whereas from 1910 to the end of the current financial year in 1913, the present Government will have expended £12,500,000, or £3,000,000 more in three years than the Liberal Governments spent in nine years. forgets the altered conditions. Liberals? I know, when the gentlemen who sat on the Treasury bench had some claim to be called Liberals, but that time has long gone by. any honourable member opposite would propose to reduce the expenditure on defence? Yet that is the item -which has grown abnormally, and upon which our expenditure has increased by leaps and bounds. There is no doubt that honourable members opposite would have raised that money in a different manner. How? By borrowing. Did they not pass an Act authorizing the Fusion Government to borrow £3,500,000 for the construction of a Fleet Unita policy unheard of in connection with defence matters. I say that the only sound policy is to provide for the defence of the country out of revenue. I come now to another item upon which our expenditure bulks very largely, namely, that of new works. I find that, during the years 1908-9 and 1909-10, the £1,500,000 upon this item, whereas the Labour Government, during fhe two years they have held office, have expended £6,000,000 upon it, or four times as much. Are these new works required? Will any honourable member stand up and say that unnecessary works have been carried out in his electorate? Is there an honourable member who does not want twice as many works put in hand ? I know that I do. If the Treasurer listened to all the appeals which are made to him for the construction of new works, the expenditure upon them -would not be£6,000,000, but £60,000,000. If my honourable friends opposite would borrow for defence purposes, with how much more alacrity would they borrow for the construction of new works which are a permanent asset. Had they been so disposed, the present Government could have remitted taxation, and could: have built these new works out of borrowed money. Had they followed that course, their bill for interest and sinking fund this year would have been £250,000 instead of £6,000,000 during the past *two years. But the £6,000,000 would have been expended nevertheless, and the debt would have been handed down to posterity. It is not long since the honourable member for Mernda advocated borrowing in order to get rid of responsibility. That was the attitude of Micawber, who, when monev became due, used to write out an I.O.U. and say, ""Thank God, that is done with."" That is the way in which the Fusion Government would finance the country. During the past two years the present Ministry have provided money for defence purposes, and have expended I ask whether £6,000,000 on new works without borrowing a single penny. The Leader of the Opposition also referred to immigration, and declared that the Government were not doing anything to encourage it. He affirmed that the Commonwealth had had a splendid offer from the States, which the Minister of External Affairs had not accepted. That offer was that the Commonwealth should expend £150,000 a year to bring immigrants to Australia for the State Governments. The latter were to do the rest. The honourable member for Ballarat affirmed that in 1906 he had a conference with the States in regard to this matter, and that they agreed to provide the land and employment if the Commonwealth would supply the immigrants. He subsequently declared that, as Fusion Government expended the States had not guaranteed to furnish the land and employment, he could not do anything in the matter. But in 1906, when he was contesting Ballarat, he said the Commonwealth would provide the immigrants and the State Governments would furnish the land and employment. That kind of promise reminds me of the young couple who were about to be married. They had not much to live upon, and the young",51,Honourable Members Hear Hear

375,Mr Scullin,"There was a time,lady accordingly suggested that they should subsist on bread and water. The prospective bridegroom replied, "" All right. You forage round and get the bread, and I will provide the water."" exactly the position which was taken up by the honourable member. said to the States, "" You provide the bread in the form of the land and employment, and the Commonwealth will provide the water in the shape of immigrants."" What is the position to-day? Thousands of immigrants are arriving in this country without any land or employment having been provided for them. The honourable member, in endeavouring to discount the operation of the land tax, told us that the subdivision of large estates which had been"" is this so-called loan, about which effected was merely an imaginary kind of subdivision. He said that these estates, when subdivided, had been rushed by neighbours. Evidently there is a land hunger ture to say that the honourable member for here, and yet he would spend £150,000 a year on immigration. The policy of the present Ministry is, however, absolutely the slightest objection to taking all the sound. The Labour party have never declared against immigration, but they have affirmed that land and employment should be provided before immigrants are brought here. From the report of the Land Tax Commissioner, I learn that last year the land tax realized £1,360,000, or £3,800 less than the amount collected from it durare the people. The Government are the ing the previous year, and that the estimated revenue from it during the current financial year is £1,300,000, or £60,000 less than the revenue of the preceding year. According to the Commissioner, about £22,000,000 worth of land was -sold during the first year of the .operation of the tax. know how much was sold last year. There is a significant statement in the rethe same sum of money from the people port of this officer in regard to which I .should like further details. He states that, return the profits to the people as we do, on examining the contracts of sale presented to him, for the purpose of proving that those who presented them should escape payment of the tax, he found that, in anticipation of its imposition, very large .sales of land had been effected. There is not the slightest doubt that, up to the very lected, making a total net profit for the .last day available to them, a number of land-owners almost broke their necks in their endeavours to get rid of their land. The Leader of the Opposition also referred to the note issue as the ""note tax."" He also described it as a."" loan."" Other honout of the note issue. If that is a loan, orable members opposite have spoken of it as ""the first Commonwealth loan."" They Mr Scullin. really ought not to make such remarks, because if it had not been for a sturdy band of Labourites in the early days of Federation, the Commonwealth would then That is have been committed to a borrowing policy. Later they passed a Naval Loan Act for He £3,500,000, and one of the first actions of the present Government was to repeal it ; yet we are now told that the Government have imposed the first loan upon Australia. Our objection to a borrowing policy is not purely on abstract principles. It is not an academic objection. We object to borrowing as a general policy, because under it we have to pay money out of the Treasury into the pockets of private individuals, the bulk of whom live abroad. But what the honourable member talks? It is money which we owe to our own people, and for which we pay no interest. I venBallarat would be floating loans of that kind all his life if he could. I have not money that people like to give me on the same terms. Honourable members opposite have worked themselves into a state of frenzy on the ground that we have been taking from the people of Australia a forced loan without giving them any interest. That is true; but who are we ? We people. The Parliament is the people, and that means that the people are taking the money from themselves. But what did this system supersede? What policy went before ita policy which the honourable member for Ballarat and his colleagues would have retained, and did retain all the We do not time they were in power? It was a policy whereby a few banking institutions took without paying them interest, and did not but gave them to a few private shareholders. The net profit from the note issue, after paying all expenses, for the year just closed was £140,000. In addition to that, the sum of £40,000 was earned in that financial year, but not coltwelve months of £180,000. We are constantly hearing of what the States used to get. They obtained £90,000 per annum from their note tax. We have therefore doubled their profit, with the same people, I am a borrower every time. If it is a borrowing policy, it is a good policy; but it -is very unlike the borrowing policy with which the honourable member for Ballarat had something to do when in State politics, and very unlike the borrowing policy which has hitherto been pursued by the Governments of the different States of Australia. Has the note issue done anything more than make a profit of £ 1 8 0 , 0 0 0 for the Commonwealth? people a safer and sounder issue, and it has done more. It has led to the investment of most of the money with the State Governments, enabling them, on behalf of their people, who are our people also, to borrow on better terms, generally speaking, than they did before. As a proof of that statement, let me make a comparison. In May, 1909, Victoria borrowed £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 from private sources at 3! per cent, at £ 9 8 . The flotation expenses of the loan were £36,200. rowed £1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 from the Commonwealth Government, also at 3J per cent, at £ 9 8 . The money was handed over to them almost immediately, and their flotation expenses were absolutely nothing. If it cost £ 3 6 , 0 0 0 in flotation expenses to borrow . £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 in 3909, it should have cost at least £ 2 4 , 0 0 0 to borrow £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 in to say \ per cent. 19H. There is £ 2 4 , 0 0 0 saved to the Victorian people because the Commonwealth Government issued notes in 1910, and I . have no doubt that a similar amount in proportion has been saved to the other State Governments. The honourable member for Ballarat made what he believed to be a strong charge against the Government for not having taken over and consolidated the State debts. One would imagine that never previously in the history of Federation was there an opportunity to take them over. Some honourable gentlemen opposite excuse themselves by saying, "" We never had the power before the State Debts Referendum was taken in 1910."" Prior to that referendum they had the power to take over £200,000,000 worth of State debts, and that is a very decent little start. The referendum taken in 1910 gave power only to take over the remaining £50,000,000 . Why have not the State debts been taken over before this? The fault lies at the door of the State Governments. They have never come up to the mark; but when the Braddon section was expiring, and the financial agreement was being entered into -with the State Premiers by honourable members opposite, and the whole question of the future financial arrangements between States and Commonwealth was being opened tip, that was the time to put the screw on and say, "" You shall come to terms on the State debts question."" But what terms did honourable members opposite make? The honourable member for Ballarat said the question of taking over and consolidating the State debts was the essence of the contract, but he threw that aside in the secret It has given the caucus with the Premiers. What conditions do we want ? We do not ask for power to prevent the States borrowing in the future; but we do ask that before the Commonwealth take over the burden of the State debts they shall have the power to say "" No State Government shall go on the money market and compete with us when we are redeeming their debts."" The argument in favour of the consolidation of the State debts is always that, by having one borrower with the whole of Australia behind it, and In 1911 the same State borno competition between the different States, we shall be able to borrow money cheaper. That is the common argument in any economics-wher e there is more competition the price is higher; where there is less competition the price is lower. It is estimated by financial experts that we should save at least I per cent., and some go so far as It would be a considerable saving to the people of this country. The Prime Minister has declared over and over again that he is open to negotiate with the States at any time. It rests entirely with the State Governments to come up to the mark, saying, "" We will hand over our responsibilities ; you take over our State debts, ancl redeem them ns they fall due, nnd we shall agree not to go on the money market in competition with you."" The Commonwealth Government could then deal with all the debts and arrange all future borrowings. The honourable member for Ballarat has some sympathy with the question of State debts, because in dealing with it he was dealing with a very old friend. When one looks at the problem, and knows that the State Governments owe' about £270.000,000, or about £ 5 9 per head of the population, one censes to wonder that the Federal Government are not enthusiastic over a borrowing policy. From 1890 to 1900, a period of ten years, the State of Victoria doubled its national debt. The sum of £25,000,000 was borrowed in that time. During six of those years the honourable member for Ballarat was in office in one capacity or another, and the Government with which he was associated was responsible for adding to the debt of Victoria to the tune of about £20,000,000. That was the period when things were booming in Victoria. Some people are afraid that a similar boom is taking place now, but I would remind them that a boom established on borrowed money is established on an unsound foundation, whereas prosperity established on a financial policy, such as the present Government have pursued, is on a safe basis. That boom, begun by the borrowing policy of the State Governments, was helped on by the booming policy of any number of gentlemen who supported the State Governments of the day, and led to the crisis of 1893. We never want to see a repetition of that in Australia. whether it is a burden. There was one most amusing incident in the honourable member's speech. He said, "" Had we remained in power, we should have arranged for a conference, and that would have brought this matter into the light of day."" Why, the last conference they had on the matter was held in the dungeon ! It was secret, with no light of day about it, and we were informed that even the blottingpads were destroyed. like a death-bed repentance, that if the honhas marked the Postal administration since orable gentlemen opposite were permitted to return to the Treasury bench they would have a conference and bring things out into the light of day. We were informed by the honourable member for Ballarat that the present Government had not diminished taxation. Will he diminish taxation if he returns to power? In the first place, that is a most inaccurate statement on his part, because the present Government provided for penny postage, which diminished taxation to the people of Australia, according to the official return, by no less a sum than £470,000. then ? What rot! member for that interjection. I was about to come to the point he has raised. When honourable members opposite criticise the financial position of the Commonwealth, they take the total revenue, divide it by the population, and say that the taxation is so much per head. They include Public Services. ber has done so on more than one occasion. He quoted the taxation per head in a criticism of this very Budget, and included the Public Service. The organizers of the Opposition party go round the country and say to the. electors "" Look at the expenditure ! Look at the amount of your money that is being taken out of your pockets in taxation.! "" I will give an illustration of this so-called taxation which the people have had to pay since the present Government came into office. Take the Post Office. The revenue for the two years 1908-9 and 1909-10 was £7,100,000. During the last two years the revenuehas been £7,700,000. That shows an increase of £600,000. According to honourable members opposite that amount of over half-a-million is an extra burden of taxation upon the people. But go to the people themselves, and ask them Go to those living in the bush, who pay 6d. to use a telephone, and ask them whether they consider that a burden which saves them many a journey on horseback of 40 or 50 miles. Ask the horse whether it is a burden ! Let me take, by way of illustration, a paragraph published in the Age a few weeks agoNow we are told, One of the healthiest increases in revenue that Federation occurred during last month. The month's Postal revenue from the whole Commonwealth was ^323,843, an increase of £45,843 over the total for the corresponding month in i g n . That is, I suppose, one of the burdens which the people have to bear. The more we increase services for the people the greater will be the revenue and the more the expenditure. Consequently the more per head will be the alleged taxation upon the people. But I venture the opinion that the electors want a great deal more of this kind of burden imposed upon them. They are continually asking for extended services. Honourable members opposite have been asking for them. We were told by the honourable member for Ballarat that no consideration had been shown to the States. What consideration would he have shown that has not been manifested by the present Government? What does he mean? He told us that the extra money which the present Government has had to handle has been taken from the States. That is not absolutely correct. What is the position of the States in relation to Commonwealth finance? They receive £6,000,000 per annum from the Federal Govermnent under the 25s. per head agreement. In addition to that the Commonwealth has taken over the control of old-age pensions, which amounts to a saving of over £2,000,000 to the States. We are also paying interest on transferred properties.

Some honourable members opposite do not believe in this policy. They advocate a contributory system. for Parkes is very sweet on compulsory insurance, or something of tliat description.

Look at our pensions system from the insurance point of view. The people contribute to the fund out of which the money is paid. When the objection is raised, "" You do not pay the pension to a l l , "" I admit that the logical outcome of a pensions scheme would be that every one should get not wrong in principle if we pay only to those who are in need.

Let those who do not require old-age pensions thank God that in all was probability they will never see the day Yet in the when they shall need to do so. But l e f us not sneer at those who do enjoy the pensions granted by the Government, and congratulate ourselves that the Commonwealth has adopted a policy of so humanitarian a character. I notice that the honourable member for Ballarat had nothing to say about the proposed maternity allowance. I am glad that he had not. I am very pleased that he has too much selfrespect to be led into the kind of criticism that the ladies-so-called-and the gentlemen-so-called-wh o form the Women's National League and the People's party have indulged in, and that has been -reported in the daily press day after day.

What, then, becomes of the outcry about excessive expenditure in this direction? This Those who are now receiving Government is being charged with extravagance.

If the Opposition think tliat we are spending money in any direction in which we ought not to expend it, is it not fair that they should tell us of it in this House in a plain and straightforward manner? duty which they owe to the country, to the Parliament, and to their own party. Speaking for myself, if I found that they could point out any extravagance on the part of this Government, I would support them in having that extravagance removed. But these general charges-these vague generalitiesabout the extent of our expenditure certainly do not contribute to the better management of the affairs of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Parramatta, .iD one of his recent speeches in this House, urged that we needed to expend more on the Public Service, and, together with the honourable member for Lang, the honourable member for Illawarra, and the, honourable member for Wentworth, expressed a desire for a larger expenditure on the Federal Capital. Then, again, the honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable member for Franklin have asked that more money should be expended on quarantine; whilst the honourable member for Parramatta, whose name seems to appear in connection with every demand for an increased expenditure, the honourable member for North Sydney, and others have talked in this House about the need for paying Area Officers and other military men higher salaries. The Leader of the Opposition himself has declared that we should have spent £150,000 on immigration, yet his supporters tell us that we contemplate a waste of money when we propose to expend £400,000 on the maternity allowance, or on what, so to speak, is the best kind of immigration. Honourable members on all sides have been asking for more expenditure in connection with the Postal Department. these demands, can it be said that there is any foundation for the charge of extravagance? Is there anything wrong about this Budget? Have the Government been lacking in their duty in any respect? The speech delivered to-day by the Leader of the Opposition constitutes the greatest compliment that could be paid to the Government. The fact that, after indulging for two hours in generalities, he sat down without pointing to the waste of a penny, really Ur. Scullin. 4 represents the greatest compliment that the Government haye received during their two Well, I challenge any honourable years of administration. To sum up, the position is that when this Government took its place on 'the Treasury bench, there was a deficit of ,£451,284; that after it had been in office for a year it was able to show a surplus of £1,837,175; whilst the Budget statement now under discussion shows, That is a in respect of the financial year just closed, a credit balance of £2,261,541. In addition to that, there is not a debt that we owe to any one save ourselves. We, instead of the banks, owe to the people the money that we have taken from t'hem by means of the note issue. We have borrowed for public works from a trust fund established by the Government upon the issue of its notes. In . other words, we have taken money from one pocket and put it into another. We have not to pay a penny to any one outside the Commonwealth, and we have not incurred any debts. It is true that we havesome obligations. We have, for instance,, to pay interest on the transferred properties,, and we have also to pay some debts taken* over in connection with the transfer of theNorthern Territory. But no debt has been incurred by the Government itself. Instead of borrowing, we have adopted a lending policy. Out of the note issue fund we have lent £5,685,000, whilst in respect of other trust accounts established by means, of surplus moneys and economical administration, the Government have been able toinvest £1,723,557. The total amount lent or invested is £7,408,577, and the annualinterest on this invested money is £252,124,. or over a quarter of a million. When the Treasurer was delivering his Budget statement, the honourable member for Parramatta interjected, ""You have become money lenders."" This, however, is the first Government that has had money tolend, and we would sooner be moneylenders than borrowers of money, as the Opposition were when in office. We have been asked how we are going to meet someIn the face of all of the expenditure to which we are committed. I would point out that a sum of about £2,000,000 has been invested at short call, and will fall into the hands of the Treasurer within fhe coming year, so that if he desires to carry out any big public undertaking, and requires funds, hecan lend this money to himself as Treasurer, or to other Departments of the Commonwealth that require it, with the result that the interest will be paid out of onepocket and put into another. To conelude this brief review of the financial position, and of the speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition, I would say that honourable members 'ought not, and they should advise their supporters outside that they ought not, to indulge in any stateoccasion. 1 say quite unreservedly that I ments even for political purposes that are calculated to bring the credit of the country into disrepute. National Parliament should consider that the credit of its country is the most important thing which the representatives of the people have to conserve. Statements to the effect that the country is going over a precipice, that there is wild extravagance, that there is a time of reckoning coming-al l of which are made for political purposes, with an eye on the coming contest-ar e uttered by unpatriotic men and women, and should not be encouraged by honourable members occupying responsible positions in a Parliament such as this. So satisfied am I with the finances of this country that I hope that the Treasury will always be in its present financial position. I am satisfied, after a careful examination of the Budget, in which I have brought to bear some little business training, that, if the affairs of the Commonwealth are always as well and as safely handled as they are, and have been, by the present Treasurer, the future of Australia must indeed be a very bright one. -The Treasurer did not quite fulfil the ture goes to the Trust Fund.

Tlie statement that the Treasurer was ahie to place before us must have been considered very satisfactory, so far as the revenue was concerned.

Under the system adopted by the present Government, the increase in the expenditure has also been very great.

In regard to the expenditure on the Northern Territory, we have undertaken a serious responsibility, as, no, doubt, honourable members have noticed. The estimated revenue is only £48,000, whereas the expenditure is £478,857; so that this year the Treasurer anticipates a deficit of £430,857. The annual deficit when we took over the Territory was £166,883; but this year it is estimated at £430,857. ment to stand still, and do nothing? from my desire. I want to get something for the expenditure. 1 wish to know that the Government are going to do something with the Territory. Up to the present time. I am not aware that they have done anything except to make some appointments. I really think that, by this time, the Government should have had a definite policy in regard to this immense Territory. It is nearly two years since we took it over, but no progress has yet been made with its development. use of providing a small sum for a railway survey to the Katherine River? We ought to have had reports on that country long ago. I think that the Government have made a great mistake in not employing persons who have a knowledge of this country to furnish reports, rather than send persons who have never been, perhaps, in tropical Australia, and have no knowledge of the country. In South Australia there must be a good many persons-surveyor s and others, especially the former-wh o have been in this country and have a good knowledge of it. We could have got as much information out of them, even without visiting the country, as those [88] who are there now will acquire in a period of several years. We might have secured the valuable services of persons who already know the country and could report further, rather than have given these appointments to broken-down politicians and others who have never been there, and who will take years before they acquire any knowledge of the country, even if they ar* competent to do the work. not seem to have advised South Australia very wisely in the matter. necessary and ungenerous remark, as it is well known that South Australia had not the money to do the work. There must be a number of able men who were employed by South Australia all over this country, and who could give us most valuable information, l t seems to me that those who are not acquainted with the country have been selected for these posts rather than the experienced men who served South Australia in the Northern Territory, and have an intimate knowledge of it. An honourable member said, "" Do you want to leave the Territory alone and do nothing with it ?"" My reply is, '' Certainly not."" I want a policy enunciated by the Government. 1 wish them to take the responsibility of the position and to tell us whether they propose to connect this country by railway with Oodnadatta in South Australia and with the Queensland border; because unless it is worth these connexions it cannot be a great financial asset to the Commonwealtli in our time, at any rate. 1 think that if more care had been taken, and more knowledge and experience shown in dealing with the matter, we would have had reports already. What is the wrong men are dealing with it. the men who have been sent up there have everything to learn, whereas there are plenty of experienced persons in Australia who could have rendered good service, and' whose reports we might have had in our hands at the present time. I am not at all in favour of leaving this country undeveloped. I believe in opening it up. But the first thing we have to do is not to make a railway survey from Pine Creek* to the Katherine River, but to make a railway survey from Pine Creek to the border of Queensland, and a railway survey from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta in South Australia.

I again say that the Government has shown neither initiative, enterprise, nor Tax Department was last year £56,609, knowledge in dealing with this immense Territory. No credit has been given to the last Government, in which I had the privilege of being a Minister, for the construction of the Fleet, hut it must not be torgotten that we ordered the Dreadnought . i V M Australia. When she comes out, we shall have the satisfaction of knowing that we gave instructions for her building. Boldness based on Braddon provision continued to operate, this Government would have had to borrow, too. l t is proposed to spend on the Fleet this year £1,306,829, of which only I think it is £110,000 is to be charged to revenue, the balance of £1,196,829 being safely stowed away in the Trust Fund, l t was not even mentioned in the Budget, nor did the Treasurer mention that he had done that. In the Trust Fund there is £89,776 for small arms ammuntion. No doubt the accounts tioned somewhere, but it requires almost a ferret's ability to discover all the items. The receipts from the land tax this year are estimated at a sum less than those received last year and the year before. During 1910-n, £1,370,345 was received, and during 1911-12, £1,366,454, but the revenue estimated for this year is only £1,300,000. When the bursting up so much desired by honourable members opposite has been completed, there will be no further revenue from this source. The Government, by the end of this year, will have received £4,036,799 from land taxation, the money having been paid primarily by about 14,000 taxpayers. No doubt some of them have passed on the tax, but a great many of them have not been able to do so. The expenditure on our Fleet up to the present time has amounted to about £4,250,000, so that the payers of the land frightened to tax them. tainly not in favour of a levy upon a few. persons. To take £4,000,000 from fewer than 14,000 persons in three years is to make a levy, not to impose a tax. Honourable members opposite talk about "" our Fleet,"" but it is the 14,000 land-owners of Australia who. have paid for the Fleet. I wish to point out that, whereas the expenditure of the Land this year it is to be £81,625, an increase of 45 per cent.

They say that they have spent much more than their predecessors, ignoring the fact that the Braddon section was in operation when the last Government was in power, and that this Government improperly curtailed its operation by six months. able member's proposition? to a mutual agreement with the States. This Government, however, promised the States a twenty-five years' termat least, that promise was made, on behalf of the party, in Western Australia-and gave them only ten years. We must remember the immense increase of revenue that the Commonwealth has received, owing to the expiration of the Braddon section. first year, 1910-n, the Commonwealth by this change received £4>33 >775 J » 6 n 1912, the amount was £4,967,577 ; "" d it a is estimated that for the current year the amount will be £4,628,250.

But some subtle and astute monwealth. The Government will have received by the end of this year additional revenue to that available to their predecessors of about £18,000,000 owing to the expiration of the Braddon section and the imposition of the land tax. Why should the Government talk about spending more money than previous Governments did when they have received practically £14,000,000, exclusive of the land tax, more than the previous Governments received under the operation of that section ? able member have spent this money if he had received it? attempted to do so, and, I hope, wisely; I am not prepared to say that we should have spent it in the same way as have the present Government. Then, further, in three years out of the last four, there have been surpluses. There were surpluses before the present Government came into office, and there have been greater surpluses since; and the total to the end of this year is £2,917,690, excess of revenue over expenditure. the deficit during the right honourable gentleman's term as Treasurer? plus; that deficit was paid in the next year. These are actual surpluses in cash which have gone into Trust Funds. But I have always been of opinion that this money belongs to the States, though I believe there is a High Court judgment which permits it to be retained by the Commonwealth. The effect of that judgment is, I understand, that the Government may appropriate large sums of money for future use, and call that appropriation expenditure for the year. I was one who assisted to"" frame the Constitution, and I know very well that the intention was that the Commonwealth should be entitled to spend all it received, less the share of Customs and In the Excise revenue to be paid to the States, but that, if there was any surplus, it had to g6 back to the States. That is provided for in section 94 of the Constitution, which sets forth that all the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth shall be paid to the States monthly. That is in perpetuity, and is the law of the Constitution ; and the arrangement was carried out almost to the time when the Braddon lawyer, on this side of the House, 1 believe-thoug h I think he never received any credit for it-conceive d the idea that the Government could appropriate this money, even to the extent of millions, for old-age pensions or any other purpose, and call it expenditure for the year. I was opposed to that arrangement, but to my astonishment the High Court decided that it was legally permissible. While this decision gives the Commonwealth the power to thus appropriate even £20,000,000 for future use, it is, in my opinion, a moral wrong and an injustice to the States. The words of the section are quite plain, and they express the intention of those who framed the Constitution. decided that the Government may appropriate such moneys. reason why the Government should do so, even if they have the power. I have shown how not only this Government, but a previous Government of which T am glad to say I was not a member, evaded the intention of the Constitution, and placed these balances to Trust Funds.",61,Honourable Members Hear Hear

Then, whilst in 1910 we produced by white labour 209,342 tons of sugar, in 1911 our production amounted to only 176,503 tons, and this year it is estimated at only 134,034 tons. paid upon the production of sugar grown by white labour was £630,208, in 1911 it was £541,259, and this year it is estimated at £401,400. I hope honourable members will not think that I am saying this with a desire to injure the industry. I am not. I visited these sugar-cane districts some years ago, and have always been very sympathetic with these enterprising people. It is a great industry, and wants encouragement and assistance; but we are not going the right way to work m hampering it as we are doing. I hope the Minister of Trade and Customs will be able to give some satisfactory explanation. If he does no one will be more gratified than I shall be; but the fact remains that the Commonwealth control of this great industry has not increased the number of workers or the output of sugar. Comparing 1906 with 1911, the figures show 3,835 less white workers, and the production of sugar, by both white and black labour, as having fallen from 205,676 tons to 187,761 tons. used for sugar-growing on the northern rivers in New South Wales has been taken up for dairying. ing pays better, and there is not so much political interference with it. It is estimated that for the financial year 1912-1^ Excise will be paid on only 109.000 tons of Australian-grown sugar, as against 187,168 tons last year, and that 123,565 tons of sugar will be imported, as against 40,760 tons imported last year. That is a curious thing. surer is getting an increase of revenue from ? part of it. This state of affairs, as shown by the Treasury returns in the Budget, is not satisfactory. Personally. I hope there is some good explanation of it, because, after all the trouble we have had, we have a right to expect the industry to be flourishing. There is a Commission sitting; but I do not think we shall get anything out of that, In the first place, it has been almost discredited by being composed of a lot of partisans. Leaving out the Judge, I am inI hope that someformed that there is only one man on it who is not a Labour partisan, and, in the circumstances. the report of one independent expert would be far better than anything we are likely to get from a Commission composed in that way. We do not appoint poliIn 1910 the bounty ticians or partisans on one side or the other to report on our naval and military services, We get the most experienced man available, and in regard to an industry like this, we should get the judgment of some one with g t knowledge of the question, and life r e a from all political bias or influence.

It wants to be left alone now, to go on just as wheat-growing, dairying, or any other soil production are allowed to go on. We do not want political interference to hamper growers as to the wages they will have to pay, or the conditions under which they shall carry on their industry.

426,Sir John Forrest,"That is someor dictation of a Commonwealth Minister sitting in Melbourne, who has no power or right under the Constitution to interfere in any local industrial matter. Other industries which produce from the soil have not to submit to these hampering restrictions.. Personally, I think the reason why the Excise and bounty are continued is solely for political purposes, so that the Government may keep complete control over the sugar industry, and have every one connected with it under their thumb. The Government like to be able to say to the sugar-cane growers that unless they do this or that they will not receive the bounty. and charge them no Excise, but let them carry on their industry the same as other people do other industries, protecting them against undue outside competition by an import duty. The policy of the Government, however, is to interfere with and harass not only these, but all other producers, and get them in the stocks. our policy, if you say that. me to be so, or the Government would not make regulations and conditions in Melbourne to apply to undertakings in tropical Australia, in regard to which they have had little or no experience. They should certainly not attempt tofixthe rates of wages to be paid and conditions of employment to be offered by people up there, and thus invade the industrial arena under the control of the States. Government of which you were a member. order to try and make the industry a white man's industry, but that object no longer exists, and the policy that was then thought to be left alone to the utmost possible exnecessary no longer exists. I can see no reason why it has not been changed long ago, except that the Labour party want to retain control of the industry for political boot-making case unless he had learnt bootpurposes, so as to get the producer in the stocks, and not allow him to manage his own business in his own way. The same thing is going on in regard to the pearling industry. People here are a long way away from where the industry is carried on, and do not see much of it, but they pretend to think that for persons to gain their livelihood on the sea, and come ashore now and again, without being allowed to remain permanently in the country, is an invasionof the White Australia policy. A Commission has been appointed to deal with the pearling industry. honourable gentleman would have been a member of it. But perhaps he would not engage in such a farce. Persons appointed to advise in regard to a difficult and dangerous industry should know something about it. But apparently, in the opinion of this Government, any one vvill do, as long as he is a member of Parliament. He must be a partisan on one side or the other. I am reminded of the lines of ByronI should give them no bounty, A man must serve his time to every trade Save censure; critics all are ready made. Apparently members of Commissions are all ""ready made."" I was told to-day as a fact that one of the largest pearling proprietors had taken his boats away to Java. He has left us altogether. We do not want to bring about that kind of thing. We want the industry to flourish in our waters. Having no knowledge or experience, however, the Government are groping like blind men, and are calling in the inexperienced to guide them. If the Government want assistance, why do they not appoint a good man, who understands the industry, to collect information? There would be some sense in that. member for Franklin? pose that he is an expert on pearling; but he will be of some use, because he will do his best to prevent a report being brought in that would lead to erroneous conclusions and might' for a time smash up the industry altogether. I would advise that an expert should be appointed if information is required. But these industries ought tent. member say that a Judge should not try a making? who have never seen pearl shelling carried on in their lives should not be appointed to inquire into this industry, which has nothing to do with our White Australia policy.

Of that sum, £191,000,00 0 is held in London, and £79,000,00 0 is held in Australia. It is very satisfactory that so large a proportion of the debt should be held in Australia. £9.500,000 every year. which is very dangerous, and requires to be looked into, is that this year £11,000,000 of debt matures.

That is to say that, within the next ten years, £130,000,000 will become due. Nevertheless, we seem to go along rejoicing, and think nothing of it. We seem to pay no heed to this sword of Damocles which is hanging over our heads. It was expected that the Commonwealth would be a stronger financial power in London than any individual State could be, and the Treasurer when in opposition said on one occasion that he had a horror of a seventh borrower in Australia. borrower himself. As far as I know, he is making no effort to consolidate the debts. He has done something, though. He has not been idle. He has done his best to alienate the financial institutions, and by so doing has probably made consolidation more difficult. That is something to have accomplished, but it is something disadvantageous and injurious to Australia. remember that when I was in London a few years ago I was told at the Imperial Tieasury that the great conversion scheme of Mr Goschen could not have been carried out without the assistance of the financial institutions. Bonds were taken up by and only a very small amount of cash was required to pay people who did not want to take them up. The scheme was carried through with the assistance of the financial institutions, and without them would have been impossible. Shall we be able to convert our debts without the assistance of the financial institutions both here and in London, and is the Treasurer acting wisely in unnecessarily alienating the financial institutions, and by coming to loggerheads with them? not think so. The Prime Minister, when in opposition, told us what an immense advantage it would be for the Commonwealth to take over the debts of the States. But since he came into office he seems to have forgotten all about the subject, and has done nothing. When we come into power, as I hope we shall one of these days, we shall have a great deal of misWe pay in interest chief to undo.

On 20th September, 1906, when Treasurer, I presented to this House a statement showing the amount of saving to the year 1952-whe n the I whole of the existing public debts will have matured-assumin g that the Commonwealth canfloat loans at a i per cent, less interest than the States, and that such J per cent, be accumulated at 3 per cent, per annum compound interest. The total of such savings the existing holders, so accumulated from the several dates of maturity of existing loans up to 1952, would amount, it was then stated by me, in the case of New South Wales, to £9,419,823; Victoria, £6,106,725; Queensland, £ 4 , 3 6 5 , 3 2 0 ; South Australia > ^3>57 >99.3; ' Western Australia, 2 £ 1 , 9 6 6 , 9 4 0 ; and Tasmania, £ 1 , 3 3 5 , 4 7 2 ; or a total of £ 2 6 , 7 6 7 , 2 7 3 . That was the saving which I estimated would be made if we could float loans at only a J per cent, less interest than is paid by the States, and I do I think that £26,767,27 3 is worth looking after.

Sir JOHN FORREST some of this £ 9 per cent, that we hope to secure by consolidating the debts. should like to point out that our loan liabilities are looming closely ahead. In the first place, the money which, in respect of the note issue, has been borrowed from the public "" for a piece of paper,"" will not last for ever. I take no exception to the note issue. As a matter of fact, I had something of the kind in view; but the money that has been obtained in this way will not last for ever. Then, again, the construction of railways in the Northern Territory-if railways are going to be built, and if they are not the Government might as well give up the countrywill cost us at least £10,000,000 , whilst the estimated expenditure on the' transAustralian railway is £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0. always said that the cost of building that railway would be £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; but judgby them as their own. They claim credit ing by the way in which the Government are carrying on the work, and in view of all the troubles they are likely to encounter in connection with the construction of the line, I think that it will cost more. I have no wish to say anything against day labour. As a matter of fact, I carried out the Fremantle harbour works and the Coolgardie water supply scheme, two great undertakings, by day labour, but in those cases the supervision was close, whereas, in carrying this railway through immense stretches of unoccupied country, close and economical supervision will be far more difficult. over £4,00 0 , 0 0 0 with wages at 8s. a day. mate of the engineer is a little less than £4,000,000. Then, again, we have already borrowed £ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . The naval bases, which the honourable member for Mernda estimates will cost £15,000,000, are put down by me as likely to cost £12,000,000. whilst I allow for an expenditure of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 on the Federal Capital. That gives us a total of £36,000,000 , the inThat is to say, at the current terest of which, with sinking fund, will per cent, consols, amount to £1,500,00 0 a year. liabilities arise-withi n a week? arise very soon if we are to go ahead. We are already committed to an expenditure of about £ 4 ,000,00 0 on the trans-Australian railway, and we have borrowed £8,000,000. Then, again, I assume that the Government intend to proceed with the naval bases, whilst we should certainly' emN o ; but it is bark next year on the construction of the Northern Territory railways. TheI £36,000,000 to which I have referred does not include £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 for defence and £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 for old-age pensions, which is charged against the revenue every year. These are liabilities looming closely ahead, in. addition to the £270,000,000 representing the public debt of Australia, the interest bill in respect of which amounts to £ 9 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. In conclusion, I should like to say that the present Government have been very fortunate. They have come into a goodly heritage. They have reaped where they have not sown. Seeing that they have fallen on good times, they should not be ungenerous. They should at least be fair, and err, if at all, on I the side of generosity. As it is, everything that we did has been appropriated for having initiated the naval and military policy, although we introduced and passed both Bills giving effect to that policy, and ordered the first Dreadnought. We took that step, although, in those days, we had little money. The Braddon section was still in operation, and our resources were very scanty. Then, again, the old-age pension system was established by the present Leader of the Opposition. I was not then a member of his Government, but he passed it with the assistance' of the whole House. There was no division of opinion, and the B ill to provide for old-age pensions was passed in one sitting. In view of the attitude that we took up, I do not think it should be said that we did nothing towards establishing that system. Then, again, we introduced penny postage which was opposed by the Labour party, and I dare say that the present Minister of External Affairs voted against the Bill that we brought down.",66,Honourable Members Hear Hear

Notwithstanding our scanty revenue, we intended to provide for penny postage, but it was reserved for our honourable fnends opposite, on coming into power, after having opposed it previously, to adopt our Bill, and to take the whole credit for the introduction of the system, never even mentioning our previous action or assistance. I congratulate them upon having passed it. I voted for the institution of penny postage, believing that a cheap means of postage was one of the best things that could be given to any counhave compared their action to that of a man try. rates. schemes, undertaken at a time when funds were low and finance was difficult. We also made provision on the Estimates for wireless telegraphy. We did not make rapid progressin introducingthe system, but the same may be said of our successors. We likewise made the agreement for taking over the Northern Territory. Deakin Administration made the agreement, and supported the present Government in taking it over, l t is a great undertaking, involving a great burden, and if it is not successful a great deal of its non-success will be due to the want of courage and enterprise on the part of those who are controlling it. Again, I would remind honourable members that we all worked for the building of the transAustralian railway. I believe that my colleagues will say that it was always part of their policy, and was never omitted from the Governor General's Speech. members opposite, with our full support, carried it ; but We carried out the survey for them, and made everything ready. It is like a man who clears his ground, ploughs his land, and puts in the seed, and then others come along, turn him out, and reap tbe crop. That is just about what honourable members opposite have done in regard to this and so many other matters. being considerably improved. [89] like to point out to the Minister of Home Affairs that in the case of railway surveys in my own State, which were much more precise, it was usual to name a margin of 10 or 15 miles for deviations on either side of a trial survey for the permanent survey. The surveyors did 7 miles a day in the trial survey for the transcontinental line. It is often found possible, by making deviations in a permanent survey, to save many thousands of pounds in the cost of construction bf a railway. So there is nothing in the honourable gentleman's interjection. I have been referring to measures which were ours,, and which have heen appropriated by honourable members opposite, and Again, we reduced the telegraphic who turned another man out of his wellThese were great progressive cultivated-field, and claimed the crop as'bis own, without giving him even' thanks for what he had done. There is, however; a part of tlieir policy for which we, on this side, have no desire to take credit. It includes a land tax, or rather a forced levy, by which over £4,000,000 has been raised in three years from 14,000 persons. posite will take credit for that later on. orable friends can have that forced levy for themselves.

Further, there has been no attempt made by the Government to reduce taxation. They are taking from the pockets of the people £ 4 10s. per head, when the taxation was only £ $ 13s. per bead at the time they assumed office. They also have the odium of not doing anything to assist immigration, and we do not desire to have any part in that.

In conclusion, I may say that the policy of the Labour party seems to be to extract as much money as possible from the poor, as well as the rich; to hamper the people in their enterprise and their daily lives; to harass and interfere with every employer, and make his life a burden to' him; to refrain from any attempt to reduce taxation; to increase the cost of living, and blame the employer for it ; to give preference to unionists and favouritism to a class; to support the maxim of ""spoils to the victors""; and to institute a reign of terror to nil opposed to them.
