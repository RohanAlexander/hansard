This 'course has been suggested to us by the State Dried Fruits Boards. It was found by the Victorian board that a certain quantity of fruit only partly dried had been sent across the Murray into another State, and in that way the quotas for local and interstate trade had been disregarded. A conference of the Commonwealth Export Control Board and the various State boards was summoned, and the bill as it stood at the second-reading stage was placed before those bodies. As the result of that conference, various amendments were suggested, and most of I should like more information than has the amendments now to be submitted to been supplied as to the meaning of "" prethe committee originated from that scribed authority."" gathering.

It is felt that, if the bill were passed in its original form, too much would be left to tbe discretion of the prescribed authority. rity could operate in one State only. considered wise to change the wording of the sub-clause in the manner that I have indicated, so that the Commonwealth Minister may have a check upon what may be done. Amendment agreed to. toThat the word ""granted,"" sub-clause ( 4 ) , be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" issued."" for Markets) [11.27] I move That the following sub-clause be added:5. Where a satisfied that any person to whom a licence has been issued under this section has contravened or failed to comply with any term or condition of the licence, the prescribed authority may cancel the licence, and the licence shall thereupon cease to be of any force or effect. When the bill was first brought down, it was thought that power to cancel the licence would be given by clause 4, paragraph a, which sets out that regulations may be brought down prescribing the conditions upon which licences may be issued. It was considered sufficient to prescribe as a condition of a licence that it could be cancelled in the event of its being contravened. But the request was made by the Dried Fruits Boards that this provision should be embodied as a subclause in the bill rather than that the matter be left to regulations. The Government readily complied with that request. I do not question the necessity for the amendment, but should there not be some method of appeal to the Minister in regard to such matters as this. There will probably be five or six different boards operating in the respective States. If no board operates in a particular State, the Commonwealth will have to appoint an authority of its own. Under the amendment, cases of hardship may arise in the future through licences being cancelled without appeal from the decisions of the authorities that cancelled them. There should be some means whereby a person whose licence has been cancelled can appeal to the Minister. I am afraid that with different boards operating in the respective States we shall not have uniform conditions. Necessary though the amendment is, it might be advisable for the committee to go a little further than this provision goes. There should at least be an appeal to the Minister by any aggrieved person whose licence has been cancelled. The cancellation of a licence is a very important matter to the people who are engaged in growing and exporting dried fruits. It may even jeopardize their livelihood. It is of the greatest importance that they should have a channel through which they may seek prescribed authority is justice in the event of a dispute occurring between them and the prescribed authorities. If an appeal to the Minister were provided, that gentleman could decide the matter on its merits. When passing legislation we should always provide an opportunity for a person with a grievance to appeal against decisions like these. I was not in the chamber when this legislation was passed. While I am aware that the dried fruits industry needs all the assistance and every possible facility for trading that we can give it, the Minister is aware that I hold the strongest possible objections to this class of legislation. I am aware that it is not competent for me to take exception at this stage to what I regard as a fundamental interference with the right of the community to indulge in interstate trading. If this interference is introduced in the dried fruits industry it may also be introduced, in connection with greater industries. I am not surpised that already the Minister finds it necessary to introduce policing regulations to carry out the act, and I predict that these regulations will be the forerunners of",16,Dried Fruits Bill

The only justification for it is that it tends to bring the practice of granting government privilege to the ground, and it is due to the failure of the so-called Country party to effect that reduction of privilege to the manufacturers of this country to which, by their platform and their public speeches, they are committed. They have failed to exercise their influence in that direction, and so are trying to propitiate their country supporters by demanding an equal measure of protection for them. ful body. rather an exhibition of weakness, but the honourable member is entitled to his own view.

We should at least provide for the setting up of the authority which is to make the regulations. Apart from my objection to the intended effect of the amendment, I submit that it is faulty from a drafting point of view. I do not agree with the statement of the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) that everything is satisfactory when a certain group of producers have control of an industry. everything was satisfactory. honourable member was that the virtue of the bill-if it contained any virtue at all -consiste d in the fact that it proposes to give control of the industry to the producers themselves. Such a contention has not my approval. I can see no reason why any section of the community should be authorized by act of Parliament to take toll of the rest of the community at their own sweet will. The conflict of opinion that has developed out of this discussion raises the question whether it is intended that the Minister shall be guided in his administration of the act by the advice of the growers, or whether there is to be direct governmental control of the industry. I object to the bill, lock, stock and barrel. interference of an unwholesome character with interstate trade, and if a similar principle were applied to the whole of the industries of Australia they would quickly be wrecked. This action is being taken out of consideration for the dried fruits industry, because it finds it self in a very bad state. Whether wisely or unwisely, a large number of men have engaged in the fruit industry in a small way, and there has been over-production in an attempt to remove from the world's markets those who supplied such markets with their requirements of fruit before the crisis developed in the affairs of the nation. In other words, it is an attempt by Australia to effect a balancing of markets and it not possible to to compel every fruit-grower to supply up to a certain percentage of the require-' ments, both at home and abroad. TheI do not think so. Aplegislature is really endeavouring to set up a condition of commercial idealism, and it is not possible to do that by legislation. I should like the Attorney General( Mr Latham) to explain whether there is to be governmental control of the industry under such regulations as this, or any succeeding government, may in its wisdom impose; or whether there is to be control by the industry itself, with the State and Federal governments fawning upon it. has not made a complete statement of all the possible alternatives. character of this legislation. If there is to be straight out government control, the Minister should say so. The clause, as it stands, will give the Government control under any conditions which the present or any future Ministers may impose. If it is intended that there shall be set up certain boards to advise the Government, it will be within the power of the Government to act only on the recommendation of those boards. It rests with the Government to extricate itself from the dilemma in which it is placed.

81,Mr Latham,"The proposition wouldare organized for marketing upon a large scale basis. If production is to any considerable extent in the .hands of smallscale producers and the producers cannot unaided deal with their marketing problems. establish a marketing organization which will enable them to sell their products upon reasonably profitable terms and to free themselves from the market irregularities which occasionally are deliberately produced by powerful competitors. must itself establish that organization or it must provide the industry with the means to do so. That is the principle upon which export control boards have been appointed in certain industries, in the marketing of whose products there are special and peculiar difficulties. Success in marketing does not depend solely upon the quality of the product; other factors have to be considered, such as continuity of supplies and variation of market prices. The latter in turn are dependent not only upon the supplies which at any given period are available, but also, unfortunately, to a considerable extent upon trade and commercial manipulation. In those circumstances, a small producer is unable to sell his pro.duct in a market which is thousands of miles distant from the place in which it is grown unless he has at his disposal an organization that is sufficiently powerful to counteract the influences to which I have referred. That, generally, is the justification which exists for a degree of control in relation to the marketing of the products of certain industries. Very great care has been exercised in the legislation which has been introduced by this Government, to see that the control of the exportable surplus of any product remains in the hands of the industry itself and not of the Government. Many governments might be influenced by political considerations, and it is most desirable that those considerations should be kept out of trade. Much as I appreciate the merits of the present Government, I realize that its members are not endowed with special insight and inspiration in the actual conduct of trade or industry merely by reason of the fact that they hold commissions from the Governor General; and I do not believe that any memMr Latham. ber of the Government holds a different view. But we all recognize that it is our responsibility to assist Australian industry and trade; and if means can be devised which will enable those who are There are only two ways to actually engaged in the trade or industry to control it in such a way that they are able to compete in overseas markets under conditions which favourably affect their profits, there is no reason why those means should not be adopted. The MinisEither the Government ter for Markets( Mr Paterson) has already explained that it is proposed that the authorities which will issue licences dealing with interstate trade shall consist of persons who are representative of the growers and will exercise their powers under the provisions of State acts. The effective control under this act will consist in the issue of licences to engage in interstate trade. That is the central provision of the measure. Neither the Government as a whole nor the Minister in particular will have any say as to whether a particular application for a licence shall be .granted or refused; those licences will be issued by the authorities in the different States. Accordingly, those authorities will control all operations. was wrongly withheld, or subsequently cancelled, what power would the Minister have to intervene? be appointed under regulations. What can be made, can be unmade. If the administration of a particular authority should be unsatisfactory, it will be entirely within the power of the Minister by regulation to change the constitution of that authority. It is not at all likely, however, that action along the lines suggested will be taken on arbitrary grounds. The regulations ought to make provision with respect to the tenure of office of the authorities and the limitation of their powers. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), has proposed that the regulations shall be made by the Governor General in Council only upon the recommendation of the authorities. I submit that it is impossible to make such a provision, because, as the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) has stated, the "" prescribed authorities themselves cannot come into",21,Dried Fruits Bill

If this measure provided, for instance, that the authorities should be A, B, and C in Victoria, and D, E, and E in South Australia, those authorities would be prescribed by the act, but in the absence of such a prescription, prescribed in this measure means prescribed by the regulations to be made under the act. There is no method of constituting the authorities other than by regulation, and, therefore, no authority can come into existence until regulations prescribing it have been made. Accordingly, if no regulations could be made except on the recommendation of ."" prescribed authorities,"" and no authority could be created except in accordance with regulations, it follows that there could be neither regulations nor authorities. ment may prescribe a new set of regulations and conditions. nexion with every act which empowers the making of regulations. the measure may be altered by regulations. not be inconsistent with the language and purposes of an act. At times it is necessary to have a more or less elastic system of regulations in order that they may be adapted readily to meet changing circumstances and conditions. Legislation is a process that occupies time, and can only be accomplished when Parliament is actually sitting. Unless we are to introduce an absolutely rigid system of control it is necessary to leave a good deal to be done by regulations. One of the most important features of the system which this bill introduces is its elasticity and flexibility to meet changing circumstances. Nevertheless, the power to issue licences upon which the operation of the act will wholly depend will be with the authorities, and not with the Minister, but if regulations could be made only on the recommendation of a prescribed authority confusion might result, and the scheme become unworkable. When there are several authorities must until they have heen they confer before a regulation can be made, or will the recommendation of a single authority suffice? The honourable member for Swan will see that his amendment will introduce unnecessary complications. I remind the committee that all regulations of this character are capable of disallowance by Parliament. sympathize with the Attorney-General in his effort to prove by his considerable legal learning that government control will not be government control. The Government also deserves sympathy because of the presence amongst its occasional supporters of two die-hard protagonists of private enterprise. They belong to the past; they are for private enterprise in season and out of season. The Government, whilst professing similar beliefs, is not so consistent in its conservatism. It does endeavour occasionally to keep pace with modern thought and development. It bees that private enterprise is breaking down all along the line, and that in many industries government control is absolutely necessary to buttress private enterprise. By a necessarily laboured argument the Attorney-General sought to convince the committee that regulations will be issued, not by the Government, but by prescribed authorities which will consist of representatives of the growers; therefore, the growers will control their own industry, and will decide whether any of their number shall or shall not send his fruit from one State to another. Thus, said the learned gentleman, there will be no government control of the industry. Surely we are introducing a new order of government if a group of men in any industry may constitute themselves an authority to dictate the flow of interstate trade. Obviously, any authorities prescribed under regulation by the Government will become agents of the Government, and, for the purposes of the act, will be the Government. They will have the authority of the Government behind them in carrying out the purposes of this act, and the industry will be controlled by the Government. Otherwise, the control would have no authority behind it. In differing from the Attorney-GeneralI am not agreeing with the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers). It",22,Dried Fruits Bill

In respect of other matters they are forced by the logic of facts-as year after year, and age after age, one industry after another gets into difficulties, and is forced to ask for Government control and assistance-to accept the principles in which honourable members on this side believe. are.

I believe that it is absolutely essential to assist the dried-fruits industry through its difficulties, and I differ enauthority the Government would have to tirely from those honourable members who are prepared to allow it to languish, and many men to be ruined because of the fetish of private enterprise. The honourable member for Swan would be well advised to withdraw his amendment. AlthoughI think that I was justified by the language of the bill in moving my amendment, I bow to the superior legal knowledge of the Attorney-General, who has told the committee that the amendment would be impracticable. Therefore, I ask leave to withdraw it. As this legislation is introduced in the interests of the growers, I desired that any regulations issued under the act should first be approved by the boards which will be representative of the growers. Of course, the Minister would still have power to disallow any regulations. I recognize that the present Minister for Markets is very sympathetic to the growers, but this power of regulation might be dangerous in the hands of an unsympathetic Minister. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. know whether to congratulate the Attorney-General upon his lucid exposition of the fact that he agrees with a policy that he professes to disown or upon his support of the Leader of the Opposition in a policy from which he has dissociated himself. The Minister began by saying that a government was Certainly the Government is the worse possible authority that could be chosen to control an industry. He then proceeded to justify the fullest possible control by the Government, because, I supported although he tried to make out that the Government appointment of authorities was not an exercise of government control, he afterwards went on to say that if any of those authorities did wrong, the Government could remove them and appoint fresh ones. I want to know how any government could possibly profess to take such action unless it possessed all the knowledge necessary to control the industry, and was acquainted with the work done in the industry sufficiently to enable it to judge whether the decision of the authorities was right or wrong. While the Attorney-General contended that the Government was not qualified to control the industry, he explained that if it were not properly controlled by the prescribed do it. This only shows into what a dangerous position we can drift when we once meddle with clear and definite principles. The Leader of the Opposition referred to a number of honourable members as "" die-hards,"" and said we were the antique survivors of private enterprise, which was failing dismally everywhere.

Is there any reasonable hope of this control being exercised equitof trying to bring about control to artiably?

This measure is devised to benefit a section only, by increasing the burdens of the people generally, which are becoming so heavy as to far outweigh the benefits derived by the sections that are said to profit. Therefore, I contend that the scheme contemplated by the bill will not be beneficial to Australia as a whole, and when we have to decide between benefits for a section and the diminution of the burdens of the rest of the community, the interests of the general public must prevail. This bill reverses that principle.

I remind the honourable member that clause 4 is under discussion. I admit that the scope of the clause is very wide, and that I have allowed certain latitude in its discussion; but the honourable member must connect his remarks with the clause. the honourable member for Perth( Mr been from one or two dried-fruit dealers. Mann), who referred to the fruit-growers as highway robbers. said that the Government would clothe them with such powers that they would be able to direct the pistol at the head of the community. This legislation was desired by the primary producers associated with the fruit-growing industry, and it is being introduced to advance their welfare. Clause4 merely grants an important industry the right to control its own business, much the same as the Companies Act confers a similar right on those to whom it applies. This bill will give primary producers the right to control and market their own produce, not only in their own interests, but in the interests of the general community. honourable member for Perth objected to the granting of the powers conferred by this measure, and stated that their Thereefficacy had not been proved by experience. That charge cannot be connected with the dried fruits industry. Eor a number of years that industry has been carried on successfully under a system of growers' control, and experience has proved that it can best be carried on under co-operative control with Government aid. This clause is being introduced at the suggestion, and with the approval, of the people who have carried on the industry so successfully. Recently a fly has appeared in the ointment, and all the good work of the past is likely to be undone by the action of a few greedy men. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) referred to "" die-hards,"" and claimed that private enterprise was dying. Something was also said about consistency, the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) alike claiming credit for that virtue. I am not a believer in government control, and I do not think that there is anything in the argument that one must do this and that merely to be consistent. As Emerson puts it, "" A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.'-' I have received letters from individual growers and others asking me to support this measure, while the only opposition to the measure has I shall read a letter which I have received from Mr J.

In South Australia a certain small section of dried fruits dealers are in opposition to anything in the nature of control. These dealers now realize that, failing the passage of the proposed bill, they will be able to take full advantage of those constitutional difficulties previouly mentioned, and sell 100 per cent, of their fruit holdings on the profitable home market. Asi t is impossible for the growers to get back their production costs without averaging their home and export sales, it will be readily seen that this loophole in the act would be of enormous advantage to any firm availing themselves of it. I am writing this letter as a grower and a growers' representative, to bring to your notice the extreme urgency of the matter, and to ask, on behalf of all South Australian growers, for your support when the bill again comes before you for consideration. In conclusion, I would like to point out that such a measure as that proposed ensures a degree of stability to those directly dependent on the industry for their livelihood; and is only making effective legislation now enacted in four States. I agree entirely with the views set out by Mr Murdoch. I might add that I received that letter after I made my second-reading speech supporting this measure. I am personally acquainted with Mr Murdoch, Mr Kay, and others on the State and Federal Dried Fruits Boards, and I am confident that while we have such men available to act en those boards, and prescribed authorities, neither the growers nor the consumers of Australia will have anything to fear. The alternative to a control .such as is contemplated is to allow a few speculators to corner our output. They would smash the market and ruin the growers. The sultana, currant and lexia vines would go out of bearing, and Australia would have to import its requirements of those articles instead of consuming home-grown products, and building what is rapidly becoming a profitable export market. I support this clause and the general principles of the bill. which I believe to be in the true interests -of the community generally. ROÂ«: am confident that this measure will be of great assistance to the dried-fruits growers. It has been said that it amounts to government control of the dried fruits industry. I do not agree with that. I regard it as an attempt by the Government to help the growers to market their Constitutional difficulties in the know that it will institute a kind of fruit strictive measure of this nature, they would be at the mercy of the consumers, and would have to accept unprofitable prices for their produce. I have listened carefully to the speeches that have been made on this bill, and shall refer particularly to the remarks of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), who objected strongly to the control proposed by the measure. The honourable member failed to see why any section of the community should have power to take toll from the rest of the community at their sweet will. Under our protective system those engaged in our secondary industries already have that power, which is a necessary corollary of the system. Surely the primary producers are entitled to a similar right. We have to pay whatever prices are asked for the products of our secondary industries, and the producers of dried fruits or any other primary product should have some control of their markets. I cannot understand the arguments of the people who wish to deny them that right. Primary producers are unable to obtain protection except by bounties, and such measures as this.

The object of this new clause is to impose a penalty upon any person who, upon being required to produce a licence issued to him, or any return or documents required from him refuses or fails to do so. It is extremely unlikely that it will ever be necessary to enforce the provisions of this new clause, but it is desirable that the prescribed authority should have the power which it conveys. A similar penalty is contained in all the legislation which we have passed in relation to our export control boards. appears to me that the penalty provided is much too severe.

He then reserved to the Government the right to reduce that bounty still, further at some future date, during its currency, in the event of the British Government so amending its preferential rate on Empire wines as to give to Australia a greater benefit than she had previously enjoyed. The Government contends that that position has arisen as a result of the alteration of the British tariff on wines which was made in April, 1927. Not only was the rate on both British Empire and foreign wines altered, but there was also a very significant alteration in the line of demarcation between low-strength and high-strength wines. That alteration had the effect, for the first time, of bringing that very large class of wines, of a strength of about 29 degrees, within the same category for taxation purposes as our sweet wines, The which contain from 34 per cent, to 35 per cent, proof spirit, except that ours enjoyed the British preferential rate. The Government, therefore, felt justified in bringing down at the earliest possible moment a measure providing for the reduction of the bounty from Is. 9d. to Is. a gallon. While a good deal of hostility has been displayed by certain sections of the wine industry to this proposal of the Government, some of the leading wine makers have been frank enough to admit that' the industry can carry on profitably with the reduced bounty. to name them. certain wine makers that, although the industry will no longer be able to make what has been described as easy money, it will nevertheless be able to carry on quite profitably, if it is efficiently run, and assuming that the London market recovers to some extent from the depression which, unfortunately, is affecting it at the present time. It will not be out of place if I again put before the committee particulars of the alteration which was made in the tariff. That alteration has undoubtedly placed the Australian exporter of wines in a much better position than he previously occupied. No matter what interests we may represent, it is generally admitted that, prior to April, 1927, the amount of preference which our wines enjoyed in Great Britain over those of continental origin was 6d. a gallon. The 29 deg. wine, which was the main competitor of our wine, had then to pay a duty of 2s. 6d.",28,Dried Fruits Bill

136,Mr Paterson,"It is admitted by a gallon, as though it came within the foreign division, it for taxation purposes was placed in the light wine section. On the other hand, although the 34 degree Australian wine came within the category of high strength wine, it enjoyed the benefit of the British preference. The effect was that our wine paid a duty of 2s. a gallon, while foreign wine paid 2s. 6d. The result of the alteration made in April, 1927, by the British House of Commons was that the 29 degree wine from the continent which formerly was placed in the low strength class; was taxed to the same extent as our wine, on account of the fact that the line of demarcation between low strength and high strength was reduced from 29 deg. to 25 deg. in the case of foreign wine and to 27 deg. in the case of Empire wine. The foreign wine of -29 deg. then became dutiable at the rate' of 8s. a gallon; while the duty on Empire wine was increased to 4s. a gallon, the consequence being that our measure of preference rose from 6d. a gallon to 3s. 6d. a gallon. , s merely on paper. I freely admit that, prior to April, 1927, there was a paper difference of 4s. a gallon and an actual difference of 6d. a gallon, but since that date our actual preference over continental wine has amounted to 4s. a gallon, and therefore the Australian exporter has benefited to the extent of 3s. 6d. a gallon. It is true that, in order to relieve to some extent the position which was created in Great Britain by the substantial increase in duty, the Chancellor of the Exchequer compromised last year' to the extent ting the stocks of continental wine which were then held in bond-approxi mately 1,500,000 gallons-to be cleared upon payment of a duty of 5s. a gallon instead of 8s. a gallon. Our wine, which was dutiable at 4s. a gallon, thus benefited last year to the extent of Is. a gallon over continental wine of a strength of 29 deg. which was released at 5s. a gallon. Those stocks having been exhausted, any new unblended wine which enters Great Britain in competition with our wine must pay a duty of 4s. a gallon greater than that which is imposed on ours, even though it be some degrees lower in strength. The honourable member for Angas referred by interjection to the possible competition of blended wines. It is said that a certain amount of blended wine is being sold in England; but there is not a great deal of evidence of that. But, assuming that it is possible, as suggested in the letter from the president of the Viticultural Association, to blend a gallon of low-strength wine, dutiable at 3s., with a gallon of high-strength dutiable at 8s., and thus reduce the average duty to 5s. 6d., we have still an advantage of Is. 6d. per gallon, whereas twelve months ago the benefit was only 6d. If that blending can be done successfully and at no cost, the difference in our favour is still such that the Government would be justified in reducing the bounty not by merely 9d., but by even Is. per gallon. Those honourable members who so ably represent the wine industry, argue that our wines have to compete not only with the continental product, but also with British wine, which pays an excise duty of only Is. per gallon. The British budget presented last month increased that excise to Is. 6d. per gallon, the increase being equivalent to two-thirds of the proposed reduction of our export bounty. Moreover, we are informed by Australia House that the customs authorities in Great Britain contend that the ingredients of British wines are taxed to the extent of 6d. per gallon in addition to the excise of Is. 6d. Thus our wines have a protection of 2s. per gallon, which is equal to the duty payable on our wines up to and not exceeding 27 degrees strength, and practically the whole of the British of permitwines are within that limitation. So honourable members will see that the taxation on the British wines is very much the same as is imposed upon wines of similar strength imported from Australia. At the second-reading stage the Prime Minister said that the Government recognized that full consideration should be given to contracts which had been entered into prior to the Government's announcement of its intention to reduce the bounty.

We have been informed by those engaged in the wine industry that the London market has shown itself remarkably ready to adapt itself speedily to alterations of the bounty. When the bounty was reduced fro m 2s. 9d. to Is. 9d., only a short time elapsed before the prices showed a corresponding: hardening, and we are credibly informed that a similar development may reasonably be expected to follow the present reduction, and that before long the market w ill become stabilized on the basis of a bounty of Is. It w ill be noted that through the restriction of duty of Is. 9d. to old contracts or their equivalent, no new sales w ill be made except on the basis of a bounty of Is. It is desirable that at the earliest possible date the industry should get down to that foundation which may be regarded as more or less permanent, The Government feels that in permitting the Is. 9d. We bounty to continue in respect of contract wine, it runs no great risk of encouraging speculation, because such wine is already sold, and largely to old established houses. As an additional encouragement to wine industry, the is the vital clause of the bill, because it w i ll h it the growers, because the manureduces the bounty.

Even so, it will take the full Is. 9d. hounty on 1928 wines to even partially make room for the 1929.vintage, assuming that the crop of grapes is a normal one A reasonable bounty on tlie export of currants and lexias would doubtless induce the growers to dry their fruit again instead of sending it green to the wineries. I do not claim that tlie wine-makers were wise enough to foresee what has happened, otherwise they would doubtless have advocated granting a bounty on dried fruits at the same time as asking for the bounty on wine; but what I do say is that they now see that this would have been a much better plan, and it would have avoided the present glut of wine in London. Tbe Government have been altogether too drastic in reducing the bounty by a Is. in September last, and then following it up with another 9d. reduction within a period of eight months. ""While the new clause to be inserted -will meet the position, so f a r as existing contracts are concerned, it does no more than that. It w ill probably differentiate between Australia, tect those who have tracts. Eveni f the contracts covered everybody for this year, the repudiation for the rest of the term for which the bounty was given would remain. Until the Government can show that there has been a change for the good in the market in London, it has no warrant for its proposal. All the information that I have received since the last debate confirms the view then expressed by me and other honourable members that the position in London was really more unfavorable than we then believed it to be. By offering inducements, and then cutting them off before half the first year has gone, the Government is f a i l in g to carry out its agreement with the-important industries not only of wine-making, but of growing vines for the production of grapes. the difficulty in which the wine industry is placed is to be found in preventing the diversion to it of splendid, fruit s such as lexias and currants, which should be prepared and sold as dried f r u it . That result could have been brought about for less expenditure than the wine bounty has cost us, and it would have given more benefit to the growers than has the wine bounty alone. Honourable members should not lose sight' of the fact that the dried f r u it and the wine industries are distinct. Those engaged in the production of dried f r u it s have the protection of a considerable duty. Many of those who favour the wine bounty are also in f u l l sympathy with the attitude of the Leader of the? ""Opposition ( Mr Scullin) towards thedried f r u it industry. The Minister has been good enough to say, on behalf of the Government, that he w ill sympathetically confer later with persons in the winemaking trade, and see that adjustmentsare made. That is the old game of cancelling a benefit, and agreeing to consider what can be given in its place. The"" Prime Minister has begun to realize that when a government meddles with private business it generally makes a mess of things. If this .matter were traced to its; source, we should find that the authority that advised the Government was not an expert, and, although he might have known something of the business, he had certain manufacturers in only been acquainted with it for a short and it will only pro period. I know who is the great authosigned conr it y in the wine business to whom the Minister has referred. The Minister accepts this authority as representing theviews of the whole trade; but I have received definite information from the resjjective State authorities and from their Australian council, that, with the exception of a particular individual, the trade is united on this important issue. Therefore, honourable members can easily discover who the Minister's authority was.. I invite the committee to consider the subject from the point of view that the representatives of the wine trade in the different States, and their Australian council, declare that there never has been greater unanimity of opinion amongst them than there is at the present time. I impress upon the Leader of the Opposition that this measure intimately The solution of affects the growers. As honourable members know, a few years ago this House had to come to their rescue, at a cost of Â£200,000, none of which money is likel y to come back, and none of it should comeback, as it was used to assist those poor fellows, the majority of whom are returned soldiers-to keep body and soni together, and to feed themselves and t h e i r families.

Does not the Leader of the Opposition recollect the occasion when, because of a division taken in this House, the bill was -withdrawn, to be reconstructed on a more generous basis? Honourable members would not then have acted as they did had they not believed that this is a national question, which affects an indusbeen opened in the Old World, but try that some day will be as important to Australia as the wool and wheat industries. honest and did the right thing, and it should again take similar action. Honourable members who have been for a few years in this House will remember the painful times which our returned soldiers in the Murray area passed through. This Government, and properly, came to their rescue, which was a good thing both for the returned soldiers themcablegrams began to arrive from England selves and also for the Government, and particularly for the State Government. Millions of pounds have been spent in repatriating returned soldiers, but Australia has to deal with no greater repatriation problem than that of settling the returned soldiers along the Murray river. The granting of a bounty imposed responsibilities. Strenuous efforts were taken to make the wine industry a success, but it could not have been a success had it not been for the co-operation of British winemerchants with our own people, who risked everything in order to obtain additional capital. -with unprecedentedly generous treatment from the financiers, the banks going a long way beyond their usual limits in order to assist those engaged in the wine industry, as they recognized that those men were capable, and that the development of the wine industry had tremendous possibilities. are men, as, for example, the Seppelt. and other pioneer families, who are as Mr Foster. opposed to the nineadvanced in the science of wine-making as any one in any other portion of the world. Those men have risked the fortunes they had already made in the interests of the development of the industry, . and I ask why in the name of conscience is the Government penalizing the wine industry at a time when the withdrawal of assistance is The Governlikely to jeopardize its existence. Later, when I have the opportunity, I shall quote opinions on this subject that will confound the Government, including something that emanated from one of its own Ministers. Although our export wine business is considerable, we export only one-fourth of what we produce. The action of the Government will cripple the growers, as the price of wine is low. By considerable effort markets have we shall be unable to exploit them in future if the bounty is reduced. The Government then was Although the wine cellars and stores in the Old Country are full, not a great quantity of Australian wine has been consumed there, but consumption is increasing satisfactorily. Under the agreements that have been made the sellers and not the buyers of our wine will be affected by any gallantly reduction of bounty, and as soon as the introduction of this measure was mooted cancelling the orders already placed. No member of the Government, or, indeed, none of its supporters, has attempted to justify its action in this matter. The Government undertook to pay the winemakers a certain bounty on export on condition, that they, in turn, paid a specified price-fixe d by the Government-for the grapes used in making the wine. There is no evading that contract so far as the 1927 and 1928 crops are concerned whether the wine is shipped abroad or remains in Australia. Even commercial ethics inThese met sist on honoring the undertaking to pay a bounty in respect of that crop. When this year the Government announced its intention to reduce the bounty, and fixed the price to be paid for grapes, half the grape crop had already been sold and was in the wineries. To say now that the bounty shall apply only to wine On the river Murray there shipped prior to the 5th March, 192S, is wrong. The Government not only failed to give proper notice to the wine-makers regarding the reduction of the bounty, per gallon is paid. I sincerely trust that, but it also increased the price they had to even at this late hour, the Government pay for the grapes. That there is stored will'abandon the bill. in England 3,000,000 gallons of Australian wine is not a matter of great seriousness. I read reeently a letter from an Englishman connected with the wine and spirit trade, who is now on his way to Australia on one of his periodical visits. In his letter he said that he wanted 1,000,000 gallons of Australian wine, which he will select personally and take to England, where it -will be placed in bond for a period of five years. But he says definitely that he will not take one gallon of wine in respect of which the bounty is not paid. He said, moreover, that Australian wine was becoming very popular iu London. But he gave warning that a foolish step now might result in the loss of all that has been gained, and that the market once lost, it would take us many years to regain the position we now hold. Somo Australian winemakers have not eJ^ported their wine, but bold it in their cellars for their regular customers, so that it may mature further. The growers of grapes along the Murray Valley are dumbfounded at the action of the Government. They cannot understand who is responsible for it. The Government's action is inexplicable to me. T know the struggle these men have had since 1923. Except for a short period during the war, when prices were high, their life has been one eontinual struggle. They have worked under practically sweated conditions for very small returns. Yet the Government now proposes to make their lot even harder. I have here a number of extracts from speeches made by members of the present Ministry, which I hope to get inserted in Hansard when I speak again on the clause. I eannot understand why the Government is so antagonistic to the wine industry. Why has tbe Government such a desire to depress the distilling industry, seeing that it is obtaining Â£39 in excise duty for each ton of grapes that goes to the distilleries, and is used for producing Australian brandy 1 That figure is arrived at in this way: 150 gallons of spirit are obtained from a ton of grapes, SO per cent, of which, namely, 30 gallons, is proof spirit, on which a duty of 26s.
