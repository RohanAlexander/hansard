It is about time that area of our city was put to better use. It will expand the green space that is going to be made available. I say to people of the Illawarra who have an interest in this: go and look at the plans at Wollongong City Council and do not be persuaded by the views of a minority that in some way this is the privatisation of public space; that what is being proposed is the wholesale redevelopment of public space for the construction of apartments. A picnic for MacCabe Park is to be held on 29 April and I suggest that people who have a real interest in this go along so that they can make a real and honest appraisal of what council’s proposals actually entail and, as I say, not be swayed by a minority. It is not surprising, of course, that there would be people in the community swayed by a minority voice. In the Illawarra Mercury last SaturdayI saw a photograph of a small number of individuals who have created an organisation called Preserve our People’s Park. Part of the representation I saw there consisted of Wollongong councillor Kerrie Christian, who represents the Active Community Team. You are a long way from Coledale, Kerrie, to be turning up down in Wollongong but I am always pleased to see you there. Who did I also see in this photograph? I saw that ageing James Dean, that rebel without a cause, Paul Matters, the sacked former secretary of the South Coast Labor Council. Paul is over at the University of Wollongong now doing a law degree because they gave him the flick from the South Coast Labor Council after he had proved to be the most divisive figure in the Illawarra in 20 or 30 years. This is a man who has made a career out of standing up for causes that most people do not believe in, creating the greatest amount of pain to the greatest number of people in the broad community. There is an adage in Wollongong: if Paul Matters is against something then it must be terrific and it must be good for the people of the Illawarra and Wollongong. I simply say to some of these well-meaning people concerned about the future of their central park, like 2Vox FM and people involved with the medical centre and those concerned about the future of the Pioneer Hall and the pensioners associations: be realistic and have a look at what government-in this case local government-is proposing. They are not talking about redevelopment and the elimination of the park; they are talking about expanding the park. They are talking about providing new and better facilities for the people of the Illawarra. It is time we all stood up for the greater good of the greater number and not be persuaded by a low-life like Paul Matters that in some way this is a conspiracy, this is privatisation.

239,Mr Schultz (Hume),"Honourable members will remember the Swiss canyoningWednesday, 12 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15873 We can understand the stress and dismay of the families of the Australian victims at Adventure World’s plans to recommence canyoning tours. The Australian ambassador to Switzerland will express to Swiss authorities the Australian government’s concerns about this development and ask that, if there is the capacity under Swiss law, Adventure World be prevented from resuming the tours until the outcome of the ongoing judicial inquiry is known. Canyoning is not regulated in Switzerland. The capacity of Swiss authorities to stop Adventure World may be constrained under Swiss law. The government can confirm that the families of the Australian victims are planning to meet in Sydney on 18 April to receive a comprehensive briefing on the Swiss judicial process from lawyers from a Swiss victims assistance organisation that is representing the families in that process. Any legal action is a matter for the families and their lawyers to decide. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has no standing to either investigate or provide legal advice on any allegations about the liability of Contiki. Judge Trapp, the Swiss judge, will not publicly confirm the accuracy of Adventure World’s press release of 12 January stating that he has recommended manslaughter charges against eight persons. Trapp has confirmed, however, that he informed those under investigation of his confidential preliminary recommendations to the Swiss public prosecutor. They have the right to request that he obtain additional evidence before finalising his recommendations. Judge Trapp has stated that charges are not finalised until the public prosecutor agrees to his recommendations. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has kept families informed about the Swiss process via, to date, six comprehensive letters, three teleconferences and ongoing contact between officers of the department and individual families. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has also kept informed the four Australian survivors injured in the tragedy. Australian consular staff in Switzerland and Australia provided a great deal of assistance to the families in the aftermath of the tragedy. I know that the two families who reside in my electorate and who lost sons in that unfortunate tragedy in Switzerland will be gratified by the ongoing assistance that this government is giving them in what is still their time of need. I raise this issue in the Main Committee today because, in the last 24 hours, members of both families have approached me concerned about the fact that the company involved in the tragedy-the Contiki Tour Company-is endeavouring to open up the business again. That will put more people’s lives at risk. I find that incomprehensible and tragic.

They have had the most brutal introduction possible to the new industrial relations regime under the Howard-Reith government. On 31 March, I had the honour of joining a group of 22 women peacefully protesting in front of their former employer, Linda Electric Industries, an electrical goods manufacturer based in Noble Park, and which has been manufacturing blankets, amongst other things. The slogan ‘Wonderfully warm with Linda’ is something that many of you may have heard, but these workers have certainly been left out in the cold by Linda! On 29 March, those employees were escorted off the property by security guards for asking one simple question of their employers. Many of them had been working there for 10 years and had just been handed a sheet of paper with lots of nice numbers on it. Their question was this: will I be guaranteed my full entitlements? That must have been a fairly difficult question for the employers at Linda Electric Industries, as it seems to be for this government at the present time.

I pay tribute to these women because they were standing up for what they believed in. They were standing up for their rights, their demand for what is rightfully theirs, their full entitlements. They want some certainty, like the workers in National Textiles. They have the misfortune of not having Stan Howard on the board of the former Linda Electric Industries. They want the same sort of treatment. They want a guarantee such as the one enjoyed by the workers at National Textiles, a guarantee that they will receive their full entitlements. What is good enough for the workers of National Textiles with Stan Howard on the board is good enough for the workers of Linda Electric Industries in Noble Park. They are going to be joined soon by another group of 30 people, predominantly women and migrants, who are going to be turfed out onto the street by Linda Electric Industries. They will also be given just a sheet of paper with a set of numbers on it, but with no guarantee of their entitlements. I invite Minister Reith to come down to Noble Park-have a look at map 90 in his Melways-and talk to these women and give them a guarantee that they will receive their full entitlements, entitlements such as those enjoyed by the workers at National Textiles. (Time expired) Education: Funding Saturday’s Sydney Morning Herald. The article focused on the frustrations and the increasing pressures being placed on our state school teachers. ‘Who’d be a teacher?’ was the headline. The article went on to state: The criticism is endless, the praise rare. And teachers can never get it right. I thought that article encapsulated the frustration and despair being felt by many school teachers throughout the state of New South Wales. Two weeks ago I attended a public meeting organised by public school teachers and the P&C association in my electorate, and the same frustration and despair were expressed there. There was a very strong feeling of anger and disillusionment. Teachers who were doing their best for the kids-working hard, committed, professional and caring-were constantly under a barrage of criticism from the media. There was frustration at the lack of support from the state government and-worse, in fact-at attacks by the state government and by the minister who was supposed to be looking after them. There was despair and frustration at the declining levels of community recognition and esteem. These feelings are understandable. Most of our teachers are hard working, committed professionals. They are facing increasing expectations, they are having to deal with increasingly diverse issues and constantly changing curriculum material, and they are bearing increasing levels of responsibility in counselling and nurturing children who are alienated or traumatised by dysfunctional families. Year after year the expectations and the pressures on our teachers are growing, but the state government is not keeping up with its responsibility to adequately fund them. Over the last four years direct federal government funding for public schools has increased by 25 per cent, but the funding by the New South Wales state government for its public schools has increased by only 12 per cent. The New South Wales government has badly failed the hard working teachers in our system. Further, federal government financial assistance grants to the states, out of which they get the revenue to fund their schools, has grown by five to six per cent a year, yet the New South Wales government has increased funding for schools by only about three per cent a year and, in fact, in the last budget by two per cent.

Goods and Services Tax: Mobile Homes Bowling Club in my electorate of 100 mobile home owners and village operators to hear a report on the effects that the GST would have on people who live permanently in mobile home villages. The meeting was addressed by Peter Hide, from the Taxation Office, and by the members for Mitchell, Chifley, Grayndler and me. The meeting was organised by Roberta Kovacsics, and I thank Roberta for her sterling effort on behalf on the mobile home owners. The significant point made on behalf of the government by the member for Mitchell was that mobile home owners would not be discriminated against by having to pay a 5.5 per cent GST on their site fees because, believe it or not, the inflationary effects of the GST will result in other forms of private rentals also rising. loss situation applying on all forms of private rentals as the result of the GST. The government would argue that the increases in social security payments for pensioners will compensate permanent park residents for the effects of the GST, but nobody really believes this. One pensioner in my electorate has already written to me to complain that milk, which is GST free, has increased in price by 13 per cent in the last few months. I think we will see other so-called GST-free items also increasing in price by more than the GST 10 per cent. Government members have been quite gallant, I would suggest, in defending this very unpopular tax, but there does appear to be some concern amongst members relating to this particular aspect of the GST. The Deputy Leader of the National Party, Mark Vaile, put out a circular prior to the election saying that the GST would not apply on site fees. Larry Anthony, the Minister for Community Services, said that he would convey to the government his constituents’ concern on the question, therefore, I believe, holding out some hope of a review. In spite of the best efforts of the member for Mitchell, this meeting unanimously carried a resolution condemning the imposition of the GST on mobile home owners. I advised the Riverstone meeting that I would report the result of this meeting to the federal parliament, and I am happy to be able to have done so. Queensland: Unemployment Administration)-In Australia today, we have a period of honesty, openness and accountability. The general public does expect that politicians who make promises will keep them. I rise today to express my concern about the way in which the state of Queensland is falling into a never ending spiral of worsening unemployment under the Beattie Labor government. Prior to the last election, Premier Beattie said that his government would achieve a five per cent unemployment rate. Quite clearly, like Keating in 1996, they were prepared to do anything and say anything to crawl into office. What concerns me, however, is the fact that in Queensland we have a state premier who refuses to admit that the promise he took to the people simply cannot be met.

This government has substantially improved the appalling unemployment situation which we inherited upon election to office in 1996. The problem for my home state is that, while national unemployment has fallen, Queensland’s rate has been stuck at around eight per cent for over a year under a government which is essentially run by Queensland trade union leaders. It is a government by the unions, of the unions and for the unions. This federal government brought in workplace relations reforms; and we, of course, have been opposed by the Labor Party. The Australian general public are appalled by militant trade unions and their bullyboy tactics, as has been instanced on the wharves over the last year or so. This was seen as nothing but a last ditch effort by unions to protect their privileged rorts and backroom deals. While Beattie’s big Queensland grin may win over the local press at times, he lacks the guts to confront the trade unions and his cronies. I believe that is a tragedy. Some even call him ‘Peter, Peter the job eater’. He has not got the personal strength to confront his union mates over the way they withhold productive, business friendly and job friendly policies from Labor’s conferences. The situation is that when he got elected to government, he reversed the important reforms brought in by the Borbidge government. While the Queensland Premier masquerades as a people’s premier, deep down he is hurting because he knows that he cannot maintain his promise of five per cent unemployment-a promise which he made in bad faith. Even Labor’s Leader of the Opposition has said that Australia’s jobless rate will fluctuate at around seven to eight per cent for another decade. Sadly, it would be far worse if Labor were elected to office. It is time that Peter Beattie showed some integrity, took a leaf out of Tony Blair’s book and dumped his regressive, anti-employment, pro-cronyism trade union polices that really ensure that the Queensland people are cut out of the equation. The lesson for Queenslanders is: a vote for a Labor government is a vote for higher unemployment. Premier Beattie and his government stand absolutely condemned. for members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 April, on motion by Mr Fahey: That the bill be now read a second time. Costs) Bill 1999-2000 seeks to provide legislative authority for expenditure by the Attorney General’s Department to meet the Commonwealth’s liability that has arisen under orders made on 25 February this year by the Federal Court and an associated liability to pay interest. The liability relates to the legal costs of Dr Lawrence in connection with the Marks royal commission and her court challenges to that commission. On 25 February the Federal Court ordered that the Commonwealth pay damages and interest in the amount of $761,594.13 and legal costs to be agreed or determined by the court on taxation. There is an outstanding dispute, I understand, about the amount of interest that the Commonwealth is liable to pay. The amount of the actual appropriation is not quantified in the bill. It is, however, limited to the terms of the orders made on 25 February and the provisions of section 52 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, which is the section that deals with the accrual of interest arising from a judgment in any particular matter.

Therefore, we are happy to have the matter considered in the Main Committee. conclusion to one of the most shameless episodes of public administration in my memory. The Appropriation (Dr Carmen Lawrence’s Legal Costs) Bill 1999-2000 deals with the payment of legal fees by the Commonwealth for the member for Fremantle, Carmen Lawrence. These legal fees were incurred by, or on account of acting for, the member for Fremantle in relation to the challenging of the validity of the Marks royal commission. This bill does not provide an amount to be appropriated from the consolidated revenue fund. The amount of post-judgment interest owing for Carmen Lawrence’s legal fees cannot be determined until the judgment debt is paid. It is expected that the appropriation amount will be in the vicinity of $0.75 million. To put the provisions of this bill in context, it is worth revisiting the series of events that led to its introduction. In June 1995, the Keating cabinet decided to pay the legal costs accrued on behalf of the member for Fremantle, Carmen Lawrence, in relation to the Marks royal commission. Then, on 20 June of that year, the then Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, announced that the Commonwealth would fund a challenge for the member for Fremantle to the High Court questioning the legality of the Marks royal commission. The following day the coalition indicated that it would not necessarily support the payment of then Minister Lawrence’s legal fees in their entirety-specifically that portion of the fees incurred in challenging the validity of the royal commission. From that point on, the federal Labor government was on notice that there was a very real possibility that the opposition would not commit Australian taxpayers to footing the total bill for then Minister Lawrence’s legal fees. Meanwhile, on that same day, the Australian Democrats, under their leader, Cheryl Kernotyour good friendmember for Port Adelaide who confirmed that they would insist on parliamentary approval for the payment of Minister Lawrence’s legal fees. On 26 October 1995, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1995 was tabled by the Labor government in parliament in relation to then Minister Lawrence’s legal fees of $800,000. On 28 November, parliament voted down the appropriation for $240,000 incurred in challenging the legitimacy of the Marks royal commission in the High Court. But, unbeknown to the coalition and the Democrats, Labor had effectively already legally committed Australian taxpayers to the entirety of the then Minister Lawrence’s legal fees. The reasons for this are found in the recent judgment of the Federal Court in Vass v. the Commonwealth. Justice Burchett held that the Commonwealth was contractually bound by undertakings given to Dunhill Madden Butler by staff in the offices of then Minister Lawrence and then Prime Minister Paul Keating. This political compact ensured that Australian taxpayers would have to pay what was essentially the personal legal costs of Carmen Lawrence in a matter totally unrelated to her responsibilities at the time as a federal minister. It is this unfortunate arrangement that has necessitated the introduction of this bill presently before the House which burdens Australian taxpayers to the tune of at least $0.75 million. But the passing of this bill will not guarantee closure on this issue. There are still a series of critical questions that remain unanswered concerning what has happened to the money that people donated in good faith to the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund.",136,Representatives Main Committee

From the time that the Appropriations Bill (No. 4) was passed in November 1995 various senior ministers-Carmen Lawrence, Gareth Evans and Kim Beazley-made many statements about the issue of then Minister Lawrence’s legal fees. On 29 November, then Minister Lawrence confirmed that cabinet had determined that the legal fees should be met by the Commonwealth. On the same day, Minister Beazley said: It is not our intention to fund that element of Mrs Lawrence’s legal expenses by any other method than ultimately a recourse to parliament. Sadly, now we know that was not the case. But even when then Ministers Beazley and Lawrence made those statements, did they know that, in fact, this would never be the case? In fact, did they not already know that the Commonwealth was locked into paying the legal fees because cabinet had already made that decision and because staff from their respective offices had created a contractual obligation with Dunhill Madden Butler? It certainly appears to be the case. On 29 November 1995, then Minister Lawrence revealed: Cabinet decided that the bills should be met. I would not have undertaken any challenges at all if there had been any suggestion that they would have to be met either by me or the ALP. The reality is that former Ministers Beazley, Evans and Lawrence were all aware that cabinet had determined that the Commonwealth would pay the entirety of Carmen Lawrence’s legal fees. They were also most likely aware that the Commonwealth would be legally forced to pay the entirety of the fees, irrespective of parliament’s decision. Years later, even former General Secretary of the Labor Party Gary Gray admitted: We have always believed theythe legal feeswere properly incurred by the Commonwealth. Former Minister Beazley asserted it was not Labor’s: ... intention to fund that element of Mrs Lawrence’s legal expenses by any other method than ultimately a recourse to parliament. However, he was, either intentionally or otherwise, circumventing the superiority of parliament over cabinet by creating contractual obligations between the government and Dunhill Madden Butler that their fees would be paid by the Commonwealth. But this information did not stop then Ministers Beazley and Evans from whipping up hysteria over the liability of the legal fees. On3 December, then Minister Beazley was reported in the Canberra Times: Deputy Prime Minister Kim Beazley says it is imperative the Labor Party ensure that Carmen Lawrence is not bankrupted by having to pay legal fees arising out of her court challenges to the Marks Royal Commission. Mr Beazley confirmed that Dr Lawrence would have to step down from parliament if she were made bankrupt. Then there was a quote from then Minister Beazley: “We could not let that happen, absolutely.” The charade continued when Gareth Evans claimed in the Sydney Morning Herald: “She could be faced with bankruptcy.” So, on 5 December 1995, the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was established. Its trustees included then General Secretary of the Labor Party, Gary Gray, the now New South Wales",137,Representatives Main Committee

That must have been a happy bunch, Mr Deputy Speaker, given the make-up of the trustees. The trustees of the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund actively sought public donations to pay that portion of Carmen Lawrence’s legal fees that were not going to be covered by the Commonwealth. The defence fund received contributions from such luminaries as the former member for Bass, Sylvia Smith, and from an unsuspecting public who were led to believe by the ministers of that government that then Minister Lawrence was likely face bankruptcy if the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was not established. It is understood that the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund currently holds as much as $100,000, although some media reports have suggested that at one stage the fund held as much as $240,000. Following the Federal Court’s orders in Vass v. the Commonwealth in February, federal Attorney-General, Daryl Williams QC, has written two letters to the trustees of the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund. The Attorney-General has asked the trustees, on behalf of the Australian taxpayers, to obtain the consent of the donors to the defence fund, under clause 3 of the trust deed, for reimbursement of Commonwealth expenditure to help meet legal costs incurred by Dunhill Madden Butler in acting for Carmen Lawrence. The government’s reasonable and proper request has fallen on deaf ears at Curtin House. I understand that the Attorney-General has received two items of correspondence from the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund in response to this request. I further understand that, on both occasions, the fund has effectively denied that they owe any obligation to Australian taxpayers to reduce their liability for the legal fees of the member for Fremantle. issue to do with the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund paying its share of the legal fees for Carmen Lawrence. That is all we are asking them to do, to pay their share. We know that we are stuck with paying the bill, but we would like them to cough up their $100,000. This is an extraordinary position for the supposedly egalitarian Australian Labor Party to be taking. It is particularly galling when we see media reports indicating that the fund is writing to donors seeking their agreement to the balance of the fund being used for other purposes. breach of public administration practice, starting with cabinet and ministerial staffers circumventing the will of parliament in 1995. The actions of the trustees of the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund, in refusing to pay the funds to pay for Carmen Lawrence’s legal fees, compounds the breach. The government’s position is that the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was established to pay the portion of the member for Fremantle’s legal fees that parliament refused to pay, and that the fund should be used for that purpose-a very reasonable position. The Australian Labor Party’s refusal to disclose the status and future intention of the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund leaves a series of critical questions unanswered by the Leader of the Opposition. Firstly, as the legal fees have not been paid to Dunhill Madden Butler, where are the proceeds of the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund? Are they sitting at Curtin House and are they earning income for the Labor Party? Does the Labor Party expect that the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund will not have to pay the legal fees, in which case has a fraud been perpetrated on those who donated to the fund believing that they were doing so to stave off the potential bankruptcy of Carmen Lawrence?",138,Representatives Main Committee

Have they been done out of their money? If the Labor Party expected the Commonwealth to pay, why were Gary Gray and the former Ministers Evans and Beazley promoting the idea that former Minister Lawrence was facing bankruptcy? Why did former Minister Beazley whip up hysteria about Carmen Lawrence’s alleged potential bankruptcy when, as a cabinet minister, he was part of the decision making process that had committed the Commonwealth to pay the debt? Has any money been drawn from the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund? If so, if it is has not been drawn for the purpose of the payment of legal fees, what other purpose could funds be directed to? Are the donors to the fund aware that these funds have not been applied to date for Carmen Lawrence’s legal fees? Was the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund a pre-election ruse designed to deflect attention from the issue of her veracity and to create sympathy for her? The public and the donors to the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund may well ask why the proceeds have not been used for the purposes for which they were collected. They may also care to ask about interest earned on the fund and whether administration charges have been made. It would also be expected that, if indeed any payment has been made from the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund, then that payment should appear on the Register of Members’ Interests. Fremantle records on the Register of Members’ Interests the payment of her legal fees which, of course, are very much a diminution of a potential personal liability to herself. If you were one of the people duped into giving money to the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund, wouldn’t you want to know whether that money was spent on her legal fees? I am sure if the member for Port Adelaide had given money to the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund he would want to know if it was being used for her legal fees-or were you duped too? I hope you were not duped, the member for Port Adelaide. ignore the interventions of the member for Port Adelaide. it to those people to tell them whether it is going to pay for the member for Fremantle’s legal fees or whether it will go to 100,000 of direct mail from Curtin House at the next electionprobably not in the member for Port Adelaide’s electorate.

If it is not to be used for that purpose, the public and the parliament have a right to know for what purpose it will be used in the future. There is no doubt that it would be in the best interests of Australian taxpayers that the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund be exhausted before the taxpayers are called upon to foot Carmen Lawrence’s legal fees. If such a contribution were made, then it would partly offset the appropriation the parliament is now required to make. If this does not occur, it will be another example of Labor protecting its own interests and thumbing its nose at ordinary taxpayers.

Administration) (10.14 a.m.)-As honourable members would be aware, on 25 February this year the Federal Court of Australia ordered that the Commonwealth pay legal costs, damages and interest to the date of judgment. The Federal Court held that the Commonwealth was legally liable to pay damages for breach of contract which arose following the Commonwealth’s initial refusal to pay the legal costs incurred by the honourable member for Fremantle in relation to the Marks royal commission and her court challenges to that commission. The subject matter of the commission arose prior to the member for Fremantle’s election to the federal parliament. The Appropriation (Dr Carmen Lawrence’s Legal Costs) Bill 1999-2000 seeks to appropriate moneys from the consolidated revenue fund to meet these liabilities. The amount to be appropriated is not specified due to the nature of the judgment. Similarly, the amount of the post judgment interest cannot be quantified until the judgment debt is paid. The purpose for which the money can be appropriated under the bill is however limited to amounts resulting directly from that judgment. Accordingly, the appropriation is not discretionary. Moneys appropriated under this bill are additional to the appropriations made in other appropriation acts in 1999-2000. In summing up, I would like to echo the words of my colleague the Minister for Finance and Administration. In his second reading speech on this bill, he stated: ... the need for this bill is the result of a typical ALP style deal done under the former Keating Labor government to help one of its mates. The taxpayer, of course, will end up picking up the tab. Reading the judgment of the Federal Court, the clear impression is that the Commonwealth was contractually bound by a political compact organised by the offices of the member for Fremantle and Prime Minister Keating and supported by a decision of cabinet on 8 June 1995 to pay what were essentially the personal legal costs of Dr Lawrence. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you would understand that this unfortunate and bizarre arrangement has necessitated the introduction of this bill which burdens Australian taxpayers, the mums and dads of Australia, to the tune of at least three-quarters of a million dollars. It gives me no pleasure to commend this particular bill to the House. I also note that the Commonwealth Attorney-General has rightly asked the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund to contribute towards the member for Fremantle’s legal expenses. This has not occurred. If such a contribution had been made, this appropriation would not have been needed to be as great as it is and taxpayers’ money would have been saved. The Australian Labor Party has been asked to contribute towards the cost of these expenses, and a contribution from that party would also seem to be more than appropriate. Such a contribution would further offset the appropriation provided for in this bill. It is, however, my regrettable duty to commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative.

I must say I was inveigled into this debate by the member for Sturt, Mr Pyne, who frankly made some outrageous comments. Let us clearly understand and let me put on the record the very clear history of this matter. This whole matter started when the Western Australian Liberal Premier, Richard Court, in a politically motivated way, established a royal commission with one objective-a political witch-hunt. So if you are worried about the expenditure of taxpayers’ funds, ask yourself the question: how many millions of dollars did Richard Court waste in pursuing a member of the Commonwealth parliament by way of a political witch-hunt? When we saw the results of that politically inspired royal commission jacked up by Richard Court in cahoots with his federal Liberal colleagues-and that is also on the record-what did a District Court jury in Western Australia do when it came for a fair, impartial, objective consideration of these matters? They threw out every charge in less than 45 minutes. It took them about three minutes per charge to throw it out unanimously. Mr Pyne interjectingheard in silence. He might want to have more respect for the procedures, practices and demeanour of this place than he has had for the procedures which have seen this bill come to light. matters after about three minutes consideration per charge. Millions of dollars were wasted by Richard Court in the course of a jacked up, trumped up, political witch-hunt which a jury of Western Australians threw out. Someone might like to ask Richard Court, Daryl Williams and the rest of his federal Liberal colleagues, how much money Richard Court wasted which could have been spent on Western Australian schools and hospitals. How much money did he waste? I remind people of a point that I previously made in this parliament. In the course of that trial, counsel for Dr Lawrence made a submission which made it crystal clear that the royal commissioner and counsel assisting the royal commission had ordered the destruction of documents which could only have had the effect of prejudicing Dr Lawrence’s fair trial. And when we come to this bill, when the Attorney-General stands in the other place, as he occasionally does, I simply interject by saying to him, ‘Daryl, why don’t you appeal?’ If the Attorney-General had any basis for proceeding other than the way in which he has, then he might want to appeal against the decision of the Federal Court. When people stand in this place and talk about the expenditure of taxpayers’ funds, they can ask themselves this question: how many millions of dollars did a Liberal state government waste in a trumped up, jacked up, political witch-hunt? How many millions of dollars did they waste which could have been spent on Western Australian schools and hospitals, improving facilities and services for people in Western Australia? How many millions of dollars were wasted in a District Court trial which was thrown out and where submissions were made during that case that counsel assisting, Miss Vanstone QC, and the royal commissioner had ordered the destruction of documents which could only have the effect of prejudicing Dr Lawrence’s fair trial? Contemplate that when you stand up and talk about the waste of funds. When this matter came to its final conclusion, a District Court jury unanimously, and in less than an hour’s consideration, threw out the proceeds of a politically inspired witch-hunt jacked up by Liberal statebeing maligned in the chamber.

I ask the member to withdraw any imputation of her motives as it defames a member of the judiciary. that individual became a judge and any criticisms are directed to that person in their previous existence. I do not believe there is a point of order. I call the honourable member for Perth. the member for Sturt clearly understands that the royal commissioner in that matter was a retired judge. were made in that case which made it crystal clear that counsel assisting, Vanstone QC, together with a retired judge who was the royal commissioner, ordered the destruction of documents which could only have the effect of prejudicing Dr Lawrence’s fair trial. The problem is that it did not work because a Western Australian jury threw it out within 45 minutes. (Time expired) Administration) (10.24 a.m.)-I will be quite brief. The member for Perth mounted a spirited defence of the honourable member for Fremantle, but he was fighting a West Australian battle here in the Commonwealth parliament. My expression of regret that the parliament is being asked to reimburse these funds related to the fact that the Keating Labor government did a deal with one of its members in relation to conduct prior to that member becoming a member of the federal parliament. My argument is that this matter did not, in any way, shape or form, relate to the Commonwealth. It predated the member for Fremantle’s involvement in the Commonwealth parliament. It was a sleazy deal by the Labor Party and the cabinet at that time to agree to pay what were essentially personal legal expenses in relation to circumstances which arose prior to the member for Fremantle being elected as a member of the Commonwealth parliament. Also, in my summing-up speech, I drew the attention of the chamber to the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund and the fact that people had contributed money with a view to assisting the member for Fremantle in her defence. The government, quite reasonably, has asked both the member for Fremantle and the Australian Labor Party to contribute to the moneys which will be paid pursuant to this appropriation, if indeed this appropriation is carried by the federal parliament. The purpose of the Appropriation (Dr Carmen Lawrence's Legal Costs) Bill is to implement a judgment of the Federal Court. That judgment flowed from a decision made by the former Keating Labor government to effectively reimburse the legal expenses of a member of that government in relation to circumstances prior to that member of the government even becoming involved in the Commonwealth parliament. In that sense, it was a most strange and bizarre arrangement. This government objected to that. The Federal Court has made a decision and the purpose of the bill which is before the House is to implement and give effect to that decision which we greatly regret. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, in reverse order. Firstly, if the government and the Attorney-General had any difficulty with the decision of the Federal Court, then they ought to have appealed. They did not appeal. They came to this parliament with an appropriation bill because they know there is no appeal from the Federal Court decision because that Federal Court decision was right. That is the point. If there was a difficulty with this appropriation, the Attorney-General had a course of action open to him.",142,Representatives Main Committee

278,Mr Stephen Smith (Perth) (10.26 A.m.),"I refer very briefly to the points made by the15884 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 12 April 2000 That course of action was to appeal. He did not appeal because he knew the appeal would be lost. Secondly, in reverse order of the points that the parliamentary secretary made, he said, ‘What is the Commonwealth connection here? The member for Perth has said that these are Western Australian matters; what is the Commonwealth connection here?’ The Commonwealth connection is this: a Liberal state premier conspired with his federal colleagues to tear down and do damage to a federal minister and a federal member of this place. That is the connection. That is the Commonwealth connection. A Liberal state premier conspired with his federal colleagues to do his utmost with a politically inspired royal commission to tear down a member of this place. Mr Deputy Speaker, the ultimate verdict on this matter is said to you in two things. Firstly, a Western Australian District Court threw out trumped up political charges in less than 45 minutes. Secondly, this bill is here because the government and the Attorney-General know that the Federal Court has told them what is the only appropriate and correct thing to do. Administration) (10.28 a.m.)-In the interests of brevity, I want to say, on behalf of the government, that we completely, totally and absolutely reject the allegations just made by the honourable member for Perth. actions of the government on this issue. My colleague the member for Perth has very adequately outlined exactly how inappropriate the government’s actions have been on the whole Carmen Lawrence issue. With regard to where and why this appropriation is necessary, a few points need to be made. The appropriation is necessary because the Federal Court has made that decision. As my colleague the member for Perth has said, if there is any doubt on the part of the Attorney General as to the appropriateness of that decision, the appropriate thing for him to do is to appeal that decision. He is not doing so because he knows that that would also be thrown out and would just increase the costs involved in this case. When it comes to talk of taxpayers' money, the fact is that $7 million has been wasted by the Premier of Western Australia on a political vendetta against a very effective, competent former Premier of Western Australia and minister of the Commonwealth parliament. That is what this was about: tearing down a politician who is a colleague of mine, and one for whom I have great respect. a good premier and a good minister-is highlighted by the way this bill is being dealt with today. The fact is that the Treasurer could have had funds at his disposal to deal with appropriations of this sort. There was no need to have a bill titled Appropriation (Dr Carmen Lawrence’s Legal Costs) Bill 1999-2000. That emphasises exactly what this vendetta is all about. The real say was in the District Court of Western Australia where the jury unanimously threw out all charges against her in 45 minutes. That showed just what a farcical situation this is. I have the utmost respect for Dr Carmen Lawrence, and if people think that anyone on this side of the House is about to run away from that respect and that friendship, then they are very wrong. We know what this is about. It is about the fact that you people over there have a ‘born to rule’ mentality and cannot cope with the fact that competent Labor ministers and premiers just get on with the job.",143,Representatives Main Committee

The bill is not about the Marks royal commission, it is not about the veracity of Carmen Lawrence and it is not about witch-hunts or dubious deals. I support the parliamentary secretary in his total repudiation of the allegation made against the former leaders of the Liberal Party that they were in any way in cahoots with Richard Court. My points have been all about the fact that there is $100,000 in the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund. That money was raised for the purpose of legal fees under the illusion that there was a possibility that Carmen Lawrence would be made bankrupt and that, in that event, that money should be used to reduce by $100,000 the liability of taxpayers for legal fees. That is what I have said all along. Everything else beyond that, which has been raised by the Member for Perth and the Member for Grayndler, is quite extraneous to the issues before the House today. I am disappointed that they have chosen to attack the coalition for no good reason. Bill be agreed to. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.

282,Mr Pyne (Sturt) (10.32 A.m.),"I want very quickly to make it clear what theWednesday, 12 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15887 The following answers to questions were circulated: Private Health Insurance: Media Campaign Costs (Question No. 1210) Mr Leo McLeay asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 6 March 2000: (1) What is the estimated total cost of the Government’s media campaign on private health insurance and what is the breakdown of those costs. (2) In relation to the campaign, what is the breakdown of expenditure between the various types of media, including television, radio and print. (1) The media campaign that the Government is conducting is to inform the public about Lifetime Health Cover. The estimated total cost of the Government’s media campaign on Lifetime Health Cover is $15.95m. The approximate breakdown of this cost is: Advertising (including production and agency fees) $11.20m Public Relations $ 4.10m Research$ 0.34m Administration $ 0.31m ------------Total $15.95m (2) Of the $11.2m advertising budget, approximately $9.9m is allocated for the purchase of media space as per the following approximate breakdown: Television $5.6m Print $3.8m Outdoor advertising $0.5m Radio $0.0m ------------Total $9.9m Goods and Services Tax: Caravan Parks (Question No. 1248) Ms Hall asked the Minister for Community Services, upon notice, on 13 March 2000: Will the Government’s decision to allow the GST to be imposed on the rent paid by permanent residents living in residential and relocatable home parks cause significant hardship to those persons; if so, (a) why are those residents being treated differently to other Australians who pay residential rentals and (b) will the Government compensate residential park residents to place them in the same position as other residential renters. No. Permanent residents living in residential and relocatable home parks will not be worse off, under the GST. The Government is giving owners and operators of caravan parks a choice between two options. The first option is to allow them to use the same treatment as applies to residential accommodation generally, that is input taxation of the rentals. The second option is to apply a concessional form of GST. Owners will choose the taxation treatment that serves them and their residents best. Under either option, the net impact will be similar to that for private rental accommodation. The Government is providing a generous compensation package including: . increasing the maximum rate of Rent Assistance by 7 per cent to compensate people on low incomes for rises in rental costs;",145,Representatives Main Committee

284,Mr Anthony,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:. increasing pensions and allowances by 4 per to compensate low income people for other expected price increases; and . providing low income families with very generous tax cuts and increases in family benefits that will also benefit many residents of long term commercial accommodation. Aged Care: Indigenous Australians (Question No. 9999) Ms Jann McFarlane asked the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 6 March 2000: Is it not a fact that the Productivity Commission has noticed that people from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds are significantly under-represented in nursing homes? Can you confirm that while making up 2.3 percent of a target population for nursing home care only 0.8 percent of people from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds are in nursing homes? Do these figures not represent the discrepancy between this government’s policy on indigenous issues you are happy to have Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders over-represented in our prisons, but you do nothing to ensure they have equal access to our nursing homes. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Productivity Commission Report stated that factors such as cultural difference may influence the extent to which various special needs groups use residential care, and should be considered when interpreting statistics. It is the Government’s objective to ensure equitable access to aged care services for both indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. Indigenous Australians generally prefer to stay in the community and be cared for by members in their community. Community aged care packages have therefore been found to be more culturally appropriate in meeting the needs of this group. The Government has actively targeted community care packages to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. In recognition of the fact th2t disability and ageing affect the indigenous community at an earlier age, the Government considers statistics on indigenous people aged 50 and over when planning the distribution of aged care places, as compared to 70 for non-Indigenous aged Australians. Thus Indigenous aged Australians make up 2.3% of the target. The success of this strategy is shown by the fact that 3.0% of community care packages funded by the Department in 1998-99 were provided to Indigenous Australians. The Government also currently funds 21 aged care services which provide flexible aged care specifically for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities7 plus approximately 40 mainstream residential aged care facilities which are either auspiced by Aboriginal communities or primarily target Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. These are in addition to the specific Multipurpose Services for Indigenous Australians. These statistics are the position as at June 1999.",148,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
