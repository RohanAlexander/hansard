Later : tion to mention that the total charges made by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company under the existing agreement amount to £5 4s. Od. per ton, made up as follows:-Freight, based on actual cost, £1 12s. Od.; selling commission, 7s.; managing cost, £ 1 ; refining charges, £1 03. l i d . ; bags, at cost price, 16s.; coal, 7s. 3d.; these items making a gross total of £5 4s. Od. Out of that sum an amount of £2 7s. l i d . was payment direct to the company, and the remainder was money paid by the company for various services rendered, shipping, bags, and coal. The estimate under the proposed agreement is £6 2s. 6d. per ton as against £5 4s. Od., and it is made up thus:-Freight, & c , £ 2 . This is an estimate upon the actual cost. stand that the company has nothing to do with the matter except to engage and pay for freight. It simply pays whatever freight is current. A t present, and for some time past, as honourable members may know, the freight has heen s.s fixed by the Government, and the Government is responsible for lossesand gains. Sof ar there have been all losses and no gains. And, as honourable members also know, increases in wages and costs of running the steamers have been very material, and, consequently, freights w ill be still higher. under the new agreement will be £2, as against £1 12s. Od. The selling commission this time is 7s., as it was previously. Tho management item is £1 2s. 6d., as against £1 in the previous agree-' ment. The explanation is that the company now has to finance on a £30 6s. 8d. basis instead of upon the £21 basis and, consequently, has to find some millions sterling of additional money, for which, of course, it must be paid. charges are £1 3s. Od. as against £1 0s. l i d counted for by the increased wages paid in the refineries. Bags, it is estimated, will cost £ 1 , as against tfie previous cost of 16s. The charge for coal is now estimated at 10s., as against 7s. 3d. under the present agreement. The company receives-, therefore, .only 2s. 6d'. more I do not desire a disthan under the present agreement. It is now called upon to finance this scheme and pay interest om capital on a basis of £30 6s. 8d. instead of upon the £ 2 1 basis.

46,Mr Robert Cook (Indi) [2.56],"however, compliment the mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply on the speeches they delivered. I am pleased to see that the oft-repeated promises of cooperative assistance hy the Prime Minister to the primary producers are included in the Governor General's Sp'eech. I happen to he one of the eleven members of that party which is called the "" Country party""a party that has been much abused and much criticised, and, probably, rightly so in some respects. The Prime Minister, in his remarks at Wangaratta during the election campaign, made reference to the Country party as being the "" tail end of the Ryan dog."" That is not a very complimentary remark, nor one that adds any great prestige to the Prime Minister of Australia. But what did the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) say? He said, on the floor of this House, that we in this co-operative efforts, and I am pleased in corner were the "" tai l e n d "" of the Nationalist party. It would be seen that both gentlemen agree that we are the "" t a i l e n d "" of some party, and my adand a half years the workers of Ausvice, taking it for what it is worth, is tralia have, on account of strikes and that we get on with the business of the House and the country generally, or the "" t a i l e n d "" may be the head of both parties in the near future. As a new, though not a very young, member, I have noted the debates that have taken place here, and I assure honourable members that I feel convinced there is a considerable waste of time. It w ill be very wise to abolish Hansard. members would not then be so fond of talking to empty galleriejs, and from what I know of the two leading Melbourne newspapers not much publicity would be given to their speeches. The cost of living is the topic of the hour, and there is no doubt that it is a burning question. It claims the gravest consideration of every man in this House and of every Parliament in the Commonwealth. The industrial unrest that is abroad will increase unless active measures are taken to prove that we are at least in earnest in attempting to deal with this important problem. We ought to consider, firstly, the cause of the high cost of living, and, secondly, the means of prevention'. Chief amongst the causes is the lamentable world-wide war. For four and a half years the world has been engaged in slaughter, and the whole energies of the Empire have been devoted to the manufacture of destructive machinery. Belgium, which was in the forefront of industrial advancement, has been practically blown to pieces. France is crippled industrially, and England is struggling under a huge debt of £8,000,000,000. Parts of Germany, from which, prior to the war, we received millions of pounds worth of cheap goods per annum, are on the verge of starvation. Industrial wages in Europe have risen 100 per cent.; shipping freights have trebled. Having regard to these facts, it must be many years before we can expect to get from tlie Motherland goods at their pre-war rates. In my opinion, the prices of imported articles will be very much higher than they are to-day. A t the present time, Australia is the cheapest country in the world to live in . The problem of the high cost of living can be solved to some extent by deed that the Prime Minister( Mr. Hughes) has advocated co-operation right through the piece. During the last four other causes, lost about £6,000,000 in wages alone. If the money that is wasted on strikes were put into co-operative enterprises by the industrial workers, I , and I believe all primary producers, would be ready to deal directly with them. I regard the industrial workers as the finest asset that the country possesses, and it is the duty of the House Honourable and the country to give them all reasonable assistance. If they established butcheries and bakeries, and the primary producer dealt directly with them, the profiteer in foodstuffs would be at tlieir mercy. If skilled men were appointed to the management of these concerns, I have no doubt that the success they would achieve would be of greater benefit to the workers than are strikes, which hold up industries, and penalize the whole community. Strikes have caused an enormous loss of capital, and that loss has gravitated through all classes, so that practically everybody has been penalized more or less. An y system of co-operation that will obviate these disastrous disputes will be welcomed most heartily by the members of the Country party. The matter of the duplication of Federal and State services has been referred to by nearly every honourable member who has spoken. Senator Fairbairn stated last year that co-ordination of Commonwealth and State activities would result in a saving of £340,000 per annum. I quite believe that estimate. The co-ordination and. amalgamation of Departments should receive the earliest consideration of the Government, and I am pleased to know that this matter is a plank in their platform. I find myself obliged to cross swords with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) on the subject of defence. I am convinced that the future of this great continent will be dependent upon an efficient defence scheme, and that any money that is judiciously and economically expended on that object will be wisely spent. We must remember that the teeming millions of Asia are at our doors, and that we have only 5,000,000 people to hold a continental island greater in extent than the United States of America, which has a population of 100,000,000. How can we keep this continent clean, white, and wholesome unless we adopt an effective system of defence? That eminent naval warrior, Lord Jellicoe, who has had experience of the aeroplanes and submarines and all the other menaces to' capital ships has reported that he still pins his faith to the Dreadnoughts. That means that Australia will require to expend £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 annually for some years on naval defence. That expenditure is worthy of consideration, and the Country party will support the Government in any sound and economical policy for the defence of Aus-"" tralia. In the crisis through which the world has just passed the British Empire was our salvation. But for the protection of the British Navy what would have been, the fate of Australia? We must look to the British Navy in future to a large extent for our safety, and if we the honourable member has described. I are to prove ourselves worthy of this great continent, for which 60,000 of our brave warriors, in addition to hundreds of thousands of our Allies, laid down their lives, we must not stint or grudge the expenditure that may be necessary in order to give effect to a bold and comprehensive system of defence on right lines. I believe that in the present Minisform, but while affording them the freest ter for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) we have a man who will keep a shrewd eye on the best interests of Australia in that regard. Mr Robert Cook. In regard to the Federal CapitalI think the Prime Minister stated that there was to be no ceremonial stone-laying. I hope there never will be anything of the kind. I shall vote against the wilful, wanton, and extravagant expenditure of money on the establishment of a Federal capital. We are told that it would cost upward of £3,000,000 to create a temporary bush capital. Having just emerged from the struggle of the war, we should be guilty of nothing but criminal folly if we increased our present debt by incurring this enormous waste of money. From what I can gather from brainy men throughout Australia, I understand that it would be a huge mistake to proceed with the building of the Federal Capital. In the meantime I am prepared to allow the Seat of Government to be transferred to Sydney for a term of twenty years. In the course of that period we would probably be found to have a little more brains and possibly a little more money. At any rate, we would be in a better position to know just exactly where the Capital should be. I would like to continue speaking at greater length, but I feel that I am merely beating the bush. Already unnecessary time has been occupied by this somewhat useless discussion, but still the general feeling is that a debate on the motion for the adoption of the Addressin-Reply enables an honourable member to "" get a little off his chest."" What the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) said the other night in regard to the conditions in the BrokenH ill mines impressed me very much, because I lived in a mining town and have the greatest sympathy with the miners. I have heard of a hell on earth, but never previously of such a hell underneath as feel that if his statements are correct, we have only one of two courses to pursue, either to shut' the death traps down for ever, or to make them as free and open as their output. will possibly permit for the men working in them. The Farmers party has no desire to harass the Government in any shape or assistance to carry on their administration, we want reasonable assistance extended to the rural producers. Surely they are entitled to that reasonable consideration, seeing that they produce 76 per cent, of the wealth of Australia, and representing 50 per cent, of the population, pay one-third of ;be annual war interest bill of £30,000,000. If reasonable consideration is given to the country districts, the connection with the development of the towns can look after themselves. We want a bold developmental policy to be pursued. Expenditure of money in that direction will receive our hearty support. It will be money spent in the truest and best interests of Australia generally. I congratulate the Prime Minister( Mr woollen goods in the world's markets, and Hughes) upon coming to a definite decision with regard to the manufacture of wool tops. Many people in my constituency, engaged in the manufacture of wool tops, have been out of employment for the last two years, a fact which did not reflect much credit upon the Government, or speak highly of their intelligence. The matter could have been settled long before this, and should have been, because the wool-tops industry is one of the largest in the country. The establishment in which the industry has been carried on in my electorate is most up-to-date, yet, through some misunderstanding between the Central Wool Committee and the company, it has been shut ' down for some time, creating a very unfortunate position, not only for the employees, but also for the country generally. I have nothing to say about the agreement which has just been drawn up; I understand that Sir Robert Garran and other legal officers of the Crown have been engaged in the task; but I hope that now the trouble has been settled, prosperity will return to the Botany district, and we shall all do our best to ""produce more,"" as so many people advocate should be done. Here was a large industry producing nothing, but we hope now it will make progress. At any rate, at the end of June, when the War Precautions Act ceases to operate, and the control of the Central Wool Committee will terminate, I hope to see large woollen industries springing up all over Australia. market for these wool combings ? The manufacturers have made a good deal of money out of Japan, and we should encourage them in that regard. [23] bugbear raised about the exportation of metals. concluded is only a preliminary step in woollen industry. I hope that Australia will lead the world in the production of woollen goods. Here we have the finesfe wool. We do not need to send it away. Buyers come here from all parts of the world. We should be able to produce and sell blankets and cloth and all other I hope that that will be the policy of this country, irrespective of the consideration of party interests. The Prime Minister has said that on account of the Constitution Alteration Bills not receiving the endorsement of the people, he could not deal with profiteering; but I have with me a copy of the manifesto at Bendigo, in which the following occurs:We shall protect the consumers against exploiters. There is no mention there of any need for an alteration of the Constitution to deal with exploiters. I am anxious to see industrial peace, but if the cost of living is to keep soaring up there must be some end. honourable member suggest ? ing so far. If the cost of living goes up, wages will have to go up, and as wages increase, soi does the cost of living soar. Where is the end of it all ? Any practical man who wants to solve the problem would suggest the regulation of the prices of commodities in the interests of every member of the community. We have attempted tofixprices, but we have started at the wrong end. We have attempted to fix the price of boots without any effort at fixing the price which the manufacturer has to pay for his raw material. I maintain that if we seek to fix the price of boots we have first to fix the price of hides, and then the prioe of leather, and ultimately the price of the manufactured article. member regard the price of hides as too high? pre-war rates. able member cheapen hides ?",24,Kerby

In regard to my conduct so far, I desire to make an explanation. I owe no apologies, and do not intend to make an apology; but it has been brought home to me that honourable members are sometimes called upon to cast their votes upon matters which have not previously come under their legislative notice, and which have not come up for adequate debate in this Chamber. During last week 1 cast a vote in accordance with a promise made to my constituents; and I hope that, so long as I remain here, I shall keep my pledges in every particular. The matter of the Commonwealth police was hurriedly and unexpectedly mentioned; and, since I had promised to vote in favour of the abolition of the Commonwealth police, I did so. Much to my surprise, the Melbourne Herald came out with a great heading"" The Government challenged ""-and it announced that Mr Erancis was the only Nationalist member who had voted against tbe Government. Afte r the vote had been taken T was somewhat surprised to learn that the term "" Commonwealth police "" had been misrepresented. I was given to understand by the speech of the PrimeM in ister that the Commonwealth police were a. band of men engaged to keep dowr. disloyalty and Sinn Peinism. I assure honourable members that, if a body of men is necessary to suppress disloyalty and Sinn Eeinism, I w ill always be prepared to vote for the continuance of that body. I have entered this Chamber as a loyal subject of the K in g , and I do not desire I sincerely trust that the amending Bill that it should be said that I voted in favour of disloyalty. I listened with great interest to the Governoi'-General's lency rightly said that we, as a British people, were glad indeed that the great war had terminated. said in this Chamber about the Union Jack and concerning the part which Australia played in the war. I know that Australia did its noblest and best, and that there is hardly a man or woman whoj in his or her heart of hearts, does not feel found, however that h e ' cannot secure grateful for the successful termination of Mr Francis. the conflict. It may be out of place for me, as a new member, to strike a note of warning, but I point out that in other parts of the world the condition of warfare has not yet ended. As an Australian people we may yet be expected to defend our shores, even from within. Australia's defence policy must be carried on in all seriousness by this National Parliament. We canuot afford to be caught sleeping. The eyes of other nations are on Australia; we must train our men to defend these shores, and to be prepared if ever the time of peril should come. The part played by the women of this land is a matter upon which this Parliament's heartiest thanks should be accorded. The war work of our women was magnificent, and we should take the earliest, opportunity to pay tribute to their great a.nd noble efforts. I congratulate the Government upon its promise to amend the repatriation legislation. I have had the honour to represent the Minister for Repatriation upon tbe Malvern Committee since its inception, and I know from personal experience that the repatriation Statute must be improved. Mention has been made during this debate of the position of a deceased soldier's mother who has been, deserted by her husband. Under the present Act the bereft mother has no claim for assistance whatever. I know personally of a mother who was deserted many years ago by her husband. She sent her only two sons to the Front. Without doubt, she had. depended upon them for her living. Both lads were killed. I have pleaded with the Repatriation Department time and again that assistance should be granted to her. The answer has been, however, that since she has a husband, he is supposed to look after her. will provide for cases such as that. As a municipal councillor I have been brought into close touch with local conSpeech. His Excelditions, and I am convinced that in several respects the repatriation legislation can be considerably improved upon. Much has been I know of a case of a returned soldier who has seen four years' active service. He desires to re-establish himself in his former occupation. He has purchased a block of land, and intends to build an office in which to carry on his business. He has building materials in order to get a start I have approached the Repatriation Department on his behalf, and have asked whether it is not possible for h i m to be given preference over others in respect to bricks and cement. To-day he is "" on the rocks,"" because he cannot secure a building in which to carry on. member think it would be a wrong policy to grant preference to one returned soldier over another? I meant that this returned man should be given preference over outsiders with regard to the distribution of bricks and cement. It has been rumoured, by the way, that the Repatriation Department is holding large stocks of cement. I have been given to understand that, somewhere along the wharfs, there is a store in which a good deal of cement is held for the Repatriation Department. If such is the case it is the duty of the Government to release the stocks, and, if possible, provide bricks also for the requirements of our returned men. The man to whom I . have referred has work to do, but he has been compelled to borrow money right and' lef t in order to maintain an existence.. The vocational training scheme is another important, matter. It has been said in the course of this debate that technical education is a great asset to the community. In most.parts of the world technical education has been a proved success; it has been the means of teaching young people their trades, thus providing adequate numbers of skilled workers. A slipshod workman is no good to anybody. Efficiency is absolutely necessary. Economy is all r i g h t ; I stand, for a policy of economy, and have pledged myself to do all in my power to further it. But I stand', also, for efficiency. It is of no value to use the pruning knife ruthlessly upon our great educational system if it is to be at the cost of efficiency. It is quite likely that he was in a more I should like, as ,,a new member, to give my impression of this House; and in doing so I ask honourable members to believe that there is nothing in my remarksof a personal nature It has been said by interjection that economy js all right so long as it does not affect one's self. I find here the Country party, and, indeed, honourable members in all parts of the chamber, talking economy; but it is an economy that suits their own pockets, and is not of a general character. I venture to say that if the Country party could get £ 1 per bushel for their wheat, they would grab it . However, I believe those honourable members in the corner are a good party, and are going to be of some advantage in this Parliament. The party, no doubt, has created a good deal of annoyance to the National Government at the outset of the session, but 1 believe they will help to a very great extent in keeping the Government intact. However,we of the National party are I did not intend that. not in any way dependent on them for support in the way of votes. A Government that calls itself a National Government should be prepared to stand firm, determined not to give way on this or that question, at any rate on any question that vitally affects the people. I take it that on any measure of vital importance the Government will consult this House before proceeding. It is a pity that the War GratuityB ill has been delayed, and apparently it will be delayed u n t i l this evening if honourable members will not stop talking on the Address-in-Reply. Several honourable members interjecting, I have had ""a show,"" and, apparently,' there is a desire to shut me up. However, we may feel sure that the Government will introduce the War GratuityB ill , and that it will prove satisfactory to our soldiers and sailors. We must remember, also, that munition workers deserve some consideration, though I am not prepared at this stage to say what we are prepared to do. I know of one munition worker, who,leaving his wife and family behind, went to the other side of the world, and returned with the sight of both his eyes gone. In my opinion, that man, when he lost his sight, was working in the interests of the country, whether he was on the battle-field or in tbe factory. dangerous zone than many men. on the field of battle itself; and any one who will say that such, a man does not deserve great consideration for services rendered, ought to get out of the country.

93,Mr Francis,"This is the first timeworthy of criticism by this Parliament and the public generally, if a member of the firm of architects which has been engaged for this work is a son of a prominent official of tlie Commonwealth Bank. It has been so stated in the House, and it is a matter that requires looking into. This firm is conducting the business in its own way, and even a member of Parliament, when he seeks an interview regarding the work, is coolly told that it has nothing to do with him-that the Kirkpatrick firm controls the matter. However, I am not very easily shaken off, and I had occasion to interview a representative of the firm, whoever he may be-som e bit of a boy -in connection with a home that is urgently required for one of our "" digger "" boys. The firm, in the plans and specifications, made an error in laying down the foundations; they went too far on one side, thus leaving insufficient room for a vehicle to enter. My interview was with the connection of the Commonwealth Bank official; and he went on reading his papers, saying, "" It has nothing to do with you; we are running this business; it has nothing to do with the Commonwealth either."" coolly, indeed; and I may say that I told him what I thought of him.

If a Royal Commission is necessary, it is in connection with the administration of the War Service Homes Branch. Before we spend hundreds of thousands of pounds belonging to my constituents, and the constituents of other members, immediate and dennite inquiries should be made. It is said by those in control of the branch that houses can be built by day labour at. £200 less than they can be built by contract. That, I think, is a very farfetched statement; in the near future honourable members will get the shock of their lives when the accounts come in for the erection of the war service homes. We hear of a six-roomed brick house for £700 on land bought, in some cases, at £3 per foot. In other cases, land is bought at 35s. a foot, when the price that should be paid"" is £2 10s. In my constituency some land has been acquired by the Department for soldiers' homes.

The cost of the building of the war service homes should be equally distributed over the whole of the people, and not borne by a few.

It is impossible for £700 to secure jects, and there is no suggestion of reland and build a brick house fit for a "" digger "" to live in. The question of the Federal Capital has been raised. It was said by the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Kerby), in his speech on the Address-in-ReplyandI desire to congratulate both that gentleman and the seconder of the motion on their maiden speeches-that the Government should not entertain any proposition for the spending of millions of money at Canberra. This matter affects honourable members from other States very considerably. It may be said that the objection of Yictorian honourable members to expenditure on the Federal Capital is due to a disinclination to travel to and from Canberra. That is not my reason for urging that the Government should not at present proceed with the expenditure of 'millions of money upon a bush capital. It is quite on the cards that Canberra will eventually become the Federal Seat of Government, but we must have regard to the circumstances in which we find ourselves to-day. We have had to send the Treasurer to the Old Countryi n order to make arrangements to meet the financial obligations of the Commonwealth, and why should we involve ourselves in an, expenditure of £3,000,000, or £4,000,000, in order to keep a compact made in the -Constitution? That compact has remained in abeyance so long that it can surely be deferred for a few more years. Possibly, after we have dealt with the problems that have resulted from the war, Victorian members will agree that the creation of the Federal Capital is necessary. When this compact was made there was no idea of war intervening, but -conditions have changed during the past five years, and all our energies are now required in order to cope with the aftermath of a great war. We have big pro""blems to face. repudiation ? -of facing anything by repudiation. I shall always stand up to my obligations, . but I cannot see that a further postponement of the Federal Capital scheme will amount to a repudiation of any -debt or compact. Because of the war we have had to postpone many propudiation in deferring the expenditure on the Federal Capital for the time being. Much has been said regarding profiteering. I , like most other honourable members, am pledged to do what is possible to reduce the high cost of living. During the recent election I urged the people to vote in favour of the referenda for the alteration of the Constitution, and I was glad to know that, in my constituency, there was an affirmative vote. That fact reveals the very high class of people whom I represent in this Parliament. stituency gave a majority in favour of the referenda. was so. The honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb), when speaking on the subject of profiteering, said that, in his own business as a greengrocer, he had to purchase potatoes at £15 per ton because he was informed that the price would increase to £24. I am sure that, although the honourable member sits in opposition, if he could buy potatoes at £15 per ton, with the knowledge that the price was likely to increase, he would hold them and sell at £24. During my election campaign I was not assisted in any way by the profiteer. I had to fight my own battles. I was opposing a Government candidate, and I had not the support of the National Federation, or other Nationalist bodies, or the profiteer. orable member associates the two. way, associate the Nationalists with the profiteer. In my opinion, a Nationalist is one who does all he can for the benefit of the nation. In answer to a question to-day the Prime Minister stated that the Government were unable to introduce legislation to prohibit profiteering, because the people had recently refused them the necessary powers. As a layman, I may not understand much about constitutional matters, but I claim to have a certain amount of common sense, and I believe that if this Commonwealth Parliament is supreme it undoubtedly has some power of checking the profiteering that is taking place. liament is not supreme.",34,Kerby

It is all very well for the people who are in receiptof large incomes to say that it is not necessary to interfere with the profiteer or that profiteering does not take place. bourne (Dr. Maloney) has informed the House of the profiteering that takes place in the tweed industry. consumer being able to purchase the material from the manufacturer, he has to purchase it through a merchant, who increases the price by nearly 100 per cent. That evil is so simple and obvious that an ordinary municipal council, let alonethe National Parliament, could deal w i th it . I shall not be satisfied u n t i l something is done to check profiteering, in regard to which I shall have something more to say at a later date. Although the hands of the Government are tied to a great extent, they must do something to afford relief to the people. If time permitted one to mention the increase that has taken placb in the ordinary essential household commodities, one could emphasize more strongly the present burden of the high cost of living. In regard to the Tariff, I am pledged to my electors to vote for the assistance and establishment of local industries. That policy is essential to the well-being of the Australian people. prised during a recent study of the statistics of imports and exports to find that local industries are not being fostered as they should be. I agree with the honourable member who said that the export of raw hides is disastrous to this country. I know that the Government are pledged to bring down a Tariff that will be helpf u l to local industries. Of course, there may be a danger in a high Tariff. may happen that the Tariff remedy wil l prove worse than the malady, but we must take the risk. We must raise a protective wall about our industries, and if those who benefit do not supply the people They are required, with their requirements at f a i r and reasonable prices the Government will be obliged to take other measures. I listened with interest to the discusSir John Quick, who is supsion that took place with regard to the new sugar agreement. I hold the opinion that on any conference convened to fix the price of any commodity the consumers should have representation, apart from the Commonwealth Government. It has been said that the salvation of Australia lies in building up an export trade, and' not in pursuing a policy of importing from other parts of the world. I have interested myself slightly in the papermaking industry, in which hundreds of thousands of pounds are now being spent The honourable member for Melin order toincrease tbe output of the mills. In this connection it is regrettable that the Victorian Government recently Instead of the saw f it to send to America for supplies of paper, ignoring, and, as it were, stagnating, the local industry for the sake of saving a few pounds. Possibly the Government did save a littl e money, but, no matter what saving was effected, I am always ready to vote for the establishment of local industries, even if the price of their output should exceed the. cost of the imported article. It is the only way in which we can eventually produce commodities at prices below those at which we can 'purchase from the outside world. We have heard it said that when we sent away our wool and wheat we secured a return far below the prices which other nations secured, but if we were ready to sell our produce at such ridiculously low rates we cannot blame the British Government, as some persons are disposed to do. Great credit is due to the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) for the magnificent work he did during the war, frequently faced, as he was, with great difficulties. We should be pleased that we I was Surhavo him among us to-day. Certainly mistakes were made, but we ought not to worry over what is past.

The trade mark "" Madei n Australia,"" referred to by the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson), will do for me, as it should do for other honourable members. Another matter that the Country party should take in hand is the development of the fruit-canning industry. I am not in the Farmers party, but I have many farmers in my constituency and many fruit-growers. A t present half of the Australian f r u it crop is grown for the benefit of the middleman, or merchant, or for the payment of railway freight, and it would be a most excellent step to establish and encourage the canning industry in various country districts. I hoipe that the' men who will be appointed to take control of the islands over which Australia has a mandate will be experienced men. We read of persons being sent to fill such positions who do not understand' the local conditions, and are inconsiderate of the inhabitants' of the islands under their care. We should see that men of the very best character, and' kindly men, are appointed to take charge of territory which undoubtedly, if managed correctly, will become a valuable asset to the Commonwealth. I am glad to note that tlie cotton industry is to receive the immediate attention of the Government. This is essential, because we are obliged to pay profiteering prices for cotton. Possibly the dividends of the cotton manufacturing -companies are not very large, merely a few million pounds per half-year; but in any case cotton growing should, be encouraged in Australia. I thank honourable members for their -close attention to my remarks. I can assure them that so long as I remain a member of the HouseI shall endeavour to carry out my obligations to the people who sent me here, the only persons to whom I am responsible for my conduct in the House. I am prepared to go before my electors at any time the Government choose, and I shall not be bludgeoned into giving my vote in any particular way by the threat of an election. A t the same time, I think it would be a great pity to have the Commonwealth Parliament everlastingly appealing to the people at the cost on each occasion of hundreds of thousands of pounds. We should strive to regard the business of the country as a national concern and to avoid the great expense of too frequent elections. It is undoubtedly our duty to do what the people have sent us here to do, and that is to administer the affairs of the country for the good of the community generally. The compliments paid by the honourable member for Henty( Mr Francis) to the Country party do not seem to have been too well received in the corner. For my part the Country party should be welcomed. It s appearance is certainly not premature; and I echo the hope expressed elsewhere that its members w ill use their influence to -restore the responsibility of Ministers to the House, and also to restore constitutional government in this country. By joining with the Opposition, I hope they will endeavour to insure that no undertaking committing the country to a large expenditure is entered into without being previously submitted to Parliament for ratification. I understand that the Country party has come here mainly for the purpose of enforcing economical administration. For that reason also I welcome its advent. But I think it has made an inauspicious start. It had a fine opportunity of enforcing the theory of economy at the very beginning of this Parliament, when it was announced that the Treasurer ( Mr Watt) was to pay a health trip to the Old World. Fori t is only pretence to contend that it is a visit on public business. A remarkable coincidence in regard to that t r ip was the unanimous approval given to it by the principal newspapers in ' Melbourne and Sydney. This unusual unanimity suggests a pre-concerted arrangement. It had been arranged for and canvassed, as was formerly the practice in Victoria before the Commonwealth Parliament came into existence, such visits havin"" first to be approved of by the gentlemen who dictated the policy of the country from their editorial sanctums. The singular unanimity of the press approval of the visit of the Treasurer to the Old World raises the suspicion in the ordinary mind that objection which would have been raised in the natural course of events had previously been removed by some private agency. One reason why I object to this visit is that we already have in London a gentleman of very high qualifications for tih*",36,Kerby

Money has to be found for the war gratuity and for repatriation purposes, and this financial genius ought to be here in this Housei n order to give honourable members the benefit of his experience and reputedly valuable advice. Another opportunity of enforcing economy which the Country party has lost is in regard to the recent appointment of an Administrator for the late German Possessions. An y one who has given thought to the matter is aware that these Possessions could be administered quite well by Judge Murray, the A d ministrator of Papua, a man of high character and ability. familiar with the conditions of these territories, their wants, and their development, and is quite capable of undertaking the extra duties of administering these islands without any additional cost to the Commonwealth. The Administrator appointed at Rabaul w ill be surrounded with' secretaries and other officials, thus adding to the costly administration expenses of the Department. I observe, by the way, that objection to Judge Murray's administration of Papua has been raised by some of the people of Port Moresby. I hope the Government will pay no attention to the resolution reported to have been carried by an alleged majoritv at a mass meeting there. trator of Rabaul has been appointed only a certain period.

The interests of the producers had effective advocates in this Parliament long.before they appeared here, or even thought of entering politics.

A reference to the debates on the first Federal Tariff and the divisions on the various items in that Tariff w ill show that there were in this House men who could "" cut ice,"" and who did look well after the primary producers of Australia. Another failure on the part of the Country party makes me suspicious that they are not genuinely in favour of economic reform. Only last week, when the SupplyB ill was before us, the question of the pay of the Commonwealth Police was raised. If ever there was an administrative scandalI would almost speak of it as an outrage-it was the creation of that force in Australia. There was no occasion for it . It was merely a salve to the wounded vanity of the Prime Minister. Some one threw an egg at him, and from that egg there emerged a force of policemen which costs this country some £8,000 per annum. If the Country party were out for real economy, it would have assisted us to wipe out that item. It would at least have voted for a substantial reduction. so, I am inclined to impeach its sincerity, and to say that it is only a bogus party. Hadi t meant business, it would have been with us in resisting that vote. I do not intend to deal at length with the record of the present Government. There is so much to be said in their condemnation that it would transcend the opportunities given to honourable members. I shall therefore leave them to be dealt with by the people, as I think they will be eventually, for the disgraceful manner in which they obtained office. The people, deceived by their campaign in press and on the platform, w ill indubitably deal with them for the malicious lies, fabrications, and foul passions which their base sectarian appeals aroused iu the community. I should like now to refer to the sugar question. There were some peculiar omissions from the speech made yesterday by the Prime Ministeri n dealing with the subject. I would recommend the Country party, and new members generally, to look up the history of the sugar question in the records of this ParThe balance was against them. liament, before they agree to any in the honourable crease in the price of sugar to the Queensland sugar-growers. I may offend some of my Queensland friends in speaking in this way, but I have taken a keen interest in the question since it first came' before the Federal Parliament,and I feel constrained to draw attention to certain matters relating to it which ought to be considered before the agreement is ratified. I agree w i th the Prime Minister that the sugar industry in Australia is in a peculiar position, since it is essentially the only industry here which is carried on with white labour in competition with black labour employed in the industry elsewhere. The original intention of this Parliament in granting bonuses to the sugar-growers was to effect a transition from black to white labour. For that purpose various devices were employed. This Parliament, in a very generous mood, gave to the sugar-growers of Queensland a Tariff advantage of about £ 5 per ton, which covered the larger part of the period from 1902 to the present daycise. Trade Minister telling the House that the Sincei t did not do bonus was paid out of the Excise. But who paid it? It came out of the Treasury., and undoubtedly Excise was collected on the sugar. But for every £ 4 collected by the manipulation of Excise and Customs duties the sugar-growers received £ 5 . about? Tariff on imported sugar was £ 6 per ton, and the Excise duty was £ 4 per ton.

I may refer the House to some statistics obtained from the Commonwealth Year-Book. Honourable members who have just entered the House and are not familiar w it h the subject may bo advised to study the position as set out in V o l . VI . of that publication by Mr Knibbs. When dilating upon the increased charges to be borne by the growers and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the Prime Minister did not tell the House that the sugar-growers had already received enormous benefits from the rest of the people of the Commonwealth. what they have given to the people of the Commonwealth. complaint of the sugar-growers to-day is that, they are not receiving for their sugar the world's parity. They want the people of Australia to give what the famishing people of Europe are paying for their sugar. when they ask for the world's parity ? Is, per lb. They are not asking for that. any producer receiving the world's parity if he does not at any time impose extra prices on the Australian consumer. What have these growers done? W h a t was the price of sugar before the Federal Parliament came into existence? the honourable member for Perth( Mr manufacturers have paid to the sugarFowler) to say whether sugar was not then on sale in Perth and Fremantle at £ 1 4 per ton. like that. less. We now have a proposal to charge £30 odd per ton for it . I could understand the desire of the Queensland sugar growers to obtain from the Australian public the world's parity if they had in the past produced their commodity with out Tariff protection, without leaning upon the rest of the people of Australia. cession from. Australia for the transition from black to white labour. That, however did not satisfy them. this fact only to show the honourable member and others that the industry has leant considerably on the Commonwealth in past years. then was to enable us to carry out our obligation in respect of the White Australia policy. It was not their obligation. carry out the White Australia policy, but we paid a good deal for it unnecessarily. In any event, the honourable member's in terjection does not affect my point, which is that if the sugar-growers of Queensland claim the world's parity for sugar are asking for only about one-third of the approaching world's parity. they have leant on the rest of the We shall see. The people of the Commonwealth, that their industry has been subsidized to a substantial extent, and that, therefore, .they should not now attempt to put up the price of sugar in Australia. What has Australia paid for the protection of the sugar-growers and to encourage their industry ? of those concerned in the preserving of fruits and the making of jams. I have no objection to arrive at an exact estimate of what Australia has paid, because not merely have we given bonuses direct to the sugar growers, but we have also allowed rebates to the manufacturers of jam, condensed milk, and other commodities containing I appeal to about 50 per cent, of sugar. These growers increased prices for the sugar which they have used, but' when they have exported their manufactures the Government has given them a rebate of 50 per cent, of the duty on the sugar conI t was perhaps even tents. New South Wales has participated in the bonuses to sugar-growers, though not to a great extent. Accc-rding to Enibbs. the total quantity of sugar produced in 1901 was 112,492 tons. Strangely enough, he omits the figures for tbe period between 1901 and 1905, and also those for the period between 1906 and 1910. If we take into consideration only the period between 1910 and 1918 we find that the production of sugar in those years totalled 1,422,042 tons.

159,Mr Bell (Darwin) [ 5 . 1 1 ],"I amthere was ever a strike because the worker was too comfortable or had too much. I interjected rather often, and my action brought from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) the retort, "" The honourable member knows absolutely nothingabout the conditions of workers in Australia."" PerhapsI do not know as much as does the honourable gentleman about the conditions of workers in the cities. AlthoughI have wandered about the cities a good deal in idle moments, have worked in cities, and have seen something of the conditions that exist there, I do not put my judgment against that of the Leader of the Opposition with regard to the liberty, comforts,. and privileges which city workers enjoy, or can reasonably expect to enjoy. when the honourable gentleman asserts that I know absolutely nothing about the conditions of the workers in Australia. I do say that I know a good deal about some classes of workers in Australia. I know something of the conditions of those whom I consider to be true workers, such as those who work down in the mines, and out in the forests and fields in the country districts of Australia. I know that many of these men do not enjoy any of the privileges and comforts that many of the strikers enjoyed before they .struck. The workers to whom I refer cannot afford to strike, and so I say it very often happens that those who enjoy the best conditions are those who strike. Will any honourable member say that the marine engineers responsible for the last strike did not enjoy more comforts and life than did some of those who suffered, and suffered very severely, because course to direct action? of the Opposition is now present, I mayinform him, perhaps a little belatedly -becaus e I had no previous opportunity; T am now answering what he said when T interjected-that very often those who enjoy the best conditions are those who strike, whilst those' who enjoy the worse conditions are not able to do so. 'The honourable gentleman then said that I knew absolutely nothing about the conditions of the workers in Australia. -do not remember either the interjection or the reply referred to. MT. BELL I remember both, and that is why I am alluding to the matter. the workers to know that their conditions are absolutely awful. able gentleman, and I am going to allude to the awful conditions of some of the workers with whom I am familiar. I do not wish all honourable members to laugh at the same time when Tasmania is mentioned, but I may be allowed to say that in that State there were thousands of real workers in the electorate I have the honour to represent who.were practically made ruined men because of the strike. They are not men who ever earned £5 per week or enjoyed the comBut forts and privileges which the marine engineers and certain! city workers enjoyed. Of course, the marine engineers did not want to punish these people, but the effect of their action was that men who had toiled on the land through many bad seasons, men who had not received good prices for their products, and had frequently failed to raise good crops-wha t with Irish blight in their potatoes and occasional visitations of drought-and who were now looking forward to a good season in order to make up some of their losses, were confronted with a disastrous strike. They could not shift their produce; they could not sell it. I know of scores of these unfortunate producers who have been ruined. There are few land workers to-day who can afford to go on strike. As a rule, what with their heavy expenses in these times, they have not more of . the privileges of much, if any, money put by to carry them through weeks of idleness. That applies to the working people of Tasthe engineers had remania in all parts, and particularly to As the Leader our miners-the tributers and prospectors on our West Coast. They live from hand to mouth, week by week, and just manage to keep plodding along. When we consider the question of industrial unrest, and the means by which every worker, as well as each employer, shall have justice, the plight of the people of Tasmania should not be lost sight of. -In the view of many so-called Democrats majority rule is democracy.

162,Mr Bell,"I agree with the honorindustrial disputes, and the 'amendment of our arbitration laws, come before the _ Commonwealth legislature. Mention has been made, during the debate, of the proposed convention to consider the amendment of the Constitution. It has been remarked also that the only effective means of bringing about national economy will be by doing away with our numerous State Houses. Six State legislatures and a Commonwealth Parliament have been said to be too many for Australia's requirements. On the surface, that appears to be the case; but we have to consider what would be the effect of their reduction. I listened with pleasure on ""Wednesday to the speech of the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), wherein he dealt so ably with the proposed convention. With his remarks in regard to decentralization I am in f u l l agreement. I assure those honourable members who hold that the only way ,to effect real economy is to do away with the State Governments^-that the people of Tasmania will not vote for the extension of the powers of the Commonwealth. During the election campaign I was often asked what I thought of the Constitution Referenda. Upon all occasions I replied that Tasmanians should consider the matter very seriously before they voted to grant increased powers to the Federal Parliament. Tasmanians know only too well that in the past they have been outvoted by the larger States. They have not participated in the benefits accruing ' to other States by a huge expenditure of public money therein. Under the present interpretation of democracy the small community in Australia does not get a fair deal. Can it be wondered at that a large section of the people of Tasdiers, and I am pleased to know that it mania should advocate cutting the painter? They know what has been the effect of Federation upon Tasmania. They are aware that, during the recent maritime disputes, and in other directions, serious attention has not been given by the Commonwealth Government and Parliament to Tasmania's just claims. The reason for that is that Tasmania is a small State, and its influence in this House has not been, and never can be, great. It is only natural Mr Bell. that Tasmania should seek to secure some of the benefits which have been 'freely given to mainland States. £75,000 from the Commonwealth this year. member is oue of those, I think, who assisted in granting that small measure of justice. After all, the grant was no more than her due. It is but an offset against that which was really a serious leakage in the Customs. If the goods brought into Tasmania had been imported direct, instead of having to pass through the Customs Houses of Sydney and Melbourne, Tasmania would have gained the varying annual amount from the beginning. The total sum involved in the grant is not on a par with the enormous expenditure which has been incurred upon such a project as the EastWest railway, linking up Western Australia with the Eastern States. It canto bring about Unification-is not be compared with the amount of money that will have to be spent if the Federal Capital is to be reared within the boundaries of New South Wales. Mention of the Federal Capital reminds me that that project was alluded to in the Governor General's Speech, and has been, freely discussed during the debate. His Excellency referred to the appointment of a Commission. It'appears that an investigation is to be undertaken concerning what use shall be made of the Federal Territory. Underlying the proposed appointment of a Royal Commission, one fact is obvious, namely, that activities in the matter of constructing the Federal Capital are bound to be postponed for a few years longer. A great portion of the Territory is suitable for the settlement of returned solis proposed to set aside land for this purpose. I understand it is not the policy of the Government or the wish of the people to ""art with the freehold in any part of the Federal Capital territory, and I take it that if land is settled by returned sioldiers it will be under a ninety-nine years' lease. By the time tlie leases will have expired the future of the Federal territory might very well come up for consideration, and by that time, let us hope, Melbourne and Sydney will have outgrown some of their childish",43,Kerby

164,Mr Bell,"Yes; and the honorablejealousies, aud the subject may then be considered from an Australian standpoint. Touching upon the war. gratuity, I may say that we are all anxious to have the B ill before us, and I am quite sure, from the assurances that have been received from members of all three parties, that every facility will be given to expedite the passage of the measure. all interested in seeing that returned soldiers are well treated, and it will be our purpose to give the very best advice possible to the Government so that the B ill , in its final form, may be fair and just to all returned soldiers and their dependantsI may add, in passing, that I am not in agreement with the remark made by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) last alight when he said |that he did not approve of the gratuity being paid in cash. I always said that if the financial position of Australia would permit I would favour a cash payment. Returned soldiers as a body are as much interested in the welfare of the Commonwealth as any other section of the community, and as a class they are prepared to take into consideration the financial state of the Commonwealth and the difficulty of raising sufficient money to pay the gratuity in cash. hear some honourable members and others say that they do not approve of cash payments because a number of men would not know how to spend the money wiselv, I feel that they have an altogether wrong impression of the character of our returned soldiers. are a few who' waste their money, but they are in the minority, and, I think, are to be seen mainly in the streets of our principal cities. I believe, therefore, that those who think returned soldiers are unable to spend wisely and well the amount of war gratuity to be paid to them have an altogether false conception of the real character of our soldiers, because, no doubt, they have not come in touch with those of our returned men who have really gone out to take up the work of civil l if e again. Coming now to the subject of the Tariff, I want to say that I am perfectly willin g to support a Tariff that w ill give f a i r protection and encouragement to Australian industries. I do not want to labour this question, because it has been f u l l y debated already, and no doubt when the new Tariff is before the House there w ill be ample opportunity for detailed discussion. I think, however, that if we give any industry the benefit of a high protective Tariff we should insure that the consumers' interests are adequately safeguarded and that provision is made for sale direct from the manufacturer to the retailer. I shall give no support to We are a protective Tariff that does not insure the manufacturer selling to the consumer at a f a i r and reasonable price. There should be no sole agencies and no long line of middlemen gaining benefits from a protective Tariff at the expense of the consumer. The question of improved postal f a c i l ities *is one that very largely affects my electorate, which, in the main, is a country district. The Government have agreed During the election campaign that the outlying portions of Australia have uot had liberal treatment in this respect in the past. Better facilities are now promised, and I believe the House is going to demand them. I will be as patient as I can with the Postmaster General( Mr Wise), as I am convinced he has a great deal of work ahead of h i m in remodelling and perfecting the new policy of the Administration. But we want to hurry along. It is little satisfacWhenI tion to some people-and I know quite a number of them-wh o have been waiting for years to get telephone or mail services, to be told that the Postmaster General has a lot of work to do. This question of telephones and cables affects We regret that there Tasmania very seriously. A t present press messages are much delayed in transit. During the past week we had an example of this difficulty, a press message occupying six hours in transit from Melbourne to Launceston, because the cable was so overloaded. There may be other reasons for the delay. It is said by some honourable members that the Postal Department is overmanned, and requires a complete overhaul ; and it is often the case, where, too many men are employed, that the work is not clone so expeditiously as it would otherwise be; but I am not in a position to say whether in the Postal Department the faul t lies with the staff. A t present, the facilities for sending cable messages from the mainland to Tasmania are not sufficient; and this, of course, is a great drawback to all concerned. If we are to develop Australia-and it is by this means alone that we can reduce the cost of living,' and be prepared to meet our great indebtedness-w e must realize that facility of communication is one of the chief factors. In the matter of the cables I am not speaking without knowledge, because I have the advantage of going into an office in Tasmania and seeing the business transacted. When cable messages reach Launceston, they are despatched from there to their destination, and, in the case of one message which came under my observation, -it took some six and a half hours Jo go from Launceston to Burnie. Would any of the larger cities of Australia tolerate without protest such a condition of affairs? It must be remembered that this has gone on for some six or ten years in Tasmania, and I feel convinced that not one of the leading newspapers on the mainland would accept the conditions without such a protest as would quickly result in a remedy. I congratulate the Government on their decision to divest themselves of Pools and controls, leaving the primary producer, by means of co-operation, to handle his product and place it on the market to the best advantage. No matter how well goods may be handled by a Government Department, satisfaction cannot result; and the Government are wise to throw the onus on those most concerned. We are told that the Government intend to encourage co-operation in every possible way, and that announcement is gratifying to those of us who are primary producers. Of course, there are great difficulties in the way of reaching the consumer directly. It appears to be the opinion of the average citizen that it is the duty of the producer to take his produce to the consumer's door, and sell it at the cheapest possible Tate. I wish to see consumers-and by that I mean all who are not primary producers-re ceive the necessaries of life as cheaply as may be, and to-day that is the great aim of the representatives of every party in Australia. My trouble, however, is that the primary producer is expected to accomplish all this in the absence of any co-operation from the consumer. What is required is that the two shall come together-that the consumer shall assist the producer to sell his produce in the Mr Btll. most expeditious and cheap way. If we can evolve a scheme with that result we shall have gone a long way towards getting, over the great dissatisfaction caused by the high cost of living. It is a notorious fact, however, that those who mark their goods the highest do the most trade; we can see illustrations of that fact every day in the city. For instance, an,attempt is made to give the people cheap f r u it ; and I , myself, have purchased fruit at 2s. a case, while fruit no better, if as good, was being sold at 4d. per lb. in the retail shops, and 3d. per lb. on the stalls. At the same time, we find that the shops are doing, the bulk of the trade; the average citizen will go to a retail shop rather than to a fruit barrow. A very small proportion -of the fruit consumed in Melbourne is bought from the co-operative places,, where it could be obtained at about half the price that is paid in the shops. As. I say, we require co-operation between the consumer and the producer-w e must have the consumer's assistance, or we can never have a perfect system. There are many other matters regarding which I have notes, but, as I am getting rather hoarse, suffering as I am from a cold,, and as an expression of opinion from me regarding them would possibly not assist the House, I shall not occupy time with them. I sincerely hope that members, on whichever side they sit, will give the House the benefit of their experience, so that we may deal effectively with the problems that confront us, more especially the problems of industrial unrest and profiteering. Unless honourable members on all sides, without party bias or prejudice, seriously consider these problems in the interests of the whole of the community-whethe r they represent those who work in the city, the mine,, the fqre.t or the field-we can never accomplish our task. Earlier in the debate, young members opposite reminded young members on this side of the great responsibility that lay upon them as representatives, and asked them, to deal with the questions that are to come before us, fairly and justly, without party bias. In the same spirit I ' assure those honourable members oppositethat such will be my desire and effort at all times. I have no prejudice because of any past experience in this House, but I recognise that it is very hard for older members to escape a feeling of the kind. honourable members occupying seats on the T look to the future, and 1 take second Ministerial corner benches place to no one in my desire to do what themselves the Country party, they are is best for Australia, and make her the merely tbe l e f t wing of the Nationalist great nation she is designed to be if we party.

The Central Wool Committee has been the salvation of the pastoral industry in Australia. There is no doubt about that. Where would this great industry have been had it not been for the Imperial Government coming to our rescue and offering us a flat rate of 15£d. per lb. for our wool, and, at the same time, providing ships to transport it away? We had no more hope of shipping our wool clip during the waT period than we had of sending it to Great Britain by aeroplane. If the man who is selling the product is prepared to allow the Mother Country to act as an intermediary, why should others complain ? I have discussed this matter with pastoralists in Western Queensland, and I have not heard one complaint concerning Great Britain taking 50 per cent, of the excess profits. Their only concern is when they are to receive their share of the additional profit. MT .

It is mean, and contemptible in the extreme for persons to complain of the action of the Imperial Government and to say that the pastoralists of Australia are being penalized. Consider the hundreds of millions that the Old Country has spent in connection with the war. Had GreatB r it a in not entered the conflict, we would not have been privileged to sit in this chamber; and surely that is worth more than the paltry £S,000,000 it is asking us to pay. Australia does not wish to avoid paying her debts. She w ill pay the Old Country all she owes, and I trust more. It is ridiculous for the narrow-minded individual to .compare Australia with Canada, as such comparisons are beneath contempt. During the war period I often thanked God that I was privileged to live under the protection of the British Flag. In the disposal of our wheat, wool, hides, tallow, and, in fact, all our produce, GreatB r i tain has acted as a mother to her son. I have felt it very keenly when I have heard honourable members belittling the Old Country, because she has not treated us unfairly , and the least we can do is to be grateful for the consideration shown.

The interval is hardly sufficient to enable them to have dinner and return here in time for business. After consultation with the Government, I have decided to conform to the wishes of the majority of honourable members, and extend the adjournment for a quarter of an hour. In future, I shall resume the chair at 8 p.m. instead of 7.45 p.m. Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 8 p.m. The following paper was presented: Sugar Industry-Beport of the Koyal Commission; together with evidence. Ordered to be printed. Bill returned from the Senate without request. Debate resumed. the small growers in Western Queensland, I tender to the Australian Wool Board and Sir John Higgins our sincere thanks for what they and he have done in regard to the wool clip of the smaller men engaged in the pastoral industry in our State. Members of this House have been members of the Wool Board, and gave their services ungrudgingly, and without fee or any hope of reward, and the thanks of the small men in the industry are due to them for their services up to the conclusion of the contract with the Imperial Government. To show what the men running the Wool Board think of the industry, the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) when making his speech yesterday emphatically stated that the Chairman of the Wool Board had said that, so far as they were concerned, they would make no contract with Messrs. F. W. Hughes and Company, of Sydney -that is, the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company-tba t they could not Tecommend the Government to take it over, and that if there was any onus in the matter it would be thrown on the Government. That showed to me that the Chairman of the Board was unselfish, and that he had no feeling of vindictiveness towards the company, because those of us who know the inside working of that .business with the company are aware of the forces that were brought to bear to bring the Australian Wool Board to heel, so that the company could play "" ducks and drakes "" with the wool for its own purposes. On the question of sugar, I wish to compliment the Prime Minister on tbe business deal he has made for the people of the Commonwealth. Australia, notwithstanding what the newspapers and certain individuals saj, is the best-off country under the sun. We are the best and cheapest fed, and the best clothed and best-off people on God's earth. Everything in connection with living and clothing is cheaper by in some cases 100 per cent, than it is in other countries, particularly in Great Britain. When we realize that fact, and the social unrest that exists in other countries, we ought to congratulate ourselves on being Australians and living in Australia. I consider that what the Prime Minister has done in regard to sugar is superhuman. I never expected that we would get the deal we have got. I see that the Sugar Commission's report recommends a price",50,Granville Ryrie T H E Y Did Not Be One Of The First To Be Sent For I Have

213,Mr James Page,"On behalf ofof £22 a ton. Honourable members know what the position would be if we offered £22 per ton for sugar to-day. The Prime Minister, at the price of £30 6s. 8d., has made a good deai for the Commonwealth. No t only has he made a good deal for the consumer, but he has made it also for the sugar-grower, and for the sugarworker. Takingi t all round, we are to be congratulated on the conclusion of such an agreement. One honourable member asked us this afternoon to solve the problem of industrial unrest. magic wand whereby that could be done.

He is included under the heading, "" Colonial Sugar Refining Company,"" but that, as I say, must be a mistake. The whole of the people interested in the industry were represented at that roundtable conference. Some honourable members said that the consumer was not represented. not represent the consumers, whom do we represent? were represented, and the Prime Ministeri n his statement to the House, rightly said that sugar is a commodity which is in every household. As we represent the .people of the Commonwealth, we are here to guard the consumer, and from what I know of the temper of the House now, particularly of gentlemen in the Ministerial corner, I am satisfied that the consumer is to get a f a i r deal in the sugar business. The fact that all interests were represented at that round-table conference, and that the whole of them came to a decision, augurs well for the future > settlement of disputes in any one industry. I am a believer in voluntary arbitration. In the old days, 'when anyI only wish I had the thing went wrong in the shearing shed, we heard the men's grievances on a Saturday afternoon.

On the very day that he was going to fight three' or four of us, the owner of the station ( Mr Charles Fairbairn) arrived 'on the scene aud said, "" WhatI want is not prize-fights, but the wool off the sheep."" settled oiir differences. If voluntary arbitration was a success in those days why should it not be a success to-day ?

What would not the people in other industries be prepared to give to secure stabilized conditions for the next three years ? For these reasons I congratulate the Prime Minister on the agreement that he has arranged. This afternoon another representative of Tasmania, the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell), gave us a dose of the hysic supplied to us last week by the onorable member for Wilmot ( Mr season. Other States, however, have also Atkinson). He assured us that there was a movement on the part of Tasmania to break away from the Federation, and he proceeded to set out that Tasmania, as the 2-esult of Federation, had suffered enormous losses. We have heard the same tale in this House from the inception of the Parliament. true. can only say that some years ago several representatives of Tasmaniai n this House represented that 'that State was on the verge of insolvency, and that unless the Federation came to her rescue something Employers and emserious would happen. The Federal Parliament in the most magnanimous way responded to this appeal. It said, in effect, to Tasmania, "" We believe that, as the result of Federation, Tasmania has lost a lot of her trade to Victoria, I know nothing and New South Wales, and we are, therefore, prepared to help you w i th a straight out grant of £900,000."" I ' am beginning to think that the representatives of Tasmania are out for another £1,000,000. Let Tasmania, if it likes, cut the painter for three years, and let us, if she does so, put an export duty of £30 per head on all tourists leaving Australia for that State. What would poorlittle Tasmania do in that event? I am satisfied that, separated ,from the mainland States, she could not exist for fiveI n ten minutes we had minutes. W h y should the people of Tasmania wish to kick away the ladder by which they have risen?

I can well understand the representatives of that State speaking as they have done, since, by reason of its isolation, it suffered severely during the shipping strike. It was unfortunate that that strike should have taken place in the middle of the Tasmanian applesuffered. No t only have many Queensland industries been forced to close down,, -but many people in that State have had to go to bed hungry because of the shipping strike. Sincei t was possible to build a railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, why should we not build a bridge from Point Lonsdale to K in g Island, and thence to Tasmania?

225,Mr James Page,"Ho w ? Bygoes in for separation and afterwards re-: turns to the fold, it will'come back, not as a State, but merely as a suburb of Melbourne. My advice to the honourable member for Bass is to tell the separationists of Tasmania that they had better drop their grievances. Union is all ""bunkum,""because the Federal tie is indissoluble, and there is no possibility of any State getting out of the Federation. Tasmania may as well accept the inevitable, peacefully and contentedly. I am glad that the Government is to introduce a Bill to amend the Repatriation Act. There are many anomalies and manv grievances that need remedying, but I plead now for better treatment for those returned men who are down and out. The normal man can always get somebody to look after him, but the down-and-out man is "" nobody's dog."" Every one despises him, and no one wants him. Yet we must not forget that he went from these shores a good man, and that he fought to make it right for the rest of us. Had it not been for him, and the likes of him, the debates of this Parliament might now be carried on in a foreign tongue. At the present time the only place for the habitual drunkard is the gaol. My God, Mr Speaker, is that the best place that we can find for returned men? Is that the only treatment we can give the man who has succumbed through sheer weakness? All men are not equally strong. I thank God every night when I go to bed that I am a teetotaller, because I see what drink is doing for so many. I wish to get something done for the returned soldiers who have become the victims of drink. Let us establish an asylum of some sort to which they can be sent, and where means can be taken to restore them to decent citizenship. Recently in Brisbane a returned soldier who had won the military medal was convicted for habitual drunkenness. And what did they do with him? They sent him to the Island, in Moreton Bay, and there he committed suicide. That is all they could do for him! If we cannot do something for our incapables, we should at least let others try to assist them. There are persons in Queensland-many of them are womenwho are able and willing to take these men in hand. When the honourable member for Henty( Mr Francis) spoke today about passing a vote of thanks to our Mr James Page. women for what they did during the war, I felt that the war produced even more heroines than heroes in Australia, and for these we cannot say too much. They were not flag-waggers, or band-players, or singers of God save the King merely; This talk of leaving the they went out and did things. There are men aud women in Brisbane who are willing to assist the incapable returned soldier, without any cost to the Goverument; but under the existing law they cannot do anything for him. When the Repatriation Bill is introduced, I shall try to put into it a provision which will enable us to take advantage of their goodness and capacity. Another matter that is dear to my heart is the provision of telephonic and mail communication in Western Queensland. Whether in Parliament or out of Parliament, I shall always champion the cause of the people out there, because no one knows better than I do the disabilities under which they live. Let me read a letter which I have received from Mrs. Laura Duncan, of Mooraberri Station. Honourable members will, know her name, because of a case that was taken, recently by the Queensland Government to the Privy Council. squatter "" ? brave woman, and a good one, too.

It will be my desire, as long as I have a voice and a vote in this Parliament, to do the best I can for these people in the far outside districts. I hope that the new Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) will do what he can to assist these people.

I remind honourable members of a statement made by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) the other day when replying to some remarks of a member of the Country party on the subject of country telephones. He said that, so far as he was concerned-and I know he meant it-h e would give £500,000 for telephones, if only by doing so he could induce people to leave the towns and go out into the country. I feel that we have a good chance now of the expenditure of money for improving the postal and telephonic facilities in country districts. I hope thatother honourable members will join me in contending that people should not be penalized for living in the country, and that, on the contrary, they should be given every facility that can possibly be afforded to them. We want no favours, but only justice, for the residents of outside districts. Those who live in the country want only some of the facilities that are by those who live in town.

234,Mr James Page,"I did not get residents of the city, but we should beI desire to express my gratitude to my honourable friend, the member for Maranoa( Mr James Page), for two reasons. One is that he has again pressed forward in most forcible terms, and with a wealth of illustration, the claims of the people who live in the country for better postal and telephone facilities than they now enjoy. If I say a woa'd on this subject it is not because I have any doubt whatever that the present Government and the new Postmaster General( Mr Wise) are likely to be deaf to the appeal of those who live in the country, but I feel that, however amiably disposed to the claims of those who live in the far-back districts the Government may be, the matter touched upon by the honourable member for Maranoa is one which cannot too often or too strongly be pressed upon their notice. From personal knowledge I can endorse practically all that the honourable member for Maranoa has said of the far-distant places to which he has referred. There is another place whose claims I believe he has in hand at the present moment. Although some of these people in the outside districts write to me for assistance, I remind enough-and say, ' ' I consider your adthem that they have a very good member in the honourable member for Maranoa. The people at Mt. Howitt Station are complaining of the lack of a mail service. What often happens in these outside places is that they may get a mail service, I have not felt that it was my duty to and three or four months later, for one reason or another, the mail contractor is unable to carry on, and the mail ceases, and there is a gap of four months or six months when these places have no mail at all. At Mt. Howitt the people are faced with the difficulty of themselves sending for their mails 90 miles to one place or 75 miles to another. That has been going on. now for several months, and is likely to coutinue for some months longer. The trouble is that in the past there does not appear to .have been any one in the Department able to realize what the conditions in the back country are, and an attempt has been made to apply to the far-distant places principles that are applicable only to such centres of population as are the suburbs of Melbourne. I wish also to express my gratitude to the honourable member for Maranoa for what he said on behalf of the Central Wool Committee and' the action of the British Government in the matter of the purchase of the Australian wool clip. Honourable members can well understand that it has been rather painful to me to sit here during the last fortnight or three weeks and listen to the harsh reflections and adverse criticism of the action of the Central Wool Gommittee in connection with the sale to the I mperial Government of our last three clips of wool. I have understood, but I am afraid many honourable members do not realize, that the people who have been loudest in making these complaints are not wool-growers, and do not represent wool-growers. Some honourable members who have complained may have managed to enter this House as the representatives of constituencies which contain some wool growers, but I do not hesitate to say that they do not represent the wool-growers in those constituencies. My experience in this matter has been exactly the same as that of the honourable member for Maranoa, and I have not found one wool grower during the last four years come to me-and I am certainly accessible ministration of the wool scheme has been wrong."" As I have just mentioned, I have felt very deeply these adverse criticisms, both of the British-Government and of tbe Central Wool Committee, but rise in this chamber and champion the Committee. None the less, however, I am grateful to the honourable member for Maranoa for having spoken as one interested, as a wool-grower, who understands the subject, and for having plainly indicated his approval of the activities of the Wool Committee and the Imperial authorities. I should hardily have ventured to rise at this late stage of the debate but for tbe very interesting statement of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) yesterday with regard to the settlement, or the temporary adjustment, of the dispute between the Wool Committee and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company. It is a matter of very grave importance, and one which it is only right that honourable members should thoroughly understand. I was greatly relieved, upon entering this cham-",55,Latjra Duncan
235,Mr Jowett (Grampians) [8.35],"ber yesterday afternoon, without knowledge of what had been proceeding in Sydney with respect to a settlement, to learn from the Prime Minister that an arrangement had been made by which that great industry in Botany, principally owned by MrF . W . Hughes, was to be put into active working order again. do nob propose to reflect, either favourably or adversely, upon tlie terms of the settlement which the Prime Minister, in his, wisdom, has seen fit to draw up. I know that he was actuated by the very highest intentions, and has done his best in handling a very critical situation. There is, indeed, every reason to congratulate him upon having succeeded in ' starting the industry once more. but, nevertheless, it is a fact-that the very first occasion on which I rose to adW. Hughes will sell his tops in competidress this House, about two years ago, was in order that I might endeavour to explain the position as it then stood with respect to tbe wool-tops industry. I did not take an unfriendly view of MrF . W. Hughes, or of his considerable in terests at Botany; and I emphasize that I do not now propose to say anything about the terms of settlement except to draw attention to one exceedingly important feature. The terms are, particularly as they affect the wool-grower, that between now and the 30th June the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company is to receive a quantity of wool, fixed by agreement, namely, 10,600 bales; and that this quantity is to be purchased by the company upon what are known as the appraised prices. Mr F. W . Hughes will be able to sell bis tops at the world's parity. Wool topsI need scarcely remind honourable members-ar e wool in a semi-manufactured state. tops possess rather more than tlie value or raw wool of the very best quality. It is estimated, roughly, that the class of wool which will be purchased by the company, namely, merino, is worth in the London market-and that is to say the world's markets-the e times what it will pay for it in Australia. knowledge of the class of wool which the company will use, and of its weight per bale and its value; and I estimate that the average weight per bale will be 320 lb. Let me say-and I do not desire to be taken as laying down exact figuresthat the price will be 2s. per l b . That is to say, the company will probably buy the 10,600 bales, each weighing, on the average, 320 lbs., for £ 3 2 per bale. Every bale which the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company purchases will be worth in London to-day I £96. Thus, MrF . W. Hughes is given under this agreement power to transport wool from a market where it is worth £ 32 per bale to one where its value is £96 per bale. It should be remembered that nobody in Australia can export his wool and receive £ 9 6 for it ; he must sell ib here, at £ 3 2 per bale. I repeat that this company is to be allowed to buy at £32 per bale, aud sell in the LondonI do market-in a semi-manufactured state, I admit-wher e the commodity is worth £ 96 per bale. In other words. MrF . tion with manufacturers who have to nay for their wool, not £ 3 2 , but £ 9 6 per bale. It will be readily appreciated, then, that in a world which is scrambling for manufactured wool, the Botany company will reap an advantage of nearly £64 on every bale. This is an amount which w ill go into MrF . W .

The expression used by the Prime Minister was that this 80 per cent, would be paid to the Commonwealth Government; but he did not say the Government were going to keep it, and that induced me to rise, in order to place the true position before honourable members. The amount to be paid to the Commonwealth Government, I calculate, would be £542,720, a very large sum of money indeed. And how will it beobtai ned? There need not be the slightest doubt about the quality of the wool; and it must be remembered that it will not be sold at the world's market price, but at £32 per bale, for the special purpose of top manufacturing. I do not take exception to this. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) knows that I have always stood up for this industry, and it is my desire to see a multiplication of such establishments in the Commonwealth. But I do want to know by what right, and on what grounds, the Commonwealth can hold one penny of that £542,720. it ought to go into the Pool? thank my honourable friend for anticipating what I was about to say.

I may mention that in the statement made yesterday it The difference in the was said that out of the net profit, to be assessed by an independent auditor, 80 per cent, will go to the Commonwealth Government, and 20 per cent, be retained by the company, subject to State and Federal taxation.

Unfortunately the honourable member catches me-at a time when 1 have not my papers at hand. I must, therefore, rely upon my memory. In order to enable honourable members to understand the position, it is necessary to go back to the genesis of the contract, which was made, I think, about four years ago. I was the representative of the Government at that time. I had been to England, and had had several conversations with the British Government in regard to wool. Partly as the result of those conversations, the British Governmentmade representations in the nature of an offer to the Commonwealth Government for the purchase of the entire wool clip-merin o and cross bred-of Australia. representatives of all sections of tlie industry-growers , brokers, and manufacturers-in . order to discuss the proposal of the British Government. It was clearly understood, when it was decided by this most representative conference to accept the offer, that there was to be excluded from that sale all that wool which was necessary for Australia's local needs, including the maintenance of its manufactures at their f u l l capacity. I hope before I sit down to be able to quote from the minutes of that gathering, but I am reasonably well versed in the matter, and in the meantime, make that statement with a certain amount of confidence. We never sold to the British Government the wool which was required either to be directly consumed in Australia or manufactured here for export. first -point, and it is most material because the agreement which I have laid upon the table of the House is one which has been made in respect of wool manufactured in this country, and which is to be exported in ' its manufactured state. It is said that this agreement is a good one, that it w ill settle a long standing dispute about the merits of which I offer no opinion, that it will provide employment for hundreds of men, that it will create much-needed wealth in abundance-indee d in superabundance-and that it will bring to the Commonwealth urgently required, revenue. I do not know how much revenue it will produce, but the honourable member for Grampians has .calcuUnfortunately, I was not here lated it to be £542,000. He has aflirmed that that money rightly belongs member's remarks, but I to the Wool Pool. I say that it does not. It belongs to the Commonwealth. That wool was never sold to the British Government-it was expressly excluded fro m the sale. A t the conference at which the original agreement was made, not only were wool-growers present, but manufacturers, scourers, fellmongers, and the representative of this very company, which is one of the parties to the present agreement. Vicars, of Marrickville, were represented there, as indeed were nearly all the weavers and spinners. A t that conference I said, "" Isi t clearly understood that there is excluded from this sale the wool necessary for the maintenance and encouragement of the manufactures of Australia at their f u l l capacity 1 Becausei f it is hot, now is the time to state your objection."" I shall show, I called together if necessary by laying on the table of the House the shorthand report of the proceedings, that no objection was taken""'to that condition, and that it was clearly understood, that the wool required for local manufacture was expressly excluded from the sale, including the wool'necessary for the manufacture of wool tops. The honourable member for Grampians says in effect: ' 'You have made a good agreement; you have caused the desert to blossom like a rose. Where there was nothing previously, you now have something. But that something belongs to us."" I say that the onus of proving his contention rests on the honourable member. For the past two years it has been open to him and his friends to suggest some modus vivendi whereby 400 men in this country could obtain That is my work. It has been open to' any honourable member interested in the matter to see that this great industry received some encouragement. But nothing was done. I make no criticism upon that in action.

I do not begrudge the wool-grower all that he gets, but I would remind the honourable member for Grampians of what he and every other wool-grower owe to me. The honourable member has said that he and his fellow wool-growers want this £542,000.

I do not think that is fair. I do not think that the wool growers of Australia, if they were polled to-morrow, would say that it is fair. During the past four years, and particularly during the last two years, the honourable member has uttered no protest in regard to the delay on the part of the British Government in handing to the wool-growers of Australia their half-share of the profits accruing from re-sa'es of their wool.

There was not a word of protest because the wool-grower had not received one penny by way of his half-share of the profits of the wool sold cither at the issue price or at the auction price, but so soon as the Commonwealth Government sets in operation machinery for the creation of wealth and the encouragement of a great Australian industry, a representative of the great wool-growing interests-and , mark you, though the honourable gentleman has sought to speak for all the wool-growers of Australia, although I venture to say that they would not elect him as their spokesman -make s a claim for the whole of the amount of £542,000. Speaking on behalf of the people of Australia, and as the custodian of their money and their interests, I say that that amount, if it That increase of ^d. per l b . is as great as the honourable member states I did not know that we had made so Then, good a bargain-clearl y belongs to us.

Owing to the arrangement by which wool tops were sold forward and the subsequent rise in the price of wool, there was no margin of profit, and the Government is' a loser to the extent of £200,000. or thereabouts. 'The Pool must not lose, and the Government must make good that amount of £200,000. But the honourable member for Grampians says that we may not recoup ourselves from the other amount of £542,000 ; he wants the Commonwealth to bear all the losses and to get none of the profits.

If it were an agree-' ment for one year it would be different, but it is to cover a period of three years. Recent quotations for refined sugar indicate that the price per ton in London was £77, and in the United States of America £80. I do not think any honourable member would take the responsibility-h e would rather leave it to the Government-of opposing this agreement, because it is evident on the face of it that if an agreement were not entered into there would be chaos for one year at least. , We cannot say to what figure 3ugar may go. This agreement has no relation to the war period, and it seems that a statement made at the recent Conference should be very closely examined. According to a report of that Conference it would appear that the Queensland people have not aimed at securing the world's price for their product, but have been influenced in demanding an increase principally owing to the peculiar industrial conditions obtaining in Queensland. price demanded at the Conference for raw sugar is double that ruling before the war. and if an increase were sought owing to the war conditions and world's prices we could understand it . In the first paragraph of the report of the Conference, it Xhe Prime Minister has inis statedThat the Conference assumed that a substantial increase would take place in the labour costs as the result of an impending State award. At the time the Conference was sitting no new award had been made, and honourable members probably recollect that the last The Prime Minister has award was a peculiar one, more ' particularly in relation to the conditions surrounding it. It has been generally recognised that the last award was a generous one, and related moreto,theconditions prevailing than to the wages paid. extent ? glad to know in what way it was varied. But in spite of any variation, it' was a very generous award. Assuming that an award is to be made during the first year The Queensland of the agreement, it is evident that it is likely to be a very liberal one. The wording of the paragraph in the agree-, ment pins the increase in the price of sugar solely to the altered industrial conditions in relation to the cost of production, and any award necessitating an addition of £9 6s. 8d. per ton to the price of sugar must be a pretty substantial one. We must regard this sugar agreement in the light of the Australian consumer, not only from its present aspect, but also from what it may imply in the future. Although there is a guarantee that, if the £9 6s. 8d. per ton is paid to the cane-growers in addition to the price previously paid, there will be no further industrial troubles during the first twelve months, resulting in an increased cost of production, our experience during late years shows that the conditions of some industrial agreements, no matter how binding they are supposed to be, are ignored entirely by those concerned, and in the most aggravating fashion. Not only have we a generous industrial award recognised even before it is completed, but there is an implied invitation in this agreement which makes possible a second award The during the second year of its currency. I know that it will be limited to such additions as may properly be given as a. result of an increase in the cost of living, but our experience has shown us that we cannot trust some of the States to be particularly conscientious as to the latitude",62,Latjra Duncan

""We shall have to make greater strides with the woollen industry than we have done. Madden said some years ago, our merino sheep, thanks to the efforts of the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) and others engaged' in pastoral pursuits, have been brought to such a stage of .perfection 'that the quantity of wool obtained from each of them is double that which could be secured some time ago'. I give every credit to those who have been breeding merino sheep in Australia for the improvements they have made. To-day we are getting far more wool from our merinoes and cross-bred sheep than we thought possible some few years ago. Tn the past we have been content to export our raw material instead of working it into the finished article for ourselves. If we undertook the manufacture of woollens on a large scale we should be able to sell the finished article at a lower price than is possible by sending the raw material 12,000 miles overseas to be made up for us. finished woollens are too much in the hands of the importers. We should be making more woollens than we are at present. In reply to a question put by the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley) a few days ago, the Prime Minister stated that the Commonwealth woollen mills at Geelong were turning out woollens for the use of soldiers and their dependants at 5s. 6d. per yard for the No. 1 quality, 6s. 6d. per yard for No. 2 quality, and 7s. 6d. per yard for No. 3 quality. is sufficient for a suit of clothes, so that a suit length of the best quality would thus be obtainable at a cost of £ 1 6s. 3d. The best tailors in Melbourne will provide all trimmings and make a suit for about £ 4 , so that if the people could buy their suitings direct from the Commonwealth mills they would be able to obtain, at a cost of about £ 5 8s., a suit for which they have now to pay from £ 1 0 to £ 1 2 . How can we account for the difference? I take it that the Commonwealth mills are working at a profit"". If the Government can supply woollen goods from their own mills to our returned soldiers and their dependants, what is there to prevent them from extending the business and supplying the ordinary public ? for the Government to sell direct to soldiers and their dependants? W ill the honourable gentleman say that, notwith-, standing that these men deserve the best at our hands, no one would challenge the Government's right to sell to them if they had not constitutional authority to do so? Does .the honourable member suggest that the Government have not sumcient power to withstand any such challenge? If they can withstand a challenge, they can go further, and protect the people against .profiteering, saving them hundreds of thousands of pounds. Some objection was raised to the establishment of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills by the Labour party, but now the mills stand as an in surance against profiteering, and show what can be done in the manufacture of woollens. I think that the Government should go further. As soon as they are able to supply the demand of the soldiers and their dependants, let them sell their manufactures to the general public, and My view is that let the merchants of Flinders-lane, or any other interested party, challenge their action in the Courts. Should the H i gh Courti n such a case, decide against the Government, that would be a challenge to a higher court, the people of Australia, who, finding that the Commonwealth Government could not do what was necessary to relieve them, would vote for an amendment of the Constitution to give them more power.

I may be told that the Government have already taken steps to promote the growing of cotton in Australia, but we move so slowly that it is not enough for the Government to guarantee a certain price for cotton. What is needed is a propaganda, not a mere Gazette notice of the offer of the Government.

I have before now contended that the Federal Analyst, Mr Wilkinson, has not been properly treated.

In this connection, I should like to remind honourable members that during the last three or four years the Estimates presented to this House have contained votes to defray the expenses inas high as 40s. curred by the Bureau of Science and In dustry. Tbe reason I held up the last Supply Bill for a time was that we have not yet passed a measure establishing the Bureau, though we have been expeuding money upon it every year. The Bureau should be established under proper legissoldiers, and for the immigrants we are lative action. If that course were followed we would have an opportunity to discuss whether the establishment of such an institution is worthwhile. I make bold to say that thousands of pounds have been wasted upon the Bureau because it has been doing work which, in many cases, was done in the States years before its establishment. That kind of expenditure ought to be guarded against. Honourable members object to the duplication of the Taxation Departments of the Commonwealth and the States, and they object also to the duplication of the shall readily accept and support it, and Electoral Departments, but they appear to be ready to accept the duplication of the work to be carried out by a Bureau of Science and Industry, though it involves the unnecessary expenditure of thousands of pounds. If we were to establish woollen mills, steel works, and cement works that would supply Australia's requirements, we. might give ""employment to nearly 1,000,000 more people, and to what extent would we increase the wealth of I this country by the employment of those people? If private enterprise will not supply the necessary capital to start woollen mills, we should not be satisfied with One Commonwealth Woollen Mill at Geelong, but should establish similar mills in every State. Why should we allow the' financial and manufacturing magnates to grow rich at the expense of this country when tlie Government might derive a very considerable revenue by taking in hand the manufacture of our cheaper rate than that at which they can now be obtained ? I repeat my statement that the Geelong mills are producing the best of cloth at 7s. 6d. per yard, and it pays them to do so. If I went to a wholesale house in Flinders-lane I should be charged 30s. a yard for the samrt quality of cloth. and they may go still further if they get the opportunity. Why should not honourable members on both sides demand that we should carry on these industries, and find employment for our returned going to bring here, and who, I hope, will be of a desirable class? There are many other matters with which I should like to deal, but I will, not further delay the House at the present stage, as I understand that there is a desire that some other business should be taken up. I hope that honourable members generally will not be narrow in their views.

I shall be ready to give my support to any proposal calculated to advance the best interests of the country without respect to the persons who may, for the time, occupy the Treasury bench. for the statement made by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) with regard to the wool-tops compact, and the sugar compact, it was my intention to follow the suggestion of the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Cameron), who seconded the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. The honourable member made the very useful observation that matters which may be discussed in the debate on the Address-in-Reply can be more usefully considered when the actual measures affecting them come before the House. question dealt with by the Prime Minister yesterday seems to me to make it necessary to say a few words. We have heard this evening a good deal about the wool-tops contract, and it is not necessary that I should touch upon that. With regard to the sugar agreement, I feel not only that I should make certain observations, but that it is the duty of some one board of directors it is not sufficient for to make them. The agreement that has been entered into is nothing more than a commercial transaction. I suggest that if it is we should endeavour to carry it ont ou something approaching commercial lines. The contract is to cover a period of three years, aud involves the expenditure of many millions of money. It is a buying forward at a fixed price, which may be increased slightly, but which cannot be reduced. It must have been a matter of very grave consideration to the Prime Minister when he attended the Conference to determine whether it was wise and business like to make an agreement to pay the price embodied in the sugar contract: The problem which the Prime Minister had to face is exactly similar to those which had to be dealt with during the war period by commercial houses practically every day. It happens to be my particular job to handle propositions of a very similar character at present; and, in this connection, a close parallel may be drawn between this Parliament and the Prime Minister and an ordinary commercial trading company which has a The Prime Minister stands in the position of managing director, and this House is nothing morethan a board of directors, so far as such a transaction as the sugar contract is concerned. For the purposes of illustration, honourable members will, perhaps, allow me to cite cases which 1 have had to consider, decide upon, and submit to my board of directors; for I also-lik e the Prime Minister-happe n to hold the position of a managing director. It has been necessary for me to solve matters, certainly not involving enormous figures such as in the case of the sugar contract, but figures which are serious enough to us in our small way, and which have to do with contracts for cotton and woollen goods dating as far in advance as two years from this period. When one is The called upon, as managing director, to advise the placing of orders of which one's company will not take delivery for a matter of two years, and in respect to which one must settle the question of price forthwith, one takes care to make a recommendation only after securing the fullest information. When a managing director submits his proposition to his him to make a bald statement that it will be wise to take such-and-such a course of action and to supplement that merely with a few general reflections regarding what the position of cotton, for example, may be in the period ahead and has been in the past. One is bound to secure detailed and concrete facts. One is called upon to dig down to the root of things, and to be able to furnish chapter and verse regarding why one considers it wise and necessary to commit his company to a big contract two years in advance. The managing director must ascertain all particulars of the output of cotton in pre-war days, and must consider how far cotton production has been, sufficient to meet the world's demands. SinceI am taking cotton as an example, I may state that prior to the war, when",69,Latjra Duncan
320,Mr Bruce (Flinders) [10.27],"ButAmerica had a large crop, cotton production was in excess of the world's demands. When America had a small crop the world's production was not quite lip to world requirements. W it h respect to wool the proposition is very different. Prior to the war the supply of wool, even when really good seasons were being enjoyed in all wool-producing countries, was only just equal to the demand. revert to the illustration of cotton production, a managing director during the would be the consumption of cotton on the part of all the Great Powersi n volved in the conflict. ascertain how many bales the Allies would be taking for the purposes of munition production. to consider the supposition of an armistice being declared, and had to estimate what would be the effect of the cutting off of the demand for cotton for munition purposes as an outcome of the armistice. There would be, indeed, 'a thousand and one factors to consider. The point which I am desirous of stressing is that a managing director had to get his subject thoroughly prepared; he was called upon to make his decisions only after he had gained f u l l knowledge of his subject, and was equipped with a good working idea of future probabilities. All that information was requisite if one expected to secure a directorate's sanction for an extraordinary expenditure. Now, that is exactly the position in which honourable members find themselves in regard to the sugar contract. I have no doubt, and I certainly sincerely trust, that when the Prime Minister went to Sydney to settle the contract he was in possession of all the knowledge available with regard to sugar-the world's production and consumption-the present position, indeed, set for th in clear and tabulated form. I hope the Prime Minister had given those particulars fullest and weightiest consideration before venturing to enter into a contract extending over three years upon a basis of certain specific prices. But even before devoting consideration to those facts and figures it was necessary for him to determine the question of entering into a three years' contract. which this House has been furnished in that regard is that a contract covering that period would give stability to the industry. I quite agree that it might do so; but it seems to me that chapter and verse are required for asserting that such a term would stabilize the industry. One naturally wants to know the probable outlook in a normal season, and what are the possibilities with respect to new mills being erected. I am merely submitting now, in accordance with what I understand to be To the Prime Minister's expressed wishes, points which he may consider and reply to. I suggest that upon the question of war had to consider what the necessity for an agreement extending over more than one year we have been given no other information except that One had to contained in the one vague statement that it w ill furnish stability for the industry. I am fairly confident that a One, then, had sound case could be stated upon the necessity for the contract to run over a three-year term; but unless this Parliament is provided with complete information it should not be expected, as a board of directors, to sanction the action of the Prime Ministeri n his capacity of managing director. Honourable members should not be called upon to take responsibility upon their shoulders and off the shoulders of the Prime Minister and the Government generally. Apart from the matter of the period of contract, I stress that probably no honourable member present would venture to describe himself as a sugar expert. Possibly there are some who know a great deal about the industry; but I doubt if any honourable member will say that he has the sugar industry at his fingers' ends in the same sense as I am required, in pursuance of my job, to have the wool and cotton markets of the world at my fingers' ends. I question if any honourable member is in a position to decide whether or not a forward contract over a long period would be wise'and prudent. I have jotted down a few points which I feel that I would be called upon to place before my directorate if I were in the position of the Prime Minister, and desired to receive sanction for the contract to which I was a party. These points are directed to an endeavour to secure a review of the position of sugar throughout the world before the war, and of the posiThe only explanation with tion to-day, and the probabilities in the future. It is obvious that one should know first the sugar production and consumption of the world in pre-war days, before there was an abnormal demand aud'prior to the dislocation of trade consequent upon the war. Having got at the facts with respect to those items, one then would need to know where the sugar came from, aud in what proportions it was cane sugar and beet sugar. Thus one would be in a position to judge concerning those parts of' the world in which the beet sugar industry has been hampered or wiped .out. In this regard the Prime Minister did indicate something about beet sugar. He stated that it would be impossible to grow beet sugar in northern France for many years to oome. But that, after all, is not very useful information so far as I personally am concerned, since I do not happen to know how much beet sugar was grown in northern France in pre-war days; and so I am unable to estimate how far the present position in northern France is likely to affect the world's production. The very phrase, "" a number of years to come,"" is obviously vague and inadequate as the basis for a commercial computation. Honourable members are entitled to all information of this nature in order to judge the position generally. We should also be informed of the present estimated stocks of sugar the world. Only a few months ago the Government purchased Java sugar at £15 per ton, and we have been told that the price has since to £60, £100 per ton, but we have had no information as to whether the increase in price is due to a shortageof production or to an abnormal demand following the close of the-war. were able to get sugar away from Java again. These are, perhaps, minor points, but I venture to say that not very many honourable members are able to answer them off hand-. Another noint that occurs to me. is that full details ought to be available as to the probable of sugar the world over. With to cotton, when the first ginning come in, one is able to form estimate of production; the position of the sugar industry, have no information place before my directors when I am trying to steer them through any difficult course. the demand for sugar. ister stated that a larger number peoole were now consumers of sugar than in pre-war days. It is well known that Mr Bruce. soldiers, and particularly those in the Balkan States, lived on a higher dietary scale than in former years, and they are now greater consumers of sugar. , B ut the Prime Minister gave us no information as to the effect of this increased consumption on the world position. I agree it is a very difficult problem, but if we are expected to determine the price for the next three years we should have some information as to the probable consumption and production. We ought to know, too, what effect the present price of sugar is likely to have upon future production, and how far new areas will be made available. I have indicated only a few points that immediately occur to me as matters which, had I , as a managing director been responsible for the contract, I would have endeavoured to place before my board of directors. I have no doubt that the Prime Minister had all these matters in his mind, and that the officers whose job it is to advise him arrnec him with the necessary information before he went to the Conference. The whole object of my remarks is to endeavour to bring home to honourable members the fact that throughout it is impossible for us to be experts upon everything. We all know something about our . wn particular business affairs, risen and in order to enable us to arrive at a £70, £80, £90, and even correct judgment upon this sugar contract, we should be placed in the possession of the fullest details, because as I have already said, this is nothing mo.re than a commercial agreement to which and whenproducers we should apply ordinary commercial standards of judgment. There is no possible reason why my illustration of a managing director and a board of directors should not be applicable to a Minister who asks honourable members to approve an agreement on a matter harvest like this. That is to say, we should be regard supplied with all such information as reports it is necessary for every managing an director who knows his job to place before but concerning the board to whom he is responsible. such as I have to As one who has been closely associated with the sugar industry, in Queensland, I listened with much interest to the reThen there is the question of marks made by the honourable member The Prime Minfor Flinders( Mr Bruce).

I doubt if any company is in a better position than the Colonial Sugar Kenning Company to furnish reliable estimates as to the world production and the provision necessary for the requirements of the Commonwealth. Let me say at the outset that the sugar industry in Queensland is in a very precarious state. If , it is not properly supported, hundreds of thousands of acres now under cultivation, of acres that could be put under crop, will be absolutely idle. We have to remember, also, that certain neighbours have already drawn attention to the fact that we are in .possession of an immense area of rich agricultural land in the northern parts of this great Commonwealth, but are not utilizing them, and that we are depriving them of the opportunity to provide for their surplus population. They remind us that we did not buy this country; or win it by war, but took possession of it from the aborigines, who were the r i g h t f u l owners, and' that if we cannot utilize it ourselves it is only logical that we should make way for those who can. On the 29th July, 1919, Mr Christoe, secretary of the Bundaberg and District Manufacturers Union, presented to the Royal Commission on the Sugar Industry a compilation prepared from returns sent in relating to the seven factories in the Bundaberg district, including Millaquin and Qunaba, Fairymead, Bingara, In victa, Baffle Creek, and Gin Gin Central. He pointed out that connected with the seven mills there are no less than 29,134 acres under cane; that in the mills 759 persons are employed, and, in cultivation, 2,390; that the capital invested in 1918 in the mills and other works was £910,000, and in the land, cultivation, aud plant, £720,960, or a total of £1,639.960; that for the period of six years ending with the crop of 1918-19 the expenditure was £3,795,577, and that the value of the product was only £3.687,922. leaving a deficit of £107,655. These figures refer to the seven mills alone, and to only one portion of my electorate. This industry employs 70,000 to 80,000 people, directly and indirectly, and involves an outlay of many millions of pounds, while the average annual value of the crops is about £13,000,000"" per annum. I should like to deal with the question raised by the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) as to the construction of fresh mills. A t the time the last agreement was made, I pointed out to the then Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) how absolutely unnecessary was that clause prohibiting the provision of fresh plant, or additions to plant. I then saidI was perfectly certain that no private enterprise would put up a m i ll in Queensand hundreds of thousands land under existing conditions, and that the Queensland Government had already put a large sum of money into the industry on which they were receiving an unsatisfactory return. This is not on account of the absence of sugar land, for there are hundreds of thousands of acres just as good as those under cultivation, but because there is no inducement to erect mills. Just now I interjected that we very seldom had any surplus of sugar in Australia. I only know of a single instance of a bond fide surplus, and that was one of 9,000 tons in 1907-S. In the following year that surplus had not"" only been wiped out, but there was a deficit of 110,000 tons. The only other surplus was in the The industry is in jeopardy. very year that we entered into the last contract-1918 , when it was s&id there was six months' surplus on hand. But what happened? That six months' stock was not a legitimate growth of sugar for that year. In the previous year f u l l y 50 per cent, of the farmers refused to cut their cane under the Dickson award, and it was held over u n t i l the following year, when there was at least the growth of one year and a half milled, resulting in the "" surplus."" But that was wiped out, and this year there is a deficit of over 110,000 tons. Has anything been done by the Government to encourage more production? Nothing whatever! Wages have gone up <to such an extent that, as the Prime Minister stated yesterday, 80 per cent, of the value, of the sugar is represented by wages. I may point out that before the agreement was entered into, offipers of the PrimeM in ister's Department obtained the information which, so far, the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) has been looking for. One report which has come into my possession was prepared at the instigation of the Cuban Government, which desired to know the position of the beet sugar industry. tions of the European beet sugar industry, and was prepared by Mr Hannibal J. De Mesa, special envoy of the Cuban Government, and is of the utmost importance to sugar consumers in Australia. That gentleman points out that there has been a shrinkage of over 4,500,000 tons in beet sugars alone. there of the beet sugar industry expanding again within the next three years? Very little. Most of the countries that produce beet sugar have to a large extent been depleted of the facilities for carrying on the industry successfully; and in the cane sugar industry there has been practically little or no expansion, in face of a severe shortage. The honourable member for ( Mr Bruce) referred to the rise in price of Java sugar from £15 a ton to £80 a ton in two years, with an exchange about 30 per cent, or 40 per cent. was plenty of sugar in Java to sell, but no vessels to take it away; and as soon as vessels were obtained and the markets were opened, up went the price, to which has to be added exchange, freight, charges.

I am satisfied that no managing director of any business enterprise could have got together more accurate or more The up-to-date information than was obhas adtained by the Prime Minister and the A new staff which was associated with h i m regarding the sugar industry. I would not have spoken b u t for the observations made by the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) in regard to wool tops. It seems to me that he accurately stated the position, and 1 f a i l to understand how the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) can take up the attitude that the £540,000 which w ill be paid into tbe Consolidated Revenue of this country, under the new agreement Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, does not actually belong to the wool-growers. The right honourable gentleman referred to the fact that, approximately, £200,000 had been lost by certain firms as the result of wool top3 being sold at 4i'd. per lb. ter of fact, the basis upon which the manufacturers were paid 4 | d . per l b . was that of scoured wool, and not of greasy wool. To me it seems incredible that £200,000 was lost by the sale of wool tops at that price. But if such losses are being sustained it is time that a stop was put to them. I hope that fuller in formation will be given to the House as to how this particular loss was brought about. I feel certain that the £540,000 referred to by the honourable member for Grampians rightly belongs to the Australian wool-growers. tinctly provided, and the wool-growers agreed to it , that wool required for local purposes should be outside the Pool. the .producers. I was indeed astonished to find so many champions of our primary producers on the other side of the chamber I was very pleased to hear the fine speech made by the honourable member for -Maranoa( Mr James Page). He touched upon many matters relating to primary production, and he knew what he was talking about. He advocated the extension of postal and telephonic facilities to the residents of our back-blocks. Now, as the result of several deputations which have waited upon the Postmaster-General, a promise has been made that £100,000 will be appropriated for the purpose of providing these facilities for agricultural areas. W h a t is the good of £.100,000 to provide facilities foT the men of whom the honourable member spoke? Having regard to the fact that the Postal Department made a profit of something like £500,000 last year, I think that at [25] -least that amount of money should be spent on those services that are so necessary to keep people away from the large centres of population. We have the continual d r if t of population to the cities, coupled with a reduction of production. About 4,000,000 acres have gone out of cultivation for wheat. Certain statements made by me in regard to the dairying industry have been referred to by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) with the Colonial and the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan). The statements I made were correct. The dairying industry, like wheat-growing, is going backwards day after day. There are in Australia to-day 200,000 less cows than there were in 1913. I remind honourable members, As a matparticularly those who sit in Opposition, that they must be prepared for a great increase in the prices of both butter and meat. There is a standing offer from the Canadian Government to the Victorian Minister of Agriculture of 2s. 6d. per lb. for the whole output of Victorian butter, and, if the sale is confined to the output of certain districts, an increased price w ill be paid. The position which has arisen in my own district owing to the low price of butter prevailing to-day is appalling. A great quantity of the milk from that district is condensed, and Nestles Company at the pre-ent t'me i i using about 250 tons of sugar per week for the manufacture of condensed milk. The company is able to pay a higher price for the mills than can be paid by the butter factories in the district, on account of the price of butter being fixed. The prices that I quoted, and to which reference has been made, were correct. The fixed price for butter for home consumption is 175s. per cwt.; for second grade butter for the Orient, 205s. per cwt.; and for the small trade done with SouthA f r i c a , 243s. per cwt.; whilst the fixed price for GreatB r it a in was 253s. per cwt. The open price in Great Britain is something like 300s. per cwt. So that the Australian dairyman is receiving £100 per ton less for butter than the open prices in Great Britain. These fixed prices w ill obtain u n t i l the end of August. I say nothing about the contracts into which the Government entered in the past.

The position in regard to meat is very interesting. answer given by the Prime Minister to a question I asked the other day that no fresh contracts w ill be entered into with the Imperial -Government. know whether that statement is final, but, at any rate, it is final for the time being. We must, therefore, study tbe existing position in regard to meat. I quote the following remarks made by Mr C. A . McCurdy, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food, on the 13th December : As regards meat, there is a surplus at the moment in this country. misled by the fact into assuming that our supplies for next year are assured. Perhaps a plain statement of the facts with regard to meat will be of value. Before the war the population of the United Kingdom ate 2,100,000 tons of meat every year-175,00 0 tons every month. The British farmer supplied 1,360,000 tons, and 750,000 was imported every year. Owing to the stoppage of emigration, we shall have more people to feed next vear than in 1913. Where is it to come from? The home supplies will be about 1,000,000 tons. Assuming that our people eat no more than they did before the war, we shall want an extra 360,000 tons from abroad to feed them. We shall want 1,100,000 tons of imported meat instead of 750,0.00. Now all the meat in the world which the meat-producing countries can export next year out of the year's production is estimated at about 1,210,000 tons; add to that stocks of 120,000 tons in hand in New Zealand and Australia held over from past years owing to the submarine war and shipping difficulties, and you get 1,333,000 tons in all. At our pre-war rate of consumption we shall need 1,100,000 It was made also by tons, and that leaves for the United States of America and the Continent of Europe only I di d not say that. 222,000' tons. The United States want half that, -and that leaves 110,000 tons in all for the Continent of Europe. WihenI tell you that the meat supplies of the European countries, apart from Bussia, are .3,500,000 tons short, and many of their people are actually starving, you will agree that 110,000 tons is not much to meet any demands which they are able to make. France, Italy, and Belgium have already asked for 500,000 tons, which they are not likely to get. If we could assume that a hungry Europe will get no imported meat at all, there would be just enough for everybody else, but that is rather a risky.assumption. There will ibe, beyond any doubt, the honourable a world shortage of meat next year-a t least 3,000,000 tons less meat in Europe than our neighbours used to eat before the war. That is the position in regard to meat. The honourable member for When the open contracts are restored, which must happen about 10th A p r i l , it w ill be found that very much higher prices w ill be paid for meat in this country. About 9,000,000 sheep have been lost in New South Walesi n consequence I understand from an of the drought, and as there is a small number of sheep in Victoria, only a good rain is required to increase the price of sheep in our own markets by I do not 6s. or 7s. per head. We must expect to pay higher prices for butter, meat, and other primary products. The Prime Minister stated the other day that the primary producer must increase his production in. order that Australia might meet its obligations on the other side of the world. I hope that if we do as he suggests, we shall get the high prices now offering abroad, because that is our only We must not be means of meeting the vast obligations created by the war. In regard to repatriation, a great, deal has been said about wool and the manufacture of woollen goods. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr. Fenton) went into this matter very f u l l y. -I merely desire to refer briefly to the statement made by the Prime Minister that he intended to ' make an effort to organize the woollen industry in Australia, so that three-quarters of our wool",75,Latjra Duncan

329,Mr Gibson,"The farming commight be converted into manufac.tured goods in this country. It is one of the greatest ' opportunities this country has ever had of repatriating some of its returned soldiers. It has been stated, in connection with the establishment for this purpose of a woollen factory, that a capital expenditure of approximately £100,000 is required. If such an industry were established, it would employ, at least, 500 men, and it would require only that number of shareholders contributing, say, £200 to provide the necessary capital. If we were to place 500 men on the land, a much larger expenditure would be involved. The establishment of such an industry in each -State would 'provide employment fox many returned soldiers, and would enable them to make handsome profits. I do not suggest the nationalization of the industry. I believe that a number of returned soldiers -would be prepared to invest their war gratuities in it, but, failing that, the Government could advance the money, as is being done'in connection with land settletory manner. It is hardly fair to introment. It is well known that in placing returned soldiers on land established settlers are being bought out to accommodate returned men. I . do not wish to criticise the administration in this direction too severely, because it is really a State matter. fanners' holdings have been purchased by the authorities, and the settler who has been displaced simply comes on the market again in open competition with the Government. In consequence of this practice being followed throughout the length and breadth of Victoria and New South ""Wales, the land has appreciated in value approximately £2 per acre. In my own district, during the last fortnight, twelve different families have left their holdings, and these are now to be worked by returned soldiers. The natural consequence is that the farmers, who doubtless have sold at a good price, aTe again coming into the market and forcing up the price against the authorities, who are purchasing on behalf of the discharged men. Much of the land is being offered to the Government at very high prices, and it would be interesting to see how the prices realized compare with those at which it is valued for taxation purposes. I could quote instances where farmers have purchased land at £7 per acre, and ifoave offered it to the Government for repatriation purposes at from £10 or £12 per acre. It would be interesting to know the value on which land tax has been paid in connection with these particular estates. I trust that my brief remarks have not : hindered the passage of the Soldiers' Gratuity Bill. I can assure the Government that those occupying the corner benches and honourable members opposite are just as anxious to support the passage of the Bill as are honourable members sitting behind the Government. I feel confident that, had the Government been sincere in their desire to pass this measure, it would have been disposed of last session without a murmur. It is my intention to confine my remarks to the sugar question. I listened with interest to the very clear statement of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), and I regret that this important question was not brought forward in a more satisfacduce it at this stage, and to expect honourable members to discuss it on the Governor General's Speech. on the question that the paper be printed. In many instances, then be too late. The Prime Minister made it clear that if Parliament opposed the agreement the Government could not attempt to handle the sugar question at all. It would have been practicable for the debate on the Governor General's Speech to have been postponed to allow the sugar agreement to be discussed in detail, and if that course had been adopted we would have had an opportunity of obtaining further information on certain important points. We cannot expect the Prime Minister to submit all the details in a brief speech, but I believe he has made a very good deal. From what I have read, it is reasonable to assume that there is likely to be a sugar shortage for at least one or two seasons, if not longer. If that is so, we are bound by this price for only three years, and there appears to be little prospect of the public being unfairly treated. While I am prepared to take the responsibility of supporting the agreement, I must say that it is time the Government-if they remain in office-bega n",76,Latjra Duncan

331,Mr Mcwilliams,You can discuss it,77,Latjra Duncan
332,Mr Atkinson,"Probably it wouldto look into the sugar question a little more closely than they have been doing. I have always been in favour of Queensland receiving liberal treatment in connection with the sugar industry, as regards not only the industry itself, but also the general conditions surrounding it: We cannot, however, blink our eyes to the fact that the Government have been receiving £1,250,000 for many years on an annual consumption of 200,000 tons, and this amount has been of great assistance in keeping the industry going. It must be admitted that the industry is not making much progress, and that it does not meet the Australian demand. There are thousands of acres of sugar-producing country in Queensland, and if the industry is not to expand under the present favorable conditions it is time a different policy was adopted. The sugar-growers should not only endeavour to meet the Australian demand, but should produce sufficient to enable them to market supplies overseas. The Australian people cannot allow the present conditions to continue indefinitely, and I trust that the sugar-growers will take advantage of this set .term of three years, and make a strong effort to increase the area under cultiva-. tion. I am prepared at all times to look at this matter from the Federal standpoint and to treat the industry generously, but if it is to be capable of merely meeting the Australian demands we have to consider whether the industry is worth fostering. member considered the details of the last award ? are peculiar, and higher wages still will have to be paid. per week. will doubtless be a heavy impost. It is to be hoped that when the three-year period embodied in the agreement has expired conditions will be normal. If sugar is then to cost £30 per ton locally as now, we shall have to consider whether it will not be more advantageous to import our supplies. If the area of land suitable for the cultivation of cane is extended, there should be sufficient sugar to meet thedemand. It may not be for twelve months, but what is a year or two in the life of a nation? The Queensland producers cannot expect this Parliament to go on protecting their industry for ever unless they make a reasonable advance on what they have been doing for the last twelve years. In regard not only to sugar, but also other tropical products, Australia has to face the question of indentured labour. There are vast tracts of country in the north which ought to be producing, but I do not see any prospect of having white people employed there unless we have labour which is suited for the particular industries which might be carried on there. that labour? in F i ji labour is secured from India. If we treat indentured labour properly, say, by employing it for terms of two years, or three years, only, and keeping one lot passing out while another lot is coming in, there will be no danger of interfering with the White Australia policy. It would be far better to have these industries carried on in this way with white men as overseers, and in clerical positions, than to have the vast tracts of country in the north lying idle. I am afraid they would not remain idle very long, because, if we neglect to utilize them, I am sure a more virile people will come along and do so. -It is about time this Parliament took into consideration the advisability of the honourable abolishing the useless waste of time brought about by debating the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. I can see some excuse for such a debate at the beginning of a Parliament when men are new to the House, because it gives them an opportunity of finding their sea legs, or breaking the ice, but, apart from that, the debate is useless. Furthermore, it does the Government no good, because, anticipating that about a week, or a fortnight, will be taken up in this way, they are quite unprepared to bring forward legislation, as occurred last session, when the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) permitted the debate to be concluded long before the time anticipated by the Government.

There is still business for the House to do, and I am not aware what time w ill be occupied in doing it , but I suggest that, when we do adjourn, we should adjourn until noon to-morrow. move That the House, at its rising, adjourn until 12 noon to-morrow. Question resolved in the affirmative. ister and Attorney-General) [11.34] According to the arrangement I made with honourable members. I now desire to move That the memorandum of the Conference, held at Sydney, between representatives of the Queensland siigar industry and the Queensland and Commonwealth Governments, be printed. In order to make the intention of the parties clearer, we have inserted at the end of the last paragraph but one of the agreement, the following words: And it is agreed by the parties that, under the above clause, the Conference cannot recommend any increase in the price of cane beyond that provided for in this agreement. In my remarks I shall be very brief. am afraid that I cannot follow the very admirable advice of the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce), to adopt the practice of directors at a meeting of shareholders. Perhaps honourable members who have not been in the House very long do not appreciate the difference between Parliaments and private enterprise. But there is a fundamental difference. One difference becomes apparentwhen I recall to honourable members the fact that we have been here nearly a month and stand to-night with not a single thing to our credit. have practically spent the whole time in criticising that which is past. enterprise would hardly be guilty of such procedure. I do not blame Parliament. I have been too long in it , and I know what all Parliaments are, and what I suppose they, w ill all be to the end of time. But when I am asked to deal w it h a matter such as this in the way that I would deal w i th it if I were myself buying sugar, or if I were the head of a company buying it , I must point out the circumstances in which I find myself. If I were buying the sugar myself I would have acted without delay. 1 would not have talked about it . I would have made up my mind whether it was a good deal or a bad one, and would have taken all the risk there was in it . It would have been a purely commercial transaction. But, of course, a Parliament finds itself in a very different Therefore I position, and hesitates to do or to decline to do that which a private individual would do or refuse to do without hesitation. He would make up his mind one way or the other. In private enterprise I need hardly say that only those men succeed who are able to make up their minds quickly. And in ' private enterprise men have' toconsider only whether a proposed course is commercially profitable and Parliament has to consider many other things. I am confronted with this position: I have, in the first place, to consider not merely the question of acquiring sugar at a certain price and selling it at a profit; not merely the factors of the world's supply, and the possibilities of fluctuations in prices and in demand, but also what effect the transaction w ill have upon Australia, and upon one of the greatest industries in it . In this matter we are in very much the same position as we were in regard to wheat. We gave a I guarantee' of 5s. 4d. per bushel for wheat, although we did not know whether the price of wheat next season would be high or low. The Government had to take that risk, and d i d so willingly, deliberately, and rightly, because it is essential, whether the price of wheat falls below 5s. 4d. or not. to encourage people to grow wheat, in this country. Eveni f the price of wheat outside fell to i2s., it would still be a sound policy to encourage men to go on Australian lands and grow wheat. It is We also profitable to encourage people to settle on the northern sugar lands of Private Australia .by guaranteeing a fixed price for cane and sugar, even if the price of sugar does f a l l outside. Of course, for this season this is clearly a good agreement on tlie face of it , I mean good from a commercial standpoint, b u t if for the following two years the people of 'Australia have to pay more than they would .otherwise have paid, still Australia as a nation w ill pay only that which is",78,Latjra Duncan

If it has not made the huge profits attributed to it , why is it the one company which has refused to supply a Royal Commission with information sought to be obtained? I want to see the industry prosper, and recognise that it would be a bad day for Australia, and especially for northern Australia, if it were injured. The Prime Minister has very properly pointed out that the industry is a splendid one, and deserving of encouragement. He states: ""We are dealing with an important industry."" Here we are really dealing with two industries in one. The smallf r u it growers of Victoria and Tasmania w ill be swept out of existence if this agreement is passed, unless provision is made in it for their protection. This practice of hastily entering into contracts is a wretched one. I thought that our experience in connection with the shipbuilding and one or two other contracts would have been a lesson to us not to enter into hastily-made agreements entailing a cost of millions of pounds and threatening the existence of important industries without this House having ample time to consider the subject. The Government should have had proper time to consider'this agreement. arrangement has been hastily arrived at? MrM c WILLIAMS tion given here to-night is the result of hasty consideration. W ill the right honourable gentleman tell me what is to be the retail price of sugar under this agreement? Sir MrM c WILLIAMS relating to one of the staple food's of Australia, affects the raw material of a kindred and equally important industry, and surely we ought to know what is to be the retail price of sugar. I have been told by f a i r l y good judges that the retail price of sugar will be raised to 5£d. OT 6d. per lb. If they are right, the small-fruit industry of Victoria and Tasmania w ill be killed. In a very able report prepared by MrM a r t in , a Government official who was at the time Assistant Price Fixer, it is stated that, small fruit s cannot be grown profitably in Tasmania and Victoriaf o r less than 3d. per l b . ; and, as a pound of sugar and a pound of f r u it is required to make two pounds of jam, it will be impossible But how often for Australian preserves to compete in the world's markets with sugar at 5£d. or 6d. a l b . I think that, if proper consideration were given to the matter, it would be possible to insert in the coni tract provisions which would give the cane-grower the assistance hefeteedswithout crushing those in other -industries. There is no antagonism between the canegrower and the fruit-grower; but the middleman gets all the profit from the industry of both. man come in here? MrM c WILLIAMS Immediately this agreement is sanctioned there w ill be a demand for increased wages, and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company w ill go for its cut. While the consumers of sugar w ill pay more for that commodity, the unfortunate cane-growers w ill benefit but little by the increase in price. In America, they are tryin g to get over the difficulty by using what is called there "" n e a r w h it e s u g a r, which, I believe, is what is called in Queensland "" m i l lw h it e "" sugar, that is sugar just a stage short of refined sugar. I understand that such sugar can be used for the making of preserves; but the semi-brown sugar we have been getting ferments, and is useless for preserving. I desire that the canegrower may get f u l l value for his .produce, instead of having to ship it to SydT h e informaney for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to take their cut out of it .

348,Mr Hughes,"Ho w does the. middlethem that the Queensland growers would not he prejudiced, because importation would be necessary in any 'case. They would not buy at £7 10s. a ton, and some months afterwards had to buy the same sugar at £22 a ton, losing £1,500,000 on the deal. The preserving companies were prepared to buy Java sugar at £7 10s. a ton, to pay the import duty of £6 a ton, and to run the risk of not getting freight to bring it to Australia, but the Go""vernnient would not allow them to import it, and compelled them afterwards to buy it at an increase of 150 per cent, on cost. Mi-, i McWILLIAMS -Tli e Government could have bought the sugar at £7 10s., yet it compelled the preserving companies to pay £24 or £26 a ton for it. Every one knew that we would have to import between 80,000 and 100,000 tons of sugar. Mr 'GREENE -We did not .know at that time that we would have to import, because there was then a surplus of sugar in Australia. once since Federation been a surplus in Queensland-that is once in twenty years -settle our lands will not receive a ful l every one knew at that time that there would be ia shortage. The preserving companies -and the .growers of. small fkuits were not so much injured as they might have been, because, owing to the war, prices took a great jump. But today -prices are low. There are thousands of tons of pulp and preserves in other forms in stock. Recently, a manufacturer told me that next year's outlook for the small-fruit industry was an exceedingly poor one owing to the large stocks that have beenleft over by the war. Great Britain has been selling tens of thousands of tins of preserves, and still holds a considerable quantity. I represent a district in which hundreds, and, I might say, thousands, of persons are engaged in growing small fruits, and surely we have a right to protect that industry!We do not wish to injure the. cane-grower; but the financial position and the homes of the growers of small fruits in Tasmania should be protected. There is no reason why one industry should crush another. We are being asked to discuss the sugar agreement before we have had an oppor[26] trinity to consider measures which, in my opinion, will have to be adopted if the sugar industry is to be a success. I regret to say that from personal inquiries of men who have spent their lives in cane-growing I learned that many of them have not done too well out of it, some have not 'done well at all, and some are threatened with disaster that I would gladly help to divert. After all, the jam manufacturers represent the small-fruit industry, and I want to know if it is not possible for them to buy direct from the mills sugar that would be satisfactory to them. If that were possible, the canegrower would get an advantage and the fruit-grower would also get an advantage, whilst the man who would be cut out is the middleman, for whom I have no sympathy. If primary productions are to increase in Australia we must eliminate as far as possible the trusts .and combines that exist in the form of middlemen in our cities handling those productions. Until those people are -cut out our primary in'dustries -cannot assume the importance which they should; those who go out to return for .their labour, whilst the consumer will continue to be penalized. ber not know that it would cost the small miller to make the class of sugar to which he has referred very nearly as much as 'the cost of refining?

Sir Henry Jones, in Tasmania, is taking infinitely more out of the pockets of the small fruit-growers of that State than the Colonial Sgtg&r Refining Company has -ever taken from the pockets of the sugar growers of Queensland. able member desires to preach the doctrine of co-operation I can suggest to him no more f r u it f u l soil in which to plant the seed of that policy than among the small fruit-growers of his own State. The honourable member wants to know what is going to be the retail price of -sugar. I would like to be able to tell him. me three things first-how much will be produced in Australia next year; how much sugar we shall have to import into Australia price of that imported sugar will be, and what will be the state of exchange on the date when the drafts are to be honored between this country and those -which we shall have to import sugar. I Mr Greene. will inform him to a cent the retail prioe of sugar if he will furnish me with those That is to say, prior particulars. Now, that is a perfectly fair offer. One other point was mentioned by the -honourable member. He remarked that something ought to be done under this agreement to protect the fruit-grower. It is perfectly true, What is the position ? If we do not conclude this agreement the retail price of sugar, in all probability, w ill be lOd. per lb. for this year. Is the small-fruit grower likely to be better off in those cirI think they made a mistake in cumstances, or under this agreement? Whatever the price of sugar may be under this agreement, it follows that, in asmuch as we shall be purchasing two-thirds, and possibly still more, of our supThey declined to plies of sugar in Australia at one-half, or less than half, the cost to the rest of the world, the price of sugar in Australia must „be lower than in other countries. All I have to say further Fruit-growers in other parts of the world will have to pay for sugar required for jam making more than the Australian fruit-grower. That is perfectly obvious, and, in the circumstances, I ask the honourable member, as a business man, whether T ask the honoror not the fruit-grower in Tasmania has for Franklin, if he a better chance than he has ever had before. If the honourable member will consider for a moment he will realize that under -this agreement it will be possible to proI venture to say that duce jam in Australia at a lower price than in any other part of the world, and either the jam-makers are going to put huge fortunes into their own pockets or to pay the fruit-growers of Tasmania fair prices. I repeat that the whole If the honortrouble in the fruit-growing districts of Tasmania aaid the small fruit-growing districts on the mainland is that they have been in tbe hands of monopolists. fair deal, and if the honourable member desires to preach the doctrine of cooperation anywhere he should start in his AjidI will tell him if he can tell own back yard, because it is needed there sugar more titan anywhere else in Australia. I am in agreement with some of the renext season; what the marks made by the honourable member for that the House should have ample opportunity to discuss the agreement.

389,Franklin ( Mr Mcwilliams). I Believe,"of the Royal Commission. W it h the in formation before me, I honestly think that we could not do better for the next two years than to r a t if y the agreement. It is quite possible that in the third year we shall be required to pay a higher price for our sugar b u t if we have to pay increased prices for the first and second years, the people of Australia would not be any better off. According 'to the report the people, but for this agreement, would have to pay at least 8d. per l b . for sugar at the present time. I am aware that the Commission recommends an increase only from £ 2 1 to £ 2 2 per to n ; but evidently tliey believe that in all probability sugar will increase in price in the near future. One of the reasons why I am supporting the agreement is that it will take certain powers out of the hands of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. has told us what the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are receiving at present, and . what they will receive under this agreement. amount, according to their ownstatements, to be 18s. 6d. per ton, including freight 8s., refining charges 2s. I d . , bags 4s., coal 2s. 9d. I regard the Colonial Sugar Refining Company as one of the most unscrupulous concerns in Australia. Time after time they refused to give in formation before the Royal Commission. they put the increased charges down at £ 1 3s. per ton as the actual added cost, and the auditor ascertains that they pay these increased rates. port it is statedAppreciable delay in the presentation of the report has been caused by the refusal of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to furnish certain information called for by the Commission. CommonwealthParliament to remove any doubt as to the power of the Commission to demand information, but the company maintains its. attitude of refusal after the passing of the Act. It is understood that the Government matter, and as above indicated, a special report relating to tbe Colonial Sugar Refining Company's affairs will be furnished. The report also states that one of the reasons for the increased price of sugar is the appreciation in the value of sugar lands. [27] of living is going up because the price of land is being increased. On page 11 of the report MrE . W . Knox, the general manager states that he estimated in 1913 the average value of sugar lands was about £ 1 7 per acre, which he thought was a fair and reasonable value; but that in the Herbert district, the principal district in Queensland in which the company is concerned, farmers were paying about £ 3 5 per acre for land which should be sold at £ 1 7 per acre. It follows, therefore, that if a farmer has to pay more for his land the price of his product must be increased. On page 35 of the report it is statedAs will be observed by a perusal of this report, it is practically impossible to arrive at any precise result in respect to the average cost of production per ton of sugar cane. The great majority of farmers cultivate small holdings; the average area of land devoted to sugar cane is about 40 acres. Of this area It has done so. less than two-thirds is harvested each year. As explained elsewhere, the majority of these farmers keep no accounts, and it is only by a careful study of the accounts which were submitted and by viewing the general condition of the industry, that the Commission was able I make the additional to form an opinion as to how the present rate of wages, prices for raw sugar, cost of living, &c, affect the welfare of the farmer. There is no general evidence of prosperity, nor, with few exceptions, are there any signs of further development. Owing to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company having refused to furnish, confidentially or otherwise, any information in respect to the financial results of the operations of the raw sugar mills in Queensland and New South Wales, the Commission has been unable to obtain complete information in respect to the milling branch of the industry. On the information available, it is found that, with few exceptions, the raw sugar mills are deriving but small and frequently insufficient profits. In my opinion, it has not been tlie farmers or the raw mills, but the refiners who have taken the largest share. We were told by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr G-reene) that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are A special Act was passed by tbe .benefactors, inasmuch as they pay more for the cane than do the co-operative mills. It was my privilege, when Ministerf o r Customs, to visit Queensland in 1909, and in the company's office at is taking certain action in the Herberton, Mr Mann, the member for the district, and a sugar-grower, stated that when he sent his cane to the cooperative mills he was paid 16s. a ton, whereas theColonial Sugar Refining Company paid him only 9s",86,Joseph Cook No About Eight Months Before The Armistice

If the figures that have been quoted show that the company gives more for cane, we ought to be told the number of tons of cane to the tons of sugar obtained. The company may, for all we know, have been purchasing cane which requires only 8 tons to produce a ton of sugar. The company have taken care to obtain the best positions for their mills, with the farmers at hand, and may well afford, perhaps, to give better prices. I realize, however, that the agreement is the best that can be made, not only for the workers, in the way of improved conditions, and the cane-farmers in the way of increased price per ton, but also for the raw sugar-millers. agreement the company w ill not receive the proportionate advantage that they had in the past.

All this evidences the necessity for the House being informed of what the retail price of sugar is likely to be. I do not know whether the honourable member that information.

Reference to the Australian Sugar Journal, , which is one of the best authoritieson sugar in the Commonwealth mill-owners' point of view. would not be likely to fake the prices received from America.

417,Member For Franklin ( Mr Mcwilliams),"Some honourable members are of opinion that there is nothing to justify the proposed increase to the sugar producers. Evidently they do not pause to consider that year after year wages have gone up, that the cost of machinery has increased, and that the price of the artificial fertilizers which are necessary to the maintenance of the productivity of the sugar lands of Australia has also increased enormously. Earlier in the evening I cited the case of seven mills with plantations attached to them, which have absolutely lost £107,000 within the brief period of. six years. In the absence of this agreement, what encouragement can we offer the cane-growers to cultivate more land? Yeti f they do not plant additional areas, the land which becomes exhausted every year will pass out of cultivation. The result will be a less yield of Bugar, and consequently greater importation of that article. It necessarily follows, then, that we shall have to pay vastly more 'for our sugar than we shall do if we ratify the proposed agreement. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 1 a.m. (Friday).",89,Joseph Cook No About Eight Months Before The Armistice
