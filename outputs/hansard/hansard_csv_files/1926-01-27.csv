Briefly stated, the position in regard to his treatment is that. in March, 1925, Dr. Smalpage first brought under the notice of the department the fact that he was obtaining satisfactory results by a certain process of preparation of an antitoxin against tubercle bacilli. In order to carry out this process the preparation of certain extracts was necessary, and at the Commonwealth Serum 'Laboratories the preparation of this extract was put in hand, aud the supplies were from time to time forwarded to D r . Smalpage. The preparation of anti-toxin was delayed on account of certain difficulties of a technical character, and, on the 7th January, 1926. an invitation was addressed by me to Dr. to come to the Serum Laboratories and make use of the resources of the laboratories for the production of serum by his own method. developed consists of utilizing an extract of the spleen for the. digestion of living tubercle bacilli. it is claimed, in the production of an endotoxin which upon injection into a horse stimulates the cells of the horse to the production anti-toxin Smalpage cases tempts have been made to produce an anti-toxin against tuberculosis, but, so far as is known, no previous attempt by the use of this particular method has been made. which attaches to any statement made by the Government, it is necessary to state, that, Smalpage claims to have obtained are encouraging, still the department has not yet had before it the evidence which is necessary ta the formation of any estimate of t.he reliability of these results. series of cases, which must be carefully selected aud closely observed by independent specialists, must be treated for a sufficient period of time to enable a judgment to be formed as to the effect of this method of treatment. in concert with Dr. Smalpage, has undertaken to arrange that this series of test cases shall be dealt with in the six capital cities simultaneously, in view of the numerous which have, been received from patients or their friends, to state that it will not be. Sir Neville Howse. possible to commence the treatment of this series of cases u n t i l at least one month hence. It is also necessary that the selection of the test cases shall be made by the specialists who will be observing the effect of treatment w it h a view to ascertaining the effect of the serum upon different classes of cases, and it w ill not be possible to give preference or consideration to any patient for any other reason than the opinion of the committee of specialists as to the suitability of the case for test purposes. D r . Smalpage is actively engaged upon the various stages in the preparation of this serum at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, and it is not practicable by any means to expedite the process. Dr. Smalpage has very openly requested that accordingly, the department's officers should keep in Smalpage close touch with his work, and make in dependent experiments at various stages to corroborate or disprove his results, and arrangements have been made to this end The method just now beiug so that the results of the laboratory tests may be available for consideration at the same time as the results of the tests from This digestion results, human patients. It is important to make acknowledgment to D r . Smalpage by letting it be known that he has intimated to us that he is prepared to transfer to of anti-toxin. It is this the Commonwealth Government, without which is used by Dr. auy"" conditions, for use within the Comfor the treatment of human monwealth, all of his rights in the proof tuberculosis. Many atcess. The statement. I have just made wa3 approved by D r . Smallpage in a conference with me this morning, and the way is now clear for a complete test of bhe value of the serum for the In view of the responsibility treatment df tuberculosis patients. The Government has arranged to make an allowance to D r . Smalpagei n order to although the results whicli Dr. meet his immediate personal expenses while the serum is being prepared, and it is necessary to emphasize, first, that it is uot intended to make any serum available until the tests have been comAtestpleted, and this may take from three to six months. D r . Smalpage, of course,' w ill have supplies. . Secondly, so soon as the efficacy of the serum is established, a sufficient quantity will be made available for general use. The department, The Government has gone to a good deal of expense in providing horses that have been inoculated, so that if the tests prove successful the supply of serum will be but it is necessary, sufficient to meet any demand that may communications be made for it within the Commonwealth.

BeforeI delivered the policy be constructed in the future in the Northern Territory and the Federal Capital Territory. The Commonwealth is also assisting the States to meet the expenditure that will be incurred in unifying-the railway gauges of Ausbralia. Tasmania is responsible for a portion of the cost of those works, and has, therefore, a legitimate claim for some service in return. To me, there is only one way in Territory (Administration) which its requirements can be met. We should provide, not a partial service as the bill proposes, but a continuous service that would embrace both passenger and goods traffic. I believe that the people of Tasmania, desire to have a continuous service. W it h such a service that State would make much greater progress than it has made during the last ten or twenty years. It has been endowed by nature with all the potentialities for development. It possesses coal deposits, extensive timber areas, and splendid agricultural and mining country. In addition to those natural advantages, which would enable manufacturing industries to be established if facilities were provided under which manufacturers in That w ill prove quite inadeouate.

52,Mr Charlton ( H UN T E R ) [3.35],"speech of the Labour party in the early part of the recent election campaign, the granting of assistance to Tasmania was taken into consideration by the members of the party. The constitutionality of the Government proposals was considered, and we decided that because of a doubt in that connection, in order to assist Tasmania legitimately, we would, if returned to power, provide a fleet of steamers to carry both passengers and goods, so that Tasmania would be assured -qf conjtinuoujs communication w i th the mainland. an attempt is being made to dispose of some of the vessels belonging to the Commonwealth; but it would be better to employ them in a regular service to Tasmania, in order to assist that State. Last week a petition containing a number of requests, among which was one for the establishment of a permanent steamer service between the mainland and Tasmania, was presented to this House. If such a service were provided, the people of Tasmania would .know exactly where they stood and what obligations they could accept. ' Under this measure any benefits to be conferred apply solely to passenger traffic, and that during certain seasons of the year only. bill provides applies to tourist traffic only. factory, because it w ill not assist to develop Tasmania. A permanent and continuous service is necessary. vice the honourable gentleman suggests would not be so satisfactory as the proposal contained in this b ill . The honourable member's suggestion refers to an Australian service only. contend that an up-to-date, regular service between the mainland and Tasmania would not provide for the needs of Tasmania as well as the measure before us ? what this bill provides; ib would not enable produce to be conveyed to London. Minister wriggles! Tasmania wants her produce carried not only to London, but to the different parts of Australia. If a regular service opsrated between Tasmania and the mainland, much of the produce of Tasmania could be disposed of in Australia; but, if necessary, it could also be shipped direct to London. Personally, I would be prepared to go further, and allow the Commonwealth vessels to carry that produce. There is nothing to prevent that from being done. now. the honourable member spoken of the disabilities from which Tasmania is suffering through lack of a regular service with the mainland of Australia. ber's proposal would not give Tasmania According to recent cables, what this bill proposes to give that State. member for Bass( Mr Jackson) referred to the existing Commonwealth boats carrying the produce.

I am urging that, in addition, there should be a local service between Tasmania and the mainland to enable the produce ' of Tasmania to be carried to any part of Australia. ment tried to carry on such a service, and failed badly. T h a t is not satisfore follow that the scheme I have suggested would not be a success; but I doubt whether the Government's proposals, as embodied in this measure, will, if put into operation, be successful. I doubt the constitutionality of those proposals. We must be very careful regarding legislation of this kind. A few years ago legislation dealing with taxation matters was passed by us in good faith , but the first appeal proved it to be in valid. That has happened also in regard to other legislation. We were assured by all the legal talent on the other side that legislation recently passed to deport cerI t would not provide tain persons was valid, but the H i gh Court showed that it is not. In view of those experiences we must be particularly the careful. As a layman, not claiming to possess any legal knowledge, but using merely my own common sense and judgment, I express the opinion that this measure is unconstitutional, because it makes a distinction between States.

The whole Navigation Act should be repealed. member agrees with me that this is only a half measure. One of the chief reasons why I criticise this measure as I do, is that I desire, so far as possible, to retain the shipping industry of Australia for our own white people. I want to prevent a competition by ships manned by coloured labour. the ships. not they are manned, and whether we desire to. live up to the ideals of the White Australia policy. That is the chief principle involved in this legislation. We may wish to live up to the White Australia ideals, and to prevent the occurrence of industrial troubles, but we shall have great difficulty in doing so if we permit ships manned by coloured labour, paid low rates of wages, to come into competition with Australian ships in the trade of this country. coloured labour be met by a tax on the difference between the draft of the ships carrying black crews, and that of those carrying white crews. member thiuks that the difficulty might be got over by taking into consideration circumvent it in the H i g h Court, they the drafts of thedifferent ships, b ut this bill deals only with the position arising I realize when Australian ships are unable to carry the traffic.

No matter from what angle the present proposal is viewed, it, merely amounts to tinkering w it h the problem. Eveni f the bill be constitutional, can it be more helpful than the amending legislation of 1920?

I was also glad to hear the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) say that he realized the difficult position under which Tasmania was placed by the Navigation Act. The honourable member stated, further, that he believed the bill to be unconstitutional. Surely, if all th© members of this Chamber are agreed that one State is being badly treated under Commonwealth legislation, it should be no difficult matter to reiieve that State of its disabilities in that regard. I propose to point out some of the drawbacks suffered by Tasmania under the act. For over thirty years oversea mail .vessels had been calling at Hobart. They were first induced to go there by the pioneer apple-growers of Tasmania, who had, through their bankers, to guarantee the freight before the fruit could be lifted. That trade led to the development of the tourist traffic. Each year the tourist traffic by these boats increased, and in 1914 they carried 1,500 passengers to Tasmania. The smaller vessels will tourists being allowed to travel on the mail boats; people of that clas? will travel only under the beet conditions, ancl are prepared to pay more for comfortable accommodation. In moving the second reading of this bill the Minister for Trade and Customs stated tliat Papua, the Mandated Territories, Norfolk Island, and the Northern Territory have been removed from the operation of the Navigation Act in accordance witL. the recommendation of the Navigation Commission. The evidence before the commission clearly showed that the act placed a great disability on the islands and territories, and they must have benefited considerably by being exempted from the provisions relating to the coasting trade. Surely the same. treatment should be meted out to Tasmania. It also is an island, and is dependent upon shipping for intercourse with the mainland. Without adequate and continuous shipping facilities it cannot develop. When proof is adduced that certain statutes operate to the detriment of one State, it is the duty of the Commonwealth Parliament to grant relief. If the relief to Tasmania does not take the form of exemption from harassing legislation, the State must, in order to pay its way, approach this Parliament for further financial assistance. Under existing conditions it is being crippled and crushed. The Minister for Trade ancl Customs said that the shipping service to Tasmania is adequate. That adjective seems most inappropriate to the circumstances that now obtain. Evidence was given before the Navigation Commission that passengers have to book their berths from three to four weeks ahead of the date of sailing, and that many of them have to accept a "" shakedown"" in the social hall or smoke-room, whilst hundreds of would be tourists can get no accommodation at all. Surely those conditions contradict the statement that the service is adequate. book six months ahead. to do that, or pay first-class fares for a second-class berth, or ""shakedown,"" the service cannot be adequate. The Peninsular and Oriental and Orient steamers do not carry cargo between States, but not be affected by the passengers they will be allowed lo carry to Hobart will help them to pay the steaming and port charges incidental to their calls to load apples. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) admitted that disabilities are imposed upoii Tasmania by the Navigation Act, and said that he would institute a special service between it and the mainland. If he offers a service by the . Commonwealth Line it will be useless to Tasmania, because tourists will not utilize it . The accommodation on the ships of the Commonwealth Line is worse than that of the interstate boats. Government sell the State ships? had some cargo ships, but lost such an enormous amount of money in their running that the Government was glad to get rid of them. The Commonwealth Line might be able to provide an adequate cargo service, but it could not cater for the tourist traffic, which is of immense importance to the State. I agree with the honourable member for Forrest that this bill does not go far enough.

During thc war the shipping services of the Commonwealth were commandeered and controlled by the Commonwealth Government, and the boats were rationed out. When the companies again assumed control, instead of competing against each other, they reorganized their services and sent vessels only where the trade was sufficient to warrant their, being, sent. The proposal contained in the bill is only the thin end of th© wedge. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) will endeavour to secure permission for overseas vessels to trade between Albany and Bunbury and the eastern states, and between Geraidton and Perth. He desires to restore that unfair competition, under which, prior to the proclamation of the act, the flotsam and jetsam of cheap labour boats from the Old World had an advantage over the Commonwealth shipping lines, which observed White Australian conditions. The evidence taken by the commission shows that, at the time it visited Western Australia, a greater quantity of timber was being exported from that State than at any time prior to the war. Arrangements had then been made to l if t every stick of timber offerthe act the safeguards for which our seaing within six months, although the amounts exceeded any previous quantities.

Our shipping companies do not wish to see the -cream of their business taken by those who are not bound by any regulation relating to wages, hours of working, breathing space, manning scale or wireless provision, but are content to follow old world ideas as to the manner in which men who "" go down to the sea in ships "" shall live. Those conditions were changed on the Australian coast by the legislation of the Oommonwealth. We should protect our shipping industry a3 we protect any other industry. Almost every week proposals are brought forward in this Parliament to grant a bounty to assist and give an impetus to one or another of our industries. The only thing that has given an impetus to our shipping industry is the Navigation Act. the advantages of which honourable members opposite now seek to whittle away.

The commission which inquired into this subject was the outcome of the agitation of that time regarding the Navigation Act.

Can you, in the face of these figures, say that tlie Act is inflicting any injury on your fruit trade?"" and offer the comment that the figures ns to production being correct, the information given by mc as to the space available was quite incorrect. In reply to* this, I would state that I have had tJie data upon AvhichI based my remarks carefully revieived, and I find that the latter. Avere' at the time they were made, a perfectly accurate statement of the position. My information was obtained from an authoritative source-the shipping people AVIIO handle refrigerated shipping in Australia. It showed that at that time 29 ships A\ere tentatiA ely T T fixed to take, in the aggregate, nearly 2.000,000 cases of fruit from Hobart. And hail conditions in the refrigerated products export trade remained as they were, as appeared likely, there is no doubt whatever that tliese ships would have actually taken away every case of fruit that the Tasmanian groAvers Next, we shall have could offer. But the British markets for meat and butter, which at that time Avere perfectly dead, shortly afterwards reA'ived, and in order to apportion the tonnage available in Australia evenly between the trades concerned, tlie committee controlling the refrigerated ships, Avhich is. in no Avay connected Avith the Government or under Government control, Avitlidrew certain A-essels that Avere listed for Tasmania's fruits, and made them available to carry meat and butter. I have now obtained from ray colleague the Minister for Trade and Custom's a report as to this year's fruit shipments from Tasmania. This is made up to the end of April, whicli practically completes the export season. I am surprised and gratified to learn that, including a parcel of 35,000 cases which are to be sent by the BaraiUnc this month, the exports of Tasmanian fruit Avill reach the record figure of 1,362,000 cases. I learn that there still remain some 200,000 cases of f r u it ' for Avhich space to British markets cannot be obtained. From inquiries made among the shipping authorities, it is ascertained that the reason Ai'hy these apples could not be taken was that there was not available in Australia and New Zealand sufficient refrigerated space to take aAvay the fruit, meat, and butter offering. Tasmanian growers are not the only sufferers, as I am informed quantities of meat and butter have also been It shut out. I am also in a position to definitely state, on the authority of the shipping people who handled these vessels, and Avhq, it must be admitted, can speak with authority on the matter, that tlie 'Navigation Act is not responsible in any AA'ay for the shortage of ships. Had there been no Navigation Act, Tasmania would not have shipped a single additional case of apples. A statement has been made that but for the Act three P. and O. steamers would have A-isited Hobart and lifted between them some 60,000 eases of apples. I learn that two out of the three vessels referred to were definitely fixed for mainland ports months before the apple season opened. AndI am also given to understand that, even if these three ships had been scheduled to call at Hobart, an equiA'alent space in some one or other of the boats Avhich have been sent to that port would have been allotted instead to mainland ports, so that Tasmanian exporters Avould not haA'e been benefited in any degree by their",33,Deputy Speaker Mr Visited Tasmania There Had Been A Record

The power of Parliament to deal with navigation also depends upon section 98 of the Constitution, which readsThe power of Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping, and to railways the property of any State. A measure dealing with navigation is obviously a law with respect to trade and commerce; but Parliament legislates in passing such a measure under and subject to the rule that it shall not give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof. There is no decision of the High Court interpreting this particular section of the Constitution; but it has been referred to in two cases which have been determined by the H i g h Court.

Honourable members may be surprised at that statement, but my reason for doing this is that in Cameron's case the opinion of the minority in 190S was in 1923 adoptedby the whole five justices as accurately stating the law. The point at issue in the ""new protection"" legislation was this: Parliament bad imposed an excise duty upon harvesters and other agricultural implements made in Australia, with exemptions depending upon various considerations. For example, persons who manufactured harvesters, & c , under conditions of labour declared by Parliament to be f a i r and reasonable, or under conditions complying w it h the awards of the A r b i -tration Court, were not to pay the excise duty. The effect of that act was to i m pose a heavy tax upon persons who did not observe the industrial conditions which the Commonwealth Parliament had prescribed.' The majority of the H i g h Court held in regard to that act that Parliament had no power indirectly to legislate upon industrial conditions as such; that the substance of the act was legislation upon industrial conditions, and that it was therefore invalid. The majorit y also held that this legislation, The matter though not in itself discriminating between States or parts of States, was of such a character that under it discrimination might take place, and was thereThe fore invalid. That was an additional reason for the majority decision. The minority, on the other hand, held that In this conthere was not discrimination, and it is upon this point that their opinion bears upon the b ill now before the House. Clause '3 of the bill readsSection two hundred and eighty-six of the principal Act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following sub-section :"" (6.) Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Governor General that the tourist traffic between any ports in the' Commonwealth or in the Territories under the authority of the Commonwealth is being injured or retarded, and the Governor General is satisfied that it is desirable that unlicensed ships be allowed to engage iii the trade, he may, by notice, published iu tbe Gazette, grant permission to unlicensed British ships of such size and speed as are specified in the notice to engage in the carriage of passengers between thoseports, subject to such conditions (if any) and for such period as are set out in the notice."" It is obvious that this clause applies to traffic between ports. It is not directed to traffic between one State and another, or between one part of a State and a part of some other State. ports of the Oommonwealth are in one State or another. therefore, whether it can be said that this measure authorizes a prohibited discrimination. monwealth Parliament were to legislate giving preference to a State as such over another State as such, that legislation, I consider,' would be invalid under section 99 of the Constitution; but if Parliament were to pass legislation in general terms under which it was possible that there might or might not be discrimination, then we must consider what was actually done under that legislation. Legislation is not invalid because under it a regulation may apply in such a way as to infringe section 99. In the Harvester case, pages 106 and 107 of the 6th volume of t.he Commonwealth Law Reports, Mr Justice Isaacs saidBut"" States and parts of States"" are reconditions would be illegal. But to issue ferred to, and that expression more naturally lends itself to the assumption that the proa proclamation dealing with vessels of a hibition to the Federal Parliament was against certain tonnage travelling between the differentiating in its measure of taxation beports of Sydney, Melbourne, and Hobart tween States or parts of States because they would be to make a provision in relation were particular States or parts of States. He was then dealing with section 51, parts of States. That is the distinction. sub-section 2, of tbe Constitution. Referring to section 99, Mr Justice Isaacs saidThe second circumstance referred to is the tinction which the H i g h Court itself has similarity of the language in the primary drawn. The decision of His Honour Mr. limitation and in section 99. The expressions Justice Higgins was on exactly the same "" discriminate between States"" in the one and lines. A f t e r referring to the section, he "" give preference to one State over another pointed out that the legislation was geneState"" in the other, seem to me identical in purport and effect. "" Discriminate between ral, the same for Queensland and Western parts of States"" in the one, may or may not Australia There is not one set of conbe identical with "" give preference to any ditions for Tasmania, and another for part"" of one State ""over any part"" of anVictoria. That is to say, the provision is other State. But if there is any distinction between the last-mentioned phrases, one point a perfectly general provision. of similarity is indelible. It is this : that the treatment tliat is forbidden, discrimination or special provision for Tasmania under this preference, is in relation to the localities conbill. sidered as parts of States and not as mere Australian localities, or parts of the Commonwealth considered as a single country. . went on to sayThe question is-Does the challenged States. provision, whether it be the legislation selves create distinctions.

This statement of the Privy Council was cited by Mr Justice IsaacsThe rule laid down by the act is a general one applicable to all the States alike, and the fact that it bears unequally in the several States arises, not from anything done by the Parliament, but through the inequality of the Obviously, all tbe duties imposed by the States themselves.

172,Mr Latham,"Mr Justice HigginsI n Cameron's case, which is another example of something authorized by Parliament being declared invalid, I find in 32 Commonwealth Law Reports, page 68, a reference to the matter. TheH i gh Court, in 1923, had to consider' the validity of the law which, for the purpose of the income tax, differentiated between the value of horses and pigs according to whether they were in one State or another. The line of discrimination was a State line, and nothing else. For example, for the purpose of these regulations the value of a horse at Albury was fixed at a lower value than that of a reason being that one was in New South Wales, and the other in Victoria. A horse at Albury, under the regulations, was deemed to be worth exactly £ 8 , whilst the same horse, if across the river at Wodonga, was deemed to be worth exactlv £ 1 5 . under this legislation to rectify that? tion. That is an income tax question. That regulation was held to be invalid, and the reason was that the line of discrimination was a State line. There is no objection to discrimination between horses and pigs, even if all horses were in New South Wales, and all pigs were in Victoria. But to value a horse at one rate because it is in New South Wales, and at another because it is in Victoria is to adopt a State line of discrimination, and that is exactly what is prohibited. His Honour the Chief Justice dealing with this question, refers to what was said in the Barger's case which I have read from the judgment of Mr. Justice Isaacs, and accepts it . He also accepts what Mr Justice Higgins said, agreeing that there is no infringement of the non-discrimination provision when there is one general rule applying to all the States; though the circumstances in one State may bring it into application, whilst the circumstances in other States do not bring it into application. His Honour Mr Justice Isaacs points out in the case of this regulation, that different standards' are applied, and they are referable solely to whether live stock are in one State or another. In other words the discrimen-the line of distinctionis: Which State? That is the essence of the judgment. This bil l is capable of being applied to any State. may not cover all the States. traffic between any ports of the Commonwealth that in the opinion of the Governor General is being injured or retarded, this legislation may be applied to it. with ports in all the States. applied to it , if , in the opinion of the Governor General, it was being injured or retarded. Mr Justice Isaacs repeated horse at Wodonga, the only the rule he laid . down in Barger's case. Mr Justice Higgins did the same, and Mr Justice Rich and Mr Justice Starke accepted the opinion then expressed. There was the unanimous decision of the justices. Whilst this decision refers to sections 51 and 52, reference was made by several of the judges to section 99 as similar in effect.. Here we have a unanimous decision of five judges, accepting the view T h a t is another quesof the minority judges in Barger's case, because the discrimination was upon a State basis-becaus e one thing is in one State and another is in another State. disagree with the decision of the majority in Barger's case. tliere were five judges; three decided in one way, and two in another way.

All I wish to say on that matter is that, apart from any question as to whether Parliament would be able to impose the condition that the ships should carry passengers only between ports to which the licence applies-as to which there is possible room for doubt-the application of this section depends on the Minister being satisfied that the service, as carried out by a licensed ship or ships, is adequate to the needs of such port or ports. There the criterion is the adequacy of the service to the needs of the port or ports. I understand from everything I have heard in this House on the question that this is no crying need of any port or ports. It is not a question of the adequacy of the service to the needs of Sydney, Hobart, or Melbourne. It is not a question of tbe needs of the ports at a l l ; the existing traffic is being carried. This legislation is introduced for the purpose of re-establishing a traffic that used to exist but which now no longer exists. to-day than ever. tion is the traffic that used to be carried by the large oversea vessels which are no longer engaging in this tracte.

( Mr Hughes) said that. gard it as an article of political f a i th -as some honourable members opposite apparently do-to subscribe to everything that the ex-Prime Minister has said. If there be a traffic which can be developed, and which will earn money for Tasmania and other parts of Australia, then let it be developed. If it be a sort of first class traffic, wby should we spurn it because there are people who are willing to pay higher sums than usual tor special services? The object of this proposal, as I which used to exist but is now non-existent; and it is specially intended to develop the tourist tramc. It is very difficult to bring the re-establishment of a non-existent tourist traffic under the head of "" t h e need of a port or ports."" If it were sought to provide for the passenger tourist traffic under section 286, it is for the reasons I have stated, quite doubtful whether the section would be rightly applied; but under this clause there is no doubt as to the intention of Parliament. It is a special clause providing for tourist traffic. It can be used for nothing else, and it describes the conditions under which the Minister may act under it . as to what Parliament intended under, say, the deportation legislation of last session. intention of Parliament as disclosed by the words of the legislation. analogy between the two pieces of legislation. the tourist traffic, and for the reasons I have indicated there is room for serious doubt as to whether that could be provided for under the terms of existing The traffic in queslegislation.

The Attorney-General states that in the more recent decision of the members, but, as a H i g h Courti n the Cameron case, the opinion of the two dissenting judges in the harvester case was upheld. In my opinion, they ThereI should like tentatively to The Attorneyjoin issue with the Minister. He said that the Chief Justice quoted from Mr. the Justice Isaacsi n the Barger case, and remarked, "" In that I concur."" What Mr Justice Isaacs said was that because a man was in one locality he was not to The Attorneybe treated differently from another man case, in simply on that account. The point emdiscrimination phasized by Mr Justice Isaacs and Mr. As one of Justice Higginsi n the Barger case, was that it was a breach of the Constitution to discriminate against a man because of the place in.which he lived.

I submit that if it was right, departthe contention of the Leader of the Opposition in the present instance is right, since this will clearly be a because it discriminated as case of discrimination between ports. In the Barger case, the question was one In' the Barger of discrimination between individuals only, but this bill proposes to discrimithat nate _ between ports, and that involves act was invalid for a discrimination more directly between States and parts of States. In the though not in Barger case there had been discrimination in taxation between individuals In the Excise Act according to the rates of wages they paid, between and because of that the H i g h Court held that the law was unconstitutional.

I made no endeavour to contest the learned gentleman's interpretation of the judgment; indeed I am very grateful for the light he has thrown upon a very complicated question, but I suggest that there is very grave doubt as to the effect of that judgment upon this proposed legislation. It is obvious to even the layman that the High Court could not have decided other bhan the way it did in the Cameron case. How a regulation which discriminated so definitely between States could have been made, is beyond the comprehension of any one with even a rudimentary knowledge of the Constitution.

He said that if Victoria were named in this legislation there would be discrimination, but that such discrimination would not exist if Melbourne were named as a port. I shall now leave that aspect of the matter. It may appear presumptuous in me to have entered into it, but even with the limited ability that I possess I must do my part. perplexed legally trained minds> did not gather the point which the Attorney-General made when he endeavoured to meet the argument of the Leader of the Opposition. I understood the honourable gentleman to say, "" The Leader of the Opposition argued that the provision in the bill was invalid, and, if that were so, the existing legislation was invalid. He further argued that the existing invalid legislation gave us all'the power we required; so where was the necessity to pass the bill."" of my argument; I went on to deal with section 286. in general terms as the rebuff which the honourable gentleman gave to the Leader of the Opposition, and, in fairness to the latter, re-state the case that he put forward. He emphasized his opinion that the existing legislation was invalid, and quoted the opinion of the Minister who introduced it ( Mr Massy Greene). That honourable gentleman, we may assume, spoke on tbe advice of the Government's legal advisers when he expressed a grave doubt as to its legality. The Leader of the Opposition argued that if the existing legislation was invalid, then this provision also must be invalid. But he went on to argue that if , as the Government claimed, this proposal was valid, it was not required, because the Government already possessed the power which it conferred. The case cannot be dismissed by a smart retort such as that which was made by the Attorney-General. ment, ancl then read the terms of section 286. the proposal in the bill. Honourable members representing Tasmanian constituencies claimed that this proposal would give them something they would not get if the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition were accepted. His proposal, they claimed, would provide a service between Tasmania ancl the mainland, but they wanted carriage for tbeir export trade to the London market. which was emphasized by speech and interjection by honourable members from Tasmania. for in the bill. What is in the bill? The intention, I believe, is that, in the apple season, tourists from Sydney to Hobart may travel on an unlicensed boat. Will any honourable member opposite deny that that is the intention? Not one of tbem will. In bhe apple season they want tourists to be carried by unlicensed Peninsular and Oriental boats, upon which is employed any kind of labour, under any conditions. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook) said that that would help to pay for the coal used on the journey to Hobart. go across', except m the apple season. boats now call at Hobart and take the apples away. end of February there is no apple season.

Were that not so, it would have been impossible for the north-west coast of Western Australia to reach its present condition. I agree with the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) that the time has arrived for Australia to review her position, especially in regard to the operation of the Navigation Act. I hesitate to make that suggestion, as it was my privilege to administer that act for a considerable time, but because of that experience I know that it imposes heavy burdens upon the primary producers of Australia, and upon the interstate trade of the Commonwealth. In my judgment, we shall soon have to decide whether an expensive preference is to be given indefinitely to a few shipowners and seamen at the expense of the great body of primary producers, manufacturers, and those engaged in the interstate trade. We should examine carefully the economic conditions affecting' production in Australia. We cannot for ever grant bounties to keep States and industries on their feet. A l ready this session bounties have been granted to assist several industries, and there is a prospect of more. So long as we allow unsound economic conditions to continue, we shall be compelled to grant bounties and gratuities to assist our industries. While I welcome this measure, in that it will grant a measure of relief to Tasmania, I am of the opinion that it is an attempt to circumvent the Constitution by discriminating in favour of one State. It will prove to be the thin edge of the wedge, so far as tourist traffic is concerned. legislation grants will not long be confined to Tasmania; other parts of the Commonwealth will also apply to come under its provisions, and soon the whole of the Navigation Act will necessarily have to be reviewed. I do not think that section 286 of the principal act is sufficiently wide to grant the general relief sought by this measure. That section is designed more to deal with individual boats, and I am of the opinion that licences would have to be obtained in respect of each boat applying for exemption. This bill provides for the issue of a proclamation covering the whole of the tourist traffic in the event of certain things happening. The alternative proposal of the Leader of the Opposition is impracticable. As I believe that it will afford relief to Tasmania, and to other parts of the Commonwealth, I shall support the bill. I hope that the Government will afford us an early opportunity to review the whole of the provisions of the Navigation Act. [8.13] -The people of Tasmania expect to get some relief from this measure, but in view of the fact that the whole of the shipping in Australian waters is controlled by one master mind, I cannot see that their expectations will be realized. The overseas shipping companies are controlled by Lord Inchcape. The vessels which come to Australia do so in order to make profits for.their owners; the mere fact that they are to be allowed to carry passengers to Tasmania at certain periods of the year will not affect the policy of the owners concerning them. The vessels will be diverted to Tasmania only to make greater profits.. The interstate shipping companies already cater for the Tasmanian trade. Lord Inchcape has a big interest in the Australian Slteam Navigation Company, as he has also _ in the Howard Smith Company, and in Burns, Philp and Company. The huge combine which he controls allows the interstate shipping companies to cater for the coastal trade of Australia, while its overseas vessels deal with our export trade. The Government may take credit for relieving Tasmania by assisting her industries and tourist traffic, yet the position is really in the hands of those who control overseas and interstate shipping. Therefore, despite the Government's elecThe concession wbich this tion pledge to amend the Navigation Act, no appreciable benefit will be derived by the people of Tasmania.",45,Deputy Speaker Mr Visited Tasmania There Had Been A Record

Riley (South Sydney!,"-The object of the bill is to lower the wages and destroy the conditions that are at present enjoyed by the Australian seamen. manned by Japanese and Chinese and other coolie labour will be able to engage in the passenger traffic around the Australian coast. We have to consider, not the position of Tasmania, ibut the standard of living of Australian sailors and workers. The bill is an insidious attempt by the Government to reduce our seamen's wages from £16 to £ 8 a month. It is impossible for any man in this country to live on less than £16 a month. I wish to expose to the people of Australia the Government's attempt to interfere with the White Australia policy, and I ask honourable members opposite, even if it means defeating the Government, to vote against the measure, and thus ensure for our seamen a living wage and living conditions. debates in this House we often hear a inatter treated in relation to its effect upon the interests of sections or groups of the community. Any particular section or group must be considered as the servant of the community as a whole, and we should, therefore, consider legislation in relation to its effect upon the community as a whole, and not with special regard for auy class or section. Navigation Act has for years past laid an intolerable burden upon Australia. past ? Every year has shown a further manifestation of the mischief which has been wrought in restricting the freedom of the community, and the consequent interference with free trade between the different parts of the Commonwealth. It 'has also* been evident for a long time that Tasmania has suffered a great injustice through the operation of the Navigation Act and other federal enactments. For these reasons, although not satisfied with the bill, I am prepared to support it. I agree with the remarks of the honourable members for Forrest( Mr Prowse) and Wannon( Mr Rodgers). It is time that this matter was dealt with in a more courageous and sagacious manner. bill is a tentative step towards further action. I regret that the Government, with its large majority and its clear mandate from the people, has not exercised its power to a greater extent than is now proposed. As an ordinary layman I do not know what to think about the constiUnder clause 3, foreign vessels tutionality of the bill. If it is constitutional it will at least be a step towards greater freedom, and I welcome any blow struck for the liberty of the people. But if the bill is challenged and proves to be unconstitutional, I shall not greatly care, because this w ill . be further proof that if the Government desires to give real relief from restrictive provisions, further steps will have to be taken to develop fully the trade of this country. The bill is a timid attempt tb take the first step along a road that should have been fully travelled by the Government. I regret that many honourable members opposite are prepared to interfere with the White Australia policy. I am the representative of a district a large portion of whose shipping, I regret to say, is carried on by coolie labour, so I have nothing to gain by taking up my present attitude. The time has arrived when a man must stand for the principle of White Australia. The Government has grown bold. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) urges greater boldness, and lie reminds me of the French revolutionist who said, ""Audacity, audacity; The always audacity."" While the Government has a majority, it can with impunity attack the great principle for which this party stands, but there must be a reaction. I hope that the Government will do nothing to harm a principle that is cherished by the people of Australia, and which, in the past, was supported by Kingston and other eminent men who were not members of the Labour party. The honourable member for Wannon mentioned that exemption had been granted during his term of office to several ports on the north-west coast of Western Australia. He neglected to say that the Government of Western Australia has always tried to maintain a white-labour service on the north-west coast and that one exists there to-day. The sum of £393,000 has already been expended on that service. Tasmania should have a regular shipping service.

I am afraid that the bill may bo the t h in used to break down the Navigation Act. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) is of those who financed the elections to a degree that was never known before in Australia, and they naturally I trust that the Government w i ll devise means to establish shipping communication with Tasmaniai n the way referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. wit of the Government to run between the mainland and Tasmania a few boats manned by white crews recognized as Commonwealth oflicials with public service rights, such as those that are enjoyed by omcers of the post and telegraph and similar services. If it did so we should be able to provide, as Western Australia has provided, that the men employed in the service were Australians enjoying Australian wages and conditions. One honourable member said that the racial aspect of the White Australia policy is not involved in this legislation; but the economic aspect of that policy is the more important. had to be considered, the importation of unlimited black labour would not affect it , because the labourers could be kept in compounds as they are in South Africa. on the bill because I think there is grave danger that, flushed by its victory, the Government may do something to assail a principle that is dear to the majority of the people of Australia. What honourable members on this side stand for is interstate trade controlled by Australians and giving Australian wages and conditions. That is no new principle. It has been in operation in America for 50 years. The people of the United States of America do not permit any foreign vessel to engage in their coasting trade, and they see that those engaged in it are given good wages and conditions. I am in sympathy with the claim of Tasmania that it should not suffer because of a lack of facilities for communication with the mainland: but, in my view, it would be altogether wrong to permit the Peninsular and Oriental boats, worked with lascar labour, to capture the Tasmanian support the White Australia trade with the mainland.

Honourable members opposite are fond of talking about the money which the steamship companies make; but the tourist season is the only portion of the year during which the service to Tasmania pays. Yet that is the time when strikes are declared which dislocate the service.

When I see numbers of the coloured crews of the Peninsular and Oriental liners coming ashore in Australian ports I feel sorry for the . poor I was there 35 years ago wretches. It makes me shudder to think that the majority in the national Parliament wishes to place the shipping on our coast in the hands of such seamen, thereby depriving our own k it h and k in of employment.

293,The Leader Of The Opposition ( Mr Charl,"regard to its overseas trade, let alone its interstate shipping. Hadi t not been for the Labour party's loss of office owing to circumstances connected with the late war, there would have been government control of shipping, not only between the different States, but also between Australia and the rest of the world. I predict that the political pendulum will soon swing in favour of Labour, and that the people will return to the view advocated by the most practical section of Parliament. The Labour party is prepared to act in the interests of the whole of the people, and is unwilling to check national progress. I realize that it is useless to attempt to defeat the bill, since there is a majority in the House that has no true conception of national needs. Inasmuch as the real object of the supporters of the bill is to get coloured crews into the Australian coastal shipping trade there will be little chance of amending tbe bill in committee. So long as the honourable member for Forrest( Mr dare not do otherwise. Prowse) can get 9s. a bushel for his wheat, he cares nothing for the wages and working conditions of the men employed ou the ships trading to Australian ports. The price at which he can sell his own. products is the only criterion by which he judges any question. It is a pity that there is so much selfishness among honourable members opposite; I urge them to rise above that level. It is not yet too late to withdraw this bill. Much as I desire to improve the position of Tasmania, I assure honourable members representing that State that this measure will do no good, and next year they will be again asking the Oommonwealth to help their people out of the financial morass. The establishment of a Government steamship service between the mainland and Tasmania would give confidence to tourists and traders throughout Australia. Tasmanian people to relieve their industrial, economic, and financial position. If that is refused, the only other thing I can do is to vote against this bill, which is one of the most deceitful pieces of legislation ever submitted to this Parliament. the very lucid exposition of the constitutional position by the Attorney-General and the statement by the Minister for Trade and Customs of the disabilities under which Tasmania has been suffering for. many years, there is little need to speak in justification of this bill; but as a believer in the ""White Australia ideal I cannot allow to pass without protest the remarks of honourable members of the Opposition, who apparently desire readers of Hansard and the newspapers to believe that we on this side of the House do not believe, in that principle and are prepared to support any subtle attack upon it . I strongly deprecate a great national ideal being dragged into this debate for party purposes. I remind members of the Opposition that long before the Labour party came into existence the ideal of the White Australia was a big force in Australian politics, and if I thought that it would be jeopardized in any way by this bill I would vote against the second reading. But I have not imagination evil enough to see any danger of the kind in the measure, and I intend to vote for it. the bill as an honest attempt by an honest administration to remove,, some of the great disabilities under which Tasmania has for many years suffered uncomplainingly. comparison with the magnitude of the grievance which the bill is designed to partially redress. No very great knowledge of the Tasmanian tourist traffic is necessary to enable one to realize how much that State has suffered during the last few years. During this debate there has been some reference to party funds and the wealth at the disposal of honourable members on this side of the House. So far none of that wealth has come into my hands, and I assure honourable members opposite that when I signed my elecI have offered my help to the toral papers a few days ago my campai%i expenses were well within the statutory limit. In regard to matters that are not vital planks in my party's platform, I am at liberty to vote as I choose. Every honourable member on this side is free to use bis own judgment concerning this bill, and, because I believe in the granting of this form of relief to Tasmania, I shall vote for tbe measure.

298,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [9.10].,"twelve months ago the Minister fox Trade and Customs visited Tasmania and th«re listened to representations by various sections of the community, including many men prominent in the public life of the island. I shall quote, for the information of honourable members, some extracts from the reply the Minister made to a deputation which waited upon him. I shall not tutionality of this bill, but I do know that when a court is asked to interpret a statute it takes into consideration the W it h o u t endeavouring to anticipate the decision of the judges of the H i g h Court, I believe that if the constitutionality of this measure be challenged, the judges will peruse very carefully the speeches in this House. more helpful that could f a l l into their hands than the speech delivered by the Minister for Trade and Customs when moving the second reading. It was wholly a plea for Tasmania, and do honourable members believe for a moment that the H i g h Court will allow, a Minister or a Government, by subterfuge or subtlety, to pass a measure for the making of regulations which would circumvent the constitutional prohibition against discrimination between States and parts of States? The speeches delivered by ministerial members are sufficient to prove that this bill is unconstitutional. Por my own part I would not allow a lascar crew to be employed in connection with the carriage of mails from any part of the world, especially Great Britain, to Australia. When the original mail contract was made, the Commonwealth Government line of steamers was not in existence, but with the Orient Line and the Commonwealth Line we have a sufficient number of fast steamers to convey the mails between Australia and Great Britain without having recourse to vessels that employ coloured labour. Although some honourable members opposite may demand that lascar-manned steamers shall be allowed to carry passengers from Potts Point and similar aristocratic localities to Hobart, I can hardly ' imagine the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) travelling by such vessels. There could be no finer testimonial to people to the ideal of a White Australia [is] travel by ships manned by coloured crews. Under the bill it is intended to allow those persons to travel by these boats. On the 17th November, 1924, a deputation waited upon the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten), in Hobart. It was representative of the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Manufactures, the Hobart Marine Board, and the City attempt to discuss the constiCouncil. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook) and a number of public men also were present. Replying to the representations that had been made intention of .the legislature. to him, the Minister said, inter alia He understood, Tiowjever, that the request was tliat the whole of the State of Tasmania should ibe exempt from the coastal provisions only of the Navigation Act. It must be realized that such a request must have very farI know of nothing reaching consequences. It would be a distinct departure from the national policy, of protection under which all Australian industries, including Tasmania's, were -paying approved wages and working under proper conditions, and were entitled to protection against cheap coloured labour, low wages, and unfair conditions in other parts of the! world. Those are sentiments that one would naturally expect to f a l l from the lips of a protectionist Minister for Trade and Customs, and they are similar to sentiments that have been expressed by honourable members on this side who have opposed the bill. The honourable gentleman now stands sponsor for a measure which w ill have the effect of allowing boats manned by cheap coloured labour to convey passengers from Sydney to Hobart, and to take apples from Hobart to other parts of the world. He is also reported in the following terms: He submitted that the Australian Mercantile Marine was just as much entitled to that protection as another Australian industry. The second point that had been raised in connection witli tlie request was that it would, to some extent, be tire handing over of Tasmania's trade to foreign ships, which might easily displace Australian shipping, which shipping was required to pay good wages and supply proper accommodation, and adhere to certain manning conditions and scales as laid down in the act. . . No Government could give preferential treatment against its own shipping. . . Taking Tasmania as a whole, it was found that in 1923 Tasmania had a record Vear in tourist traffic, in overseas exports, and exports to other States. These seemed to -be the only factors that could be affected by the operation of the coastal prothe adherence of our visions of the act. The State btatistician had said that before the war, when no licence was necessary, only two per cent, of tliose who than a general refusal to came to Tasmania travelled by oversea boats. . . . In 1920-21, the year before the act was in operation, 10,247 tourists visited Tasmania; in 1921-22 the number was 21,010: in 1922-23 it was 19,962,aud in 1923-24 it was 22,304, a larger number than had ever entered Tasmania previously. . . . The argument of the deputation that the tourist traffic had been influenced by tihe act does not seem to be borne out by the figures. The Minister may now attempt to refute those statements. They appear in what must have been an almost verbatim report that was published in the Hobart Mercury, of the 18th November, 1924. The honourable gentleman then showed the people of Tasmania that their trade had not depreciated. The contention' tonight and.on previous occasions has been that the trade of Tasmania has suffered very seriously, and that the tourist traffic particularly has been hard hit. The figures quoted by the Minister prove that in some of the years about which the complaints have been most bitter, there was a record in the amount of tourist, traffic. The report also quotes the Minister as having saidThe exports overseas from Tasmania in 1909 were valued at £6,554,278, or £35 per head of population. In 1922-3 its exports were valued at £17,05o,3S3. values, this trade showed a very satisfactory increase. The statement that the act had detrimentally affected Tasmania did not seem to have been borne out by the figures quoted. Thero was a lot of rivalry between ports iu Tasmania, and thc State as a whole must be the deciding factor from the National Government's stand-point. passenger service had been abandoned in 1916, the passenger support, according to evidence given, being only nominal. sorts arriving at Hobart in 1922-3 was close to the record year, and far exceeded thetonnage for 1014. The Government realized that strikes did affect Tasmania, and that shipping services were vital to the State's trade, and, taking all tlie circumstances of that into consideration, he must say, as a member of the Government, that, as far as the principles of the Navigation Act were concerned, tliose principles must stand. If Tasmania were able to make out an exceptionally strong case, showing that it had been adversely affected by the operations of the Navigation Act, he, as Minister, and the Government, would no doubt give the matter consideration; but the words I have quoted show most definitely that the Minister had his mind made up. He had been supplied by. the Director of Navigation and the Customs authorities with figures showing that the trade and the tourist traffic had not sufMr Fenton. fered, and that the Navigation Act had not operated against Tasmania in the way that the people of that State claimed that it had. I particularly want to stress the unfairness of subjecting Australian shipping, that pays Australian rates of wages and. works under Australian conditions, to the competition, of boats that are manned by black-labour crews. The Labour party is proud to have been associated with the passage of the Navigation Act. I can in memory see the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), and the late Hon. Erank Tudor, sitting on the ministerial bench night after night while the then Opposition '""-stone-walled"" many of the clauses of that bill. The Labour party then occupied the position that this Government occupies to-day; it had a large majority. Legislation relating to navigation had been held up for many years. Other ministers and other governments had desired to pass it, but it remained for the Labour Government in .1912 to place the measure upon the statute-book. The right honourable member for North Sydney knows that copies of that act were sought by Allowing for increased nearly every nation in the world. Some of the nations have taken from it many of its principles and incorporated them in their navigation acts. W.e led the world in that legislation. Now, instead of being the leaders in providing proper The Melbourne-Hobart conditions for the seamen and safety for the passengers, and thus setting an Tonnage of a ll example to the world, we propose to go back upon that splendid piece of legislation. The Government is taking a retrograde step, and I cannot imagine how many of its supporters can' vote for the bill. It is a step that I cannot sanction. I am not averse from giving Tasmania every possible assistance. While she remains a member of the federation, while she is separated from the mainland, we shall have to stand by her. The matter, however, goes more deeply than the operation of the Navigation Act. Sooner or later we shall have to consider the whole of the circumstances that operate to cause the disabilities from which Tasmania suffers. As I have said on platforms in Tasmania, and as I would say again, I am prepared to see that communication is maintained between the mainland and Tasmania. I know that in some in stances she has suffered. has suffered as the result of certain movements. Buti n this b ill Ave are presenting to her Dead Seaf r u it . realize that the b ill has been introduced in order to keep an election pledge.

House. think he realized that he was skating upon very thin ice, Avhich at any moment might break and let h i m down. responsibility, however, is with the Government and its supporters. one of the many chickens that w ill come home to roost in a few years' time. I shall vote agaiust the second reading of the bill. do not wish to prolong this debate, but as one who has spent about. £4,000 in visits to Tasmania during the last 30 years I have some knowledge of the disabilities under which that State is labouring. Excepting during the Avar years, I have ' visited Tasmania every Christmas for many years. I have been there during every strike, including the last. Regarding the constitutionality of. the bill, I fear that we are treading on th in ice. I say that as a lawyer. But in matters of this kind I am inclined to agree with the Attorney-General, because he is placed in his present position to advise the Government and the House on legal matters. He is, moreover, a man with a splendid record in legal circles in Australia. Something ought to be done, for Tasmania. Most of her young men on attaining the age of 23 or 24 years leave for the large cities of Melbourne and Sydney. short of man power, notwithstanding her great hydro-electric Avorks and other natural resources. straitened circumstances financially. strange anomaly exists regarding her tourist traffic. When1 was a member of the Hughes Government, I visited Hobart to make arrangements for the accommodation of the then Prime Minister, his family, and staff. I could not find any, and but for Mr Hadley, of Hadley's Hotel, Mr Hughes would have had to sleep in the Hobart Domain. That week a deputation waited upon him to request Every State that he should do something for the Tasmanian tourist traffic. T remember his reply, in which he asked hoAvi t could be I said that the Navigation Act had interfered with Tasmania's tourist traffic while their boarding-houses and hotels Avere so the Attorney-General( Mrf u l l that he, the Prime Minister, could not get accommodation.' The same thing is true to-day. It is exceedingly difficult to obtain accommodation anywhere in Tasmania. I always make my arrangeT ments six months in advance, and I know that I pay considerably more for accommodation than it is worth. On The the other hand, there is no question that wealthy tourists w ill not go to TasThis is mania, because they cannot make their arrangements with the shipping companies sufficiently far ahead. Tasmania, in consequence, loses thousands of pounds every year. If more tourists are to visit Tasmania, more accommodation will have I to be found for them. I am not certainthat this bill will assist Tasmania during the months of December, January, and .February, when the tourist traffic is at its height, as I understand from the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) that the apple export trade does not commence until about the end of February. The tourist traffic begins with the commencement of the school vacation, about the 16th December, when numbers of people with their children leave to spend their holidays in the island State. The large mail steamers will not visit Tasmania merely for the tourist traffic, as the revenue to be derived from that source would not be sufficient to pay for the coal consumed in their furnaces: Nevertheless, I am willing to give this legislation a trial, as I desire to render Tasmania what assistance is possible. Tasmania is the true health resort of the Pacific, but enough is not done in the way of Tasmania, consequently, is propaganda. I have travelled round the world ten times, and have visited nearly every country; but nowhere abroad She is also in have I seen literature advertising TasA mania as a health and pleasure resort. Much more could be done in this direction, and Hobarti n time ought to become a second Cannes or Monaco: Notwithstanding the view that I have expressed regarding the constitutional aspect of this legislation I am prepared to vote for the b ill .

300,Mr Pratten (Martin,"Minister f o revery member who has spoken has favoured something being done for Tasmania; any difference of opinion has been as to how and when that should be done. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr tion' is different from any other State of the Charlton) said that he would assist Tasmania by running a service of Government vessels, backed with Government money. The principles in which members on this side believe in this connection are diametrically opposed to those favoured by honourable members opposite. We on this side hold that a government's duty is to govern, and not to trade. We believe, also, that past experience in connection with government owned boats in Australia, including those of Shipping Line, is sumcient to show that it would be unwise to interfere with the existing services mania. The Commonwealth Government ShippingL in e ' has already cost the country some millions of pounds. The line of steamers run by the Tasmanian Government cost that State £30,869 in 1921-22, and £50,913 in 1922-23. Those figures are taken from the Tasmanian Government Gazette of 8th July, 1924. In the Hobart Mercury of 6th September, 1924, the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Lyons, is reported to have stated that the total loses on those vessels amour ted to approximately £100,000. should read the speech which he made at Hobart. which waited upon me in Hobart, to which the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Penton) referred, asked for the suspension of the whole of the provisions of the Navigation Act so far as Tasmania was concerned. No responsible Minister could have replied to that request other than as I did. On that occasion I also saidI'want to say, further, if nnd when any of the conditions within the ambit of the act arises, or arc likely to arise, I agree on behalf of the Commonwealth, that if satisfactory evidence is tendered, special sympathy will be given to Tasmania owing to her isolated geographical position, and, if possible, action of a practical nature will be taken to help ease you of any traffic disability within the scope of government functions. I kept that promise by running "" the Nairana last year between Melbourne and Launceston when the ordinary service was entirely dislocated. I also told the deputationI will, endeavour to remember, in administering this law, that your geographical posiCommonwealth. I cannot break the law, but if occasions arise where some relief is absolutely necessary to Tasmania, you will have my sympathy and actual practical support. I am here in charge of this bill to give that practical support which I then promised. Further, I remind the House that the Government was returned with a mandate from the people. The Prime Minister, in his policy speech, saidTo overcome one of the handicaps suffered by Tasmania as a result of its geographical the Commonwealth Government position, the Government proposes to introduce legislation which will permit overseas vessels to engage in the tourist traffic during the periods when that traffic is not adequately to Tasprovided for. The people of Australia have endorsed the policy enunciated by the Prime Minister, and this bill has been introduced to give effect to it . Regarding the bill itself, considerable misconception exists, and many exaggerated statements have been made. It has nothing to do with the maintenance of a White Australia; it deals with tourist traffic only. Before issuing a proclamation under this legislation, the Government will satisfy itself that a tourist traffic-did, or does, exist between certain definite ports, and that it is being injured or retarded. Theb ill does not necessarily mean t h a t the Government w ill not impose, conditions w i th resard to this tourist traffic. To show the The deputation absurdity of some of the exaggerations uttered this afternoon I may point out that of 37 vessels, booked to call at Hobart for cargo during the apple season, 30 are manned by British white crews, and the other seven are steamers of the Peninsular and Oriental Line. I do not propose to traverse the points that have been raised in regard to the constitutionality of the b ill , but I shall repeat what was actually said by me in this regard when I was moving the second reading. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) interjectedBnt the effect will be that tourists going to any other States can travel on these overseas boats.

My reply wasThat is so; but the circumstances must be equal before it is applied to them. amendment will give relief to Tasmania to tlie extent that tbe limitations of tbe Constitution will allow. At the same time, it will create no discrimination against, nor do injustice to, any State to which it does not apply. It will particularly apply to Tasmania, because tbe bona fide tourist traffic for which it proGibson, W. G. vides is of very much greater value to that State than it is to any other. From the evidence before me as to what has taken place, particularly during the last two years, I have no hesitation in saying that if the Navigation A ct is eventually to become a dead letter, the fault w ill lie at the door of the seamen themselves because of their actions during the last year or two. The seamen w i ll have to review the position very carefully. Already there is 70,000 tons less passenger shipping on the coast of Australia than there was in 1914, and there were 10,000 tons less in the period 1924-5 than in the period 1923-4. We have seen the sales of the Aroywatta, the Aramac, the Wodonga, and the Wyandra, totalling over 10,000 tons. These vessels have been withdrawn from the coast, and have not been replaced. We have also seen recently that the Monaro, another vessel, has been sold. Altogether the .Australian passenger coastal shipping is getting into a very bad condition. MrA . GREEN -Thos e boats are all obsolete. not obsolete. . I have shown the position. Those who say that the present Government is tryin g to undermine the Navigation Act should look nearer home, and consider where we are d r if t in g and what is happening, on our coast. hope that the House will accept the bill as a bona fide attempt to help Tasmania, while at the same time it does not in any shape or form conflict -with our White Australia ideal.

One point was emphasized by the Minister that strengthens the case for this amendment. He said, in reply to statements from this side of the House, that a lot of exaggeration had beenindulged in regarding black crews trading between one State and another, and that out of 37 boats booked to call at Tasmania 30 were manned by white crews. If that is so, preference should be given to those white crews'. Clause 3, althoughnot infringing the White Australia policy from the viewpoint of racial purity, does infringe it from an economic point of view, by allowing men receiving from £ 2 to £ 3 a month to compete with qur seamen who work under Australian conditions. probably the biggest act on the 'statute book of Australia, provides that all Australian boats in the coastal trade must be manned by white crews working under white men's conditions. I ' admit that this bill does violate that principle. Surely there are sumcient oversea vessels employing white crews to take tourists to or apples from'Tasmania. I trust that the Minister will accept the amendment, and that the committee w ill carry it unanimously; otherwise we shall force it to a division. [10.2] I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), and I hope that the Minister will accept it . It is in accordance with the sentiment of the majority, not only of honourable members, but also of the people of Australia. We propose to make in the Navigation Act a very important alteration, which is vital to the economic interests of the shipping industry of Australia, and in doing so we should adhere strictly to the great basic principle of White Australia. There is really no serious obstacle to the acceptance of the amendment.

There is a consensus of opinion among honourable members that if we permit boats to trade with Tasmania they should be manned by white labour. I m mediately the honourable member for Yarra gave expression to his views, and was supported by the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson), the Minister rose in his place and cracked the whip. He stated that it was impossible to ajccelpt the amendment because this legislation, when passed, would need the royal assent. We already have the royal assent to the Navigation Act. The Minister is using a subterfuge to obtain the support of honourable members sitting behind the Government. Honourable members who desire that only ships carrying white crews should be licensed The Navigation Act, which is should support the amendment. The Minister himself, only a few minutes ago, stated that out of 37 boats likely to trade with Tasmania during the next, few months, 30 carry white crews. That being so, why is there any objection to the amendment? those 37 vessels are cargo boats. member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook) is evidently in favour of black labour. It is a pity that he did not supply that in formation when the Minister was speaking. It would certainly be an advantage to Tasmaniai f only boats manned by white labour were allowed to trade there. We should stand four square for the White Australia policy, and not interfere with it by encouraging vessels manned by black crews to trade on the Australian coast.

The outlook for Australia, therefore, is improving. We now have larger ships thau have been in the trade for many years. harmless, and it is necessary that it should be passed in order to ensure that a licence w ill be given only to those ships' that employ ouly white labour. labour is allowed to be employed on ships trading ou the coast, the ultimate effect may ' be to break down the White Australia policy. The economic effect must be felt, notwithstanding that we do not permit these black people to reside in Australia. The competition of black men with white men can only result in lowering the conditions for the white men. If we permit this in the case of seamen, no one can say for certain that it wil l end there. It is the thin end of a wedge that is being driven into the White Australia policy. amendment ought to be accepted. A f t e r tbe stand the Minister has taken, honourable members should use their own judgment. They should show him that they are prepared to assert themselves by voting in accordance with their consciences. The honourable member for Angas( Mr Parsons) believes in a White Australia. Is there any objection to him voting for the amendment, in order to give effect to the ideal he was espousing half an hour ago ? The Minister ought not to put this pressure on young members as soon as they come here. w it h a b ill involving a vital prin ciple, the Government is justified in demanding the support of its f o llowers; but when a b ill is in committee, and we are endeavouring to i m prove it , the collective wisdom of the committee should be used in the best in terests of the people of the Commonwealth. That cannot be done if honourable members opposite are like dumb, driven cattle, and allow fhe Minister to bludgeon them into submission. The amendment has a right to be dealt with on its merits. If there are honourable members who think that only boats obsolete vessels and manned by white crews should go to Tasof no use to their mania, they should vote for the amendThree or four months ago, ment. Leti t not be said that honourable members were browbeaten by the Minister, and voted against their consciences. MrW . M . HUGHES ( No r t h Sydney) [10.14] I did not take part in the debate on the motionfor the second reading of the b ill because there were so many points involved-som e of them of vitalimportance-and it appeared to me that no useful purpose would be served by This amendment is attempting to dive too deeply into the somewhat disturbed waters. Therefore, although one or two observations were 'then made that interested me greatly, I If black refrained from offering any opinion of my own. We are now, however, confronted with a situation of such significance that I am compelled to consider my position. The amendment of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) provides, in effect, that the vessels to which permits may be given under the bill shall be manned by white crews. We have it from the Minister that 37 overseas vessels are available for the Tasmanian trade, 30 of which are manned by white labour, and the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook) I , therefore, submit that the tells us that sixteen of them, or ""thereabouts, are cargo vessels. As has been stated more than once tonight, I was responsible for the principal act. I was, indeed, the chairman of the Royal Commission on Navigation, and I literally spent years in obtaining the in formation on which the bill was framed, and in piloting the measure through this House. I was delighted to hear the honourable member for New England( Mr. Thompson) describe the measure as a great act, embodying one of the v it a l principles of our national policy. Like When dealing other great principles in operation, it sometimes inflicts hardship. We are dealing w i th such a case in this b ill . But the honourable gentleman was right in saying that if the hardship is one that cannot be borne, we ought to apply the remedy in such a way as not to involve the violation of vital principles in which we believe. In the case before us this can be done. The remedy to our hand can be applied in such a way as to give relief, and yet not violate a great principle. The Minister's declaration that, if we accept the amendment, the royal assent to the bill will be withheld, is not or not, but I should be most surconvincing. experience in making recommendations to the Governor General in regard to assenting to measures passed by this Parliament. Technically, there are one or two classes of bills which are reserved for the royal assent; that is to say, they are referred to the Colonial Office, His Majesty the King in this, as in all other matters, folio wing the advice of his Ministers in London. But, although to say it may perhaps appear heresy, I do not believe that any bill need now be reserved for the royal assent. assume, however, that this bill was reserved for the royal assent. It is of such insignificance, compared with the great measure which it amends, that it would be foolish to imagine that it would cause the Colonial Office a moment's concern. I do not believe that the royal assent would be delayed for a day. contrary, Mr Amery would tell the Governor General, as he told the Governor pf the State of New South Wales, "" You must follow the advice of your Minister*."" As Governors of New South Wales have found to their cost, it does not pay to do anything else. I ask the Minister to consider the position in which he places honourable members like myself. I and my dead friends, the late Mr Tudor and the late Senator R. Guthrie,' are responsible for the passing of the Navigation Act. So far as the bill is a measure of relief for Tasmania, I support it wholeheartedly. Yet when confronted with an amendment for the helping of Tasmania by granting licences to vessels manned by white labour, the Minister declines to accept it, because its acceptance would place the Crown in a most awkward position. That argument does not impress me. I honestly think that if the. Minister is obdurate, 3ome way will have to be found to enable us to show that, whilst we are in favour of giving relief to Tasmania, we are not in favour of grantin? licences to boats manned by black labour. The Minister has said that the owners of certain vessels have expressed their willingness that those vessels should call at Tasmania. When I was in office, those who controlled our coastal shipping in the main worked in amicable arrangeMT. W. M. Hughes. ment with the British shipping combine. The conditions may have altered. I do not know whether they have I have had considerable nrised, to learn that the deep sea companies'I speak, of course, of the owners of passenger ships, and not of those outside the combination-ar e prepared to intrude upon the business of the coastal shipping companies. That, of course, has nothing to do with the Minister who says that he is going to do his best to help Tasmania. The Government has made that pledge and is going to try to carry it out. We are trying to help them. Honourable members on the other side have put forward a Let us counter suggestion for the running of a government steamship service. I have nothing to say about that, because it is unnecessary that anything should be said about it ; it speaks for itself. I started a government steamship service, and I think there have been more strikes in connection with it than' in connection with On the any service conducted by private employers in this country.
