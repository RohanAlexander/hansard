Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the'House of Representatives assembledThe humble Petition of the undersigned, all being of or above the age of 18 years as follows: (1) Your Petitioners oppose and seek the deletion of those provisions of the Family Law Bill 1974 which supplant the retrievable break-down, whichremoveany consideration of fault, and which will weaken the family unit while causing more widespread injustice because: (a) it imposes on society a radical alteradon of divorce law far beyond identifiable requirements or desires; (b) it lowers the status of marriage by permitting people to ""drift"" into divorce, reduces parental importance and leads to increasing institutionalisation of children with consequential delinquency; (c) it will not reduce the ""in-fighting"" in a divorce suit which mainly occurs over matters of property and custody; (d) it will not encourage maturity in acceptance of marital and parental obligations and responsibilities. (2) Your Petitioners commend the divorce legislation introduced in Great Britain in 1973, which acknowledges the importance of the family unit, mirrors community establishes a realistic definition of irretrievable breakdown and call for similar legislation to be provided in Australia.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respecfully showeth: That the mathematician Leonid Plyushch has been incarcerated since January 1972, for his civilrightsactivities in the Soviet Union. That he was tried in his absence in a Kiev court for antiSoviet activities. That, despite lack of any evidence of mental incapacity, he is being held in the special psychiatric hospital at Dnepropetrovsk reserved for the most violent cases. That he is being heavily drugged and being denied independent medical assistance. That his circumstances are described more fully in the Paris newspaper, le Monde, of 28 December 1974.

Australian Government Insurance Office To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble Petition of the undersigned employees and agents of the Australian insurance industry respectfully showeth: (1) That Parliament shouldrejectthe Bill currently before it to establish an Australian Government Insurance Office. (2) That while there is a need to establish in Australia a Natural Disaster Fund to provide compensation for property damage and other losses resulting from disasters such as earthquakes, floods and cyclones, such a Fund can be established, as in other countries, using the medium of the existing private enterprise insurance offices. (3) That a plan for such a Fund was submitted to the Treasury in October 1974. (4) That no sound reasons for the establishment of an Australian Government Insurance Office (other than the desire to provide non-commercial disaster insurance and Australian Government competition with private enterprise) have been given by the Government. (5) That there is already intense competition between the existing 45 life assurance offices and between over 260 general insurance companies now operating in Australia, and that further competition from a Government Office would only be harmful at this time. (6) That the insurance industry is already coping with (a) the effects of inflation, (b) increased taxation on life assurance offices, (c) the effects of recent natural disasters, (d) other legislative measures already in train or in prospect by the Government, e.g. the National Compensation Bill, a National Superannuation Plan and improved Commonwealth Public Service Superannuation. (7) That as taxpayers your petitioners are greatly concerned at the huge costs (far more than the $2 million initial capital and loan funds which it is proposed will be allocated) of establishing an Australian Government Insurance Office. (8) That as employees and agents of existing insurance offices your petitioners fear for their jobs and their future prospects if the Parliament proceeds with the legislation. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will reject the Bill. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr King. Petition received. Australian Government Insurance Office To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the establishment of an Australian Government Insurance Office will: 1. Cause the loss ofjobs and future prospects of employees and agents of the private insurance industry throughout Australia. 2. Compete unfairly with private insurers. 3. Require large taxation subsidies for a lengthy period. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representativesrejectscompletely the Australian Government Insurance Office Bill 1975. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Anthony. Petition received. Taxation: Education Expenses To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the reduction of the allowable deduction of education expenses under Section 823 of the Income Tax assessment Act from $400 to $150 is $50.00 below the 1956-57 figure. That this reduction will impose hardships on many parents who have children attending school, whether nongovernment or government; and particularly on parents with more than one child at school. That this reduction will further restrict the freedom availbeen given to date by the Australian Government, be sent as able to parents to make a choice of school for their children. That some parents who have chosen to send their children to a non-government school will have to withdraw their children and send them to government schools already overcrowded and under-staffed. That the parents to benefit most relatively from educational income tax deductions, in tbe past and even more in the future, are the parents of children in government schools and this has a divisive effect in the Australian community. That parents should be encouraged by the Australian government to exercise freedom of choice of the type of school they wish for their children. The proposed reduction means an additional financial penalty is imposed on parents who try to exercise this choice and discourages them from making an important financial contribution to Australian educauon over and above what they contribute through taxation. That an alternative system, a tax rebate system, could be adopted as being more equitable for all parents with children at school. To compensate for the losses that will follow from the proposed reduction and to help meet escalating educational costs faced by all families your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of RepresentaUves in Parliament assembled should take immediate steps to restore educational benefits to parents, at least at the 1973-74 level either by increasing taxation deductions or through taxation rebates. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Garrick. Petition received.

The humble all whaling licences issued by the Australian Government petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of and to reimpose a total ban on the importation of all whale Australia respectfully showeth: That the Family Law Bill 1974 would be an unjust law if passed since the innocent party could be divorced against his or her will after a year's separation. That the Bill does not only facilitiate divorces but changes the nature of marriage and the husband-wife relationship. Legislation ought to reflect public opinion, not attempt to condition it.

Therefore Parliament has no mandate from the people to ask such Minister)I inform the House that the Minister a far reaching change in the nature of our society.

The Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) has misled ous. The Prime Minister's deception has been this Parliament and the people of Australia. This aiding and abetting communist North Vietnam debate centres on this issue and this issue alone. I and the Provisional Revolutionary Government have no doubt that the Prime Minister will try his in their war against the South. To do this he was desperate best to confuse and diffuse the issue prepared to betray the interests and the welland that he will seek refuge in the gag and past being of hundreds of South Vietnamese refugees. history, in hair-splitting semantics and in other He personally delayed action for 3 weeks, diversionary tactics.

There are the cables which he said were is shamed and embarrassed by the prospect of substantially the same and which he sought to hide from the Australian Parliament and people. The cables are not substantially the same; they are substantially different. To claim otherwise is blatant evasion. It is untrue. There were the 13 March letters leaked by the Prime Minister's Department against the Prime Minister's own alleged principle of keeping communications between governments secret. They were meant to explain away the difference in the cables. In fact they confirm the substantial difference. There is the letter of the Deputy Prime Minister, Dr. J. F. Cairns, addressed to the North Vietnamese Charge d'Affaires in reply to a letter on 10 January from the North Vietnamese. This letter proves that the Australian Government had already accepted North Vietnam's abrogation of the Paris Peace Agreements fully 2 months before it called on South Vietnam to obey them. There is a departmental document dated 30 January 1975 which is an accurate record of the performance of North and South Vietnam and cerning their adherence to the Paris Agreements. That document, in many ways, is more damaging than the letters and the cable. It shows that the North Vietnamese violations of the Paris Accords were much more serious than those of the South. It shows that the Prime Minister was prepared to ignore official evidence, the advice of his own Foreign Affairs Department, in the process of misleading the Australian Parliament and of supporting the cause of North Vietnam.

15,Mr Malcolm Fraser (Wannon,"some thousands of South Vietnamese refugees making their own way to our shores. Then, after having long refused to refer the matter to the United Nations, he said: 'So long as other countries are involved Australia will be too'. What compassion, what humanitarianism from this Prime Minister! What about the Vietnamese abandoned in Saigon, those who had close ties with Australians and who most deserved our help? They were victims of the Prime Minister's politically motivated procrastination. They were rejected because to help them would have meant loss of face with Hanoi. The fact that the Prime Minister was prepared to support North Vietnam and betray South Vietnamese refugees is, however, incidental to the central charge against him-the charge of deception of this Parliament and the Australian people. We are concerned with deceit and duplicity that will have far reaching implications for the Prime Minister's reputation in Australia and for his dealing with other countries. The Opposition does not condemnflexibilityand pragmatism in foreign affairs nor does it condemn proper relations with countries holding to different ideological beliefs. We do not wish to tear up the recognition agreement with China, with North Vietnam and with North Korea. But we do condemn deceit and double deahng. Smoke screens such as the history of Vietnam cannot and will not be allowed to obscure the indictment of the Prime Minister. Let me now come to the evidence of the cables. In his cable dated 2 April to Hanoi the Prime Minister, who was Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs at thetime,said: We would genuinely like to see in Saigon a government against the South. which will genuinely negotiate for reunification as provided for in the Paris agreements. We appreciate that Thieu has given no indications that he he would be urging the Thieu Government to is willing to do that, and the Australian Government understands the sense of frustration which has given rise to renewed recourse to military pressure on Thieu although it cannot condone that recourse. Let me examine the implications of those words. The Prime Minister was thereby condemning the Saigon Government and placing the blame on it for failure to negotiate and to abide by the Paris Agreements. By implication, the Prime Minister was saying that blame should not be attached to Hanoi or to the Provisional Revolutionary Government; rather, the Australian Government 'understands the sense of frustration'. The Prime Minister went on to offer the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam some public relations advice. He said: . . . the Australian Government believes it would have a most favourable effect if the PRG were to make it clear that recent military operations had had the aim of applying pressure to secure the observance of the ignored political provisions of the Paris agreement and that the operations would cease when satisfactory assurances were offeredThat was gratuitous advice indeed when it was the PRG which had in fact broken off talks on 2 grounds, both of which were contrary to the Paris Agreements. The PRG had broken off the talks earlier during 1974 and refused to resume until President Thieu resigned and until American aid to South Vietnam had ceased. We know what would have happened if President Thieu had resigned. If a concession had been made a further demand would have been the result. Our Prime Minister offered public relations advice to the Provisional Revolutionary Government on how it could explain to the world and justify its rnilitary operations. Was the Prime Minister thereby hoping that he would find it easier to explain to the Australian people his own underhand support for communist North Vietnam? This infamous cable to North Vietnam continued with the Prime Minister saying that his Government would urge on the Thieu Government 'the necessity of carrying out in good faith the provisions of chapter 4 of the Paris agreements especially article 12 on the National Council'. As it was the Provisional Revolutionary Government that had broken off discussions concerning the establishment of the National Council of Reconciliation and Concord the Prime Minister ought to have addressed that remark to North Vietnam and the PRG and ought not to have made it a point of criticism He went on to say in the same paragraph that implement chapter 5 on reunification. That is the chapter which indicates that reunification should be carried out step by step by peaceful means on the basis of discussions and agreements. Why was that point not pressed on North Vietnam and the PRG, whose forces had been increased from 145 000 to 400 000 during the period of the agreement? Whose country was under attack? The Prime Minister's own Foreign Affairs Department condemned North Vietnam in relation to these developments. The main point to be made about this cable is its understanding and real sympathy for the North and its emphasis on criticism of the Thieu Government. Those criticisms should much more appropriately have been directed to North Vietnam and the PRG, but they were not made against North Vietnam or the PRG. The cable shows the Prime Minister's partisan leanings and his personal and secret support of the communist North. The Prime Minister's apologists have tried to muddy the waters by making an issue of the fact that his Hanoi cable had instructed the ambassador to make representations as soon as possible to the DRV and the PRG, while the Saigon cable said: We wish you to take every opportunity in discussion with members of the Government of South Vietnam to explain earlier: the Government's position. The Prime Minister's apologists have tried to interpret this as implying that the Prime Minister was taking a stronger line with the North than with the South. What a farcical excuse. The Prime Minister wanted immediate representations made to North Vietnam because he wanted the Australian Government's sympathy to be made more fully evident in Hanoi at the earliest possible moment. Let me come to the cable to the South and see what our even-handed Prime Minister said. That cable was curt and abrupt. It stated: All parties in Vietnam will resume working together. A prime requirement is for the South Vietnamese to carry out in good faith the provisions of chapter 4 of the Paris Agreements especially article 12 on the national council for Reconthe cables, a proper analysis of those letters reinciliation and Concord and chapter 5 on the reunification. It was North Vietnam and the PRG that were in breach on these 2 points. The Prime Minister had become a master at double-dealing and blaming the wrong party. The Prime Minister also said that our Ambassador in South Vietnam should take every opportunity to make the Australian position known to South Vietnamese not members of the government. In other words, he was attempting to foster circumstances in which the South would be undermined. If the Prime Minister had come into ciliation the open and expressed these views openly, thus Government will observe Article7 of the Agreement conmaking public his support for North Vietnam, cerning the piece for piece replacement of armaments, muthe whole matter could have been debated on its nitions and war materials. merits. But he chose not to do it that way. He It was North Vietnam and the PRG which were knows full well that Australians would not have principally responsible for the cessation of dissupported his attitude and would have concussions concerning the establishment of the demned any government that publicly took that National Council of Reconciliation and Conpro-communist, double-dealing stance. So he cord. Article7 of the Agreement concerns the sought to do it by deceit and by subterfuge.

The Prime Minishe said that the communications were substanter would have known, if he had read his own tially the same, knowing that they were substan-Foreign Affairs Department briefing, that betially different. Some of his apologists have cause of congressional cuts in United States aid, argued-on e can assume only in panic-that by South Vietnam was provided with much less 'communications' the Prime Minister meant all than piece for piece replacement. Let me emphathe communications between Hanoi, Saigon and sise that it was the PRG that had broken off talks. Australia. It was perfectly plain in the context of Further, the Northern armies, the PRG armies, the charges made by the shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs that the question referred to the cables and the cables alone. It was plain in the context of the debate that the cables were at issue. The Prime Minister knew this full well. Even he cannot avoid that. The Prime Minister protested that it was in breach of high international principles to release communications between governments. He went on to say, in answer to a question I had asked There is no truth whatsoever in the allegations that the honourable member for Kooyong has made. He has even purported to quote from the cable. Those words 'he has even purported to quote from the cable' are contained in the Prime Minister's answer. He went on to say: The quotation which he purports to make is inaccurate. The communications I sent to Hanoi and Saigon were substantially the same. The Prime Minister, who presumably saw the cables as Acting Foreign Minister before they were dispatched, knew that they were substantially different. Let me turn now to deal with the diplomatic letters of 11 March. Far from exonerating the Prime Minister, far from providing a balance for the bias so plainly evident in forces the bias and reinforces the hidden support that the Prime Minister was giving to the North. This aspect is all the more serious because on 13 March the order for the withdrawal of northern forces had not yet been given by President Thieu. There were many people still hoping that South Vietnam could maintain its independence and viability. The letter to South Vietnam has a key additional paragraph which alters the whole tone of that letter. That letter states: I trust your Government will take early and positive steps towards the establishment of the National Council of Reconand ConcordI also trust your had expanded greatly in size. They had been rearmed with modern and effective Russian weapons on a much greater than one for one basis. Australia was well aware of the huge build-up in Communist forces. If the Prime Minister were even handed, these points would have been covered in the letter to North Vietnam. Why were they excluded? It was not clear on 13 March that the North was going to win. There was fierce fighting, but no rout of Southern forces. Why was the Prime Minister at that stage seeking to put additional pressure on the Thieu Government? I suggest that it was because, much earlier than this, the Prime Minister had made up his mind that he wanted North Vietnam to win and he wished to offer what moral support he could. One ironic aspect of the affair is that, although mentsofquite the Prime Minister fawned on North Vietnam, Vietnam. Didspecifically he appears to have won few marks from those he matters in his mind whenMinister sought to cultivate. On6 April our Ambassador ment on 9 April and said that the cables in Hanoi had a meeting with North Vietnamese substantially the same?

Nowhere in his it a sympathetic eye and ear.

These2 United States. Coupled with the 30 per cent cut demands were both contrary to the Paris Agreements. The Paris Agreements said nothing about the resignation of President Thieu. The Paris Agreements specifically allowed for continued United States support. Here was the Deputy Prime Minister supporting a proposal, which was, in itself, in breach of the Paris Agreements, in the interests of North Vietnam and the PRG and against the interests of the South. There has been a constant thread linking the Prime Minister's cables and letter and the letter of the Deputy Prime Minister. The Paris Agreements, in their strict terms, are pressed strongly on South Vietnam. The breaches of the Paris Agreements by North Vietnam and the PRG are largely ignored. The Government, through the Deputy Prime Minister, has put itself in a position supporting breaches of the Paris Agreein the interests of North the Prime he have all these deceived the Parliawere Let us now consider the Foreign Affairs docutralian Department of Foreign Affairs.

I nist forces were believed to have enough equipment in South Vietnam to maintain an all-out in American military and economic aid, and the resultant shortages in fuel and ammunition, they had been forced to make economies in army activity and in air and artillery support. The document says that neither side had been blameless in violating the provisions of the Agreements but in the ceasefire aspect the head of the Canadian contingent on the International Commission of Control and Supervision laid almost all the blame for ceasefire violations on the North Vietnamese and the PRG forces. The document says that talks between South Vietnam and the PRG aimed at establishing the National Council for Reconciliation and Concord, whose main task would have been to organise elections in South Vietnam, had broken down. It points out that it was the PRG supported by North Vietnam which had refused to resume the peace talks in either Paris or Saigon until Thieu had been removed and American aid withdrawn. These are the very points that the Deputy table or even to show privately to the Leader of the OppoPrime Minister supported.

In the process, he deceived the Parliament. Members of both sides of the House know from regular experience that the Prime Minister has little respect for the institution of Parliament. I think this is a point which has been borne out in particular by this debate and by the allegation being made against the Prime Minister. A Prime Minister must set an example and he, above all, should observe the truth with absolute scrupulousness. What about public reaction? Let me take just a sample of the commentaries from around Australia. Creighton Burns, in the Melbourne 'Age', said on 30 April: It is time the Prime Minister did some straight talking on Vietnam and for the sake of his Government as well as his own reputation, he'd better have some good answers. The Melbourne 'Age' in its editorial on 29 April said: These cables which the Government adamantly refused to and hypocrisy in the Government's attitude to the 2 More than that, they provide striking evidence that the Prime Minister deceived, and we would put it no made by the Opposition spokesman on Foreign Affairs, We need to acknowledge the consequences of the Prime Minister's duplicity and deceit. We know what it has done to his reputation at home. atimeof great domestic stress, with loss of confidence, continuing high and tragic and rampant inflation, the Minister has destroyed his credibility. This has occurred when Australia needs forthright, and responsible governmenttoday. What are the consequences further afield? The champion of the Communist cause in North Vietnam is the same man who in Washington last Friday described America as 'the world's last and best hope'. What hypocrisy from a man whose Government's actions and policies have helped push the United States along the road to isolationism. The Prime Minister has impugned the reputation of Australia. That cannot be repaired while he remains in office. The Prime Minister has been exposed as a man lacking in compassion, lacking in concern for people whose lives are in jeopardy, lacking in principle, and fully prepared to mislead and deceive this Parliament. The Government's numbers presumably will lead to an inevitable conclusion of this debate unless some members of the Labor Party find the courage of earlier days. But whatever the tally of the votes, the record cannot be expunged. The words of this debate will leave the Prime Minister condemned. We can expect much subterfuge and selfjustification but that will not alter the facts. The cables which go to any overseas post. The purPrime Minister has been devious. He has been mendacious. He has destroyed his own reputation. The Parliament will not lose sight of the duambassadors to reinforce the views expressed in plicity of this Prime Minister. Mr AnthonyI second the motion. (2.48)-On 30 April the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) demanded that I return immediately from the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Jamaica, reassemble the Parliament and answer his trumpery allegations that I had misled this House. Let me compliment him on his exquisite courtesy, his statesmanlike language repeated and embellished again today, his refined patriotism and, in particular, his sense of proportion, his perspective in great affairs and, above all, his perfect timing. He made this demand 10 years and one day after Sir Robert Menzies announced Australia's military commitment to the regime in Saigon. Saigon had just surrendered. The 30 years' civil war in Vietnam had ended.

I was scheduled to see the President of the United States of America, the Secretary of State, leaders of Congress-both Houses, both parties. But the Leader of the Opno objection, leave is granted. position, responding in exactly the same way as the Leader he deposed always did to the latest headline, the last newspaper editorial, wanted me to abandon my responsibilities for an exercise in semantics. I acknowledge that an allegation of deliberately misleading the House is serious if it can be sustained. But this particular allegation-no t just flimsy but absolutely false-coul d not be sustained for a minute; the minute it would take for anybody-the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Peacock) or the leader writers of the 'Age' and the 'Sydney Morning Herald' whom the Leader of the Opposition has just quoted-to read the record, the record then available. The charge-that of deliberately misleading the House-is based on the publication of 2 cables sent by the Department of Foreign Affairs on 2 April to our Ambassadors in Hanoi and Saigon. These are so-called secret cables. They sound so much more sinister if they are described as secret. They are no more secret than any other pose of these cables-as they both specifically state in their paragraphs-wa s was to request our the Prime Minister's letter of 13 March. The letters of 13 March referred to were communications, Government to Government. The cables of 2 April embodied departmental instructions on how the Government believed those letters should be followed up in oral representations. It is a well established and desirable practice that such communications should not be published. The circumstances surrounding the disclosure of these documents and the extraordinary charges arising from their publication make it necessary that in this case I depart from that practice. Accordingly, I ask leave to have incorporated in Hansard, firstly, my letter of 13 March 1975 to His Excellency Nguyen Van Thieu, then President of the Republic of Vietnam; secondly, my letter of the same date to His Excellency Nguyen Duy Trinh, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; thirdly, a cable dated 2 April from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Australian Ambassador in Saigon, Mr Price, entitled 'VietAffairs to the Australian Ambassador in Hanoi, Mr Wilson, entitled 'Vietnam Representations'.

18,Mr Speaker,"Is leave granted? There beingYour Excellency, I have the honour to reply to Your Excellency's letter of 25 January 1975 concerning the situation in Viet-Nam, and the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Although the Australian Government was not one of the signatories to the Paris Agreement, we have consistently supported its implementation and have looked to all of the parties to the Paris Agreement to abide by its terms and to ensure that another opportunity to achieve an enduring peace in Viet-Nam is not lost. Unfortunately, Australia's hopes have not been realised. There has been continued lack of progress in the implementation of both the political and military provisions of the Paris Agreement, now more than two years old, and continued fighting in South-Vietnam. The responsibility for this situation cannot be placed on North Viet-Nam alone. I trust that your Government will so act as to enable the violence which is causing so much suffering to be reduced, and as soon as possible brought to an end. In particular, I trust that it will for its part take early and positive steps towards the establishment of the National Council of National Reconciliation and Concord as specified in Article 12 of the Paris Agreement, and will observe Article7 of the Paris Agreement concerning the piece-for-piece replacement of armaments, munitions, and war materials. The Australian Government confirmed to your Embassy in Canberra on 11 November 1974 that it supports your Government's call for the resumption of the peace talks both on the political level at La Celle-Saint Cloud and on the milithat: tary level at the Two Party Joint Military Commission talks in Saigon.

In addition to handing over a copy of Mr Whitlam's statement made today, you should say that (a) We would like to see in Saigon a government which will genuinely negotiate for reunification as provided for in the Paris agreements. (b) We appreciate that Thieu has given no indications that he is willing to do that, and the Australian Government understands the sense of frustration which has given rise torenewedrecourse to military pressure on Thieu although it cannot condone thatrecourse.In this connection, the Australian Government believes that it would have a most favourable effect if the PRG were to make it clear that recent military operations had had the aim of applying pressure to secure the observance of the ignored political provisions of the Paris agreements and that the operations would cease when satisfactory assurances were offered by Saigon that these political provisions would be implemented. (c) We shall be urging on the Thieu Government the necessity of carrying out in good faith the provisions of chapter 4 of the Paris agreements, especially Article 12 on the NCNRC, and Chapter5 on Reunification.

We appreciate that the foregoing approach may be interpreted by the DRV and PRG as simply an attempt to cut across an inevitable military victory. The acting Minister nevertheless considers that the approach should be made at this point of the war and notes the continuing statements to you and publicly about the PRG desire for a negotiated settlement conforming with the political provisions of the Paris agreements. 5.

On8 April the honourable member for Kooyong asked me a question in these terms: I refer . . . to Government statements that the Government has urged both sides in the Vietnam conflict to end the current hostilities and abide by the Paris Peace Accords of 1973. What preciserepresentationshave been made? Were, in fact, the same representations made to each side? I answered: There have been communications certainly in the last three or four weeks but there were also communications 2 years ago in the middle of 1973 and they have been to both sides though not in the same terms because while it is true that there have been gross breaches of the Paris Agreements by both North and South Vietnam and by the Provisional Revolutionary Government and perhaps by the United States of America, nevertheless the breaches have not been all of the same kind . . . The Government, I repeat, has on several occasions communicated-sometime s in writing, sometimes orally with both sides. Let me now repeat: They are not in the same terms. On9 April, the following day, in reply to a question from the Leader of the Opposition I said: . . . I have noticed suggestions that there was some difference in the tone of the communications I sent to Hanoi and Saigon. . . There is no truth whatever in the allegations that the honourable member for Kooyong has made . . . The communications I sent to Hanoi and Saigon were substantially the same. There was one matter obviously which I mentioned to Saigon which I did not mention to Hanoi. That concerned the National Council for There was a matter which I mentioned to Hanoi but not to Saigon, namely, links with the Provisional Revolutionary Government. That concerned Hanoi and not Saigon. . . There is no truth in the allegation. Presumably the honourable member for Kooyong was somewhat surprised at the sharp tone of the note to Saigon. He would be gratified by the equally sharp tone of the note to Hanoi. Presumably it is upon some interpretation of particular words in these answers that the allegations that I misled the House are based. In such circumstances a defence could be made by choosing the most favourable or most reasonable construction upon words. However, in this matter I am not satisfied with that. I am not prepared to concede that the meaning of what I said was open to any misrepresentation or misconstruction whatever, except through malice or gross incompetence. The words stand as they are. My answers stand as they are. I stand absolutely by them. At all times, in all cases, they express the truth as plain as English can express it-the exact truth, the literal truth, the truth in letter and in spirit. Any reader of these answers and of the as they held power the parties opposite sought a documents which are now incorporated in Hanmilitary solution.

At the end of a war in which the AustraUan involvement terminated the day we became a government words like 'deceit' areflungabout by men who participated in the greatest deceit ever practised on the people of Australia. It was a deception that began 10 years and 2 weeks ago when the AustraUan people were conned in to beUeving that the commitment of an AustraUan battalion to Vietnam was the result of a request from the Government of South Vietnam. There was no deceit, no deception, no misleading a month ago when the AustraUan Government made a last, though doomed, effort to end the war through poUtical means. But mighty deceit and misleading there were assuredly at the beginning. (Extension of time granted). We have seen the spectacle of the Leader of the Opposition receiving his instructions from the 'Sydney Morning Herald' and his ammunition from the Melbourne 'Age'. Did the leader writers of these 2 papers, whom the Leader of the Opposition quotes one wonders, pause for a moment 2 weeks ago before inditing their high flown outpourings about 'the greatest scandal since Federation', about 'callousness', about 'shame', about 'inhumanity'? Did they recall for even a moment their urgings of 20 January 1965 that troops be sent to South Vietnam and the unwavering support they gave the miUtary poUcies of the United States, aided and abetted by the then AustraUan Government for years and years thereafter? Where was the pride of the 'Age' in its investigative reporting on 30 April 1965? On that day it wrote: This new commitment has been made in response to the formal procedure of a request for more help by South Vietnam and accompanied by an assurance of American cooperation. The lessons of Vietnam have to be learnt. Now is thetimeto learn them. This is thetimefor AustraUan people to learn how we got into the war in Vietnam-a t this time, when the honourable member for Kooyong is suggesting that AustraUa must be prepared for participation in more 'Vietnams'. This is not my interpretation alone. I shaU quote from an editorial appearing in the 'Australian Financial Review' on 12 May 1975. It stated: Australia, he said, should prepare for another Vietnamstyle war in South-East Asia, and could not ignore-and dare not eliminate-the possibility that it would need to give further military aid to Asian countries. In his reference to military aid Mr Peacock left litde doubt that he was referring to troops as well as equipment. His terminology that Australia should be prepared to help countries in the region 'beset by political problems' is the recipe for another Vietnam. He seemed to extend the possible need for AustraUan intervention to Papua New Guinea, despite the fact that the country's Prime Minister, Mr Somare, has specifically ruled out AustraUan military aid in any crisis. But the most worrying point remains that Mr Peacock is apparently prepared to commit arms and troops to countries 'beset by poUtical problems' which could have no relevance at aU to the defence of AustraUa. Mr Peacock sounds Uke a voice from the early sixties rather than a spokesman for a poUtical party anxious to present a contemporary policy to the electorate. One is left with the conclusion that the Liberals have lived with and advocated Vietnam-style wars and non-recognition of Asian reaUties for so many years that theyfindit hard to accept anything else. I am having prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs a paper which will substantiate the way in which we got into this war. There is a paper prepared by the Editor of Historical Documents covering the origins of the AustraUan involvement in Vietnam. Since, however, it includes Cabinet documents belonging to the previous Government, documents which the present Leader of the Liberal Party wiU not allow me to see, I cannot look at that paper. However, I am having the same distinguished author prepare a paper from Foreign Affairs documents which are available. What a lesson the honourable member for Kooyong has to learn from the way we got into the last Vietnam war. This is the Liberal spokesman for Foreign Affairs who can seriously say in his prepared statement of last Friday: Recent events have made it clear that our long-standing views were correct. How could anyone now support those who claim there was a civil war in South Vietnam? A man who, saying this, can also say: There could weU develop a shared interestBetween the Soviet Union and Vietnamin keeping China from extending its influence southwards . . . I wish he would make up his mind. For a generation we were always taught that this was what the Vietnam war was aU about-'to stop the downward thrust of China between the Pacific and Indian Oceans'. The consistent characteristic of the Opposition Parties' approach to Vietnam remains-to treat it as an issue from which political capital can be squeezed, to divide the Australian people, to exploit the suffering the war has caused and is still causing, for political advantage here at home. It has never been so disgracefully demonstrated as now, in the treatment of the Leader of the Opposition of the question of refugees. What other Parliament in the world would avoided the real issue-hi s deceit of this Parlianow be debating these momentous events in the ment. I say 'on these occasions' because we seem terms set by the Opposition? What other sigto be having a lot of these occasions lately. When nificant party in the world takes the line now that we have a Prime Minister with principles of this the Liberal Party of Australia and the National kind and whose Government acts in this way it is Country Party of Australia take? None. There is little wonder that such debates as this occur. But no poUtical party in any part of the world which it is a pity because there are many major issues now takes the position which the AustraUan Fedthat should be debated.

This could have lasting and serious consequences for other countries in South East Asia and, of course, ultimately for ourselves. The whole balance of poUtical power and mihtary strength has now been altered in favour of the communists in one of the most potentially unstable regions of the world. Vietnam has now one of the best equipped and largest military forces in the world. It seems that as a result of a It is this deception, this act which the 'Sydney communist victory the Soviet Union probably will estabUsh a naval base in South Vietnam. All these things can hardly be claimed to be in the long term interests of Australia or her friends in this part of the world. The letters and the cables, his deception, the Prime Minister today did not as demonstrated by the Leader of the Opposition, verify that the Government has been more than sympathetic to communist aggression and communist victory in Vietnam, a victory which will mean that systematically and ruthlessly any Western influence or poUtical opposition will be removed. Obviously, the Prime Minister is conscious of the general feeUng of the AustraUan public. What other reason can be given for the underhand way in which he has handled this matter. Why did he mislead Parliament? Why did he try to hide and cover up these cables? There are many issues that cluster around this central matter of deception. There is the issue of the Prime Minister's support for the communist side in Vietnam. There is the issue of the Prime Minister's efforts to withhold from ParUament and the AustraUan people the support that he had been offering. There is the issue of the Prime Minister's conteU the truth when he said in this House on 9 tinuing effort to place all the blame in Vietnam April that the cables were substantially the same. on the side under attack-South Vietnam.

The words that have passed from the Ups of the This technique involves ignoring the substance Deputy Prime Minister (Dr. J. F. Cairns) have of the matter and retreating under the smokebeen words of encouragement to the commuscreen of raising matters which have nothing to nists. But I believe that that would be about par do with the subject. To me, and I am sure to most for the course and that we would expect that people, this technique does nothing to help the from the Deputy Prime Minister. There is also the issue of the Prime Minister's to his guilt. We can recall a number of occasions attitude to the Vietnamese refugees and the sense on which the Prime Minister has used this techof shame this has caused so many AustraUans. nique. We recall the shabby way in which the These are important matters. They reveal a great Prime Minister got rid of the previous Treasurer deal about the attitude of this Government. But I repeat that the heart of this debate is the deception practised by the Prime Minister. Deception is a fairly kind word, I venture to say, for what the Prime Minister did on 9 April in answer to a question-chaUenge-by the Leader of the Opposition. The 'Sydney Morning Herald' used a more appropriate word in its editorial of 30 April 1975. It stated: The Prime Minister has lied to the Parliament. Morning Herald' caUed lying, which has moved the Opposition today to censure the Prime Minister on behalf of the Australian people whom he deceived. By trying to divert attention away from remove the distrust that he has drawn upon himself; he only compounded it. By talking about matters which have nothing or little to do with his deception of the Parliament he has not aUayed the fears or suspicions which his deception had created; he has only deepened them. All that the Prime Minister had to do today was to admit to the House that he was wrong when he said in the ParUament on 9 April that the 2 cables he sent to Hanoi and Saigon were not the same as they were claimed to be. He could have told the House frankly that he was in error and that after looking at the cables again he now agreed that they were substantiaUy different. But, of course, the Prime Minister did not do that. How can any of these things justify the Prime Minister's excuses today for his own actions? The simple fact is, as the Prime Minister knows and everyone else knows, that he did not The Prime Minister has developed his own Prime Minister; it merely gives greater substance by replacing him. What a ghastly error of judgment that was! The technique was used on that occasion. We recall the destruction of a former Speaker and the fundamental breach of principle and privilege which was involved in that episode. The technique was used then. We recall the Gair affair and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation affair when the Prime Minister misled ParUament and the Senate acted to impeach him. We recaU the many occasions on which the Prime Minister has breached tradition and convention. The same technique has been used on every occasion. Why does the Prime Minister do this? Why does he go to such trouble to avoid the issue, to cover up and to hide? The most apparent reason is that he simply does not want to acknowledge his errors. But I think there is a deeper reason, one which is becoming clear to more and more people. It is expediency. It is becoming more and more clear that, when the Prime Minister sets himself a course, nothing wiU stand in the way of it; principles are cast aside, integrity is forgotten, conveniently short. Not once did they protest, the truth becomes a casualty and deception becomes common place. If the Prime Minister decides to get rid of a Minister, he relentlessly pursues the objective until he achieves it. If the Prime Minister decides to getridof the Speaker and to assert his own domination of this House, the shamefulness of any action required to achieve that result wUl not stand in his way. If the Prime Minister decides to try torigthe numbers in the Senate or to try to rig a court, he sets out to Yet they talk about even-handedness. Not once do so with an admirable yet reprehensible singlemindedness. If the Prime Minister decides that he wants to side with the communists, he does so; and, when this bias is exposed, he denies it and tries to hide it I suppose that there are many matters, in which the Prime Minister has been involved, which wiU not leave irreparable damage. Of course, there will be some continuing damage resulting from the Gair affair, the ASIO affair, the Cope affair, the Crean affair and all the others. But the damage that will flow from the Prime Minister's bias towards the communist cause and the deception in which that bias has led him to engage wiU not be easily rectified. Certainly, his standing in the eyes of members of this ParUament and in the eyes of the AustraUan people has been badly damaged, if not destroyed. But what is much more important is the damage that he has done to AustraUa. The Prime Minister is here today and gone tomorrowI am talking about the poUtical scene, not his trips overseas-but Australia wiU be here for a long time. We have to Uve and work with other nations and to have their trust for a long time. The great tragedy of this Prime Minister is the damage which he has done not only to himself but also to this country. We cannot earn the trust of other nations if we have a Prime Minister whose attitudes and actions are based on expediency. Order! Therighthonourable member's time has expired. Science) (3.25)-The guilty men have raised themselves from the bloody mire of Australian involvement in Vietnam to point their fingers. But have the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fraser) and the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia ( Mr Anthony) forgotten the appalling My Lais of the Vietnam War, the searing deadUness of the napalm bombs, the death dealing bombs that were dropped, not only on Hanoi but also on the rest of Vietnam by the United States of America? Their memories are and now they talk of humanitarian principles. These men who plunged AustraUa into war, these men who applauded killing, these men who applauded violence, these men who supported the United States' invasion of Cambodia and of Vietnam, not once protested about United States transgressions when evidence showed that both the Americans and the North Vietnamese had transgressed the 1954 Geneva agreements. was a protest made by them. They talk also of deception and of lies. These people belong to the very Parties that lied and lied and lied to the AustraUan people about AustraUa's involvement in Vietnam. I turn now to the statements that were made for the benefit of the Australian people about why AustraUans were in Vietnam. Infamous documents were distributed to con the AustraUan people. They were deceitful and lying. One of these documents states: Australia values the closeness and strength of its friendship and alliance with the United States. Our forces are in Vietnam to help the Government of the South at its request to resist a military campaign against it. I emphasise the words 'at its request'. Honourable members may recaU the words of Sir Robert Menzies. Many honourable members in the chamber were in this ParUament in 1965.1 shall quote what the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, said on 29 April 1965 because it indicates the deception and the lies upon which Australia's involvement in Vietnam was based. He said:",31,Notice Of Motion

21,Mr Morrison (St George,"Minister forThe Australian Government is now in receipt of a request been a long drawn out struggle ultimately leading to a stalefrom the Government of South Vietnam for further military mate and possible compulsion at the conference table. That assistance. He went on: I think I should say that we decided in principle some time ago-week s and weeks ago-that we would be willing to do this if we received the necessary request . . . I see that the right honourable member for Lowe recall very well the events I am relating. Repeated requests were made by the AustraUan Labor Party, then in Opposition, for letters that were exchanged with Vietnam to be tabled. Many years later they were. It is very obvious from those letters that what was involved was not a request from the South Vietnamese Government but the acceptance of an offer that was made under the sponsorship of the United States by AustraUa. If one wants to go into the details of how that particular offer to the South Vietnamese Government was manipulated, one can find it all in the Pentagon papers and the exchange of telegrams with Ambassador Maxwell Taylor. To save the time of the ParUamentI refer honourable members to details on page 330 of the Hansard of 19 August 1971. The South Vietnamese Government was not anxious to have other miUtary forces operating in South Vietnam but the United States, for its own purposes, wanted to have a broadening of the alliance so that the United States President could teU his own people that there was a wide support for United States poUcies. So things were engineered. But the important thing is that that exchange of documents which led to AustraUa's involvement in Vietnam took place on 29 April, that the then Prime Minister made his statement on 29 April that the AustraUan forces were ready for embarkation several weeks earlier. It is the very same man, the right honourable member for Lowe, as then Prime Minister and before that as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was always maintaining that the Vietnam war was winnable. The Opposition when it was in government was not interested in the concept of negotiation-of a negotiated settlement to the Vietnam conflict. It believed this great mystique generated by the propaganda machines of the Pentagonthat the war was winnable. What did the right honourable member say on 22 March 1966? I quote from Hansard. He said: The only other point that I want to mention is the argument of the Leader of the OppositionWho is now the Prime Ministerthat the war in Vietnam is unwinnable. That may have been The responsibility for this situation cannot be placed on the case a year ago when it looked as though it could have North Vietnam alone. is not the case today. This is what the right honourable gentleman said on 22 March 1966. From that time on there was no effort and no sincere attempt by the Opposition when it was in government to reach a negotiated settlement on the Vietnam war. Yet members of the Opposition come here today and criticise the Labor Government for seeking even at the eleventh hour-w e have been doing this ever since we came to power in 1972a negotiated settlement of that war. These men who believed that the war was winnable have now found out that the war was winnable. This is the hypocrisy that motivates honourable gentlemen opposite. I now come to the telegrams and to the letters of 13 March that the Prime Minister tabled today. I hope that representatives of the 'Age' and the 'Sydney Morning Herald' are Ustening very carefully to this because there was never such an orchestrated response to the headline hunting statements of the Leader of the Opposition than the way that the 'Age' and 'Sydney Morning Herald' took up the case and ran with it. I will read the 2 letters of 13 March which the Prime Minister tabled today because I think they should be read. They will appear in Hansard tomorrow but I think it important that everybody listening, especially the few members of the Opposition in the chamber at the momentj note them. The letter to the Foreign Minister of North Vietnam states: I have the honour to reply to Your Excellency's letter . . . concerning . . . the implementation of the Paris agreement. Although the Australian Government was not one of the signatories to the Paris agreement we have constantly supported its implementation and have looked to all of the parties to the Paris agreement to abide by its terms and to ensure that another opportunity to achieve an enduring peace in Vietnam is not lost. Unfortunately, Australia's hopes have not been realised. There has been continued lack of progress in the implementation of both the political and military provisions of the Paris agreement, now more than 2years-old, and continuedfightingin South Vietnam. I want honourable members to Usten very carefully to this statement because this was a statement made to the Foreign Minister of North Vietnam. The Prime Minister said: The responsibility for this situation cannot be placed on South Vietnam alone. In identical words in a letter to President Thieu the same paragraphs appear but the wording then becomes:",33,Notice Of Motion
22,( Mr Mcmahon) Is Now In The Chamber. He Will,"As the Prime Minister has pointed out, the intent and the purport of the letter of 13 March followed up by the telegrams were to bring about negotiations. Is that such a bad thing? I know that for years the Opposition denied any attempt at meaningful negotiation. But the Prime Minister, in putting forward the proposition, allocated i i men who would have the guts-jus t the plain ordinary guts-to make a statement like that to both sides? For so long the Opposition refused to accept the existence of China. It refused to accept the existence of North Vietnam. As a matter of prime AustraUan interest we have sought to ensure that the AustraUan viewpoint is put in those capitals which matter. If the Opposition Parties had been in Government it would have been impossible to send even a communication to North Vietnam because they would have continued to hide their heads, ostrich-like, as they did for over 2 decades in relation to China. So the Prime Minister put these viewpoints. He put them strongly. I beUeve the Parliament will support the proposition that the Prime Minister acted with great courage and in the interests of the AustraUan people in seeking to reach, even at that late stage, a settlement by negotiation of this long drawn out conflict. This is what the Opposition is seeking to criticise. Cass.M.H. The fact is that the Prime Minister sent very explicit messages. I hope that people will stop and read the messages and not read just the headlines which flow from the comments of the Leader of the Opposition. trust that the honourable member for Moreton might, one of these days, sit down and read the cables. They put forward both propositions. The cables were sent on the same day to both North Vietnam and South Vietnam. The substantial difference was that in the case of South Vietnam we were urging them to adopt a policy on the poUtical side of the Paris agreements and to establish a national council. On the other side we drew attention to the violation by North Vietnam. Obviously the 2 messages were similar in substance in the sense of what they were seeking to achieve. They were obviously different in the points which they brought up because there was an essential difference between the violations of both sides. These were the statements made by the AustraUan Government. I find it absurd that the Parliament has to waste its time with a repetiMorrison, W. L. tion of the old catalogue, trying to substantiate the errors and the Ues of the Opposition when it was in Government. We have conducted our policy in relation to both North Vietnam and South Vietnam. It is a policy which those guUty men opposite could never have sought to adopt because at the stage when they had the opportunity to protest and to make their views known, not one word was ever said.

The Governbased on whether the contact lenses were ment is fully aware of the factors which need to prescribed and fitted to provide significantly be considered in relation to the provision of such improved vision as compared with spectacles, or assistance and the matter is currently under as a patient preference. examination. BeforeI outline the new arrangements in with the following conditions, being patients greater detail and draw to the attention of whose vision will be significantly improved by honourable members the more important prothe use of contact lenses rather than spectacles: visions in the Bill, I wish to emphasise 2 points. Firstly, the proposed optometrical benefit arrangements were developed in close consultation with representatives of the AustraUan Optometrical Association. The proposals have also been discussed with representatives of the AustraUan Medical Association and the AustraUan CoUege of Ophthalmologists. Secondly, participation in the new arrangements wUl be entirely at the option of the optometrist concerned. It is considered that in the great majority of cases patients seeking optometrical attention, not involving the prescription and fitting of contact lenses, will require only one or two consultations. However, it is recognised that there may be special cases in which more than 2 consultations may be necessary during a course of attention. It is further considered that generaUy such attention should not need to be sought more frequently than at intervals of 12 months. The Bill therefore provides for benefits in respect of professional attendances by participatconsultation and a subsequent consultation-in any 12 months period. It further provides for the payment of benefits for additional consultations, in excess of an initial and subsequent consultation, where the attending optometrist has certified that, in his professional opinion, the patient required the additional consultations. Available information indicates that these patients comprise about 9 per cent of optometrists' patients. The operation of this provision will be kept under review to ensure that no significant changes in optometrical practice develop. Any significant change would, of course, cause a reconsideration of this provision. The AustraUan Optometrical Association has It is proposed that the regulations will prescribe, as prescribed classes of patients, persons 1. A patient with myopia greater than 4.0 dioptres (spherical equivalent) in the dominant eye. 2. A patient with manifest hyperopia greater than 5.0 dioptres (spherical equivalent) in the dominant eye. 3. A patient with astigmatism greater than 4.0 dioptres in the dominant eye. 4. A patient with astigmatism greater than 3.0 dioptres and requiring lens for distance correction of plus power plus 3.0 dioptres or greater in one meridian in the dominant eye. 5. A patient with irregular astigmatism in either eye, confirmed by Keratometric observation, with visual acuity less than 6/12 with the best spectacle correction, and this corrected acuity being improved by more than 10 per cent by the use of a contact lens. 6. A patient with anisometropia greater than 4.0 dioptres (difference between spherical equivalents). 7. A patient with subnormal corrected visual acuity of not greater than 6/30 in the better eye, when the contact lens is prescribed as part of a telescopic system. 8. A patient in respect of whom a wholly or segmentally opaque contact lens is prescribed for the alleviation of dazzle, disto be included in the common form of undertaktortion, or diplopia caused by pathological mydriasis, aniridia, coloboma of the iris or pupillary malformation or distortion, whether congenital, traumatic or surgical in origin. 9. A patient in respect of whom a registered medical practitioner has ordered or recommended the prescription of contact lenses. The first 8 conditions which I have outlined were drawn up by an independent ophthalmologist. The list of conditions has been accepted by the Australian Optometrical Association. The operation of these conditions will be reviewed periodically to ensure that patients who reasonably require the prescription and fitting of contact lenses are not disadvantaged. All consultations associated with the prescription and fitting of contact lenses, other than the initial consultation, will be covered by the one benefit item. In the case of condition 9, the Australian College of Ophthalmologists has expressed reservations about the utilisation rates which might follow this provision. If, in fact, utilisation Insurance Act, for the assignment of benefits in rates under this provision seem excessive, the conditions will be promptly reviewed. In cases where contact lenses are prescribed accept benefits in full settlement. The participatand fitted to persons, included in a prescribed ing optometrist will not undertake to accept class of patients, and a full benefit of $60 has not assignment of benefits for these patients in cases been paid in respect of a similar course of attenwhere the provisions in clause 6, to which I have tion commencing within the previous three years, already referred, apply.

Clause6 of the Bill provides, therefore, for the benefit payable in these cases to be an amount equivalent to the benefit for a normal Optometrical Services Committees of Inquiry subsequent consultation, or such other amount as and Optometrical Services Review Tribunals. is prescribed by regulation. Clause8 of the Bill is a key provision. It provides for the Minister for Social Security to draw up a common form of undertaking. An optometrist wishing to participate in the new benefit arrangements will be required to give an undertaking in accordance with the common form. The Minister may draw up the common form of undertaking only after consultation with the Australian Optometrical Association and he may only vary the common form of undertaking following consultation with that Association. For the information of honourable members. I would like to outline briefly the more important matters ing. The undertaking will outline the kinds of services to be provided by participating optometrists and will detail the maximum fee to be charged by the optometrist for a service to which the undertaking relates. Regard will be had in the common form of undertaking to the fact that a participating optometrist may be a person or a company employing optometrists. In such cases the participating optometrist providing optometrical services at a number of practice locations may wish to enter into an undertaking in respect of only some of those locations. The locations to be covered by the undertaking will be specified in the undertaking. Honourable members will recall that earlier I referred to the fact that a participating optometrist in most cases will provide consultations to persons with pensioner medical service entitlement and their dependants without charge to the patients. This will be achieved by the inclusion in the common form of undertaking of a provision whereby the participating optometrist will undertake to make arrangements, in accordance with sub-section 20 (3) of the Health respect of these patients. The effect of this assignment will be that for consultations provided to these persons, the participating optometrist will The Bill also provides for the establishment of These bodies are to have similar roles, and are to be established and function similarly to the Medical Services Committees of Inquiry and Medical Services Review Tribunals, already authorised by the Health Insurance Act.

It will be taken up as part of a comprehensive review of similar types of decisions, already authorised by the provisions of the Health Insurance Act, being considered by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This Government recognises that special arrangements may be necessary in respect of persons living in isolated areas. In a situation where an optometrist with a principal practice in one town visits outlying areas periodically, higher charges are necessarily made to offset the additional costs involved. To ensure that persons in such areas are not deprived of the benefits under the proposed new arrangements, because of the requirement that fees be no higher than the negotiated schedule fees, the Bill, in clause 18, empowers the Minister for Social Security to make special arrangements for the provision of Mr Hayden: optometrical services, by participating optomThat the Bill be now read a second time. etrists, to persons in isolated areas.

But I shall remove that restraint from myself and suggest to Mrs Child that she will guarantee herself to be a oncer in the ParUament if she continues to teU deUberate untruths which she knows to be misleading, as I am sure the reading of that letter into the record indicates. When I reported this news in my Party room today as a matter of interest, I was surprised to hear many of my colleagues in the Opposition, such as the honourable member for Griffith( Mr becomes law-and is payable, from that day Donald Cameron), the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Bourchier), and many others, say: 'Yes, but that rumour that it was the Liberal and Country Parties in the Senate which stopped the pension increases being paid before 1 May is around our electorates too'. I hope that what I have said today will at least persuade the listening audience, which at this time of day is at its largest, of the untruth of those allegations. I do not attach any blame in this to the Minister for Social Security. As far as I know he has been ignorant of the mischief which has been put abroad by members of his own Party. Being the man that he is, I am sure that had he known that that mischief had been put abroad he would have disowned it in aflash.I know that when he gets up to respond to the debate on the second reading speech he will disown the untruths told by the honourable member for Henty.

But as I cost taxpayers almost $500m extra tofinancethis pointed out to the Minister for Social Security in plugging of another hole. The Minister, in his another speech, because of the way in which this second reading speech, states that this increase Government is mismanaging the economy, with goes towards the Labor Party's goal of bringing rampant inflation and with unemployment pensions up to 25 per cent of average weekly rising, it might be to the disadvantage of penearnings, seasonaUy adjusted.

So, as of this day, the Labor Party is and has been paying pensioners at a rate which is equal to the percentage of average weekly earnings which the Minister denounced the last Liberal Government for paying. The tragedy is that as soon as this increase becomes law-wheneve r it onwards its percentage of average weekly earnings will continue to be eroded because of the rampant inflation which is going on in this country and about which the Labor Party does not seem to care. Our poUcy in the Opposition has been stated clearly. We believe in the indexation of pensions. We do not believe that pensions should be a political football and that a Minister should come into the House and grandstand by saying: 'We will give you pensioners $5 or $6'.

It is true also that that policy has been cartaxpayer something. That was a device used by ried on by the Labor Party for the last 2 years. In May 1974 we announced that in the case where there was genuine hardship, where a man with 3 children had been sacked from the job that it was inequitable that he had to wait a week for the unemployment benefit. We could see no justice in that. He would have no income coming into his house to feed himself and his 3 children. So we recommended-it came out as policy-that unemployment benefits begin from the day after a man is sacked. Since May 1974 we have been pleading with the Labor Party to implement this. The honourable member for Barton( Mr ple of matters which I think will cause some conReynolds) drew my attention to this matter. I am glad that the Government has now copied our policy. I compliment the Government on doing so. I also compliment it on extending the benefit so that it is paid to a former prisoner as soon as he is released from gaol. This is a progressive reform of which we approve. I would like to remind the House of the cost of unemployment benefits now. Unemployment is reaching a very high level, and that costs the nation an enormous amount of money. I will detail thesefiguresvery quickly. Unemployment benefits for the year will cost $158m. The Regional Employment Development scheme will cost $ 15.5m. The structural adjustment assistance scheme-that is, assistance to individuals because of tariff changes-wil l cost $30m. That is a total of $203m. The indirect costs of unemployment are through the National Employment and Training scheme-unde r which history will show some of the great scandals of our time have been perpetrated-whic h will cost $14m; the special adjustment assistance, which will cost $0.267m; the special assistance to non-metropolitan areas scheme, which will cost $4m; and the special payments to the States for unemployment, which will cost $240m. The total of those direct and indirect costs means that spending on unemployment relief this year at this moment looks as though it will be $461 m. That $46 lm is being paid by the AustraUan taxpayer to people for doing nothing, paid for one of two reasons: Either there is no work for them or there is work but the scandalous way the Labor Party has softened the work test has allowed to flourish in this country a race of bludgers who are doing nothing, want to do nothing and yet are being paid for it by the AustraUan taxpayer. That $46lm is not a smaU sum for the taxpayer to be paying out for something that is completely non-productive. One could build on that by saying that the reduction in sales tax on motor vehicles is costing the Australian the Government to get employment moving, as were the extra funds for housing. So the total cost of unemployment which is a direct result of the economic mismanagement of the Government is over $460m. Because it is so costly, I suggest that there is a need for careful administration. I have referred to bludgers. I will give 2 examples which bother me very much. I am indebted to the honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hodges) who brought this matter to the attention of the House a few weeks ago. Instead of giving specific examples, I wUl mention a coucern. A survey was conducted in March by the Roy Morgan Research Centre Pty Ltd in Melbourne. This is the organisation which for years conducted the gallup polls. As I understand it, this was the first independent unemployment survey conducted. At that time the official unemployment figure was 298 000 people; say 300 000 people were out of work, according to the Government. The Roy Morgan Research Centre in its survey found by a sample of 10 000 people-by this sampling method great accuracy can be obtained, as we know from the organisation's surveying of election results-that only 224 000 people were out of work. This leaves a balance of 75 000 people unaccounted for. In other words, the Government says that the number of people unemployed is 75 000 more than an independent sampling survey indicates. What are the possibilities? One is that the margin for error in the independent survey is so great that it is wrong by 75 000 out of300 000. To anyone who has studied statistical method that would be an absurd proposition. Of course the margin for error is not that great. Could it be that the Commonwealth Employment Service is so lax in taking out the cards of people when jobs are found for them that the unemployment figures are inflated each month? That would be an absurd proposition, because I am sure that a ministerial direction has been sent out to every CES office saying: 'For goodness sake, as soon as you find somebody a job take his card out of the file so as to make the unemployment figure reaUstic'. So that is not a possibility. WhatI do think is a possibility-and this terrifies me-is that there are 75 000 dual or multi",43,Social Services Bill 1975

54,Mr Chippi Acknowledge The Interjection Of,"registrations of people who are collecting not one in 1961 brought 50 applicants; whereas its adcheque but more than one cheque and who are registered at more than one place, and this is not being policed by the Minister or by the Department for several reasons. One reason is that the Minister does not want it policed because he does not want to put pressure on the unemployed. Another is that the Department is so hideously overworked at the moment that it could not possibly police it. I have had brought to my notice cases in which the computer keeps paying people for whom the Department has found a job 2, 3 and 4 weeks before. How many honest people return those cheques? How many people do not? Does the Department follow these people up? If so, when? The Department of Social Security is now responsible for policing the abuses of unemployment benefits and because of the overwork associated with the economic situation the policing has not been carried out on a sufficiently large scale. Abuses of unemployment benefits are becoming simpler. Why the Minister and the Department have oversimplified the system and made it so easy to get unemployment relief, I do not know; but they have. Now only one form must be lodged monthly with the Department of Social Security to keep those cheques rolling in, and that form can be lodged by mail. Under the old system a person had to lodge the form personally each week at the local CES office in order breadwinner is working? In this house there is to continue being paid the unemployment benefit. I am prepared to be as sympathetic to the unemployed as anybody. In fact, the Opposition's posture on paying the unemployed immediately they are sacked indicates that. But I do not think it is any great hardship for a person 'Sydney Morning Herald' is sometimes ridiculed who is unemployed to go to the local CES office once a week, lodge a form personally and say: ' I am still unemployed'. To allow it to be done by proxy once a month means that a person can sit at home, post the form each month to the Department of Social Security and collect a cheque. We have heard of Utopia and the welfare state; but this is ridiculous. I refer to a letter, which I have been given authority to quote, from a firm of licensed surtreating them like cattle as they go in to wait for veyors, M. M. Fisher and Associates, of Altona Street, West Perth. It says that they recently advertised in Perth for survey hands to be engaged on both rural and metropolitan work. After advertising extensively they received replies to their advertisements from 5, 3 and 2 people respectively. While all the figures published show unemployment running at record levels and far in excess of the 1961 credit was knocking on the door of his lodgings each day asking if squeeze level, an advertisement this firm placed vertisements now bring 5 applicants. Where are the unemployed? Or is it that they have never had it so good? Is it that it does not pay them to work? Is it that they do not have to meet a work test? This is costing the nation over $400m, and I think it is the job of a responsible Opposition on behalf of taxpayers to ask the Government: 'Are you spending our money responsibly or are you giving it to any bludger who wants to stay at home and post in an application form once a month?' Mr Fisher goes on to give an example which is sickening. He says that he is prepared to back it up. He said: An example of this is in our neighbourhood: Six young people sharing a house, all on the dole, enjoying a combined income-befor e casual jobs-of $216 per week. That will be increased by another $30 per week as soon as we pass this Bill. They are receiving $216 each week from us, the taxpayers. Mr Fisher continues: Allow $35 for rent, afigure1 know they pay, $30 for each of the 2 cars they run, and they have a 'family' income of $ 121 after housing and transport expenses are paid. Mr Fisher asks the plaintive question: How many families of six are in this enviable position? There is the naked question: How many families of six are in this enviable position when the not a soul working, and they are on the dole, being paid for by us. This disturbs the Opposition. One wonders how far we will go with this ridiculous welfare state. I am also concerned about the Department of Social Security. The in this place by the Government. I remind the Government of an article which appeared on 2 April 1975. It is headed: Six-hour wait at Social Security office.

The article states further: An elderly man leaving the same office yesterday said that he had received no cheque for several weeks. His landlady his cheque had arrived. Others complained bitterly of waiting times comparable with Mrs MacLennan's.

I do not know whether that is true. I should like departmental officers who are present to tell me through the Minister, whether that is true. If it is true, it is a national scandal. If it is true, will the Minister for Environment (Dr Cass), who is supposed to be humanitarian but who laughsDr CassI was thinking about what you were sayingpeople have to wait 6 hours at the Department of Social Security? The honourable member for Hotham should direct his remarks to the Chair. mismanagement because of the number of people involved and because of the state of the economy. I have expressed concern on behalf of the Opposition but because of the rate of inflation and the difficulties experienced by pensioners we support these measures and will give them expedition both here and in the other place. come the opportunity to speak in this cognate debate. I want to concentrate my remarks on the Social Services Bill 1975. Other speakers from the Government side will refer to the Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill 1975.1 was delighted to hear the honourable member for Hotham( Mr that the work test is, in fact, carried out at the Chipp) say that pensions would not, if the Opposition were in power, be a political football. Of course, he has a very short memory. I refer him to the time when the Opposition was in government and pensions were just that. Every time there was an election it dangled the counter bid in front of the electors of how much money was going to be handed out. When this Government came to power it repeat them. They are: To make a substantial made a promise which it has kept. It stated that increase in the basic rate of pensions and every 6 months an adjustment would be made in benefits; an increase in additional payments for the rates of pension and it would strive to ensure children; the implementation of the second step that the rate of pension reached 25 per cent of in the Government's program to abolish the average weekly earnings. If the Opposition has means test on age pensions; provision for unemlearnt nothing else in opposition but the fact that ployment, sickness and special benefits weekly in pensioners are not to be held to ransom every advance instead of weekly in arrears; and protime there is an election and a carrot dangled in vision for the imediate payment of special benefit front of them to try to win their vote maybe its for people newly discharged from prison. These period in opposition has not been completely in are the obvious and readily discernible provain. The honourable member for Hotham referred also to the abuse of the unemployment benefit. We are aware of this. I think the term used by the to people abusing unemployment benefit, was 'bludgers'. We have seen in the Press the use of similar statements to that used by the honourable member for Hotham. We know that it is an easy type of statement to make and it is very difficult to assess the accuracy of such a statement. Of course it is true that in any system of 1 social welfare-the honourable member for Hotham is aware of this-ther e will be a percentage of people who will abuse that system. I submit to this House that the majority are not abusing unemployment benefit. It is an insignificant minority that would abuse such benefits by being the type of person who would register in 2 places or some such subterfuge as this. I have had plenty of reports made to me and I have always said to the person: 'Give me the name of the person who is abusing unemployment benefit and we will have the matter investigated '. In all the claims that I have heard made, only one name has been given to me, and that case was investigated. I have heard such claims made by the Opposition. I trust that members of the Opposition are doing their part and are reporting such matters to the Department of Social Security so that investigations can be carried out. We, as a government, naturally would not want people to be abusing unemployment benefit. We would want them stopped from doing so, if this is the case, and appropriate action taken against them. Of course, the honourable member for Hotham also is aware presenttime.I put to him: Is a system that is good to be discontinued because of a few people? I submit that this system that we have developed since we have been in office is one based on social concern. The principal features of the Bill were outlined by the Minister for Social Security( Mr Hayden) in his second reading speech. I should like to visions of the Bill.

58,Mr Oldmeadow (Holt) (4.49),"I welwhat should be clearly understood-is that this is a continuation of the record of the Whitlam Government, to seek out constantly new ways of making a life of dignity for those who receive any form of welfare payment. These payments are a right; not a handout. They are not charity. They are the free entitlement of all people in AustraUa who, for one reason or another, find themselves in a situation where they are recipients of these benefits. This Bill is also a clear recognition by this Government of the need to increase benefits. This appUes particularly to pensions, so that the most vulnerable people in the community do not suffer needlessly in an inflationary period. Since the Labor Government took office in December 1972 its record of pension and benefit increases has, I believe, been outstanding. On the first day of the first session of the Parliament it pensions and to keep them up to reasonable livintroduced a BiU to provide increases in aU pensions, unemployment and sickness benefits. Since then not only has the social welfare system been rationalised; benefits and pensions have increased at a far greater rate than increases in prices and wages. Let us look briefly at the advances the Whitlam Government has made in this area and compare them with the record of its predecessors. In October 1972 the married pensioner couple rate was $34.50 a week. By July 1974 this had been increased to $51.50 a week-a n increase of 49.3 per cent. This compares with an increase of 31.6 per cent in the consumer price index and a 40.1 per cent increase in average weekly earnings. This legislation seeks to increase the pensioner couple rate to $60 a week, another step in the expressed aim of adjusting the pensioner rate twice yearly until it reaches 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. The increase in unemployment benefits and average weekly earnings and that promise must sickness benefits has been even more spectacular. be kept. In October 1972 the weekly payment to a single recipient more than 21 years of age was $17. By July 1974 this had been increased to $31 a the proposal to make unemployment, sickness week-a n increase of 82.4 per cent, compared and special benefit payments weekly in advance with a 31.6 per cent increase in the consumer instead of weekly in arrears. The honourable price index and a 40.1 per cent increase in avermember for Hotham said that in this case we are age weekly earnings. Of course this Bill increases copying Liberal Party poUcy. I suggest to him that amount to $36 per week. SoI could go on that some of the things that are now stated in citing these striking examples of the Whitlam 'The Way Ahead' are Uft-outs of policy that have Government's continued progress in the area of been espoused by this Party and in fact are being social welfare and how this contrasts with the input into practice. The effect of this measure, of activity of the Liberal-Country Party governcourse, will be to reduce by 7 days the time it ments when they were in office for 23 years. One of the most outstanding examples is the benefit cheque. This has been happening since first historic step towards the aboUtion of the January and illustrates the deep concern of this means test on age pensions which was taken by Government about the delays which have occurthis Government in September 1973. Since that red in paying benefits, particularly unemploydate aU residentiaUy qualified members of the ment benefits. community aged 75 years or more have been able to receive age pensions free of the means test. We are now taking the second step on our program for aboUshing the means test for pensioners more than 65 years of age. This Bill wul give effect to that second stage. Age pensions, free of means test, wUl be made avaUable to people in the 70 to 74 years of age group as from 1 May. This of course will increase the number of people eUgible. An estimated 43 000 people who are currently receiving pensions at reduced rates will benefit from this measure by becoming entitled to payment at the maximum rate. In addition to that, an estimated 56 000 people who are now excluded because of their means will become eligible. Nobody would question the need to increase ing standards. In this BiU we have kept to our promise to abolish the means test for everybody over 70 years of age. However, there would be some who would question the priority of need, whether the Government should as its next step reduce the age of eligibility by 5 years, or whether it should phase in the means test abolition over a number of yearly periods. It is my own viewI underline that it is my own viewthat the next step should be to reduce the means test-free age to 69 years next year, then to 68, and so on. referring to. I stress that it is my view. I repeat that I say this because on the priority of need I for one would want to see the base pension kept at a relatively high rate.

61,Mr Hodges (Petrie) (5.4),"In entering thisdependants of pensioners, unemployment benefits and sickness benefits to be paid weekly in advance and also immediate payment of special benefits for persons newly discharged from gaol. In addition there is the very important abolition of the means test for people in the 70 to 74 age group. I think it is very pertinent to point out that the estimated cost of these benefits for a full year is $587m. I would like to direct my comments now to some of the points made in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security. He gloated that the standard or single rate pension now represents 24.5 per cent of seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings, but he went on to qualify that by stating that the comparison was made with the December 1974figuresfor seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings, which was the last quarter available to him. If the Minister were in the chamber at the moment I would ask him to look back over the last 5 months at least in which the inflation rate has been mnning at 20 per cent. I would suggest to him that average weekly earnings now have increased quite considerably since the last quarter of 1974. I believe that the Minister is being deceitful in drawing a comparison with average weekly earnings back in 1974 when we have inflation currently running at the tremendous rate of 20 per cent. He went on to comment that in the last year of today. I believe that this will refute the stateoffice of the Liberal-Country Party Government ments of the honourable member for Holt. My the comparable proportion of the pension to avfirst comment relates to a statement made by the erage weekly earnings was 21 per cent. A few Minister for Labor and Immigration.

He stated: This indicates that there has been a substantial redistribuand who treats unemployment benefits as being a suitable or tion of purchasing power to pensioners and social security satisfactory beneficiaries. I offer the suggestion to the Minister that many items in the consumer price index do not affect the pensioner. I invite the Minister for Social Security to come with me into a supermarket in which the average pensioner does his shopping. I assure him that I have a number of pensioners in my electorate, particularly in one section of the electorate. I invite the Minister to come with me and compare some of the price increases of the commodities commonly purchased by a pensioner. Let us consider some of them. In December 1972 a pint of milk cost 12c; in May 1975 it costs 18c-a n increase of 50 per cent. Bread which used to cost 26c a loaf now costs 38c a loafa 46 per cent increase. A pound of bacon rashers used to cost 96c but in May 1975 costs $1.58-a n increase of 64 per cent. The price of butter has increased from 56c to 67c-a n increase of 20 per cent. In December 1972 a 5 lb bag of potatoes cost 30c; it now costs 45c-a n increase of 50 per cent. A 24 oz can ofjam cost 25c; it now costs 34c-a n increase of 36 per cent. A pair of sandshoes cost $6.99; it now costs $10.50-a n increase of 50 per cent. Certainly the price of beef has gone down but lamb and pork have increased in price. If one takes items at random, as I did, onefindsthat the increase was something like 41 per cent. Of course, I have not mentioned the increase in local authority rates which in this same period has been quite considerable. On 10 AprilI made a speech in this House during the grievance debate in which I highlighted some of the problems that exist today with the exploitation of the unemployment benefits being paid to a great number of people in this country. I spoke of the exploitation not only from the point of view of the cost to the economy but also from the point of view of the moral cost to the nation. I want to enlarge a little on this subject The Minister for Labor, Mr Cameron, warned last night 'slackers' might lose the right to unemployment He said he was giving thought to reducing unemployment for people who were out of work and refused to be I've got no sympathy for people who can be described as the professional unemployed person, who just won't work alternative to working . . .

I continue my appeared in the remarks to refer to an interview given by the February Minister for Labor and Immigration on the 'A.M.' radio program in regard to unemployed persons. The Minister was asked: Mr Cameron how long have you been aware that the unTransport Workers Union in Queensland, had employment benefits have been exploited? The Minister answered: It came to my notice a few weeks ago following the reports ing benefits to make people want to get work, he in some sections of the press about what they described as a said . . . multi-million dollar racket and suggesting that practically everybody in the community was on unemployed benefits. back to work, and what they lost in wages they make up in There is evidence that following those press reports that a lot tax rebates, he said.

The interviewer then asked: Is it a multi-million dollar racket? The Minister answered: No it's not. Of course it never was, and it's not now. In point of fact, the survey that I ordered into this matter showed that out of those who are getting unemployed benefits, and it's well to remember that only 40 per cent of those who are unemployed are in receipt of unemployed for Forrest rerninds me, he has a lot of sense.

I have been a member for just less than one year. I made an honest mistake. The legislation appeared on the blue paper for debate and passage, and I thought it had been passed. It is typical of the shallow approach that the honourable member for Hotham makes to the problems of the dependent and the handicapped that he should try to mount a major attack on this issue. Instead of the misplaced galhas been making noises about abolishing the lantry that the honourable member for Hotham displayed to me, he might have tried for some smaU understanding of the problems of new members. He has been a member for 13 years. He said that I am a oncer. I might remind him that I am not. If he thinks that I am a oncer, at least I can think that he is a has-been. He cannot even attack me honestly. He prefaced his remarks by saying how much more strongly he would have spoken if I had been a man. Why can he not see me as a member of ParUament, one who has made an honest mistake and is honest enough to say so? I often wonder why the honourable member for Hotham so vigorously denies that he is a male chauvinist. Maybe it is because he is a male chauvinist. I am not ever afraid to say that I have made a mistake. The only people who do not make mistakes are those who do not do anything, say anything or think. I wish the honourable member for Hotham the joy of his efforts, but I remind him that much more can be achieved by constructive thinking than by empty gestures such as 'fighting at the barricades'. for Hotham needs one. He would be far better employed serving his electorate than pouring criticism on me. I believe that we should speak to the BiU and not to irrelevant matters; so I shaU continue my remarks on the Bill. This BUI also provides for an increase of $1.50 a week for dependent children of pensioners and supporting mothers. This increases the amount for each dependent child to $7 a week. The overaU increase for a single pensioner with 2 children will be $8 a week. This is a far cry from the 25c or 50c a week increase we used to receive under the former Government when I was a pensioner. These increases will flow on to the special benefits and sickness benefits, to sheltered employment allowances and to unemployment benefits. The new policies in respect of widows or supporting mothers with one child and no property affecting will mean that such a person will now be able to receive other income to a higher level without losing her entitlement to a widow's pension. This wiU be a great incentive to single parents to re-enter the work force instead of being whoUy dependent on the pension. Age pensions will be payable free of means test to all those in the 70 to 74 years age group. Honourable members will recall that the first stage of the abolition of the means test was commenced in 1973. It is interestingto note that the Opposition means test entirely. I prefer to look at the Opposition's track record rather than to take the words of Opposition members at face value. The Opposition's track record shows that it had many years in which it could have abolished the means test but in fact it did nothing about it. Words cost nothing; it is deeds that matter. Unemployment benefits will now be paid weekly in advance instead of in arrears. This wUl assist those who are infinancialdifficulties. This afternoon the honourable member for Hotham insulted every person who is receiving unemployment benefits. He grouped them all together and called them bludgers. It must be great for the man who is out of work, who has a family and commitments and who may be listening to this debate, to be told that he is a bludger because he is coUecting unemployment benefits because he cannot get a job. Of course there are people in the community who are taking advantage of unemployment benefits. Did they suddenly pop up in 1972 when the Labor Government took office, or did they exist before? There wiU always be those who wUl take advantage of such a situation. I ask the honourable member for Hotham not to lump them all in together as bludgers. The appropriation legislation on which I made my mistake contained provision for extra loans to ex-servicemen. That is probably where I got so upset because some of those people who were waiting for defence service home loans had to take out quite expensive bridgingfinancebecause the Senate did not sit on and pass the legislation. I had those facts right; it was the other points on which I was wrong. I suggest to the honourable member for Hotham that, instead of attacking me, he should concentrate on making sure that his new Leader wUl ensure that the Senate will sit on and pass Appropriation Bills when they are needed. with interest to the apology by the honourable member for Henty( Mrs Child).

73,Mr Lloyd (Murray) (5.30),"I have listenedturn attacking the honourable member for Hotham( Mr Chipp). The honourable member made the point that the honourable member for Hotham had been a member of this House for 13 years and that he should have some sympathy for a member who has not been here very long. The alternative view that can be taken is that those who have not been here very long should be more careful before they go racing into print. If the honourable member is sincereI accept that she is-the Opposition would expect that she would now write to the same local newspapers, in the same way as she wrote before to blame the Liberal-National Country Party Opposition for what she said had occurred, and say that the mistake was hers and that it was not the fault of the Liberal-National Country Party Opposition that the Bills in question were not passed by both Houses of the Parliament. The Government, for some reason best known to itself and better known to the honourable member for Henty than to members on this side of the House, decided not to proceed with the legislation. This was after the offer had been made by the honourable member for Hotham that the Opposition would ensure a quick and speedy passage for the legislation. If the honourable member for Henty is completely sincere, as she said she isI have no doubt that she isI beUeve that she wUl write to the same newspapers letters setting out those facts and including the points that we have made, and make sure that those letters are pubUshed. I understand that with respect to the war service loans aspect, the honourable member may not be correct in her remarks and I suggest that that matter should be checked before anything further is said about it. I commend generally the provisions of the 2 Bills now before the House. Let me summarise in point form what they are. The Social Services BiU 1975 seeks to increase the single pension to $36 a tive answer to their apphcations. But in my elecweek. The pension will be provided means test free to those who are 70 years of age and over. The waiting time quaUfication will be cut out and the proposal to make unemployment, sickness and special benefit payable weekly in advance instead of weekly in arrears will, with the passing Looking at the Department of Social Security, of this BiU, reduce by 7 days thetimeit takes the claimant to receive a first benefit cheque. The almove from one State to another the transfer of lowance for dependent children will be increased by $1.50 a week. Special benefit will be payable immediately to persons newly discharged from gaol. Provision is also made for benefits to be paid to the credit of building society accounts. The Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill 1975 provides for service pensions to be paid free of means test to persons 70 years of age and over. That provision is comparable with the similar provision in the Social Services Bill. The BiU provides further that, in respect of those still subject to the means test for service disability pensions, 50 per cent of income wUl be disregarded in the assessment of the disabUity pension, with that part of the pension to be free of means test for application of other pensions. The service pension is to be extended to veterans of other Commonwealth countries who now reside in Australia. That latter aspect has been in the policy of the Australian Labor Party since the 1972 election. Quite a number of Commonwealth returned service men and women in my electorate had begun to despair that this proposal would ever be presented. But it is being presented now. I wish to comment on many of the points to which I have referred. The first which I mention is the payment in advance in respect of unemployment benefits and some other benefits. I note from the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security( Mr Hayden) that this procedure commenced on 13 January. In my electorate in January, February and March the payment of unemployment benefits was running anything up to 6 weeks behind. People in my area would be most surprised to hear that unemployment benefits were actually being paid a week in advance from 13 January. Let me give several examples to make a specific point. In this respect I am not in any way criticising the officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service office or the Social Security office in my electorate. These people were swamped. They worked very hard then, and they are still working hard. When one looks at the National Employment and Retraining Schemethe NEAT scheme-on efindsthat many people in dire circumstances are dependent on receiving or are hopeful that they wUl receive an affirmatorate at least, the processing of applications under the NEAT scheme is running months behind. These people can do no other planning as to what they will try to achieve for themselves. They have no idea when an answer wtil come. onefindsthat when people in receipt of pensions their pension entitlements takes some months. I wish to make the point constructively and sincerely that much of the administration of areas of our social welfare services, be it unemployment benefits, NEAT applications or other forms of pensions, is in a mess. It would greatly help people in need if they could get speedy answers, or answers at all, to some of their problems. I think many ordinary people are losing faith in the Canberra colossus of Government departments. Unless pressure is applied by somebody no result will be obtained. I think that the average person feels that damage is being done in social welfare areas particularly in a time of need. I support what previous speakers on this side have said about scandals in the payment of unemployment benefits. One of the better known ones, and one that has been publicised in the newspapers from time to time, involves interstate truck drivers who, as well as having a joba well-paid job-registe r for unemployment benefits at the start and end of their interstate truck runs. For example, a man driving from Melbourne to Adelaide registers in Melbourne and in Adelaide and obtains benefits in both places. At the present time there is no junior unemployment rate. Once a person turns 16 years he goes on the adult rate. I believe this is leading to the surrounding districts, which extend into 2 considerable social injustice. The Opposition Parties believe that there should be a reduced rate of unemployment benefit for juniors between 16 and 18 years of age. At the present time some apprentices are receiving less in take-home pay than they would receive if they were on unemployment benefits. This country needs apprentices as much or more than any other group of people. I know of 16-year-olds in my electorate giving up their jobs because the money available to them to spend if they work is less than if they do not work and receive the unemployment benefit. They are madefiguresof fun by their friends of the same age group, who ask: 'Why should you work when we can play around all day and be better off financially for it?' This problem was mentioned by the honourable member for Hotham. Not only are young people developing an attitude to life which is not conducive to playing a constructive working role in our society, but also a complete social injustice is agreed to establish an office there. This is just one being done to the vast majority of young people who want to do something for themselves and for the country. One of the problems associated with malpractices in the payment of unemployment benefits is the question of identification. False names can be used. It is hard to check them. We do not have an identity card system. It is quite common for people to obtain a driving licence when they reach 18 years of age. Perhaps drivers' licences could be used to identify people. I will welcome any criticism from speakers opposite on the points I make. Medibank cards will be available to everybody in the future. The question is whether they should be used as some form of identification of persons registering for unemployment benefits so that false names cannot be used, or at least double applications can be detected more easily than they can at the present time. The availability or proximity of an office of the Department of Social Security or Commonwealth Employment Service affects people in gaining satisfaction from Government departments. I congratulate the Government on the establishment of a number of new offices for both the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security. I and other members have been told, in answers to questions, where these offices have been established. I am afraid I must say that more of them have been established in metropolitan areas than in country areas. I want to give an example of the problem that people in my electorate face. Mine is a rural electorate, small in area. Echuca and States, have a population of 20 000 to 30 000 people. The nearest office of the Department of Social Security to Echuca is 50 miles away, in either Shepparton or Bendigo. Anybody who has any trouble in Echuca has to pay a very high trunk call charge to telephone either of these offices. Very little public transport exists and it is expensive. Generally people in country areas are of a higher average age than elsewhere and it has been pointed out that unemployment and other problems in relation to welfare are generally greater in the country than in the city. Country people are severely disadvantaged in their ability to contact an office and get some sort of satisfaction. I am pleased to say that the Minister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde Cameron) has agreed to the establishment of a Commonwealth Employment Service office in Echuca but so far the Department of Social Security has not example of a situation which exists in many country areas. I note also that the legislation provides for benefits and pensions to be credited to permanent building society accounts. Initially this will apply only in respect of child endowment. I am reminded of a debate which I think concerned the same subject of increases in pensions and which took place in this House about 8 months ago. I asked the Minister for Social Security what was happening with the suggestion that pensions and benefits be paid into bank accounts. I think such a method of payment would be of some value both to efficiency within the Department and to the beneficiaries, particularly those people who are now receiving pensions free of means test. I was told that either the system was already available or it soon would be. On checking with the Department of Social Security today I was told that it is still not available. cent increase in supplementary benefits or deI hope that the brave words of the Minister in his second reading speech, indicating that the payment of benefits to the credit of permanent building society accounts will be introduced, will be borne out a little more quickly than has the suggestion of making payment of benefits to the credit of bank accounts. Also, in the move to make payments to the credit of permanent building society accounts I hope that a similar arrangement in respect of bank accounts will not be overlooked. Will pensioners actually be any better off? The Government to claim that generally pensioners Minister stated in his second reading speech that are better off now than they ever have been. the basic pension of $36 per week will represent 24.5 per cent of average weekly male earnings in the December quarter.

I turn to the supplementary benefits and dependent chUdren's allowances. One of these payI believe that the Government injustice should ments is increased in this BUI. I think it is condo one of 2 things: It should continue to make ceded generaUy that the areas of greatest need the pension received by blind persons completely concern pensioners at the lowest level of income tax free throughout their Uves and not just to the who either need rent assistance or have dependent chUdren. We heard brave words in the Minister's second reading speech about an 80 per cent increase in the basic pension. However, it could not be said that there has been an 80 per pendent chUdren's allowances since Labor came to power. Why not? Surely these are the people in the area of greatest need; these are the people who should have received the greatest increases. So one cannot say that this group of pensioners is any better off. They wUl be worse off. But there is still the question: Are pensioners worse off? The major point against this Government is that inflation ruins people's savings. All the old people are having their savings reduced overnight by the ravages of widespread and galloping inflation. So to me it is absurd for this I refer to a specific inequality or injustice The transitional benefit is to be phased out by between 16 and 65 years of age receives a pension free of means test and free of tax but whose pension will be taxed the moment he or she turns various Treasurers of this Government pointing out this anomoly. age of 65; or if that produces problems in the Taxation Office, the transitional benefit of $3 a week should be continued permanently if that is the amount required to make up for the taxation that is levied on them. The legislation still leaves other problems of dignity of work? No matter what this Governweakness. A major problem concerns single ment does by this BUI or any other piece of legisfathers who have been deserted, widowed or lation, the overall result of the Government's divorced.

A different future heralds even more depression because of type of benefit is required because unlike the increased inflation, unemployment and excessive supporting mother-the widow or the divorceewho generally stays at home and needs income, the single father for a variety of reasons goes out to work and needs supportive services in the number of significant measures in this BUI.

I understand of pensions equal to 25 per cent of average that this system is used in some other countries. weekly earnings, though many people assumed This is particularly desirable if one can accept that the 3 year target appUed to that as well.

Obviously that has been the result of the fact that the married rate pension has not increased at double the increase of the single pension over the period since 1972.1 agree with the Minister's comments on this subject to the effect that the available evidence supports some continued differential. But in response to any criticism of unfulfilled commitment I think 2 other matters are relevant and worth saying. In thefirstplace, as I have already indicated, the commitment which we made and to which we have always referred was in terms of a $1.50 increase every 6 months. That commitment was always understood to refer to the single rate pension.

However, before doing that I shaU raise some general conGovernment siderations which come to mind as a result of the their cost of the measures included in this BUI.

In 1968 the whole cost of age, invaUd, widow, ditionally it was said, and said reasonably sickness, unemployment and special benefits was enough, that if the Opposition wants to reduce $594m.

Of course, the Opposition declined that contrast, this BiU provides $587m in additional invitation and there the argument seems to be benefits over a one year period alone. In other frozen, with the opposing parties at arm's length words, the increases in this BiU, for all practical and inflation meanwhile continuing at a very purposes, equal the entire cost of the pension serious rate. program as recently as 7 years ago and the entire cost of aU Social Welfare Act benefits as recently I believe that this social welfare debate proas 12 years ago. Ifindthat most impressive and vides a useful and appropriate occasion to take almost awe inspiring. Yet during the Minister's the matter at least one small stage further. We second reading speech I could not help being should ask ourselves, for a start, whether social struck by the fact that his announcement of the welfare programs have any role to play as part of sum involved did not seem to impress anyone the general case for wage restraint. I believe that except me. No one in the House sort of whistled they have. I suggest that on any logical basis that through his teeth, or said 'phew', 'wow' or 'that part of the case is irrefutable, just as the logic of is a hell of a lot of money'. WeU, it is a hell of a wage restraint as a trade-off against last year's lot of money and it puts a number of very heavy tax reductions is also irrefutable. Unfortunately, obligations upon us. Thefirstof those obUgations is to see that not the contrary, it still appears to be the general case only is this money well spent but also that it is that in Australia the term 'standard of living' is best spent, that we are not excessively generous equated with net disposable income. One of the in some areas at the expense of other areas which great frustrations of the Government has to be should be receiving more assistance than is now seen in its inabUity to persuade Australians that provided.

Our failure to gain acceptance of this proposition could have the most far reaching effect on AustraUan politics. On the one hand it could force the Labor Government to retreat from the fuU scale, rapid rate implementation of our programs. FaUing that, it could in the end defeat Labor, leading to a government which would not only retreat from our programs but also actively attempt to put them into reverse. In many respects this potential for a change in pace and direction in the very sorts of benefits provided by this BUI demonstrates one of the fundamental differences between the parties. The Liberal Party and the National Country Party say that they want a maximum of free personal choice in the application of personal income. The Labor Party says that there are expenditures that are so important and the unavailability of these benefits is so detrimental to people who simply do not have enough income to make that choice that we should make certain benefits universally avaUable. That involves substantial redistribution of income and is, of course, inconsitent with any unqualified view of free personal choice in the application of personal income. That is one of the choices AustraUans always make at election time, though no doubt the choice comes more clearly to attention during activist-that is, Labor Party-governments . I move from these more general considerations to just one or two specific items. Two areas trol. Finally and above aU, if nursing home which benefit from increases in this BUI are the supporting mother's benefit and the special benefit. I link them because the latter benefit is the only form of assistance to supporting fathers and is much less than the supporting mother's benefit, though the position of the 2 groups is not to this stage that sort of suggestion does not proonly analogous but also identical in principle. There is an $11 difference in direct benefits received by the 2 groups-$ 9 if there is not a cluid under 6 years of age involved-bu t a very significant difference exists also in the application of the respective means tests on allowable earnings. As I understand it, in roundfiguresa supporting mother can earn $ 120 a week without losing the whole of the mother's benefit, but the supporting father can earn only about half that sum before losing the whole entitlement to a special benefit. I wUl leave more detaU of this problem to another time, but the least that can be said about it now is that such an obvious anomaly has to be tackled. The estimates of cost, which I have seen, to put supporting fathers in the same position as supporting mothers in respect of benefits range between $20m and $30m. It may seem incongruous to raise this alongside an acknowledgment of calls for restraint; but this remains an area that is impossible to ignore with any sense ofjustice. There is one other particular area which I think must also be mentioned, though necessarily only briefly and in passing, and that is the position of nursing homes. A couple of weeks ago, in the last cycle of sittings, I asked the Minister for Social Security a question about nursing homes. Unfortunately, the Minister at that time felt unable to commit himself to additional aid. No doubt his concern was not to encourage expectations of an open-ended commitment. That concern is well based, as is his argument that it is not the role of the Government to guarantee the profitabUity of private homes. Hisreferenceto the new Government poUcy of meeting deficits of non-profit homes is also highly relevant; but, with every respect to the Minister's undoubted concern to combine maximum assistance with responsible management, I beUeve that additional factors have to be taken into consideration. Firstly, an open-ended commitment to nonprofit organisations carries no less dangers than such a commitment to profit making organisations. Secondly, relief fromfinancialpressures for non-profit organisations can readily lead to increased costs throughout both systems. The reason for that is that restraints on staff and salary demands can be largely removed. Thirdly, the profitabUity of private nursing homes is already effectively subject to government conpatients, the majority of whom are pensioners, are left with unbridgablefinancialgaps, where are they to go? To suggest that they should go to the non-profit homes is reasonable enough, but there are not enough of these available. At least vide the cure. Again this is not being strictly relevant to the BUI before us, so I do not develop it further now; but I raise it as a second area where, irrespective of any desire forrestraintin Government spending, additional and not less Government expenditure in the area of social security wUl be called for. I am sure that I am not the only member with suggestions for additional expenditure. The consideration that arises in the current economic framework is this: If the growth of expenditure overall is to be reduced, social security payments must play some part in the process, if only because social security payments are such a large proportion of the whole. So to paraphrase a question that was popular in earlier days, where are the savings to come from? There are some small ones which come to mind and which have been raised in this debate. There is an argument as to whether the 16-year-old unemployment benefit is too great. One could argue for or against that. I happen to come down personally in support of the proposition that they are probably excessive, and some small saving might be made there. I have heard it argued that there is as great a case for the unemployment benefit to be included in taxable income as there is for the inclusion of the age pension, with which it is now on parity. I am inclined to accept that proposition as well. But all that amounts to chicken feed. It will go nowhere near meeting the problem. The basic problem that has to be faced is that feel, however, that consideration should have there are only 2 major items of expenditure. One been given to increasing the rate payable to the is involved in keeping benefits to 25 per cent of wife of a special rate or a totally and peraverage weekly earnings and the other in conmanently incapacitated pensioner and, in fact, tinuing with the abolition of the means test.

However,firstI would like to make a brief comment, further to what previous speakers have said, on the statement by the honourable member for Holt( Mr Oldmeadow) during this debate that, in his opinion, the final abolition of the means test should be over a period of 5 years. I also noticed in the evening papers that the Minister for Social Security( Mr Hayden) has made similar suggestions to the Cabinet. This is in complete contrast to Government policy which is that the means test be abolished in the life of this Parliament. I suggest that it will be very difficult for the honourable member for Holt to explain to his electorate-if his and the Minister's suggestion is adopted-that because of its maladministration of the economy this Government cannot keep its promise to abolish the means test completely in the life of this ParUament. To revert to the Repatriation Acts Amendment BUI, I commend in particular the increase in pension rate for war and defence widows. I do able to assume that the allowance paid to the wife of the member should be increased also. I I notice that the BUI also provides for the abolment's objective of abolishing the means test for all service pensioners aged 65 years or over. Government's further ruling on this matter.

The service pensioner gets the advantage of a pension 5 years prior to his civilian counterpart. This is compensation for his service in a theatre of war. While he can receive this pension at 60 instead of 65 years of age, I notice that the means test abolition is applied under conditions similar to those applying to a civilian age pension. For instance, the means test will now be abolished at age 70. We hope the age will be further reduced to 65 next year-that is, if the idea of the honourable member for Holt does not get through. This means that while the ex-service member is entitled to receive an age pension at 60 years, the abolition of the means test does not apply to him under the present Bill until he is 70 years of age. If the ex-service member is entitled to a pension, as compensation, 5 years earlier than his civilian counterpart, why then is it that the abolition of the means test is not comI am pleased to note his interest in that matter. I parable? It almost appears that the payment of a service pension 5 years earlier than normal was resented and that no further consideration of compensation will be given.

I have said beforeI take about the other controversial element that has the point that the honourable member for Kalbeen entered into this debate-whethe r we goorlie has made-that this Government is not should phase out the 65 to 70 means test for all fully to blame for this situation.

But this morning I was listening to the Australian Broadcasting Commission 'AM ' program and I heard reference to the fact that in the United States, where there is considerable economic and technological expertise, at present the rate of unemployment is running at more than 9 per cent and inflation is running along with it. Various countries that we regard as having sophisticated econincreased by $3 to $28 a week. The war and deomies likewise are in the same dire straits. So if anyone has the recipe for overcoming this problem plenty of countries would be willing to have it and would probably pay dearly for it. changed governments but that has not necessarily achieved the desired result. government which I suppose is equivalent to the Opposition here. To change the Ford administration might not be a bad idea either but I will not buy into the problems of other countries; we have enough of our own. The Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill is one further step by this Government in what I regard as an epochmaking crusade on behalf of veterans and the dependants of veterans of all wars who fought on AustraUa's behalf. Things have happened in the last 2 h years that I never thought would happen x during the previous WVi years when I was an Opposition member of this ParUament. Things have happened during the 2 h years of the l Whitlam Labor Government that I think many people would never have expected from a government that was supposed to be a pacifist governmenta government allegedly not interested in defence. Things have been done in the repatriation field without honourable members crowing that the Returned Services League and ex-service bodies had direct access to the Cabinet of the day. The Government has introduced measures for humanitarian reasons and out of gratitude to all those ex-servicemen and ex-service women who have died and left dependants and those who are still with us but who have incurred disabUities. We have done our best to try to recompense them for the sacrifices they have made. In speaking to this BUI the honourable member for Herbert summarised some of its provisions. The highest rate of pension-the totally and permanently incapacitated pension-is to be increased by yet another $4. This is on top of an increase made in I think, November. This wUl raise the TPI pension to $68.10. In the limited time at my disposal I shaU show honourable members that most single TPI pensioners wUl get a lot more than $68.10. The intermediate rate pension for those ex-servicemen suffering disabUities which interrupt but do not prevent their work capacity or work operations wUl be raised by $3.50 to $48.05. What is called the general rate or 100 per cent pension rate will be fence widow's pension wUl be increased by $5 a week to $36 a week and the standard rate of service pension, which has already been mentioned as equivalent to an age or an invalid pension, will be increased by $5 a week to $36 a week. The married rate wUl be increased by $4.25 to $30 a week for each of the marriage partners. The means test on service pensions, as for age pensions provided under the Social Services BUI, will be aboUshed for all persons now 70 years of age or more. Already it has been abolished for those 75 years or more. Now we are taking it a further step to apply to those aged 70 to 74 years. War pensioners will get a further increase in pension because many war pensioners receiving the TPI rate will probably also be eligible for a very sizeable increase in their service pension since we have taken the second step towards wiping out from the means test the war pension and allowances that are provided for such war pensioners. I calculated, and I had the legislative Research Service of the Parliamentary Library check it for me to ensure that it was correct, that a single TPI pensioner wiU have half of his war pension of $68.10 disregarded for means test purposes. That wUl mean that not only wUl he get the $4 increase in his TPI pension but he will also gain another $8.50 in his service pension entitlement providing he has no more than $400 in savings. I know this sounds a little complicated, but the sum total of pension increase for such a TPI ex-serviceman wUl not go up by only the $4; it wUl in fact go up by $12.50 a week, after having had an increase back in November last. This would apply for other pensioners. DeaUng withfiguresin a debate Uke this when people do not have thefiguresin front of them is a difficult task.

This afternoon I heard the question asked whether pensioners are better off today than they were two or three years ago. I invite honourable members to go along to pensioner organisations, as I have done. Almost every individual there will say that he is substantially better off than he was. The table shows this in statistical terms. I will not bore the House by quoting from it. It shows that in some cases the pension rate has increased by more than twice the rate of increase in prices as measured by the consumer price index. The reality of the situation is the amount of goods and services that can be provided with the current pension, which is increased twice a year instead of, as in the past, sometimes only once in 2 years and then only by 50c or $1.

Lots of other people in the community would like to think that their superannuation, for instance, could be so disregarded for means test purposes. Members of the defence forces of British Commonwealth countries are now eligible for Service pensions providing that they have been resident in this country for 10 years. Many British ex-servicemen who took their discharge in Australia at the end of World WarI or World War II and who have paid taxes in this country for years ask why they cannot receive the benefits of a Service pension in the country of their adoption. It has happened now, and it has happened under a Labor Government. Then there is the matter of portability of pensions which works the other way. Persons who have received pensionswhether they are Australian born or ex-servicemen and women from British Commonwealth countries-lik e other kinds of pensioners in the community will be able to take their benefits with them to some other country and retire there if they wish to do so.

The Government will provide free repatriation hospitalisation and medical treatment for veterans of the Boer War and of World War I. Exservice organisations have been asking for this for many years. The Returned Services League has had it in its pension plan. The matter has been raised in this ParUament but nothing happened under any previous government. Within 2Vi years under the Labor Government all these things have happened.

If they are not ehgible to enter a repatriation hospital they can be heavily subsidised in nursing homes. One thing that has been asked for for years and which is now provided is the requirement that the repatriation boards and the entitlement appeal tribunals give reasons why they reject an application for a war pension.

I refer to the recognition of de facto wives and the provision for exnuptial children. This is a humanitarian act by the Government. The use of repatriation hospitals will be extended. Beds in repatriation hospitals were unused wlule many patients outsidecivUians as well as wives and chUdren of ex-servicemen-wh o were looking for hospital accommodation were not able to receive it. These beds wUl now be made available. This is not only a very humanitarian benefit for the patients but also it gives a broader experience to the medical staff who operate in repatriation hospitals. I have already referred to the abolition of the means test. There wUl be an extension of benefits to children of ex-servicemen and women. It wUl no longer stop at 16 years of age. If the child happens to be in full-time education the benefits wUl continue. The funeral benefit has been doubled from $50 to $100.

The Government has gone to the extent of saying that cancer sufferers automatically receive treatment. NowI want it to go one further step. All those ceive full repatriation hospital and medical treatment. One would have thought that this would have happened long before this. Honourable members wUl see that in the sphere of repatriation the Government has done a job that has earned very high praise from the ex-service organisations of this country.

The little return is related",63,Statistical Service
94,Mr Kevin Cairns (Luley) (8.39),"One has to the value of the $500m-odd proposed to be expended in the Bill. Quite frankly, the dollars to be expended are not worth the dollars that would have been expended a year or so ago, and therein lies the very great tragedy. There is both joy and sadness in this measure. There is joy because the Government is dealing with at least 5 areas. It is dealing with an increase in the standard rate of pension. It has further liberalised the . means test. It is dealing with those who are newly out of gaol. It is allowing certain moneys to be paid in respect of building societies and other areas and, as significantly as all the others, it has those people who are concerned with the payacted to enable unemployment benefits to be paid very quickly to those who qualify for the unemployment benefits. It is worth spending a few moments in dealing with the increase in the standard rate pension. The standard rate pension is to be increased to $36 a week. So, it is said immediately that the contract or undertaking of the Government to make that pension payment equivalent to a quarter or 25 per cent of average male weekly earnings has been met. There is a litde deception in that. The deception is significant. During the period oftimefor which the payment of this $36 a week will operate-it will operate up until late September or October-it will not be worth 25 per cent or a quarter of average male weekly earnings; it will be worth something like 21.5 per cent of average male weekly earnings, which is a very significant difference. It is this little decepcause the most binding social contract which a tion which ought to anger those on the opposite side who have preached to the people over and over again the virtue of a government which, frankly, is paying benefits in devalued dollars. In fact, the average shortfall in the value of that pension over the period for which it is to operate, which is from now until the end of September, is nearly $6 a week in today's money values. So there is a very great deficiency. The deception deserves to be exposed for what is is. It is a tragedy that this has happened. Immediately one says that, Government supporters will say to us: 'You people say that if you were in Government you would cut Government spending and that Government spending should be less'. Nobody in hisrightmind would say that a domestic deficit of $l,700m or $l,800m is wrong. The tragedy is that a domestic deficit of that size is needed even to get the economy going at the very sluggish rate at which it is going today. There is real concern when one detects in the minds of Government members the idea that that domestic deficit is not to be phased out and that it is something they look at with glee and to be continued indefinitely into the future. So let us rid ourselves of this silly argument concerning the size of the Government's deficit. We will see the phasing out of that according to how private industry in Australia gets going again. Of course, that is related very intimately to the $500m involved in this Bill. I only wish that all of those dollars were worth what they appear to be worth atfirstglance; but apparently they are not. The devaluation of the $6 a week increase in pension to which I have referred during this period is not a big deception; but it is a significant one. It is a very significant deception for ment. It is a very significant deception which makes the pension far less valuable than it otherwise would be. I say this, believing that there would be little chance of contradiction: At the time at which this Government will go to an election the pension payable will not be equivalent to 25 per cent of the then average male weekly earnings. I say that that promise of the Government will not be kept. Let us not engage in little deceits by changing the time period for which the calculations are to be done. The real sadness in the Bill relates to the unemployment benefits. They are to be paid immediately and much more quickly than in the past, but the tragedy is that the pressures which have caused this to come about are some of the most dynamic and some of the saddest of this nation. After all, they have become necessary begovernment can give to Australia has been broken. I read again from the White Paper on Full Employment introduced into this Parliament on 30 May 1945 while John Curtin was still Prime Minister. It is the most binding and significant social undertaking given to all Australians. On that occasion the Government had this to say, courageously and not frightened of not being able to carry out its promise: Full employment is a fundamental aim of the Commonwealth Government. The Government believes that the people of AustraUa wUl demand and are entitled to expect full employment. Unemployment is an evil from the effects of which no class in the community and no State in the Commonwealth can hope to escape unless concerted action is taken. That undertaking or promise was given while Australia was still at war. At thattimeAustralia was still involved in World War II. John Curtin was still Prime Minister of this nation. He was not to be Prime Minister for very much longer. But, with the confidence of being able to deliver the benefits of that promise, the promise was made. All decent Australians should applaud that contract; but it has been broken. There was no fear then on the part of the Government. There were no statements that the Government made the promise so long as unemployment was not imported or that the promise was made on the understanding that inflation was not imported. The undertaking was given without qualifications. Australian workers and AustraUan business-a U AustraUans-said : 'We support that proposition'. The promise has been broken. There are one or two areas of sadness and conbe out of work who otherwise would not be out cern in respect of the unemployment benefit of work. Nobody says that the Government which up to this moment have not been explored. should do this. What we say is quite clear. I wUl It is much easier for a person to register for employment than to receive an unemployment state benefit.

The Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill contains provisions which combine with those in the Social Services Bill. The Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill authorises changes in the Repatriation Act and the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act. The Bill provides for increases and other improvements in repatriation benefits foreshadowed in last year's Budget. It also authorises an increase in the war and defence widows pension fate. This is one of the aspects of the Budget of 1974-75 still in the rnind of the AustraUan Government.

The honourable member for Perth made it apment, had faUed to make it clear to the Australian people that the whole standard of living had to be seen in the context of the national income. It must be seen in the context of what the country can afford. This is a very different line of argument for people who, to the best of my knowledge, have been arguing since 1949 when I first came into this place that it is within the capabiUty of the Government of AustraUa to look after people from the cradle to the grave. In almost every election campaign that I can recall, the proud boast of the Australian Labor Party has always been that it would be able to outbid all members of other poUtical parties in their attempts to influence the Australian people and to induce them to beheve that the Commonwealth of AustraUa wUl be able to provide for aU of them from the cradle to the grave simply if they vote for the AustraUan Labor Party. I submit to you, Mr Speaker, that in the next 12 months pale into insignificance. It is against that background that I believe we should look with great seriousness and good sense at these It is understandable for people to have their improving from year to year. I take the view that expectations have been degree that is quite sad. In comfrom LUley, I hold the view are coming up and which must be dealt with in the Budget for 1975-76 are problems which will affect the welfare of all AustraUans, and in their direct capaciadopted. ties they must be able to withstand the impact of the pohcies that will be introduced. A great deal has been said about taxation. Nothing is ever said about the diminution in the value of the doUars that are picked up. Those doUars, when they are received into the ConsoUdated Revenue Fund, are less and less able to do the things which they were able to do some years ago. No reference has been made, for example, to the savings of pensioners. I refer to people who are age pensioners, invaUd pensioners and war widows. People such as these are now sitting back and looking at the sums of money that they have in the bank, and it is graduaUy dawning upon them that at this stage in the AustraUan society that money is losing its value at the rate of 16 per cent per annum. I think it was Professor Friedman who said recently that any government which stood up and said: 'Vote for us; we are going to put an insidious 16 per cent tax on aU of your incomes' would not get the vote of any person who could add up.

101,Mr Wilson (Sturt) (9.3),"The purpose ofDuring recent years much public attention has been focused on the need for more effective policies relating to the care and education of the preschool child, but those who have been most vocal have more often than not had a special interest in only a single aspect of the total problem. For example, many have rightly wanted to see an expansion in the availabihty of pre-school education, whilst others have been more concerned to press for the provision of a greater number of child care centres. The former group place emphasis on the educational needs of children, especially those in the 3 to 5 year old age group. The latter are anxious to overcome the problem of the care of children whose parents need to work. There has been much report writing about each of these areas of concern, but little attempt to define a comprehensive philosophy as to the care and education of children. The Fry Committee's report, though entitled 'Care and Education of Young Children', concentrated heavily on the educational role of both pre-school and day care centres and the need to use professional and sub-professional staff in each. The Social Welfare Commission in its report entitled 'Project Care-Children Parents Community' put greater emphasis on the urgent need for good quality custodial care and other childhood services, especially for those in greatest need. It paid the community in general or children in little attention to the role of parents as the primary care givers and how they should be supported in that role. It considered substitute care rather than mother care. The Priorities Review Staff was then asked to public awareness and national concern. Firstly, report on these reports. It did so in a paper enthe distinction has sometimes created the imprestitled 'Early Childhood Services'. The principal sion that education and care are mutually exclusrecommendation of this report was that the reive concepts, when they are not. They are closely sponsibility of co-ordinating and administering inter-related, especially for the 3 to 5 year old. these services should be assigned to a Minister Secondly, the distinction has often hidden the without vested interests.

Thirdly, the call for the Hayden) were all excluded on this ground, and provision of pre-school education outside the responsibility was given to the Special Minister home has led to the assumption that concern for of State( Mr Lionel Bowen). Despite this move, care should be limited to that provided outside the comprehensive nature of the problem has not the home. There is now a growing public recogbeen fully recognised. Perhaps this is because the nition and expression of the view that there is no platform of the Australian Labor Party with ideal substitute for home and family life for the regard to childhood services deals primarily with young child. At its 1974-75 annual conference the care of children other than that provided at the New South Wales Federation of Infant home by their parents. Such an approach has the School Clubs called upon the Government 'to unfortunate consequence apparently deplored ensure that no pre-school child is deprived of his by the Minister for Education that it assumes the or her mother's care for financial reasons, eclipse of the family. The definition of 'services for children' contained in the Bill besides including the education of pre-school age children includes only services to children 'not being cared for in their own homes' other than services to those children who are described as having special needs. The reference to general assistance to parents in relation to raising children does not appear to contemplate the provision of comprehensive assistance. When read in that overall context of the definition, its intended content seems very narrow. Increasing public concern is being expressed at the ad hoc approach to policies and programs relating to children. In my view the establishment of a commission with the purposes set out in this Bill will not enable the Commission to do what many like the New South Wales Federation of Infant School Clubs think it should do, namely 'establish a philosophy in relation to ultimate goals incorporating standards, innovations, needs and priorities in relation to families'-and I emphasise 'families'-'and the community'. What is urgently needed is a clear definition of the philosophy behind the nation's approach to pre-school care and education. The role of the family, and in particular the mother, must be clarified. Without a philosophy there is danger that ad hoc decisions designed to help individually deserving cases will promote trends which will not be in the overall best interests of particular. The tendency to distinguish between the care of the pre-school child and the education of that child has led to an unfortunate narrowing of especially in thefirst3 years'. Most AustraUan families either choose to care for their pre-school age chUdren, especially those of 3 years of age and under, or would like to be of young cluldren is that everybody is doing it. able to make that choice. The major objective of The emphasis now being placed on personal any child care policy should be to make this possfulfilment for women in their non-maternal role ible for those who, through economic and social provides further incentive over and above the pressure, are now unable to do so.

Programs emphasis on the importance of the maternal role which provide substitute care should be struchas, I believe, suffered on both counts, and there tured to fulfil a genuine need and not so as to creis now a need to help contemporary women ate a need where today none exists.

To do this we must recognise that there are a wide range of economic and social policies grips with the core of the problem.

Pressure of In speaking of the hallmarks of the develop. . . to give effect to our concern for those who need our help we would be developing policies to assist mothers forThis will be our endeavour. We are sorry that this Bill does little to provide these mothers with the real assistance they need. I was interested to receive in the post yesterday disseminate information to and from the comthe April edition of the Queensland State Service Union newsletter. In it the Union drew attention to the hardship caused to the single income family by excessive taxation. This burden can be overcome in 2 ways: Either by the mother, irrespective of the ages of her children, going to work, or by significant tax reforms so that the current discrimination against the single income family is removed. The Union suggested a number of measures to remove some of the discrimination. Such suggestions included consideration of voluntary income splitting of the incomes of husband and wife; the restoration of concessional deductions for dependent spouses and dependent children to realistic levels; the restructuring based mother. Social isolation can be overcome of the tax scale on an overall basis; an increase in by measures designed to create or return comchild endowment; and the restoration of the deduction for education expenses. These and many other proposals, such as some form of family income maintenance or a mothers' allowance, are deserving of detailed study and appraisal in an attempt to design a policy for the care and education of the pre-school child. In addition to reducing the financial pressures tablishment. The provision of child care centres which prematurely force women out of work available for occasional use, the suitability and there is a need to help parents to understand and availability of playgrounds together with the provide for the needs of their young children. provision of community amenities such as Community situations in which parents can, with libraries and toy-lending services, can also progrowing enjoyment and confidence, make best vide valuable support to a mother engaged in the use of their own knowledge and resources in the full-time care of a child. development of their children must be promoted. Equally important is the design of policies and programs which will enable the mother of young could be given to individual famihes to overcome children, while giving primary importance to her thefinancialdifficulties that now face them when role as a mother, to maintain her interests and the mother chooses to provide full-time home social contacts in such a way that the combibased care is to change those laws and practices nation gives her, taking life as a whole, adequate which now discriminate against fanulies which opportunity for self-realisation, both within and make this choice.

If famiUes are to be given the opportunity of providing adequate home based care for their young children, measures with both direct and indirect consequences must be introduced to ensure that a real choice is available where today no real choice exists.

Employment is not the only answer to the loneliness sometimes experienced by the home munity living to suburbs where it has never existed or where it has been depleted. This can be done in a wide variety of ways, including the encouragement of play groups and toddlers groups which provide opportunities for social interaction of mothers as well as their children. Though these groups are based on the principle of self-help, there is a need to stimulate their esBut the most significant way in which support curity programs we have so often been wholly absorbed in achieving an equitable vertical and those where the requirement and demand believed that adequate child care centres need to give a child responsive appreciation and predictable warmth of the type that would be available in the home. It is to be hoped that in expanding the number of available places in child care centres through local government and other community groups adequate recognition will be given to the role of the private child care centres which to date have provided more than 70 per cent of care facilities. A pluralistic approach should be followed and the Australian Federation of Child Care Associations and its constituent members should be given appropriate recognition and encouragement. Though it is most desirable that family day care schemes should be expanded, this should occur only if subject to close supervision and regulation as to the standards of care to be made available in this way. Family day care has its strengths and weaknesses, but care provided by those working in a substitute mother role through the family day care schemes needs to be evaluated. Such schemes should take their place among the whole range of child care facilities and not be seen as a magic formula in looking after children who are away from their parents. We would have liked to find in the Bill greater emphasis both on the need for research into the munity that would prefer to provide such care, care and education of pre-school children and on policies and programs must be appraised and rethe importance of evaluating the effect of those designed to produce those results which are programs which no doubt will be supported by wanted by the community at large rather than the Commission.

Organisations knowledge of the benefits to be gained, those which have developed a distinctive style in the concerned with child care and those in public life provision of child care facilities or education for have been able to spread the message widely.

I refer to items such as assistance to greatest needs can be established. Those who parents in connection with the care of their sick through their own efforts demonstrate the willingness to accelerate the date of the provision of facilities ahead of the priorities determined for them must be informed as to whether or not they will receive any assistance. If self-help can be encouraged in the short run, in the long run more resources will be available to those in greatest need. Those who are now willing to raise funds to establish facilities should not be penalised on a dollar for dollar reduction in the Government's support available to them either in the short run or in the long run. The Government and the Commission must make it clear to concerned community groups whether community effort will be rewarded or whether they should sit back and wait until their turn comes for an allocation out of the public purse. I conclude by again drawing to the attention of the House the fact that there is no doubt that the widespread provision of early childhood services involves a major piece of social engineering. The manner of this provision will inevitably have profound effects on social practices. These effects may be largely a matter of conjecture. It is important that an attempt be made to predict their outcome in order that the purposes of the community can be fulfilled and not denied.

It was housed in an old, disused, demountable school structure and sector and those which are funded by the Government, such as the centre recently established in the Belmont Shire with which I am acquainted. But this brings about a continuing problem for those children once they leave the day care centre and enter the normal schooling stream. They are left unattended before and after school. Because they have been subject to an orderly, supervised and directed type of life, they are less able to adjust to those unsupervised hours. This is one reason why I suggest that there is an urgent need to make a continuing provision for such children. Another unfortunate factor also applies in October 1972 the Child Welfare Grants Act was relation to the holiday period. When school passed.

In his second reading speech the Minister reiterated the poUcies of the Australian Government, its emphasis on the particular needs of the people, of working, single or sick parents of Aboriginal, migrant, handicapped and isolated cluldren.

105,Mr Millar (Wide Bay) (10.4),"Having thesocial, has again been put aside as a problem which perhaps can resolve itself. Many of these questions and proposals emanating from the Bill are attached directly to whether we continue to accept the one income family as the norm within AustraUa. These famUies are being forced into the area of the poverty stricken and we seem indifferent to the circumstances that bring this about. We are increasingly accepting a multiple income famUy as the pacesetter in our community. WhUst we justify this as a measure to offset the impact of inflation, it may weU be argued in some cases whether the multiple income family is indeed not contributing to inflation. The honourable member for Casey( Mr any scheme, no matter how laudably motivated, Mathews) here a few nights ago made an observation which I think acted as a tribute to his pertimited success, if any success at all. Sub-clause 3 ception. He said that the expectations of our society possibly are considerably higher than properly may be the case, that this is subjecting our economy and our society to great stresses because we have been aiming too high, aiming beyond our entitlement, seeking more than in actual fact we can pay for, more than we have a moral entitlement to. Here in this BUI we attempt to establish a Utopia which wUl accommodate all people regardless of their degree of individual responsibility. Unquestionably many of these facilities are urgently required to meet the needs of those people who have no opportunity to implement alternative measures. But it also creates a wonderful opportunity for people to put aside completely their prime responsibUity as parents and, in this case, particularly as mothers. No one would suggest, particularly in this International Women's Year, that we should deny in any shape or form therightof a woman to fulfil herself in whichever venue or through whichever avenue she might so desire. But I think it could be described as axiomatic that one cannot have one's cake and eat it too. We tend here to denigrate the status of motherhood and the status of the fanuly. I do not invite argument as to what the status of the fanuly actually may be in this context. Of course I have an opinion of my own. But this BUI seems to suggest that one can please one's self whether one has neither or whether one has both because the State unquestionably wUl pick up the tab. If that is what the population wants at the price of $885m over 10 years it is their prerogative to indicate clearly through the elected government that that should be the case. It depends very heavUy on skiUed and expert knowledge in the social welfare area. Some of these activities may become increasingly questionable if we transfer the critical responsibUities of the famUy to the State. It wUl have the incidental effect of taking up the great surplus which wUl result from the overtoil in education in which modern society has engaged, and certainly wUl reUeve a great deal of the worries and responsibiUties of social graduates. The BUI is fairly lucid. It accepts the latch key cluldren as an essential part of modern society. Again it may be argued whether we have to 'accept a situation in which more and more of these chUdren wUl be left to their own devices without moral guidance. Sub-clause 3 (g) simply caUs for the promoting of the physical or mental development of chUdren. It seems to overlook entirely the question of moral guidance. After all, that ignores the moral issues can meet with only (d) reads as follows: (d) the care of physically or mentally disabled or handicapped children at atimeor times of the day when they are not being provided with a prescribed service and are not being cared for in their own homes; I am heartened to find in that sub-clause the suggestion that some of the brain damaged chUdren in my electorate who are receiving assistance, instruction and direction under the scheme for the achievement of human potential which has currently defied the best offices and intentions of the Government, wUl be reUeved of some of their most pressing problems. In that respect the BUI seems to be all-embracing. There seems to be a great predUection on the part of the Government or of those who drafted this BUI at all times to relate the facUities to the matter of relieving parents who are engaged in employment, as if this is the only group which can properly claim the sympathy and the service of the Government. Again this denigrates the traditional famUy institution. DarUng Downs says, the mother who stays at home must now bear the brunt of the financial and social hardships because her deprived chUdren suffer discrimination among their peers in their schools and in their social activities. It is quite clear that, as a complement to this Commission in endeavouring to reUeve the problems of our young, the Government and society as a whole must initiate an investigation and give the most serious thought to whether we have changed our social structure so much that the single income fanuly now becomes an anachronism and whether we must make all those necessary",78,Children S Commission Bill 1975

108,Mr Dawkins (Tangney) (10.13),"Iriseto primary centres as being part of the primary secchildren under 5, could be handed over to the Education Department. The only reason such a facility would be handed over to the Education Department would be to provide a pre-primary centre for children of 5 years of age for the year before they attend primary school proper, that is, in the year in which they turn six. This is a most blatant attempt to fudge the system and to muddy the waters in order that the Western AustraUan Government can obtain money for one purpose, and then effectively confiscate the faculfor the care of chUdren between 4 years of age ties provided in order to salvage a confused pre-election promise that it made last year. I should say that the reason this situation has come about is that even though the AustraUan Government, through the Interim Committee for a ChUdren's Commission did fund the preprimary centres last year the Special Minister of State( Mr Lionel Bowen), on a recent visit to Western AustraUa, indicated quite clearly that in future the ChUdren's Commission would not fund the pre-primary program of the Western AustraUan Government. I believe that this is a quite proper action on the part of the Minister for the foUowing reasons: Firstly, in all other States the accommodation of 5-year olds is a matter for the primary education sector and is subject, in relation to Federal assistance, to grants from the Schools Commission. Secondly, if the AustraUan Government commits itself to funding a preprimary program it wUl leave itself very Uttle opportunity for expanding chUd care and other services which it intends to provide throughout the country. I am not interested to condemn out of hand the pre-primary program of the Western AustraUan Government. But I think that the realisation has to be arrived at by the State Government that the program must be funded in the proper way. If the centres are, as the State Government clearly admits, part of the primary school sector, they ought to be funded as part of that sector. The State Government should not try to fudge the issue by trying to gain capital assistdetermined by the ChUdren's Commission. I am ance from the Interim Committee and then confiscate those facilities for uses other than those for which the initial grants were made. It is true that the people of Western AustraUa are in great need of all the other sorts of services which it is intended wUl be provided by the ChUdren's Commission. I refer to the second reading speech of the Special Minister of State in which he indicated that some of the other services which would be provided would include full day care, famUy day care, pre-school education of course, emergency care, occasional care, before and after school and vacation care, play groups and other chUd care activities in accordance with demand. I think that in saying this we all have to recognise that the needs of the Australian people, including the Western AustraUan people, are extremely great. The statistics that are uncovered and reported in the report of the Social Welfare Commission for 1972-73 are worth considering. They reveal that 365 000 chUdren under the age of 6 years were the chUdren of working mothers. The report went on to state that 437 000 people who were responsible and 11 years of age made no arrangements for the care of those children after school hours. I do not think that we can ignore the needs which clearly exist for the provision of the sorts of services which this Government certainly wants to provide. So in relation to that I ask the Minister to look very carefuUy at the arrangements that the Western AustraUan State Government is trying to bring about which would aUow it to swindle Western AustraUans and provide only for this hybrid pre-primary program instead of sharing in the rest of the opportunities which are avaUable under this excellent program. ChUdren's Commission BUI 1975 establishes a new commission with a nqw title. No honourable member would object to what ought to be the aims of the ChUdren's Commission as given to us in terms of its title. But in a few words, the work of this Commission wUl be judged on the balance that it achieves in relation to the care of aU chUdien. After all, 2 points are made in the second reading speech of the Special Minister of State( Mr Lionel Bowen). Thefirstone is that this Bill is intended to care for over 160 000 cluldren but that ultimately-thi s is the second point-accord ing to the principles of the Commission, all children in Australia within a certain age group are to be cared for by the year 1980. It is in relation to those 2 matters that one has to judge the balance that wUl occur in the care of chUdren as concerned that that balance be preserved and that artificial measures of need, artificial measures of poverty or artificial measures of care are not put upon the chUdren who are, after all, stUl the cluldren of their parents. I detect that under this BUI there is to be attempted an unnecessary bureaucratisation of the care of chUdren in AustraUa. After all, if the $75m which is proposed to be spent under this measure becomes a substitute for money that would otherwise be spent on fanuly assistance avaUable to parents of cluldren in the home, are we to say that that represents a net improvement in respect of the care of chUdren? When people",80,Children S Commission Bill 1975
109,Mr Kevin Cairns (Luley) (10.24),"Thewrite rules-especiall y when a central government writes rules-wit h respect to children it ought to be remembered that those children are still their parents' children and belong to nobody else. At this stage I will introduce one or two economic facts that ought to be borne in mind. One accepts the expenditure of the $75m set aside under this Bill. But at the same time one must bear in mind that the family assistance available to parents of children to spend in their homes for a family has declined from 1.7 per cent of the gross domestic product to .4 per cent of the gross domestic product. I sense in this Bill a substitution of this $75m, or an attempted substitution, for money that should be spent in other ways. After all, family assistance programs in AustraUa which have hitherto been carried out have abided by the principle of freedom of choice. They were avaUable to parents to spend money on their chUdren as they sought and as they desired. Therefore, it is in that sense that it is this buUding a few months ago to members of the whole balance of the program that ultimately will determine its validity, its respect and its support in the AustraUan community. The progress of a people-naturally , I refer to of 23 years and was tortured most cruelly and the progress of the AustraUan people-is very barbarously in turn first by German Nazis and intimately connected with the progress of later by Russian Communists.

This is something which is of vital interest to the security of AustraUa. Is the honourable member for Fraser now to say that the AustraUan Government is acting unwisely when it looks at the security of the AustraUan people? Let him draw from the present defeat at least this lesson: We have to look to AustraUa's defences now in a new Ught. We have to be more self-reUant. Unless we can do this the very survival of the Australian people is at risk. He likes to talk in scornful tones of the possibUifind ourselves victims of the communists because ties of communists from the north coming down to AustraUa. It would be fooUsh to use such scornful tones because the thrust is there. The things that we said might happen are happening. The communist threat is now very much nearer to us than it was. When he watches on television what has been happening on the streets of Saigon or some other town in South Vietnam he might think perhaps that those scenes could be enacted in Pitt Street or CoUins Street, or in the main street of any of the AustraUan capitals.

Even if she had the wUl she no longer has the power. The United States of America still has the power, but what about the voices that are being raised from the Government encouraging isolationism in the United States? That is what honourable members opposite are doing. The propositions that are corning from the Government are treason to Australian because they are inciting our American friends to abandon us if we face the kind of situation which Vietnam has faced and against which we have no protection in our own power of defence at the moment. Our defence forces are a jokea very bad joke, a joke which none of us likes to contemplate. There is virtuaUy no power in them now. What are we to say of a government which incites the Americans to retreat into isolationism and withdraw the shield? What are we to think of a government which denigrates past policy which, whatever else it may have done, has at least ensured that for the present Indonesia is and-communist and not pro-communist. If the present Government had had its way in the past, I feel certain that we would now have a communist Indonesia on our borders. That creates speculation which it is very uncomfortable to contemplate. The present Government has a long history of the shortcomings of the honourable member for betraying Australia to the communists. I Mackellar, that would not happen to him. But remember very clearly when it was considered in the speech that he has just made is so Ul-timed this House to be a matter of grave offence to say because we read in the media today that the to any member of the AustraUan Labor Party that he was an aUy of the communists. I have been removed from this chamber because I refused to withdraw the statement that there was communist infiltration into the Labor Party. I do not beUeve that Government supporters would consider this offensive now, because it stands complete and proved that there is communist infiltration into the Labor Party and it is shown by the Labor Party's poUcy. Without telling the electorate it has taken us into the communist orbit. If the Government has its way we are going to we have faUed to stand up to them and have alienated the only people who couid protect us from them. I beUeve that whatever be the responsibUities of an Australian Government, its first responsibUity is the security of the AustraUan people. This Government has been betrayed that security by permitting the defence forces to be eroded and by the insults it has given to our aUies 6n the very point of intervention to protect an innocent country from communist aggression because it was communist aggression.

Australia Wage Indexation (Question No. 1376) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: (1) Did he say on 23 January 1974 that he was convinced that the introduction of wage indexation would cause unions to confine their demands to increases based on increased productivity and technological change. (2) If so, has he received an assurance from any union to this effect. (3) Is so, from which unions. (4) If not, what is the basis of his statement. (5) Did he also say on 23 January 1974 that there would be no need for an annual National Wage Case if wage indexation was introduced. Mr Clyde Cameron-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (4) On 23 JanuaryI made a statement which read in part: 'As a result of broad ranging talks which I have held with trade union leaders, I am now convinced that if wage indexation is re-introduced unions will make no future wage demands based on rising prices but will confine their national productivity, work value or other special circumdemands to increases based on increased productivity, technological change and related matters.' As the honourable member will be aware, in 1974 and again in 1975 the AustraUan Government made submissions to the AustraUan Conciliation and Arbitration Commission supporting the re-introduction of quarterly cost of living adjustments. In the light of the 1974 decision and developments in the industrial relations and economic situation since thattime,in ings by the ACTU, to comply with the principles of wage the 1975 National Wage Case the AustraUan Government submitted that the Commission adopt a system of wage indexation based on the following four principles. (1) Indexation adjustments would take place quarterly and automatically upon the pubUcation of the consumer price index figure. (2) Where at the date of adjustment, the award rate of an employee was not more than thefigurefor the seasonaUy adjusted average weekly earnings per employed male unit most recently published by the AustraUan Government Statistician(a) the award rate would automatically be increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price that the substance of this dialogue is being considered by the index; Higher P/G Doct.

(4) There would be no wage increases on account of price increases except as provided above. Wage increases would otherwise be Umited to those on account of changes in stances, but not including changes in relativities. This system of wage indexation would continue for 2 years and then be subject to review. It is clear from the reading of the four principles I have just outlined that the Government is not supporting wage indexation unconditionally. The Government s support for indexation is dependent, in part, on the receipt of acceptable undertakings from the union side, as embodied in undertakfixation laid down by the AustraUan Government. However, if the ACTU was not prepared to accept the conditions set out in paragraphs 1 to 4 above the Government would support a decision of the Commission to approve wage indexation in principle, but to introduce it on an award-by-award basis upon the receipt of suitable undertakings from individual unions. During the course of the proceedings the ACTU responded to the AustraUan Government submission and gave certain assurances. The Australian Government commented on the ACTU response and gave what it regarded as a proper interpretation of those assurances. The ACTU subsequently responded to that interpretation. I would imagine AustraUan ConciUation and Arbitration Commission in reaching a decision on the claim for the introduction of wage (2) Will implementation of the scheme be beneficial to indexation. (S) In my statement of 23 January 19741 said that, if wage public. indexation were introduced, future National Wage Cases should disregard price movements and that there would no scheme. longer be a need for a National Wage Enquiry every year to consider the effect of price movements as is now the case. The Government's submissions in the recent National Wage Case hearing included a proposal for an annual National able member's question is as follows: Productivity Conference or Case to distribute national productivity improvement on an equitable basis. BI MARK: Market Forecasting Scheme (Question No. 1502) (1) Has he or his predecessor received submissions from the originator of the market forecasting scheme known as Mr Berinson asked the Minister for Education, upon notice: (1) What funds were provided for pre-school education (a) by the AustraUan Government and (b) from the States, own resources in each State in 1973-74.

A further comparatively small cost would also apply to non-contributory units included in pension entitlements which fell due on or after 4 June 1969. However, quite extensive research, computer work and further actuarial calculations would be necessary to isolate these details, which are not specifically required during the normal management of the scheme. cost of conversion from age 65 retirement to age 60 retirement for contributors whose(i) non-contributory units, and (ii) contributory units would not become available until age 65. In the aggregate, as at 30 June 1972 the additional capital value of the benefits to befinancedby the Government following such a change, including updating on the basis presently used, has been estimated as $784m if all contributors were to retire on attaining age 60. No estimate can be made of the cost to contributors for converting the employee proportion of age 65 units to age 60 units. Any such change would be reflected in additional contributions or in a reduction in the employee-financed proportion of pension benefits.",92,Bimark If So When

It is unlikely to be a significant alternative source of cellulose for AustraUan industry and export.

The grounds on which the powers are exercisable relate principally to the protection of policy holders of a company.

He indicated that such legislation will allow proposals to be considered in the broader context of the public interest, with particular reference to the qualifications of directors. I hope that the Government will consider shortly the particular provisions to give effect to this policy.

(3) What sum has been paid out in relation to the centre, for what purposes, and to whom. Affairs has provided the following reply to the honourable member's question: (1) On3 June 1974 I approved the construction of a cultural centre at Nowra with an upper limit on cost, including land but excluding architect's and other fees, of $220,000 based on April 1974 prices. On3 June 1974 the South Coast Aboriginal Cultural Centre Limited received a $2,000 grant for the purpose of architect's fees.

Mr Lionel Bowen-The Minister for Repatriation and Compensation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Statistics compiled by the Department of Repatriation and Compensation concerning veterans of World War II do not record the involvement of individuals or groups in separate incidents during the war. As the Depanment holds almost one million sets of personal case records pertaining to ex-servicemen and women who served in the 1939-45 war it would not be practicable to search for the required information.

154,Mr Enderby,"The answer to the honourable(2) In 1972 a company submitted to the Department advance samples of toys which it intended to import. The Department was asked to determine the lead content of the paint used on the toys. The resultant analysis showed a level of lead in excess of that recommended in the then draft National Health and Medical Research Council standard relating to paints and it is believed the importer did not proceed with the importation. There has been no similar request since that time. (3) See (2) above. (4) I am concerned that such potentially dangerous toys could be imported into this country. However, the Department has been examining this problem for some time and in fact was represented on the Standards Association of Australia drafting committee for Australian Standard 1647-1974 Children's Toys and Playthings (Safety Requirements). Among other recommendations this standard limits the level of poisonous metal in paint used on toys. The Attorney-General's Department is currently considering a proposal to prescribe that Standard as a consumer product safety standard under Secdon 62 of the Trade Practices Act. A complementary regulation is also being considered by the Department of PoUce and Customs for inclusion in the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. Local Government: Funds (Question No. 2434) Mr Morris asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Under what programs have funds been approved for local Government by the Australian Government in 1974-75. (2) What is the total approval in respect of each program in each State in 1974-75. Dr. J. F. Cairns-The answer to the honourexists able member's question is as follows: (1)&(2) ChapterV of the 1974-75 Budget Paper No. 7, without charge, in accordance with their basic philosophies entitled ""Payments to or for the States and Local Governof caring for the less fortunate in the community without ment Authorities 1974-75"", outlines the programs under regard tofinancialstatus. which funds are made avaUable to local government by the AustraUan Government and provides estimates wherever possible of expenditure in 1974-75. Questions regarding expenditure approved to date in relation to any particular programs should be directed to the responsible Minister in each case. Medibank (Question No. 2460) Mr Bourchier asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) With reference to his statement on 16 April 1975 that he is awaiting States to provide extra beds for pubUc wards, is it a fact that in his early announcements on Medibank he stated there would be adequate beds in public wards and that he could not see any need to seek extra accommodation. (2) WUl private hospitals be forced to hand over bed space for pubkc ward use; if so, is this proposal totally opposite to his early assertions. (3) What is the bed shortage number for pubUc wards. (4) Why is it necessary to obtain extra public ward beds. (5) Does he expect a greater demand under Medibank than prior to the scheme. member's question is as follows: (1) to (5) On 16 April 1975,1 did state, with reference to negotiations of a proposed hospital agreement with New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia, that rather complex negotiations would be involved in arranging additional pubUc ward beds in Victoria which would be different in nature from the negotiations which wUl be taking place in respect of Western AustraUa. In Victoria, State legislation provides for the specific identification of public ward beds and in that StateI visuaUsed some difficulties in negotiation in that the public hospitals would need to change the proportions between pubUc and private beds that they at present have. I do not recall stating that there would be ""adequate beds in public wards"". It is apparent that if there is an increased community demand for free treatment in standard wards as a result of Medibank, then additional beds in pubUc hospitals from their overall bed capacities will have to be aUocated for the treatment of such patients. It is not expected that there will be an overaU increase in demand for hospitalisation because of Medibank, although, as indicated, it is expected that the ratios of hospital patients and private patients wUl change. If there were an increase in demand for hospitalisation, it would indicate that many in our community are not being properly treated at the moment, probably because they are not adequately insured and cannot afford to go to hospital. This would be a severe condemnation of the present system if it were a fact. I am sure that the Honourable Member has observed that a patient cannot enter a hospital bed as the whim takes him but can only do so on the basis of a qualified medical practitioner's opinion. The Government cannot exercise any form of coercion over private hospitals to 'hand over bed space for public ward use'. At the same time, our legislation does provide for non-private hospitals operated by religious and charitable organizations to apply for approval to have some of their bedsfinanceddirectly by the Government so that thay can provide free treatment for hospital patients.
