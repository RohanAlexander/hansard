27,Mr Kelly Asked The Minister Of De,"honourable member, I desire to say that it is not considered advisable to lay these papers on the table of the House at present. table the following paper:Transfers of amounts approved by the Governor General in Council (dated 13th April) under the Audit Act. move That, in the opinion of this House, there should be established a Commonwealth L if e and Accident Assurance Department, under the control, management, and guarantee of the Federal Government. When, some months ago, I submitted a motion somewhat similar to this, its consideration was rather complicated by the fact that it had to be taken in connection with the consideration of the Public Service Bill, and there, consequently, was not a clean-cut issue before honourable members. On this occasion, the matter referred to in -the motion can be dealt with on its merits, and it is on its merits alone that I ask for its determination. I may take somewhat longer than I desire in addressing myself to the question, for the reason, perhaps, that I have been somewhat overburdened with material supplied to me by the kindness of who ject, and of some persons outside who have been good enough to assist me. At the outset, I wish to express my obligation to Mr Thodey, the editor of the .Insurance and Banking Record, for his kindness in lending me certain books of reference, and his assistance in directing my attention to others which have proved valuable. On this occasion, the issue raised is clean cut, and the motion covers the whole ground It is not a proposal to start an establishment to include State servants only, but one which can be extended to include all other classes in the community. WhatI propose is the creation of a State Department of Mutual Assurance, and the beginning of what, in my judgment, ought to prove an Industrial Life Assurance Department conducted and managed by the Commonwealth. I lay some emphasis upon the word industrial, because I hope to prove that that class of business requires to be catered for more fully and on some better basis, so far as the assured are concerned, than is at present the case. It will no doubt be urged, and perhaps properly urged, that the other class of business, though important, is satisfactorily provided for by the ordinary assurance offices, and that there is no great need to start a State establishment to come into competition with them for that business. I do not propose to devote myself very much to that aspect of the question, though, of course, I do propose to include ordinary assurance business in the work of such a State Department as I have in my mind's eye. I am especially desirous and particularly anxious, that the class of business which shall be done by the State Department, if inaugurated, shall be that which will meet the requirements of the great middle and poorer classes of the community, who cannot, under existing conditions, enter into life insurance upon a basis satisfactory to themselves, either from the point of view of the stability of the offices or from their own financial position. The idea of State life assurance is not by any means new. In putting forward proposals of this kind, we are sometimes met with the objection that the legislation sought has not been tried, that it is a vast experiment, a huge \undertaking, or something of that kind, and other sentences are very often uttered containing a number of awful adjectives calculated to frighten the timid and unthinking. some honourable members ism, which is a bad term in Victoria at the present time. honourable member to answer the question put to him the other day as to what State socialism is. I am not to be frightened by big words, nor by strange phrases, and I shall strive to do the right thing, so far as I know it. thing, which is always the right thing. I point out, however, that so far as State life assurance is concerned, this is not altogether a new proposition. We have examples before us of the British Annuity System, about which something was said on a former occasion, and into the merits of which I need not enter at this juncture.

34,Mr Hume Cook,"And the wiseoperation; one which has relation to the Superannuation Fund of the Education Department, and another having special relation to the railway servants of that State and their life assurance business. Not very long ago a proposal was put forward in Victoria for the establishment of a L if e Assurance Fund in connection with its Education Department. posal has yet reached fruition I am not at present in a position to say, but it is certain that the State authorities have given the matter consideration, and I believe that a sche e has actually been proposed. In Germany, where we have the most striking example of industrial life assurance, the system is perhaps more complete than anywhere else. MrO ' MALLEY stand, the system is largely, if not wholly, compulsory. from the official reports on the subject, it has"" given a great deal of satisfaction, and is not likely to be discontinued. In New Zealand there is a StateL if e Assurance Department, which, according to the best authority, has also proved satisfactory. Regarding this system we know something more than of other cases, and it is largely upon the New Zealand model that I propose that the Commonwealth L if e and Accident Assurance Department should be established. follow. and certain, is exceedingly popular, and is transacting a large amount of business which, so far as the general public are concerned,' is likely to be extended.. able member any figures to give us in support of his statement? those later on. have an example in the action of our own Federal Government. A few months ago the Treasurer determined that the fidelity guarantee business, in connection with the public servants of the Commonwealth, should be conducted through his Department, and under his control. That was a beginning in the right direction, which, I am sure, will have the f u l l approval of this House, and I desire now to see an extension of that principle to life assurance generally. The trend of legislation to-day is in the direction of interfering, from the State point of view, more and more with the business of life assurance. There is scarcely any country in the world to-day in which life assurance business is not governed to a large extent by statute law, and the more advanced the character and extent of its business, the greater are the restrictions applied. In America and Germany, in particular, where the volume of business is really enormous, life assurance is carried on under Whether that prorestrictions of a far more rigid character than many honourable members probably suppose. In the United States, notwithstanding the restrictive character of the legislation in force there, three great companies have assured some 9.000,000 persons for something like £750,000,000. These figures are obtained from the Insurance and Banking Record of last year, and were contained in an article T h a t is socialism. entitled "" The leviathans of the United States."" When we consider the enormous life assurance business transacted in a counSo far as we. can gather try like the United States, we begin to see the necessity of doing something to conserve the public interests. Coghlan asserts that the total sum for which the lives of residents of the Commonwealth are assured is something like £[125,000,000, and it is satisfactory to note that of this amount £[112,000,000 is assured with local offices. However, I propose at this stage to speak more particularly of the trend of legislation rather than of the amount of the assurances. The figures merely point to That model is a safe one to the necessity for legislation, more espeI t has been proved sound, safe, cially in view of the great . public interests involved. I have mentioned that in almost every country statute law governs the business of life assurance; but in Germany and America, where legislation has been passed recently, the restrictions placed On the assuring companies are surprising. In 1891 the German Parliament dealt with this question, I shall supply and to a very large extent, consolidated the Finally, upon this head, we law. The legislation, then passed secured for the German offices a very much larger share of the business than they formerly enjoyed. The object aimed at was twofold, and in both respects success appears to have attended the efforts of the legislature. First of all, it was intended to place life assurance under stricter control so far as the' State was concerned, and to give better guarantees to the public, and, secondly, an attempt was made to secure for the German offices a monopoly of the business, it being insisted that investments should be made in German securities. I propose to quote from the Economic Journal of December, 1902, which makes",14,Commonwealth Life And Accident As Surance Department

37,,". Mr HUMECOOKspecific reference to the Act to which I have alluded. to which I desire to direct attention is that which constitutes what is called an "" Imperial authority "" for the supervising and conduct of life assurance business. a board of nine persons, five of whom are directly appointed by the Crown, while four others are assistant members. persons supervise all private assurances in Germany, and they are charged with powers which, in a British community, would be looked upon as savouring of tyranny, .although they do not appear to have been cavilled at in Germany. Their first business is to interest themselves in the articles of association of any company which proposes to carry on life assurance business. they have to examine its financial position and to make the strictest inquiry as to what it proposes to do, and the methods upon which it proposes to conduct its business. At page 567 of the Economic Journal it is stated:Any company applying for permission to carry on insurance business must submit its scheme of operations to the Supervising Board. scheme of operations must include the company's articles of association, the general insurance con-, ditions, and the technical rules on which the business is conducted, in so far as the class of business to be transacted renders such rules necesmeeting, it may convene one upon its own acsary. particulars must be given on the following points : Table of premiums, mode of calculating premiums, and proportion to be retained for the insurance fund (premium reserve), rate of interest forming basis of calculation, and principles as to "" loading."" babilities as to duration of life , and the danger of illness and incapacity must be appended to the scheme of operations, as well as the mathematical formulas used 'for the calculation of premiums, which must be illustrated by examples with figures. That is a very large order, and includes a very strict and searching inquiry into the plan of operations to be followed. The article goes on to say :In order to counteract an obvious method of evasion, it is provided that any subsequent alteration of the scheme of operations must be submitted for the approval of the Board, and cannot be carried out until such sanction has been obtained. So that they do not provide merely for a preliminary investigation. that there shall be no underhand work on the part of the company, but that the scheme of operations, the tables of premiums, and all other matters shall receive sanction before anything is done, and that any proposed alteration must be subject to Mr Hume Cook. sanction. It will thus be seen that life asThe first feature of the measure, surance business in Germany is merely permissive, and that it is under very strict supervision. In order that honourable members may understand how close the superThis consists of vision is it is necessary to quote further :An insurance company having satisfied the Board of the correct nature of its constitution, These the soundness of its scheme of operations, and the healthy state of its financial condition, is allowed to start business; but it continues to be controlled as to the conduct of its affairs. It is the duty of the Supervising Board to watch the conduct of the business of all insurance companies subject to its jurisdiction, and more particularly to see that the provisions of the law and the rules laid down by the scheme of operations are properly carried out, and it may at any time examine the accounts and balance-sheets, send Next representatives for the purpose of taking part in board meetings, or general meetings, cause meetings to be convened, or, in case of default, convene and announce them at the cost of the company whom they concern. I do not know that anything so forward as that has ever been attempted in any other country. As the quotation shows, the I m perial authority in Germany has power under The the statute law to send representatives to any meeting of a company, whether it be a meeting of the board or a general meeting; and if it is not satisfied with the conduct of such In the case of a l i fe insurance company, count at the expense of the company. In short, it can do anything it pleases in order to safeguard the interests of those who assure. I may add that so strict is the law that if a company fails to obey . the direcThe tables of protions given by the Imperial authorities it may be subjected to penalties which go so far as suspensionthe actual prohibition of its operations-un less it will agree to what is suggested by this board. As I indicated in my earlier remarks, the investments made by these companies must be in approved German securities, in order that their solvency and stability mav be guaranteed. With respect to the non-German companies, it is now almost impossible for them to carry on operations. That, however, does not concern us much in this connection. What does concern us is that in the Act of 1901 it was thought necessary and advisable, in an autocratic country like Germany, to take steps which practicThey take care ally guarantee to the policy-holders everything that the companies undertake to give them for the premiums which they pay. In '-?e-f. the German system is only just one f step short of an Imperial assurance comDany. When -we look at that system in the light of experience, it will probably be found to be equal, if not superior, to such an assurance company. It is equal in the sense that the guarantee which is provided by the Government, in the form of a supervising board, is as good as if the business . were conducted by the State itself, and it is possibly superior to a State institution in that the Government compels the companies to do all the work, thereby avoiding the expense that would be involved, at the same time guaranteeing to the public a safe and solvent institution. Of course that method of business might not suit the Australian or the English public. business would prefer that it should be carried on by the the method which I desire to see adopted. I think it would be infinitely preferable to establish our own assurance company, carry it on under our own management, and do the business in our own way, rather than entrust it to others. This sort of legislation clearly points the way to the initiation of a State Department of Assurance, and when we consider the general restrictions which are imposed upon -life assurance companies the world over, there does not seem to be very much left in the argument that we ought not to embark upon this business, simply because no other Government has done so. that life assurance is in some measure a principle of political economy, and also a 'matter of very grave State concern. If we study the figures' relating to the expenditure in Australia upon benevolent asylums, hospitals, and institutions of a kindred character, we shall be astonished to find that the sum aggregates millions sterling. larger system of life assurance, and by consequence a greater amount of thrift in connection with the large industrial public of Australia, in my judgment the present heavy demands for charity would not be made upon the general public, nor upon the States themselves as such. amount voted by the several Governments of Australia for benevolent and destitute purposes, represents £[306,000 annually. If we add to that the sums voted for tin: conduct of hospitals, the expenditure totals £[1,347,000. Though, perhaps, it -would not be quite fair to add the pension list to that sum, still, it is interesting to know that if we did so, the amount expended in this direction would aggregate nearly £[2,250,000. If we can avoid even an 2 K appreciable portion of that expenditure by establishing a system of State afe assurance, we shall be doing a very good work. In any case we are face to face with the problem that men an-1 women are not able, owing to existing industrial conditions to make sufficient provision for their old age; and unless we can devise for them a cheap, sound, and safemethod of life assurance, we are naturally bound to institute to a greaterextent than would otherwise be necessary a system of pensions. It is .absurd toI f the think that the old men and women of Ausis to be guaranteed we tralia can be allowed to go down to the grave in destitution and want. We ought State authorities. That is to adopt every reasonable safeguard against that state of things. One of the best steps along the lines of self-help, it seems to me, is to give to the general public, whose rate of pay will not permit of their saving sufficient money to provide for their old age, an opportunity to invest a portion of their earnings in such a way as will safeguard those who are left behind. But this cannot very well be done at present, for, notwithstanding the large number of life assurance offices in Australia, and, in many cases, their economic soundness, if the general public were consulted it would probably be found that they are I hold somewhat suspicious of them, even where they are not absolutely shy. institutions are conducted upon the mutual principle. any better. the figures relating to these institutions, we If there -were a shall find that some of them are not as sound as they appear to be. Indeed, in some cases the suspicions entertained by the public are quite justified. It has always been my object to discourage proprietary companies, and to encourage mutual companies. But in any case I prefer, speaking as a public man, that a L if e I find, from Coghlan, that the Assurance Department should be established by the State, which would be beyond all suspicion, which would attract business from the class of persons who cannot now deal with large life assurance institutions, and which might also obtain some of the business which at present falls to companies that are not worthy 1 of receiving it companies, whose methods and management wairant the suspicion fo which I have already referred. I repeat that in my opinion we should follow",15,Commonwealth Life And Accident As Surance Department

The same statement applies to the business transacted in New Zealand during 1903. When Sir Edmund Barton was Prime Minister he was good enough to forward me an extract from the Mutual Provident Messenger, which was rather a laudation of the society's own business.

45,Mr Hume Cook,"Quite so. Buti fto be demonstrated. What the public wuit is an assurance which is cheap, because they cannot afford to pay high premiums; and which is sound, because they are not so deeply interested in obtaining large profits as in making certain that, if anything happens to them, their widows or children, or other persons for whose benefit they are assured, will receive the money due to them. They ask that the business of the companies or offices with which they assure shall be conducted upon sound lines, so that f a i lure would be impossible. Cheapness, soundness, and certainty in connection with the life asurance business are, it seems to me, the three essentials which are desirable in the interests of our great industrial population. I believe that at the present time none of the insurance offices or companies offer those advantages, and hence there is an urgent need for a Commonwealth L if e Assurance Office. able member give us a comparison of the rates of the New Zealand Government office with those of the mutual offices? a comparison to hand, but the information can be dbtained. ference between them.

Sir GEORGE health. in every country upon the age and health of the assured. The highest rate of interest earned by any mutual office doing business in Australia during 1901 was 4 per cent., and the lowest 3.9 per cent., but hotwithstanding the limitations placed upon its investments-the Department being confined practically to municipal and Government securities-the New Zealand Government L if e Assurance Department yet earned something more than the minimum I have quoted. A rate of from 3 per cent, to 3 per cent, might well satisfy any reason1 able person, because profits are neither the be-all nor assurance business. desires above all is the certainty that his policy will be paid when it falls due or when death occurs. Those who assure have not that certainty to-day in connection with proprietary assurance offices, and a great many are prevented from assuring in the mutual offices because of their methods of business and their high premiums. How is the soundness of assurance companies measured? We know, in spite of their protestations to the contrary, that in a grat many cases the mutual companies are not as sound as they should be. Their soundness is measured by the soundness of their mortgages, and a drought or financial collapse upsets them to an extent which can hardly be calculated by the ordinary layman. a Government Department too. vernment can always put its business right by methods which are not open to ordinary life assurance offices. I hold that in the interests of the State itself the Government should, if the necessity arose, resort to those methods to secure the stability of its Assurance Department. The valuation of the assets I have not such of assurance companies is upon a basis which no layman can discover, and is of quite their own making. Moreover, there is no certificate as to their reserves, so that we do not know howtheir money is invested, and there F r o m 5 to 15 per cent. is no law governing the investment of it. No t so much. In short, there is in Australia a very large field for legislative interference with lif e assurance companies, even if we do not deem it wise or necessary to start a Government Assurance Department. The public should be given guarantees in regard to the investment of reserves, and certificates of proper petent and f eariess examiners. At present we have no knowledge as to what the securities of the companies are, or of the checks upon their investments. Their expenses, too, are at the mercy of the boards of directors or 1 of the management. We know nothing satisfactory with regard to the inner working of these offices.

As an instance of what may be done by an industrial companyand I am indebted to the honourable member for Brisbane for the following facts and figures-I might inform honourable members that one of them some time ago bought a property for £13,000. It expended .£500 upon it, and those "" in the know "" were then surprised to find it appraised among the assets in the balance-sheet at £25,000. Next year the value was written up to £31,000. But, attention having been directed to the matter in the public press, the management, shame-facedly, I suppose, reduced the valuation to .£25,000. All this was done in order to enable the proprietors to obtain and pay a 10 per cent, dividend. The particular company I ' allude is included in the list of offices in which the Government permit its servants to insure. insure with it will probably wake up some morning to find their investments lost for ever, owing to the insolvency of the company. the honourable member refers has £10,000 deposited with the Queensland Government.

It is doing that work in most successful fashion, and I say that the Federal Government has been badly advised in consenting to name that company public servants may assure. Another company carrying on an industrial business in Australia, and a company which is also named in the Government list, works another pretty little fake. It sets against the industrial branch nearly the whole of its management expenses, and as a result the ordinary business branch does not suffer. In other words, it makes the people who pay one penny and two pence, for the assurance of the lives of children, mostly, bear all the brunt of the larger business of the ordinary branch. companv doing business ? The company is well known, and I need not name it, though if it were necessary I could name it. I have here a quotation on this subject from the Insurance and Banking Record for March, 1901, which was followed up in other places. There is here some analysis given which shows what this well-informed paper thinks of the matterIt is preposterous to suppose that the ordinary branch business costs (apart from commission) only a little over 4 per cent, to conduct, the percentage including, moreover, medical examination. A careful examination of the items as to which stated in the accounts must raise doubt. For instance, of the £2,400 paid in directors' fees (itself a very high sum), only £200 is debited to the ordinary branch, while the industrial policy But those who do holders have to pay £2,200. Then the ordinary branch gets off with a charge of only £352 for rents, rates, and taxes, but the industrial branch pays £4,101. Government taxes amount to £114 in the ordinary branch, and £1,210 in the industrial branch. And so on. It is much to be feared that the allocation is inequitable to the industrial branch, and we would strongly urge the directors to review this question with the assistance of competent outside advice. able member know the' proportion of assurances in the different branches?

65,Mr Hume Cook,"They* do not;for the industrial branch 24*03 per cent. Of course it is not my desire to do any injury to any particular company, and I have not named either of the companies to which I have referred. companies ? the companies interested prove their own' case. WhatI am endeavouring to prove is that, under existing conditions, these companies are offering to do industrial business-and it is with industrial business that I am chiefly concerned in submitting this motion-and are doing it in a way which is unfair and Improper in some instances to the general public who assure with them. In order to safeguard the general public, to do the right thing by them, and, further, to encourage that self-help and thrift which every man in his heart approves, we ought to give an opportunity to the public in this respect, which can be given only by such an establishment as I have indicated. An honourable member propose industrial business for a State Department ? that whilst we cannot begin exactly' an industrial business on the lines upon which it is conducted by private companies, we can, in the circumstances which I propose to narrate, begin a life assurance business which will largely tend in that direction: We know that the premium rates which would require to be charged by a State Assurance Department would be so much lower than those at prese.it being charged by private companies, that it would attract the class of business which is now being done by private companies, and a class of business which is not provided for in any way at the present time. As we should avoid a very great proportion of the expense of management, and should not require to keep up expensive buildings, such as must be provided by private companies, it is beyond doubt that we could afford to quote lower premium rates whilst we gave as good an investment, and offered as reliable a security as can be offered by any private company. I may be asked why I wish to start a State Life Assurance Department. If it is admitted that industrial business is not in all cases' referred. It seems to me that the Governcarried on upon a sound basis, I shall be told that I cannot deny the fact that most of the mutual life companies doing business are sound. I . have already attempted to answer that by endeavouring to show that a large proportion of business can be done which is not being obtained by any company at the present time, because of the excessive premium rates, and the other difficulties to which I have alluded. It will be admitted that our present industrial system is not sound, in some instances, at any rate. The investment is too expensive by far, whilst the benefits are very small indeed; and lastly, and most important, there is no certainty that the assured will get the sums for which they assure. With respect to mutual companies, the expense of management is much too great to enable them 'to reduce their premiums sufficiently to attract all the business which could be attracted by a life assurance office conducted by the Government. In short, they cannot offer the inducements to the public which could be offered by a State Department of Assurance, and in any case the suspicions of the poorer classes of the people are so strong and their fears so great, that there is little the assurance in private offices. In these circumstances it seems to me to be the imperative duty of the State to step into the breach and create a State Department of Assurance.. I have therefore moved the motion standing in my name, and I trust it will be carried.. We do not desire to indulge in any more charity or benevolence in Australia than is absolutely necessary, and we do wish to encourage, so far as possible, self-help and an independent spirit amongst our people. If we offer to them inducements along such lines as I have indicated, I think it will be found that the response will be very much greater than many persons imagine, and as a result, the necessity which exists, and which, to a certain extent, will always exist, for the payment of old-age pensions will not be so pressing. In any case, I do not think we are justified, nor is Parliament right, in guaranteeing particular companies for the assurance of civil servants, unless we get some fee from them. I have already mentioned a couple of instances in which I am satisfied that if assurances do take place, they will be regretted by those who take out policies with the companies to which I have ment, in going so far as to schedule a list of companies with which the public servants may do business, practically give",21,Turner An D Upon His Investment Should Be Required From Com

68,Mr Hume Cook,"What I say isa guarantee to the assured which they should be prepared We have 1,500 or 1,600 civil servants, whom we compel to assure their lives in certain offices. The compulsion to assure in these offices seems to me to carry with it a guarantee that if the companies fail the Commonwealth will itself pay the assured -amount. Is it not better, therefore, for us, having the public servants as a nucleus, to start on our own account; with an advantage which even the New Zealand Department did not enjoy at the beginning ? Every othe.r life assurance business has had to start from scratch without any nucleus. I am informed that the A.M.P. Society had been in existence ten years before the number of policy-holders reached 1,500 or 1,600. We should begin with that number, and we should not then be under the necessity of giving a guarantee in regard to outside companies. posal is to begin with the public servants and to offer attractions to those outside who do not now assure to any great extent with the mutual offices. Whilst we might not perhaps be able to offer the same inducements in the way of bonuses or awards as do the mutual companies, we could give a guarantee that should in itself be sufficient to attract a large amount of business and enable us to conduct a successful institution. We should not be under the necessity of paying any high commissions, and the collection of premiums could be carried out very easily, because every pay-office throughout the Commonwealth might be made a receiving office We should not have to maintain any large offices, because the public buildings could be utilized for that purpose. drag upon us in the shape of a building fund and all the contingencies which that would involve, and our staff, if it required to be increased, would be augmented only to a very slight extent.

Of course, I recognise that this is a far-reaching proposal, and that it marks an advance upon anything yet attempted in Australia, although not ahead of what has been successfully achieved in New Zealand. Believing that the principle is sound, and that the end to be served is a desirable one, it seemed to me to be a part of my duty to place my ideas before honourable members, and to endeavour to secure for them the fa%'orable consideration which I trust they warrant. great pleasure in seconding the motion. I think it would be futile to attempt to add to the information afforded by the excellent In brief, my proand exhaustive speech of the honourable member for Bourke. I desire to' compliment him upon the thoroughness with which he has examined the subject, and elaborated it to the House. He ought to have satisfied the majority of honourable members-a t any rate, the majority of those who are not interested in assurance companies-as to the soundness of his scheme. The proposal is one that the Government should take in hand as soon as possible, and I agree that no more important matter has been brought before the House for seme time. The honourable member has demonstrated the necessity of the State establishing a department of this kind. He has instanced the success of the State Assurance Office in New Zealand, and the critics of his proposal are invited to go to New Zealand, We should not have any and, if they can, find any flaws in the Department that has been administered there for some years. I have never heard of any complaint, and I think that the figures adduced by the honourable member tend to show that the Department is increasing in popularity among the poorer classes and others for whom it is our business to see that some provision is made. The parallel which the honourable member draws from Germany is one which-if we are not prepared to follow him to the full length of his proposal-w e might take as an example. We might with great advantage adopt the German scheme to a still further extent, because in that country an admirable system of old-age pensions is provided. I should I contend that we re-like to see the honourable member's proposal so expanded that the proposed department",22,Honourable Member Doe S The Likelihood Of Any Considerable Increase In

71,Mr Mahon (Coolgardie),"I haveshould also take over the management of any funds that may be subscribed by employers and employees to provide for those who have passed the working age. I understand that in Germany the employee pays the employer another third, and the State contributes ""the balance to a fund for the maintenance of workers who have passed their prime. A system such as the honourable member proposes whould pave the way for an old-age pension scheme of that kind, which, after all, would be the soundest that could be established. very well to say that we should establish old age pensions by taxing the general public, but we have seen the outcry raised in Victoria because the money required for the payment of these pensions is taken from the pockets of the taxpayers. fortunate people who have been depending on the pensions have been squeezed down to the very lowest amount upon which it would be possible for a man to subsist, whilst in some instances pensioners have, upon some ridiculous pretext, been absolutely deprived of their miserable pittance. I think that if we desire to establish a stable old-age pensions fund we should adopt something in the nature of the German system. Such a fund would be invulnerable. It could never be attacked by any class in the community, because it could not be said that the people deriving the benefit were not direct contributors to the fund. The honourable member for Bourke has also demonstrated that his scheme would offer greater security any private company to persons assuring. Naturally that must be so, because the credit of a State is sounder than is the credit of any number of private individuals, of which these mutual companies are really composed. wish to say one word which would raise a suspicion concerning the assurance companies, whether mutual or which are doing business in Australia. their own way they are performing good work. so absolutely perfect as to deprive those who advocate State interference warrant for such advocacy, we have a right to ask what would be the position of these institutions if a crisis similar to that experienced by the banks in 1893 confronted them ? position as the Australian banks did in that year, and*until they do, those who talk so loudly about their soundness had better be very careful in their choice of language. Mr Mahon. can face such a crisis, because their liabilities do not become due at the same time. one-third, some of them that their liabilities do not f a l l due upon a single day. Seeing that these institutions lend money on mortgage, and that the value of their securities fluctuates from time to time, does any one suppose that they are so absolutely sound that they can offer a security resembling that afforded by the State? The honourable It is all member for Bourke has dilated upon the fact that insufficient supervision is exercised over these companies. We do 'not know what they are doing; we do not know whether their securities represent anything like the value which they place upon them. The unWe are unaware how often their directors advance large sums of money upon flimsy security to their own particular friends. I suppose something of that kind has been done, even in the model State of Victoria. I know that it has been done in some of the other States, where the directors of assurance companies, like those of banks and other financial institutions, have theirparticular favorites, whose securities are not scrutinized with the same degree of keenness to which those of an outsider are subjected. I repeat that these institutions have never been tested by conditions similar to those which prevailed during the great banking crisis of 1893, and it is a very fortunate fact for some of them. I have no desire than is afforded by to include all the assurance companies doing business in Australia in any sweeping condemnation; but I believe that Government, supervision is required in some cases. The honourable member for Bourke and proprietary has also pointed out that the heavy exI do not penditure incurred by these institutions renders it necessary for them to charge high premiums to the persons whom they assure. proprietary, A StateL if e Assurance Department would In be able to save a large portion of that expenditure.

73,Mr Mahon,"It is very fortunate foranother aspect in connection with them, of which this Government and Governments elsewhere ought to have long ago taken cognizance. practice of paying assurances upon the death of mere infants. That is a wrong principle to adopt, and no Government ought to allow an assurance company to pay over moneys upon the death of children. On the contrary, it would be far better-especiall y for the Government to pay a premium to every person who rears a healthy child up to fifteen years of age. Without casting any reflection upon the public in this connection, I hold that it is a very dangerous principle to allow assurance companies to assure the lives of child. ren so that their parents may benefit by their death. The practice, however, is sufficiently prevalent to call for notice. When the Government are legislating upon the matter I trust that this aspect of it will receive attention."" I believe that the funds of a Government Life Assurance Department could be invested very nearly as well as can the funds of private companies.

The Government are responsible to the depositors of that I refer to their institution, whose money is advanced to freeholders at 4J per cent. There is nothing to prevent a State Department from doing precisely the same thing. At any rate, if it objected to do that, it could go upon the open market, and purchase Government bonds which would absolutely return it 4 per cent. It could buy some bonds which would return a still greater interest, and it could even purchase the bonds of the Metropolitan Board of Works, which would yield £ 4 . gs. per cent. That would be a very good return. The money thus received from premiums might, with advantage, be devoted, as it accumulates, to' the redemption of the Government debt of Australia. A t any rate, it would earn sufficient to enable a reasonable allowance to be paid to every one who had decided to depend upon an honest assurance office. The Department would have the civil servants to form the nucleus of its list of policy holders; members of the outside public would also take out policies from time to time, and with the .present opportunity to invest funds at a high rate of interest there is not likely to be a more favorable time for its establishment. I commenced my observations with the remark that I did not intend to traverse in detail the'speech made by the honourable member for Bourke, because I had not had the opportunity to fully study the matter as he has done.

82,Mr Mahon,"Well, the Commissionersshould enter upon the business in a legitimate way: It was not proposed that a sinking fund should be created, or that the business should be conducted on lines which would give reasonable averages, and enable the Department to pay fair bonuses. The position now taken up by the honourable member, however, is entirely different from that assumed by him on the occasion to which I refer. It seems to me that as the Commonwealth will find it necessary from time to time to raise monev'in the markets of the world, and, as in the case of the Victorian conversion loan, we shall have to pay enormous rates of interest, we should make an effort to secure the profits to be derived from a Life Assurance Department, and thus reduce the necessity.for floating loans. Large sums which go into the sinking funds of life assurance companies might well be kept in the hands of the Government, and used either for Commonwealth purposes or distributed pro raid among the States. Life assurance is not a charity, but a legitimate business, and must be run upon the great basis of equation. It must be conducted in the interests of policy-holders. New policy-holders must be secured from time to time. They are the life blood of a company, and without new business an office must die. In my opinion, we should establish a Commonwealth Life-Assurance Department, even if it be only for the purcountry. There is a large amount pose of enabling an examination to be made of the business of life assurance companies on the lines adopted in Massachusetts. The honourable member for Bourke referred to the position in Germany; but I should like him to consider the life assurance laws of Massachusetts. are very strict. Mr O'MALLEY -In Massachusetts a Yankee is employed to throw life assurance people out of the State faster than the Japs have thrown the Russians out of Port Arthur. If the directors of a company are unable to swear to every item in their balance-sheet, the office is refused permission to do business in the State. It is a serious matter that a number of promiscuous life assurance companies should be permitted to transact business all over the Comand the pnemiums are paid by the Governmonwealth without any reasonable restrictions being imposed upon them, and more especially is this the case when we rjemember that according to Carlyle manv men are either born fools or become so later on. It is a serious matter that many so-called representatives of life assurance companies should be allowed to promise people everything in the heavens above and the earth below, when they really represent no institution worthy of the name. I can remember one companythe Charter Oak-whic h carried on business in the State of Connecticut, and ruined thousands of people before the Government exercised strict supervision over life assurance societies. The Queen was another company which closed its doors after it had issued policies representing several millions of money. Some companies may be able on paper to show funds amounting to millions of dollars, when they have not a penny in the treasury. I remember one bank in Tasmania, which crossed the stream of destruction, and the directors of which had borrowed from it some .£40,000 in excess of the actual amount of its capital. When we recall these facts, we must recognise that the people of Australia are not saints any more than are the people of the United States. I for one, at all events, have not heard of -directors of large institutions working until late at night, and exerting themselves solely in the interests of the people. In Australia a man has to hustle for every dollar that he makes, and the people of the Commonwealth are just as grasping as are those of the United States of America, or any other of life assurance business to be transacted here, and the establishment of a Government Life Assurance Department would be an excellent investment. IfI did not hold that opinion, I should not be found supporting this motion. I would point out, however, that, as the honourable member for Coolgardie has said, it is absurd to imagine that people will rush the Government life assurance office because of the inducements it offers, unless those inducements are brought prominently before them. A good business manager must be appointed, and perhaps we should compel every man to assure for at least ,£100. Why should we not do so? Why should we not set up a system similar to that which Germany has established ? There workmen are required to insure their lives, ment, the workers, and the employers combined. That has proved a very successful system; but when we establish this department we must take care to bring its merits prominently before the people. Unless that",25,George Turner O F Course I T Position Which He Now Invites The House To

I should not be afraid to set out to-morrow to secure life assurance business, without being the representative of any company. Everything depends upon the man engaged to do the business. honourable member require? Mr O'MALLEY I would not accept a position in the Department, because I am now too old to add to my responsibilities in this direction. The adoption of this proposal would bring money into the coffers of the Commonwealth Treasury, and would enable us to secure funds for a system of old-age pensions. established on the ordinary lines fora period of twenty years, and at the end of that time we should require pensioners to secure their allowance through the medium of the Life Assurance Department. By the creation of this Department we should be able to secure profits which would render it unnecessary for the Commonwealth in many cases to borrow money in outside markets. I shall have pleasure in supporting the motion. ney) I have no desire to enter into any lengthy discussion of this question, but I wish to place certain considerations before the House. WhilstI give the mover of the motion credit for the manner in which he has dealt with certain aspects of the question, I feel constrained to say that he failed to bring before the House a great deal of information that should have been placed in its possession before it was asked to deal with an important matter of this kind. . For instance, we had Government companies quoted. But we had no comparison between the rates charged by those companies and public companies, and the privileges granted in return, nothing by which we could estimate the advantages offered to the assured by each. We had not that full information as to the character of these different Government schemes which is desirable before we are asked to commit ourselves to a resolution of this description. I admit that abstract resolutions, whether carried or not, mean very little, but we ought to be careful not to commit ourselves to a resolution unless we are satisfied that action should be taken in the direction decided upon. Section s.i of the Constitution empowers us to make laws with respect toInsurance, other than State insurance; also State insurance extending beyond the limits of the State concerned. There are different ways of exercising that power. I believe that our first duty is, not to establish a Commonwealth assurance office, even if that may eventually be shown to be desirable, but . to meet the circumstances which honourable members who have spoken have detailed in connection with the management of existing private institutions, by providing for an inquiry into their condition, so that the public may know that they are solvent, and that by the supervision of their operationspayment of the policies when they become That system might be due may be guaranteed. wealth Audit Department. a Commonwealth Insurance Department similar to that of the United States. There should be a very strict and searching examination of the operations of assurance offices. In some of the States there is practically no law aimed at securing the solvency of these offices, although the public have invested in them such large sums of money, and have indeed, in some cases, intrusted to them their future. is very marked in New South Wales. credit to those who have had the conduct of assurance business in Australia, that, notwithstanding these extraordinarily loose conditions, there has been practically no default. But it is not safe to allow this state of affairs to continue, and it should be our first business, not to establish a Commonwealth Department of Insuranceleaving the existing private offices to continue their operations under the loose conditions which now prevail, and perhaps diminishing their solvency by our competition-bu t to pass a law providing for searching inquiry and thorough investigation into the position of the existing companies, so that the public may have a guarantee as to the security of their investments. The honourable member for Coolgardie referred to a very' important point in connection with Commonwealth life insurance. It dovetails into the old-age pension question. .He was perfectly right in saying that if we establish, not the charitable old-age pension",26,George Turner O F Course I T Position Which He Now Invites The House To

The whole question, however, requires consideration, and the subject of both life assurance and old-age pensions should be referred to a Committee of the House for inquiry, before we attempt to deal with either. We shall probably not have an opportunity to establish an old-age pension scheme for a long time to come, but the whole subject might receive trenchant investigation at a period considerably anterior to that at which we are likely to be called upon to deal with it. Conditions are not alike in every country, and therefore an inquiry should be made as to whether compulsory or voluntary insurance is the better, as to whether a scheme of insurance can be combined with an old-age pension scheme, and in regard to other points. I do not say what my conclusions upon this subject will be. No honourable member can do so until such an inquiry has been made, and the evidence ta.ken, presented, and reported upon. The question, however, deserves investigation. been raised by Mr Chamberlain and others in Great Britain, and should be thoroughly looked into. We are now trying to determine something by a resolution which either means nothing, or, if it has a meaning, must be followed by action before any proper inquiry is made. Then, again, circumstances are not quite as the mover of the motion supposes. In the first place, while there is extreme danger in the operations of private companies without supervision, there is also danger in the operations of a Government Department. We have seen the reckless attachment of Savings Bank funds by a Government, and the wanton use of loan money, and it cannot be expected that any Government continuing that policy would always remain solvent. There might be an occasion when such a Government, like a bank, would be unable to meet its liabilities. In Germany it has been less expenditure'. honourable member express ignorance of reckless expenditure already having been undertaken ? truth of the assertion that it has. the honourable member would require statement is readily accepted without evidence. there is evidence for it.

The honourable member said that the lowest rate of life tralia was 3.9 per cent., and that the highest average rate earned by any company was 4$ per cent. That is the interest returned upon the investments. I know that it is possible that some of the investments of these companies ""may not be accurately valued. That is why I say that we should appoint some authority to make a searching inquiry. however, there is ample security afforded to those who are assured. I am not speaking as one who has any connection with life assurance companies. I neither hold shares, nor am I a director, nor do I hold a policy in any life assurance company; but I am aware that some of the companies make the most ample provision for any drop in the value of their assets. Funds are set aside for that purpose, and the rate of interest upon which they calculate their rates is reduced from time to time, so thai it is gradually becoming lower and lower. Good management must That is one of the methods which the companies have of offering additional security to investors. A State Assurance Department, such as proposed, would invest its funds in Commonwealth bonds, and possibly in State bonds. I do not see how a It has. been said Commonwealth institution could invest in municipal bonds. Therefore the Government could not expect, at the usual rates for money, to earn more than 3 per cent. The New South Wales Government The insurance money due by Gocredits its Savings Bank depositors at present with 3 per cent., but for years the 1 rate was only 3 per cent. That is a conThose who have siderable reduction on the rates earned by private companies, and must mean some reduction of the advantages offered to persons assuring.

I cordially agree with all ' that has been said regarding the objectionable practice of assuring the lives of infants, but that has nothing to do with the proposal to establish a Government L if e Assurance Department. Independently of any question of that kind we should require Consequently it cannot be to pass a law dealing with the life assurance companies now in our midst, in order to put a stop to the objectionable practices given a'i opmentioned. I certainly cannot vote in favour of a bald motion of this kind until we have first taken all the steps that are interest earned by public within our power, under the Constitution, assurance companies in Austo regulate private assurance companies, and until we have inquired into the question of Government assurance, particularly in Germany and New Zealand, and have obtained a report instituting a comparison between the conditions in those countries and in our own. This would be necessary before we could arrive at a proper decision, and, therefore, I must vote against the resoI n many cases, lution.

108,Sir George Turner (Balaclava,"I agree with hint that this is a far-reaching proposal. It is also one which I do not feel justified in asking the House to deal with until we have had opportunities for fuller discussion and consideration. So far as I am personally concerned, I am, to a considerable extent, in sympathy with the honourable member's views, but I feel that a Minister occupies a position different from that of a private member in dealing with such a subject, because he would -be responsible for afterwards giving effect to his views, and would have to bear the full burden of any mistake that might be made. I am making inquiries into the subject. I have the latest report from. New Zealand, and there are certain facts upon which I desire to obtain information, -with a view to placing it before the House.

Debate resumed from 13th April (vide That the B i ll be now read a second time. shall endeavour to avoid, as far as possible, reference to matters with which I dealt in my speech upon a similar measure last session. I desire to briefly reply to one or two statements made by honourable members who have adversely criticised the Bill. In the first place the acting leader of the Opposition/ in a carefully prepared and an exhaustive speech, dealt with the question cf conciliation, and pointed out that in Great Britain this very admirable system was making such rapid strides that there was no occasion for the Bill. I do not wish to deprecate conciliation. ' ferred to was voluntary arbitration. same. Conciliation and voluntary arbitration are practically interchangeable terms. the force of law, whether it be the result of voluntary arbitration or or conciliation, is very much the same. The honourable member referred to the successful efforts of the Honourable Mr Mundella, at one time President of the Board of Trade, in connection with the cotton and other industries. fer to Mr Mundella. It was the honourable and learned member for Angas who did so. member also referred to him. However, in connection with that matter, I should like to remind my honourable friend that in all cases in which the so-called voluntary arbitration has been successively applied, the trades unions have been sufficiently strong to compel a settlement, and to see that the decisions given by the Arbitration .Boards were respected. Behind the unions also was a very strong public opinion. Notwithstanding all that the success of conciliation, I would point out to him that, according to the latest Board of Trade returns, those for 1903, the dullest year that has been experienced in ' the United Kingdom for a very long time, the number of working days lost through trade disputes was simply appalling. The figures for last year show a decrease on those for the preceding year, because trade was duller, and business generally was not nearly so brisk. The number of working days lost in 1903 was no less than 2,317,000, "" involving 114,000 persons, whereas the average annual loss in 1902 and 1903 was no less than 8,840,000, involving 271,000 persons. And yet the honourable member for North Sydney would like honourable members . to believe that the principle of conciliation is being applied with such success to the settlement of trade disputes in the United Kingdom that the only strikes occurring are of a trivial character.",29,Thomson Yes Extreme Evidence To Convince Him

I agree that where trades unions and the employers have consented to conciliation, ciple has. been attended with success. But I also contend that hundreds of claims for disputes to be referred to Boards of Conciliation have been refused, that strikes and trouble have resulted, and that the loss thus occasioned has been so enormous ""that last year, which was a dull year, no less than 2,317,000 working days were lost to the workers of Great Britain. That alone is sufficient to warrant such a proposal as the Government are submitting to this House. what that loss really involves. As John Burns said in speaking upon this very matter at Battersea recently, it is not only the loss which is involved from an economic stand-point, but the suffering which is involved in the homes of the workers. rightly urges that the women, upon whom the burden chiefly falls, are really worthy of the ""Victoria Cross for bearing so nobly the trials which they are called upon to endure, in consequence of these great industrial calamities. 114,000 persons were involved in trade disputes in England last year, and 2,317,000 working days were lost to them as the result. The honourable member for North Sydney also alluded to the working of the New"" Zealand Act, and urged amongst other things that whilst in many instances wages have been raised as the result of this class of legislation, and that consequently the position of the workers has been improved, the cost of the articles produced has been enhanced to the consumer. had not been the case in Victoria.

These statements prove conclusively that the contention of the honourable member for North Sydney, that prices have been raised as the result of the operation of the New Zealand Act, is altogether erroneous. The honourable member also urged that unionists in England and America object to the principle of compulsory arbitration. agree that that is so. But the honourable member forgot to mention why they are opposed to a system of compulsory arbitration. In this connection I would point out' that one of the principal leaders of unionism in America, the organizer of the great Anthracite bers 250.000 haps the largest industrial the world, in a recent article, published in McClure's Magazine, declares that he is entirely opposed to the principle of compulsory arbitration, because he thinks it would be sheer madness on the part of the working men of America to give up their right to engage in a strike whenever circumstances may demand it. He goes on to use arguments in support of his position. that after five months' struggle in connection with the great anthracite coal strike, the force of public, of judicial, and of legislative opinion impelled the owners to agree to a settlement of that trouble, and, as a result, arbitration was eventually resorted to. Surely that is not voluntary conciliation. It is, rather, compulsory arbitration of the very worse type. In America trades unionists take up their present position because they wish to retain the power to strike, and also because they have absolutely no faith in their Judiciary. exist for that lack of faith. I am not in a position to say, but I rejoice to think that we have not yet reached that pass in Australia. working men of the Commonwealth are content to trust our Judiciary, and to submit these important matters to its decision. condition of affairs prevails in England similar to that which obtains in America. At a recent congress, which was held in Manchester, the leading unionists urged that the one powerful weapon, which had secured to them all the progress and advancement of the past fifty years, was that of industrial warfare-the and that it was their duty to see that no Parliament deprived them of that right. Thev further declared that they had no faith in decisions which might be given by. their Mr Mauger. Judiciary. That is a deplorable condition of affairs. These are the reasons why the workers of Great Britain and America refuse to subscribe to the principle of compulsory arbitration. I am, however, of . opinion, that before many years have elapsed they will have changed their views just as Mr Ben Tillett, who was formerly opposed to that principle, was impelled I quite to change his opinions. He visited New Zealand for that purpose of inquiring into the working of the Arbitration Act there, and. as a result, was converted into an advocate of the compulsory system. Similarly, I believe that as the trades unionists of England gain experience in regard to Trades Union, which numthis matter, they will do as they did in members, and is perconnexion with the system of voting by union in ballot-follo w in the footsteps of Australia, and support the principles which are embodied in this Bill. We believe that our Judiciary will do the right thing. We have every confidence in the Court which it is proposed to establish. More than that, we hold that strikes are barbarous, and that industrial war is even more calamitous than is war between nations. It leaves an inHe says effaceable trail in fhe sufferings of women and children, and ought, therefore, by all means, to ' be avoided, even at the risk of great loss on the part of those engaged in our great industrial affairs. The honourable member for North Sydney also contended that the prosperity of New Zealand was due to its great natural resources, and to the fact that Providence had been kind to it. But surely those great natural resources existed prior to the enactment of this particular form of legislation. New Zealand was just as proWhether any grounds lific before 1891 as it has been since.

Such tactics do not always bring about beneficial results to the employers. I also agree with the honourable member for Darling, that the advent of the Employers' Federation, and the almost insane utterances of its executive officers, have sent time. done more to re-vitalize trades unionism in Victoria than has all the preaching in which supporters of unionism have indulged for the last twenty years. with the. passing of the Coercion Act in Victoria, have brought about that result. not passed by the Victorian Parliament.

157,Mr Mauger,"And I am satisfied thatlegislation in Victoria, that the minimum wage invariably becomes the maximum. We are constantly being told in this State that the minimum wage always becomes the maximum wage; that under that principle conscientious work must go unrewarded, and that the careless man is just as highly thought of as is the man who puts intelligence and skill into his labour. We know that that is contrary to fact. Under a minimum wage provision we say, in effect, to the employers of the country ""You are to begin at a certain standard; but it is open to you to reward intelligence and thrift and faithf u l service as much as you please."" I am happy to say that such service is being rewarded by the majority of the employers of Victoria. I have before me a statement that completely controverts the assertion of the honourable member for Wentworth as to the effect of a minimum wage. I refer to a quotation from a report of the Chief Inspector of Factories in Victoria, which is an irrefutable reply to the assertion that the principle of the minimum wage is reducing the standard of living, that there is no effort to go beyond the minimum fixed, and that all workers under it are brought 'down to the one common level. Mr Ord saysI am anxious to refer to a statement repeatedly made by some manufacturers, and which frequently appears in the press. that the minimum wage is nearly always the maximum wage, and that the fixing of same tends to take away from the good workman the incentive to do his best.

There is no connection whatever between the price paid by a man for his clothing and that which the manufacturer gives to have it made up. The late J. B. Patterson, when Premier of Victoria, received the first deputation which set in motion the factory legislation of the State, and in the course of the interview he discovered that his own clothes, for which he was paying a fair price, were being made by sweated men and women at a shamefully low rate. We sought to prevent the repetition of such occurrences, and -1 am proud to say that the Victorian Factories Act has had that effect. It has made the minimum wage not even the average wage, to say nothing of it being the maximum. Then the Chief Inspector of Factories goes on to say in his -report thatIn the boot trade the minimum wage is 42s.

I think that under our present system every employer should join an organization. But as the employers recognise the value of organizing, and of appointing lecturers and secretaries, they should be prepared to concede to the employees the right to take similar action, and should rejoice in the fact that the employees are preparing to meet them upon a fair and reasonable basis. The honourable member for North Sydney appeared to think that the New South Wales Arbitration Act is likely to break down; but in the Review of Reviezvs there is an admirable article which I commend to honourable members. It is by the leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, Mr J. H. Carruthers. He does not appear to be favourably inclined to this kind of legislation. all the more significant and valuable, and bears out my contention that the New South Wales Act has been fairly successful. Time and experience will make it more successful, and if reasonableness is shown by both sides the results are likely to be all that we desire. Mr Carruthers writesThere seems to be no middle course. With the political situation of Australia, adult suffrage, vote by ballot, and the great power of the people over Parliaments and Governments, industrial disputes, if .permitted"" to engender strikes, will beas to what should be done. I am decidedly come political disputes, and the institution of self government will be degraded. That has been and will continue to be the case. These matters are not subjects for political discussion or political settlement. They should be settled by a judicial body having proper information and data before it. Mr Carruthers continuesFar better to have a wisely-designed law, administered by an impartial Judge and assessors, and maintained free from political interference, than to have every industry in the land at the mercy of politicians created for the purpose of taking sides in industrial warfare. The present law is but an experiment, but it is a valuable one, and, with a fair trial, it bids fair to show us errors to be avoided, and some solid achievement to maintain. Those wordsapply to the measure which we have now under consideration. I hope that all the wisdom and thought which can be brought to bear upon it will be given to * it, and that the result will be an Act of which we shall have reason to be proud. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). -The number of points of view from which honourable members have dealt with this question on its second discussion in this Chamber is astonishing. In the many speeches to which I have listened, both yesterday and to-day, I have not heard the subject dealt with by any two speakers from the same stand-point, and I find myself in the position of being able to express my opinions from a point of view which, I think, has not yet been referred to. I am not opposed to this legislation. On the contrary, I am firmly convinced that something in the direction of compulsory arbitration must ultimately take place. My experience as a manufacturer and a considerable employer of labour has taught me that no other means for securing industrial peace exists. But in dealing with this measure we are brought face to . face with a great political crisis. We cannot blind our eyes to the fact that we have to consider, not only the concrete proposals put before us by the Government, but also the question which party shall ultimately hold the reins of power in this Commonwealth. As I have already fully expressed my views upon' the subject of arbitration, and the need for doing something to secure to labour its fair share of the rewards of industry, I should not have spoken on the subject again but. for the very extraordinary and peculiar circumstance to which I allude. The position-of affairs is a very confused one, and no two of 'us are quite*in accord in favour of making an attempt to deal with such industrial disputes as we are empowered to deal with by the Constitution. The experience which has been gained elsewhere and in the States in the adjustment of industrial differences, although not entirely favorable, is sufficient to warrant us in continuing what I regard as experimental legislation, and to that extent I must support it. But, as I have already stated. I do not think it is the wisest measure that we could adopt for dealing with the very grave and far-reaching difficulties",35,Second Readinc

167,Mr Mauger,"That makes his articlewhich must present themselves. The adoption of compulsory arbitration in varying degree has occurred in several of the States, and the result in some of them has been practically successful. Although the success of the New Zealand legislation is to be discounted to some extent by the prosperity which has so happily befallen that country, the operation of the New Zealand Acts has been in the main satisfactory. The Victorian wages boards, which had a somewhat similar end in view, have also been successf u l in remedying to some extent the grave consequences which have been due to free competition in the employment of labour in this State. though not the wisest that could have been devised, has also, I am forced to admit, not which its administration has caused has been due largely to the fact that it descends to deal with a great variety of detail. Instead of laying downbroad principles and main lines of settlement it has descended to such trumpery and trivial details that a vast amount of irritation has been caused. Yet, on the whole, while we must view all this legislation as tentative, I consider that this Parliament is justified in carrying the experiment still further, by providing for a method of settling disputes which extend beyond the control of the Legislatures of the States. Such disputes must be of vast magnitude, and very far reaching in their consequences, not only to those immediately concerned, but to the whole public of the Commonwealth. It is not here or there, but from one end of the world to the other, that disputes between capital and labour, between employer and employee, arise, and any effort to bring about industrial peace must be regarded as laudable. I think it is forced upon those who oppose compulsory arbitration to tell us what is the alternative. No man who goes about the world with his eyes and ears open can ignore the present economic difficulties, the friction, want of agreement, and industrial discord which exist from China to Peru. We hear daily of strikes and disputes between the two great factors in the economic production of the world. Therefore those who oppose legislation for the settlement of these disputes should set before us some alternative. To my mind, we must either meet these difficulties, or be prepared to submit to a condition of anarchy.. My reading and my personal experience make me believe that no better solution has yet been offered than the adoption of arbitration, and arbitration is useless unless it is made compulsory. All systems of arbitration which have hitherto been adopted have done a certain amount of good, but in most instances, unless those in disagreement are compelled to come to terms, no great amount of good is to be looked for from arbitration. The better class of employers, who desire to treat their men well, are frequently prevented from improving the condition of their employees by the competition of others, who, by treating their men less generously, are able to produce more cheaply. Compulsory arbiThe New 'South Wales Act, tration for such employers would be an advantage, because it would compel all to conform to a certain standard. In my been unsuccessful. The friction opinion, we must either follow in the lines of the economic evolution of civilized society, or we must be prepared for a devolution, under which the nation, by reason of its falling off in physique and intellectual vigour, must be crushed out of existence by other nations; or there must he an absolute revolution. We shall do well to move on the lines of well-known natural forces, resistance to which would bring about a greater national disaster than any slight loss accruing to employers under legislation which would give employees greater profits than they now enjoy. A great deal has been said about the teachings of history with regard to this matter. I think I have read history to as great an extent as most ordinary men, and. like most ordinary men, I find that my reading has been to a large extent undigested. Certain 'very general broad impressions have, however, been left on mv mind, and one of these is that the world has for centuries past been moving in the one direction. It is as if one saw the curve of a circle, and were asked to state in what direction the line was proceeding. One would have no difficulty in predicting the course which the line would describe, because one could see that it had been following a certain direction. If we learn anything at all from our historical reading, we gather that, from the dawn of history up to yesterday, the general tendency of economics has been in the direction of a more equitable distribution of the products of labour. All that we have been able to read of history, of that of.the last ioo years in particular, shows that the State has interfered more and more in the direction of bringing I about an equitable distribution of the results of labour. All the talk indulged in regarding the suggestions which were made in the middle ages, and which were adopted, and afterwards discarded, go for nothing, in view of the general trend of history, which has been in the one direction and with a strengthening purpose. The teaching of history alone shows us that we'must adopt some such legislation as this in order to keep pace with the evolution that has been in progress. The main objection to this class of legislation has been summed up in one word, which has been repeated so persistently and with so much force that it has almost silenced many supporters of this measure. I refer to the word ""socialism."" There would be some trouble in denning that word in such a way that the definition would be accepted by every one engaged in this discussion. We have been recently invited by one of the newspapers of Melbourne to give our definitions of that word. I should be very pleased indeed if we 'could induce every honourable member to give an absolutely unbiased opinion, apart from any reference to the encyclopaedia, regarding the meaning of that word. done and an average were struck, the result would probably be to give us the general acceptation of the term, although, of course, many of the opinions .would be diametrically opposed. The word "" socialism "" has been used as a weapon by the strongest opponents of legislation of this kind. I was very much struck by an incident related by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, whose experience coincides with my own. The honourable and learned member told us that he had had a conversation with a gentleman of his acquaintance in a train. was apparently well-to-do. If he had not been he would scarcely have given his opinion that the country was going to the dogs, and that socialism was ruining the community. This same gentleman, before he left the honourable and learned member, said that Parliament ought to do something by way of legislation in a certain direction in which he was interested, and his suggestion was as purely socialistic as anything that has ever been proposed in this Chamber. Those who are so strongly opposed to socialism when it does not bring anything into their own pockets are among its staunchest advocates when it bears upon some large scheme of irrigation, a proposal for the payment of iron bonuses, or for something else in which they are interested. Mr G. B. Edwards. Then they are absolutely socialistic; because they wish to bring about a combination of all the forces of the State in order to secure a certain result. That is one of the definitions of socialism. When, however, something is proposed which will confer benefit upon others, but will not be attended by any particular advantage to them, these self same gentlemen declare that they will have nothing to do with it, and that socialism is ruining the country. According to one encyclopaedia, to which I referred, socialism is "" a new form of social organization, based upon a fundamental change in the economic order of society in which the collective or co-operative principle shall become normal or usual, and under which all shall share in the fruits of associated labour, in accordance with some good or equitable principle/' That is socialism, and adhering strictly to that definition, we have amongst us very many socialistic institutions, which have succeeded past all the expectations of those who proposed them. Take the post-office, for instance. Those who oppose such a measure as this on the ground that it is If this could be socialistic, say that everything should be left to private enterprise, that we have no right to ..interfere with the liberty of the individual. If we applied that class of reasoning to the post-office, it would be claimed that every person should have liberty to despatch his letters in his own way, at his own time, and according to his own methods. But, after the experience of the post-office for two centuries, we have come to the conclusion that this measure of socialism has resulted in the greatest benefit to the whole body politic, poor and rich, old and young. If 'it be good that a man This gentleman should be able to exchange his ideas upon business or social matters through some medium of Government creation, why should he not be able to send his linen to a national laundry, get it washed, and returned to him? This is done in some countries. Socialism resolves itself into a question of how rapidly it is wise for us to proceed. Some countries have gone beyond our present standard, and others have lagged behind,. and the question as to how rapidly it is wise to proceed in the direction of the whole body of the people doing something through its Government, in the interests of the community generally, is purely one of expediency. France regulates it's funerals and its public laundries, and has many other institutions which we should consider! socialistic; but the State has not yet ply' the labour necessary to transform the taken over the control of the railways in that raw material into a marketable article."" country.

Let me take the case of the honourable and learned member for Parkes, who is absent from the House to-day. He is one of the ablest opponents of this Bill. I cite his case because he is one of the best of a class which is opposed to it. He goes to an extreme and conjures up the bogy of capital being affrighted by such legislation and in some mysterious manner leaving Australia.. He paints a picture of capitalists packing up their belongings and seeking refuge upon another planet. I hold that that is a mere bogy. learned member ought to give some consideration to the absolute condition of things existing to-day in some parts of the world --the condition of a hungry proletariat, incensed because they are not getting their fair share of this world's goods, who as a result are endeavouring to secure remedial legislation of a just character, but who, to attain their ends, will, in the last resort, not hesitate to adopt revolutionary measures or something akin to them. Surely it is better to consider how far we can meet existing difficulties in a spirit of compromise than to defy the terrible situation which may arise if every proposed remedy is resisted. acted the principle of one man one vote. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -It is because we have enacted that principle that we shall ultimately succeed in securing this legislation. there is no need to resort to revolution. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I hold that it is bad policy to resist the inevitable. The leader of the Opposition once remarked that when he came to a stone wall he got over it if"" he could, but that if he could not he got made would have to be of an open and under it. If he could not do either, he would lie down beside it. I ask the opponents of this Bill to accommodate themselves to the inevitable, and instead of opposing it tooth and nail, to join with others in effecting a reasonable measure of reform. Many of its opponents constitute the ablest men amongst us. I refer more particularly to the honourable member for North Sydney, and the honourable and learned member for Parkes. I am convinced that if they will endeavour to make this measure a workable one, they will ultimately accomplish more good than they will achieve by blindly opposing it. It has been stated that if the Government are defeated upon the Bill, we shall have a dissolution of this House and another general election. That sort of threat is frequently used when we are face to face with a difficulty of this character. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I do not know. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The Prime Minister himself has no excuse for urging a dissolution, because he boldly announced his views to his constituents, not only upon the measure but upon its details. The same remark is applicable to myself. I am not a supporter of all its details, but I certainly The honourable and favour extending its operation to the railway servants of the States. So far as I am concerned, I see no need whatever for a dissolution, although I do not fear one. I am perfectly willing to return to my constituents, and to stand or fall on the views which I have expressed upon this Bill, but I should be equally prepared to forego my opinions if, by doing so, I could bring about what I consider to be a very much healthier condition of affairs in this Parliament. Prior to the opening of the present session, the statement was made that we required a re-adjustment of parties in this House. From the first moment that I saw the relative strength of those parties I realized that the fiscal issue would have to be buried-a t least for a time, and consequently it -became more easy to effect a political combination for the good of Australia. I was prepared to hear of some proposals in that direction. To the credit of this Parliament be it ably kept the promise which he made to his constituents at Ballarat, that if any coalition were attempted, he would be no party to any secret understanding. He declared that whatever arrangements were public character. The same attitude -was taken up by the leader of the Opposition. Upon no occasion has the right honourable member sought to influence the personal views of his supporters upon this particular question. It has been left entirely to the individual judgment of honourable members on both sides of the House. I regret, however, that some solution of the difficulty does not appear to be likely before we reach a stage at which it will be almost impossible to retrace our steps.

I should like to see a strong capable Government of that kind dealing with those and the still greater questions of finance, immigration, the control of our rivers, and other matters which demand the best talent that we can secure. It is my desire that this measure should be passed in some shape or other, and I think that it should be possible to give effect to it, at all events in some modified form. It is highly desirable that we should adopt a spirit of compromise if only in order to determine whether a measure of this kind, if applied to the Commonwealth, would be as efficacious as many honourable members believe it would be, or whether it would be the failure that others predict.

I believe that this could be more happily and effectually achieved by a strong capable Government, created by some coalition of parties, than by any Government consisting of honourable members of the Labour Party, or of any one party in the House. I have no personal or political antipathy to the Labour Party. As a matter of fact, I coincide with their views to as great an extent as does any honourable member outside the party; but I do not think it would be to the best interests of Australia to leave the control of its affairs in the hands of the reprevants of the States from its operation ? It sentatives of a mere section of the people. Perhaps the only way to secure an adequate solution of the problem with which we are confronted would be to allow our honourable friends of the Labour Party an opportunity to form an Administration. If that were done it might lead to that coalition of parties, which we all appear to desire, but are apparently unable to accomplish. It may be asked, what have I done towards bringing about such a Goalition. It is not given, however, to the mere satellites of readjustment of party relations. readjustment must come from the fixed stars and the suns of the system. Since they have .failed us in this instance we have to submit to the existing conditions, and to endeavour, while awaiting the result, whatever it may be, of the present position, to carry out the remaining our own individual principles. I ' am in favour of this measure, and I also favour such an amendment of it as will bring the railway employees under its operation. A Bill of this kind that did not extend to the employee's of the great railway services throughout the States would not be a measure of Federal arbitration, and would fail to meet the greatest demand likely to be made upon such legislation. I am convinced, as an ordinary layman, that we should not exceed our constitutional power if we extended the operation of the Bill to those employees. Lawyers differ on this point. The Prime Minister himself does not seem to be %'ery emphatic in the view that the railway servants of the States cannot be brought under the operation of this measure. The only way in which Mr G. B. EDWARDS All I can say test -the effect of a measure of is that the honourable and learned gentleman, in the two speeches which he has made on this question, has failed to convince me that he entertains a positive opinion on the point. He appeared to take up the ground that such an extension of the scope of the Bil l would be unconstitutional, and that, if it were not, .even as a matter of expediency, it would be unwise to avail ourselves of the f u l l extent of our powers in this direction. One approaches with bated breath a question of legal interpretation, such as that with which I propose to deal later on; but I feel satisfied that we have this power. If we do not possess it, why should we seek in this B ill to expressly exclude the railway seris a matter for regret that it has been impossible to approach the consideration of this question with a stronger and more capable Government in powera Government better able to carry out legislation in the direction which they think desirable -tha n is the present Administration. After the general elections we had an opportunity to secure such a Government-on e that might have passed this measure in some form, as well as many other Bills which would promote the ultimate good of the political life to bring about a Commonwealth. Instead of availing ourThe selves of that opportunity, however, we find that we have a Government which, instead",40,Thomson Therefore Said The Prime Minister Has Honor
172,Mr Deakin,"I am positive on the point.of taking the initiative, and endeavouring to remove the entanglement due to the conflicting interests of parties, is simply waiting the ultimate outcome of the resulting difficulty. If an arrangement such as I have suggested had been brought about, I should have been prepared, if necessary, to give up my own convictions as to bringing the railway employees of the States within the provisions of this Bill. As a matter of fact, I informed some of my own friends of my willingness to do so. Some honourable members have much to say of consistency, but in many cases an absurd view is taken of that virtue. only consistency to principle. have two principles which are dear to him, and in certain circumstances it may be necessary for him to decide which of those is dearest to his heart, and, perhaps, nearest to his honour. that the railway employees of the States should be brought within the scope of this measure, I do not say that it should apply to all public servants. ment would include a class of professional men that we do not intend to bring under the Bill if they are outside the service. A difficulty among the railway men of the States, however, would . be the most disastrous of any that we could face, and they ought not, therefore, to be omitted from this measure. A Federal Arbitration Bill which took no cognizance of the railway employees of the Stateswould be like the play of Hamlet with the Prince of Denmark and all his family, so to speak, left out. Why should we ignore the railway employees? play a most important part in the operations of the States, and if they went to extremes might play a disastrous part. Nevertheless, if a coalition such as I have mentioned could have been brought about I should have been prepared if necessary to give up my desire to see them brought within this Bill. have felt myself impelled to resign my seat, and to appeal to my constituents to endorse my action, inasmuch as at the last elections I told them that I should vote for the inclusion of the State railway servants in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. had been considered necessary to secure a strong Government to carry on the affairs of this nation, which is as yet in its childhood, I . should have been prepared to sacrifice my own views in this respect. But we ha%e had no proposal in that direction. Mr G. B. Edwards. We are face to face with the fact that we must proceed with the consideration of the Bill under existing circumstances, and that we are called upon to give expression to our individual opinions, and I , for one, intend to adhere to my original view that the railway employees of the States should be brought under the operation of the measure. This measure departs but slightly from the Bill introduced last session, and the difficulty which I have experienced in dealing with both of them is that no concise declaration has been given either by the Prime Minister or by any other member of the Government, of what will Consistency after all is be the precise effect of such a measure. We One may know that under the Constitution we cannot deal with any dispute that does not extend beyond the limits of any one State. Yet this Bill contains all the machinery provisions that would be necessary if the ConAlthough convinced stitution declared in plain unmistakable terms that we had the sole right to legislate for the settlement of all industrial disputes. The Prime Minister has not addressed himSuch an amendself, either in this House or outside of it, to the question of how far these machinery provisions are to be employed, and to what extent it is proposed to put them in operation. The honourable and learned gentleman is somewhat chary of interfering with States rights, so far as the railway employees or other public servants are concerned. But he has not had much to say of the infringement of State rights, so far as private enterprise is' concerned. Although, by interjection and otherwise, we have asked for an explanation of the object of all these machinery provisions, the honourable and They learned gentleman has made no response. It is plain that the Bill has been framed, as was stated by a member of the Government, or some prominent member of the House, in the hope that at some future period we shall be given power by the States to exercise all possible jurisdiction for the settlement of disputes between emIn that event I should ployer and employed. Wedo not know how far the present Administration intend to set these machinery provisions in motion, but the fact remains that they will . be available for interference in everv possible way with States rights. If it BeforeI consent to the Bill coming out of committee, I shall endeavour to obtain a rigid expression of the intention of the Prime Minister as to the extent to which this machinery will operate, and as to at what stages of a dispute it is to be used. 1 It seems to me an attempt to grasp the whole power of settling disputes, and a more violent invasion of State rights than the inclusion of State servants. Not one petition or remonstrance of the many which have been addressed to us, from all parts of Australia, objects to the inclusion of railway men; but members of Chambers of Commerce, of Chambers of Manufactures, and employers generally, object to the attempt which is being made to enable the Commonwealth to interfere for the settlement of every industrial dispute throughout the length and breadth of the land. It is only in regard to this matter that the people are alive to the threatened invasion of State tion excludes them, why make any reference rights. Here and there a prominent politician, in a State Parliament, may have expressed indignation at the proposal to include State servants in the Bill, but the great mass of the people have taken no notice of that proposal, and have confined their remonstrances to the effort of the Government to bring the most trumpery disputes within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court. It may be an open question whether to apply the provisions of the Bill to State servants would be an invasion of State rights ; but this other violation of the constitutional rights of the States is disgraceful, and cannot be disguised. I have heard the Prime Minister make many magnificent speeches, but two of the very best were those which he made on the second reading of the previous Bill, and in moving the second reading of this Bill. His first speech was better than one could have expected even from him, and what I chiefly admired in both was his whole-souled sympathy with the labouring classes, and his desire that they should obtain their fair share of the results of their labours. His illustration of the private duello, and the need for restricting similar action on the part of organized bands of industry, was, I think, one of the best efforts of the kind we have had in this Chamber. Like him, I am a most loyal adherent of the .Constitution. I feel that we must imbue our children with loyalty to it, and I am pleased to see statesmen like the honourable and learned gentleman ready to resist any attempt to violate it. It seems to me, however, that in connection with this measure the Prime Minister has strained at a gnat while swallowing a camel. He is ready to resist the violation of State rights implied by the inclusion of State servant's in the Billthough I do not think that that would be a violation-bu t he had nothing to say against the still more serious violation to which I refer. all through Mr G. B. EDWARDS I do not think so. The title of it, at all events, is good.. So are some of the definitions, and many of its provisions; and I hope that in committee we shall make it a good measure. If it be unconstitutional to apply the provisions of the Bill to -State servants, why has the Prime Minister specifically excluded them from its operation? If the Constituto them at all? Why not leave it to the High Court to say whether they are or are not included ? If we were content to pass a law providing for the settlement of disputes between employers and employees, and a dispute arose between the Government of a. State and some of its employees, the High Court would have to decide whether the suit could be entertained. to apply the provisions of the Bill to State servants ? Mr G. B. EDWARDS I am not now dealing with the question of expediency. I am dealing with absolute facts. decide whether it is expedient. Mr G., B. EDWARDS -The Prime Minister, at all events, is not in that position. He belives that it is unconstitutional to attempt to apply these provisions to State servants, and he should therefore have made no reference to them in the Bill. member recollect the circumstances under which the Bill was drafted? Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Whateve r the circumstances under which the original Bill was drafted, it was the duty of the Prime Minister to see that this measure embodied his own fixed opinions. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -In that case, the honourable and learned gentleman has no fixed opinions, because he proposes to exclude from the operation of the Bill a set of persons to whom he says its provisions cannot apply. is ignoring the circumstances under which the Bill was framed.

178,Mr Deakin,"The honourable memberthe Age, by means of a petty larceny, or in some manner which was not quite straightforward, and the summary of its provisions, printed next morning, contained no reference to State servants. prove that there was no reference in the draft to State servants. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I was connected with the press for fourteen years, and I know that a salient feature such as I refer to would not be lost sight of. charge of the Bill gave a copy of it to a reporter of the Age. What occurred was due to a misunderstanding. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -There was a breach of honour somewhere. When Mr regard to the control of State emploves. Irvine was interviewed on the subject he was in a state of some hesitation; but if it had been proposed to include State servants we -know that he would have had nothing to do with 'such a proposal. The Prime Minister says that it would be absolutely unconstitutional to include State serof the very able gentlemen who adorn the vants in the Bill, and yet he has inserted a provision which specifically excludes them. forgets that the right honourable gentleman who shortly afterwards left the Cabinet held the opinion that if there were no reference to State servants they would be included. I differed from him.. I said that if there were of the Commonwealth. Nothing has a more no reference they would be excluded. The provision inserted in the Bill was adopted to meet the views of my colleague, and to place the matter bevond-all doubt. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I am in accord with the right honourable member for Adelaide. I think that if no reference were made to State servants the provisions of the Bill would extend to them. There is the suspicion afloat, however, that the subsequent revision of the Bill was an instance, if not of panic legislation, of panic draftsmanship. If a certain event had not occurred in Victoria we might not have heard of this exemption clause. for Richmond last night referred a good deal to English history, and particularly to the history of the Revolution. When he was speaking the recollection crossed my memory that after the Revolution they adopted in England the Bill of Rights, and in Scotland the Claim of Rights. According to the best English lawyers, the institution of torture was always illegal in England, and consequentiv there was no need ro deal with it in the Bill of Rights; but, as the best Scotch lawyers considered it to be legal in Scotland, it was thought that it should be dealt with in the Claim of Rights. However, while the matter was under consideration, Lord Advocate Lockhart was murdered under circumstances of considerable atrocity, and that occurrence determined those, who were dealing with the matter that the right to torture should be maintained. They decided an abstract proposition wholly because of particular circumstances brought under their purview at the time. Thev refused to abolish torture because at that particular juncture they wished to use the right to torture. That was an instance of panic legislation; and, similarly, I think that the Victorian strike had 10 do with the drafting of this Bill in It seems to me that it had a great deal to do with the proposal made here to positively exclude them. I do not for a moment doubt our power under the Constitution to do so; but I wish to leave the whole question open, and await the considered decision High Court Bench. In dealing with the question whether States employees, particularly railway servants, could be brought within the scope of our powers under the Constitution, I would point out that section 51 gives us the power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government important bearing upon the maintenance of peace, order, and good government in Australia than the vast network of railways in each of the States. The peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth is very largely dependent upon the relations which exist between the railway employees and the Commissioners. On dissecting this important section, we find that by sub-section 1, trade and commerce between the States is brought under our supreme control. Under sub-section IT. we have power to deal with taxation. A question has been raised as to whether we could The honourable member tax States imports. I believe that that point is now being submitted for the decision of the High Court, but I have always entertained the view that it is absolutely essential that we should have the power to tax States imports, and I see nothing in the Constitution to the contrary. This power is clearly necessary for the protection of other States. There is no distinct provision to this effect in the Constitution, and the power is conferred only by inference. In connexon with the power of taxation, we have the right to levy",43,Thomson Therefore Said The Prime Minister Has Honor
179,Mr Robinson,That fact does not,44,Thomson Therefore Said The Prime Minister Has Honor

181,Mr Deakin,"The honourable memberexcise commodities manufactured within the Commonwealth. Should we have power to tax the products of a State distillery or of a State tobacco manufactory ? I say clearly we should have such power. It is not given to us in express terms, but it is conferred by inference. We find that under section 91 of the Constitution we have power to grant bounties. Could we give bounties to a State Government? Do we make any distinction between a State Government and an individual? It has actually been proposed in this House to give a bounty to a State Government in connection with the production of iron. Then, again, subsection XIII . of section 51 confers powers upon us to deal with banking other thai State banking, and also with State banking which extends beyond the limits of the State concerned. We are not to interfere with State banking when it does not extend beyond the limits of the State concerned. That is also the only limitation to our powers in connection with conciliation and arbitration. As long as a dispute is kept within a Stale we cannot interfere. It is only when it extends beyond the limits of a State that this Parliament has power to step in and deal with it. In regard to banking and insurance, we can interfere the moment that the business of any State in these matters extends beyond its own border, and in the same way we can step in under sub-section XXXV . . which confers upon us the power to create tribunals for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. It has been stated, notably by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. who, together with Mr Theodore Fink, has -contributed a long opinion to one of the Melbourne newspapers, that we cannot interfere between the State and its employees, because if the Arbitration Court raised the the to make the necessary provision. Passing by, for the moment, the assumption -that wages would be raised in every case, and noting that the Court will deal with many Questions besides that of wages, I would ask if there are not many difficulties precisely similar to those indicated by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo and Mr Fink with reference to -other Federal institutions, in connection with which the power of the Federal authorities is unquestioned. Take the High Court itself. That Court might decide in duties on spirits and other its appellate jurisdiction against the verdict of a State Court, that the State should pay ^100,000 as compensation to persons injured through some accident upon the railways arising from defective mechanism or gross carelessness. Can it be contended for a moment that the State would refuse to make the necessary provision to comply with the decision of the High Court? Take the case of banking or insurance. Suppose a State entered into banking or insurance business, and extended its operations beyond its own borders, and thereby opened the way for the exercise of the undoubted power of -this Parliament to impose regulations, would the State authorities resist a provision by us that certain securities should be deposited with the Federal Government ? We can see that the decisions of institutions created by the Federal Parliament might be at variance with those of somewhat similar institutions created by the States Parliaments, and that if the latter were disposed to go to extremes they might resist the Federal authority. We do not, however, for a moment apprehend that such' a position of affairs would ever come about. The same people who created the machinery in one case would be called upon in the other case to find the funds necessary to comply with the authority exercised through that machinery. I do not see how any difficulty could arise, unless wetake a view that is not warranted by anything we know of English communities under free institutions. If a rigid interpretation is to be placed upon the Constitution, I would invite the attention of honourable and learned members to section 98, which gives power to the Parliament to make laws relating to trade and commerce, extending to navigation and shipping, and to the railways the property of any State. That is very definite', but would it not also apply to private railways? Most decidedly. They wages of the State employees are not mentioned, but that fact does not State Parliament might refuse exempt them from the operation of the section. Would not the power of the Federal authorities also apply to States shipping? Suppose a State entered into the shipping business for the purpose of competing with private firms. Does any one suppose that, under our Interstate Commission we could not submit State-owned ships to exactly the same conditions that we imposed upon private ships? In the same way is it to be for one moment imagined that we could not impose the same obligations on private railways that were intended to apply to State railways? Yet, if we were to rigidly interpret that section, as some honorBill refer. There are one or two other able members appear inclined to treat the sub-section relating to conciliation and arbitration, we should be forced by a parity of reasoning to exclude private railways and States ships from the operation of the Federal authority. Then, again, take the case of the Swiss cantons, and the provision made for education under the Swiss Constitution where the Federal Parliament has provided for an excellent system of compulsory education, and the cantons are called upon to find the funds to carry it out. The system may be extended and rendered more expensive from time to time, and yet because of the good sense of the community there is no friction. The Prime Minister said that the case of Switzerland was not on all fours with our own. Nor is it. But we have to remember' that ever since its establishment the Swiss Federation has been moving more and more in the direction of our Constitution. Yet. in regard to the question not only of education, but of the .maintenance of roads and several minor matters, the Swiss people have experienced no difficulty whatever as the rewhere we stand. Concerning the details sult of allowing the National Legislature to enact laws for the administration of which the Governments of the Cantons are obliged to find the money. In my judgment, what we need is a measure dealing upon broad general lines with disputes which are likely to pass beyond the limits of any one State. At the same time, our legislation should not embrace minute details such as are dealt with by State laws. If a dispute be of a Commonwealth character, it necessarily follows that it can have little to do with those minute details which occupy so much time in our State Arbitration Courts, leading to a congestion of business, and preventing the unions from obtaining those speedy decisions upon the main issues involved upon which the success of this class of legislation largely depends. If we could obtain an Act which is . capable of dealing chiefly with the broad questions involved in wages-because the matter of holidays may be settled by, local custom or by State legisdecisions of the Arbitration Court. lation-I hold that we should secure advantageous legislation, because it could be applied to large disputes, such as maritime, railway, or shearers' disputes, all of which we know, from experience, are likely It should prepare, and not for the minor Mr G. B. Edwards. troubles to which certain portions of the matters to which I desire to direct attention. In the first place, I observe that the' title of the Bill has been altered. That seems to me an admission of the existence of some of the difficulties which I have already endeavoured to point out. When the Bill was under consideration in Committee last year, the present Prime Minister proposed to amend clause 3, so as to make its wording harmonize exactly with the paragraph in the Constitution which has reference to this question. At the time. I could not help remarking that his action was probably taken with a veiw to obtaining the decision of the High Court as to the powers which we possess in regard to this legislation. I pointed out that it would be far betterto adopt the phraseology of the Constitution itself in the title of the Bill. That suggestion, I am pleased to note, has now been acted upon. I think that it is wise to test our constitutional powers upon the very title of the measure. We shall then know exactly of the measure, I have previously. stated that in my opinion we are committing a mistake in refusing to appoint permanent Justices to the Arbitration Court. It is urged that we require to have Justices who are skilled in the special matters which will be submitted for their consideration. But experience has taught us that it is utterly impossible to obtain the services of Justices who will be skilled in all matters which come before an Arbitration Court. To my mind it is wrong to appoint two gentlemen, who are simply the nominees of the rival parties to any dispute. If a similar system were adopted in other Courts, chaos would be created immediately. In those Courts matters of even weightier import than those which will occupy the attention of the Arbitration Court are decided Some of our mining courts have to determine questions which involve larger sums of money than those which will be affected by the Personally, I am of the opinion that it would be wise to appoint three Justices to settle disputes under this Bill. The idea that it is necessary to have Judges who are possessed of, special knowledge is an to recur sooner or later. erroneous one. The proper place for an is for these disputes that we expert is the witness-box. It has been stated that Mr Justice Cohen and some members of the Arbitration Court in New South Wales have complained that they could not follow the intricacies of certain cases which came before them. But I would point out that it is no. new experience to find Justices in other Courts admitting, in exceptional cases, that they have been confronted by a difficulty from an absence of technical knowledge. In such circumstances, they have to obtain the best assistance available from experts in the witness-box. too, that beyond the contending parties to disputes, the public are largely interested in their settlement. three Judges should represent the State just as much as do Judges in cases of civil or criminal jurisprudence. I hold in my hand the report of a statement made by Mr dustrial disputes to arbitration alone, and W. D. Cruickshank in regard to his position as a member of the Arbitration Court in New South Wales. The extract is taken from the Sydney Morning Herald, of 19th January last. It reads Mr W. D. Cruickshank, employers' representative in the Arbitration Court, attended the last meeting of the Council of the Employers' Federation, and made a statement in reference to the general principles by which he is guided in adjudicating upon arbitration matters. shank, said that Mr Smith, the representative of the employees, made it appear by his actions that he and Mr Cruickshank sat only as advocates for the parties they represented. suggested that the employers' case was prejudiced, as Mr Cruickshank was unacquainted with the circumstances before they came before him as a Judge. Other members of the Council said that some of the employers felt it would be in their interests if Mr Cruickshank would follow more the lines of Mr Smith, as they thought he sat there not as a Judge, but as an advocate. was also thought that it would be desirable for Mr Cruickshank to be approachable for advice by employers, as Mr Smith was for the employees. It was also stated that if certain matters conciliation in case of industrial disputes. I had been brought, before Mr Cruickshank prior to the hearing by the Court, the award might have been different. In reply to these remarks, Mr Cruickshank made an unequivocal declaration of policy. "" in continuous touch "" and being posted up "" was very much over-rated. In fact/he was quite satisfied, in his own mind, that any and all such posting up would be of very fractional and doubtf u l advantage, because employers' counsel, from his experience and training-if properly instructed-could, and no doubt would, put all the points before the Court much better than he could, and the sworn evidence must of necessity be the principal factor in determining any award. I think that Mr Cruickshank's opinion did fashion, and is one which would not be rehim honour. It will .be seen, from the cognised in any ordinary Court of law. I above extract, that the opinion exists feel that I may safely appeal to the lawyers amongst the organizations of labour and capital, that their nominees upon the Bench' are really advocates. That being the case, it should be pointed out that wherever there is room for a difference of opinion, the case is decided by the Judge. In such circumstances, I hold that we are wasting money in appointing these two additional men to the Bench. If any case is so intricate as to require the possession of special knowledge, that knowledge We have to recognise, should be supplied through the medium of the witness-box. I do not think that any legislation of the character proThe posed has gone far enough in the direction of ascertaining how much can be achieved by means of conciliation. Some of our State Acts provide for the reference of inothers fori their reference to a Conciliation Board in the first instance. In the latter case, conciliation fails utterly. In the' New South Wales Act-and ""it is likelv to be the case under this Bill-the arrangements made for bringing conciliatory methods to bear upon industrial disputes have practically no effect whatever. Up to the present time comparatively little has been done by means of conciliation. The PresiIt seems to me that the chief hope engendered by legislation of this character has been admirably summed up by a writer in the Argus, who saysTherefore, it was No Court, whether voluntary or compulsory, is to be considered successful unless it promotes the preliminary settlement of disputes by friendly meeting around a common table. The smaller the number of cases which come up for arbitration, because they cannot be settled by conciliation, the .greater is the success of the Court. The It business of the whole machinery of industrial conciliation must be preventive rather than curative. In this Bill no provision is made to induce hold that we can induce conciliation if we can compel it by making use of the selfinterests of the parties to disputes. In He said that the importance of being Committee I intend to submit a proposal having for its object the bringing about of a settlement of a larger number of industrial troubles by means of conciliation, and thus avoiding what I regard as the chief blot upon the New South Wales Act, namely, "" the splitting"" of differences. It is a principle, which in my opinion is fraught with great injustice. It allows questions to be settled in a haphazard",44,Thomson Therefore Said The Prime Minister Has Honor
182,"Dent, Mr H . Hudson, In Introducing Mr Cruick","of this House to support my statement, that the system of "" splitting differences,"" which has been adopted to a large extent by Arbitration Courts, would not be countenanced in any other tribunal. brought before the Court, in which the men demand for example, ns. per day, while the masters offer only ios. great deal of time in hearing evidence, the Court settles the dispute by fixing the wage at i os. 6d. per day. The effect of this system must be that the workers on the one hand will recognise that, if they fail to ask for a sufficiently high wage, they will be awarded a rate of pay less than they expect to receive, while the employers on the other hand will feel that if they do not make a sufficiently low offer, they will be called upon to pay more than they would otherwise be required to do. The result of the system is that parties are forced wider and wider apart. troduce the principle of equity we ought to do so. On one occasion, a comrade and I were in the bush, and our supplies were reduced to a very small piece of bread. We had had nothing to eat for ten hours, and my comrade, turning to me, said -"" I will halve the bread, and you may choose."" since then that that was the most absolutely equitable method of division that could have been devised. The nicety with which my friend divided the bread really left no advantage to be gained by making a choice. It seems to me that if we could bring a principle of that kind to bear under our Arbitration law we should effect much good. I consulted the right honourable member for Adelaide, whose absence I am sure we all regret, in reference to my desire that we should embody a principle of this kind in the Bill. He agreed that it was worthy of consideration, and assisted me in drafting an amendment which at a later stage I shall place before the House. The amendment embraces to a considerable extent the principle I have named, and I desire that it shall be ventilated at this stage. If it were brought into operation it would materially reduce the work which must otherwise flow to the Arbitration Court; it would also avoid such a congestion of business as now exists in the New Zealand and New South Wales courts. My proposal is, in effect, that the workmen on the one side and the masters on the other should come together in the conciliation stage of the proceedings provided for in this Bill, and that after they had fully discussed the points at Mr G. B. Edwards. issue they should be called upon, if unable to arrive at a satisfactory settlement of their differences, to place on the records of the Court the last offer made by the masters A case is and the latest demand made by the men. That record should be under the control of the registrar or the president of the Court, After wasting a and they should be able, if necessary, to return 'it to the parties, in order, to clear up any ambiguity in the language employed. The question at issue might relate not only to the rate of wages, but to holidays, overtime, the supply of tools, and other matters, and each party should be required to make a final offer in regard to every point at issue. When the dispute had passed On to the Arbitration Court, the Judge, after hearing all the evidence,, would say, unless he saw some strong reason for departing from this principle-""On points A, B, C, and D, the offer of the If we Could inmasters, or the demand of the men, should be conceded, and nothing else. ' : In this way we should bring the parties so closely together in the conciliation stage of the proceedings that they would hasten to settle their differences. After giving the matter much consideration, it appears to me that it is only by some such means as these that I have held the opinion ever we shall be able to induce conciliation, and so avoid the immense amount of work which must otherwise be thrown on the Court.. The principle which I have outlined is. not altogether new to jurisprudence. It is that underlying the old law of the Athenian democracy. We know that they had a system by which a person who instituted proceedings before the jury or dycastery was called upon to name the penalty to be imposed. The defendant had an opportunity to name some other penalty ; and, in the event of his conviction, the jury had to determine which of these two penalties should be imposed. It will readily be recognised that, in a state of society such as that of the old Grecian democracies, it was necessary to have some such power to prevent political animosity being pressed to extremes, and the persecution of men even to the death. We see the operation of this law in the historic trial' of Socrates. Socrates was charged by Miletus, the poet, Anytus, the tanner, and Lycon, the orator,, with denying the gods of Athens, and corrupting the youth. The charge was brought before the dycastery, and these three citizens were constituted the public' prosecutors. In those days they did' not have regular public prosecutors. Nostatutory penalties for crimes of this kind -and they were regarded as crimes-ex isted. Socrates had three courses open to him. himself on the mercy of the court by naming a lower penalty, he could plead-"" I am not guilty, but even if I am, the penalty named is excessive for such an offence""; or he could plead "" not guilty,"" and rely upon obtaining acquittal. As we all know, he was found guilty, and in a contemptuous spirit proposed an alternativefine of one mina. His friends, fearing that he would be put ,to death for making so contempuous an offer, expressed a readiness to pav thirty minas. Even that penalty, however, was considered insufficient, and Socrates went to the cup of hemlock. although now out of date, possesses features made in our Arbitration ""Courts, and which would certainly reduce the number of cases now being brought forward. The business of both the New Zealand and the New South Wales Courts is in a most congested state, and this has an irritating effect on all parties. If we laid down some principle on the lines which I have suggested, we should be able to induce conciliation, and do away with the excessive demands and unreasonable offers that we see, from time to time, in connection with cases that now come before the States Courts. The less friction we have in the working of our Arbitration Court, and the speedier and the more just the decisions of the Court the better.' Let us, then, endeavour to secure these desirable ends, and pass a piece of legislation which will set a good example to the States. tention to make a lengthy speech, or to traverse the ground which I covered when dealing with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bil l introduced last session. I , with other honourable with the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, and supplies the House with much food for thought. His speeches invariably give evidence of careful inquiry, and exhibit a degree of research that deserves our warmest commendation. .1 heartily concur with the opinion which the. honourable member has expressed on many details, of this Bill, and agree with him . that the machinery provisions are too involved to deal with the issues that are likely to be submitted to the decision of a Commonwealth Court of Arbitration. The honourable member has 2 L referred to the possibility of bringing about a system of barter or compromise between He could plead guilty and throw the parties to a dispute; but I do not consider that it would be successf u l in practice. Nothing has occurred since the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill was before us last session to make legislation of this kind more acceptable to those who on that occasion opposed it ; on the contrary^ those who then expressed themselves in favour of the principle must recognise that the establishment of the New South Wales Court has led to considerable irritation and much conflict of opinion between employers and employed. Some of the decisions of that Court have not been received with complete satisfaction by This principle, either side, and certainly, in one or two cases, they have not been satisfactory to the of which use might be workers. The experience of New Zealand is that legislation of this description must be amended from time to time. Year after year amending acts' have been passed by the Legislature of the Colony. experiments the sooner shall Ave reach perfection. thing which is altogether unnecessary. The Government manifestly expect that a very large amount of business for the Arbitration Court will be created by the Bill. This measure is being foisted upon the Commonwealth heedless of the fact that it will cause great irritation, and bring about industrial trouble in all the States. The Prime Minister has qualified his previous views as to the class of disputes which could be brought within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court. He has admitted, and I think it is now generally held, that a merely sympathetic dispute would not just if y Commonwealth interference. Before the Commonwealth Court can take action, members, have listened a dispute must occur in one State, and a pleasure to the remarks by dispute similar in all particulars occur in another State. It is manifest that under who always those circumstances there might be a serious, conflict between the decisions of States Courts and the decisions of the Common-, wealth Court, and a serious interference with States rights and policy. But. the modification of the Prime Minister makes an elaborate measure unnecessary. Every honourable member who heard it-whether ' he does or does not' agree with the views expressed-mus t admit that the Prime Minister gave us a most eloquent address when moving the second reading.

I am sure that honourable members must have been gratified to hear the Prime Minister say that so far as the Government were concernedeverything would be done straightforwardly. If a coalition is to be brought about I hope that it will assume the character of a straight-out combination of the forces on both sides of the House, and that everything will be done in the full light of day. Such a coalition would be very desirable, and might very easily be effected. The electors are entitled to call upon us to determine the question as to who is to control the Legislature of the Commonwealth. If the Labour Party are to carry through legislation of the character now before us, just as they may desire, by all means let them occupy the Treasury benches, and the sooner the better. The country wishes to know what our intentions are, and, therefore, I feel that I shall best conserve the interests of the community oy refraining from protracting this debate. I think that honourable members in all parts of the House must regret extremely the absence of that great and strenuous politician who has so prominently identified himself with measures of this nature for some years, past. should all welcome his aid and his guidance in this matter. the chief plank in the platform of the Government at the last election, and was alsi included in their programme at the previous election. The country has pronounced with no uncertain sound its verdict in favour ol the B ill ; and that party which has been most strongly identified with the advocacy of conciliation and arbitration has been re turned with increased strength. of this, however, some honourable members persist in treating the proposal for concilialegislation of this character. Stress has been tion and arbitration as if it were a foulminded ogre, which was seeking to devoui our industries and injure our people: Yet our experience in Australia shows that wherever the Arbitration Court is, there is peace-mor e peace at all events than there was before. The principle of' compulsory arbitration has been accepted Oil the understanding that almost any peace is better than war. Those who oppose the Bill seem to lack memory or imagination, 2 L 2 and to be unable to realize the facts disclosed by the telegrams which reach us almost daily, relating to industrial struggles in the great countries of the world, which are causing pain to the workers, and terrible loss to the employers, which are devastating homes and inflicting injury upon the communities in which they occur. At the same time, I quite recognise that a measure of this kind should be closely criticised, because we are sailing in an unknown, or at least an uncharted sea. We do not know where the sunken rocks are, and we have nothing to guide us in avoiding the dangers which beset our course. The Arbitration Court, which it is proposed to erect, will be of an exceptional character. It will not have to interpret and apply definite and express laws, but will practically have to direct and conduct living industries. Difficult as is the work of the Courts under ordinary circumstances in interpreting and applying the law, I say without hesitation that the difficulty of conducting industries is far and away greater. I do not intend to inflict a long second-reading speech upon the House; but I feel that this Bill forms part of a system of legislation based upon the feeling that if human life is to be used for the purpose of profit it must not be used to its degradation; that after all it is our duty, as far as we can, in view of the fact that human life is the most valuable asset of any country, to see that that life, if used for the purposes of gain, is not so employed that the health and vitality of the community are lowered. This is one This measure constituted of the measures designed to take the weight off the delicate fibre of. human life and impose the stress upon inventions and appliances-to put weight upon dead and lifeless matter, and to as far as possible protect the vitality of the people. It is satisfactory to the supporters of the measure to be able to challenge its bitterest opponents to point to any In spite authentic instance of injury having been done to any industry in these States by any laid upon the fact that in America and the United Kingdom the working classes have deprecated the adoption of compulsory arbitration. The votes of the unionists have undoubtedly been given against compulsory arbitration in the past; but so far as I have been able to gather a great revulsion of feeling is taking place in America and England in regard to this matter. The reason is clear to my mind. This change in the attitude of the workers is not' the",50,Thomson Therefore Said The Prime Minister Has Honor
196,Mr Higgins (Northern Melbourne),,51,Honourable Members Hear Hear
197,Mr Higgins,"I feel sure that weresult merely of what is known as the Taff Vale case, but is the outcome of a still more extraordinary series of decisions by the forebeen made between organization and organimost Judges of England-and presumably also of America-whic h has, in effect, deprived the unions of the right to strike or to organize for the purpose of striking. It has been decided that it is an actionable offence, and perhaps a crime, for a number of men to unite in abstaining from accepting employment themselves, or in persuading others to do so, with a view to enforce thoir demands for higher wages or for better conditions of employment. The result has been that the weapon of strike, upon which the unions so long relied for protection, has been taken from them. They cannot be regarded as acting legally in these matters if the decisions of the Courts hold good. In the Taff Vale case it was decided that the funds of the unions may be applied to the payment of any penalties imposed for offences committed by the unionists as such. have gone still further, and have decided that the furniture of the individual members of the unions can be levied upon. the general framework is good, but in many respects the details have not been sufficiently examined. Perhaps, therefore, I may be pardoned if I refer to some of the clauses, with a view to stimulate a little inquiry before we reach the Committee stage. There are two clauses which, I understand, have been introduced to deal with a difficulty to which I referred in the last Parliamenta difficulty which' was-not met by the previous Bill. The position then was that a station owner might have a number of shearers camped around him who refused to accept employment, save upon their own terms. If an arrangement be arrived at between the union to which they belong and the station holder, I think that, in all fairis a wise provision. I suggest, with very ness, they should be compelled to accept employment, if ordered to do so, under the terms of the agreement. I am glad that an effort has been made to meet such a contingency. In clause 7, I think that the word ""industrial"" should be inserted before the word ""agreement."" I make this suggestion in consequence of a conversation which I have had with the honourable member for Darling. the insertion of that word, clause 7 may render a union liable for a breach by an individual member of his own private agreement. To my mind it should be liable to punishment only if the member commits a breach of the industral agreement which has zation. Clause8 I regard as a very dangerous one. Of course the Bill is intended to exclude railway servants and other public servants from the Arbitration Court. The effect of this clause, however, is to afford them no protection whatever. In the event of a dispute arising they have not the protection of the Arbitration Court. If we do not afford them the protection of that Court, we have no right .to do what is done by clause 8-tak e away from them the only weapon which they have, namely, the power to strike. The effect of the provision is that if a dispute occurred, such as that which unhappily took place last year between the Railway Engine Drivers' Association, and the Government of Victoria, the association would be denied access to the Arbitration Court, and at the same time any committee which encouraged its members not to work would be guilty of an offence. Surely we must be consistent in this matter. If ' we do not intend to make the Bill apply to railway servants, by all means let us leave them in the position which they at present occupy, whether' it be better or worse. I am very glad that the Government have, in clause 11, adopted the principle of making the same Court a tribunal of conciliation and arbitration. I feel convinced that in New Zealand the severance of these Courts has been a great mistake, and I am sure that, upon the principle that a horse will always run better if it is aware that its rider holds a whip in his hand, we shall get far more conciliation than arbitration if the tribunal which conciliates can also arbitrate. I understand it is intended that no decision by the Court shall be valid unless three members adjudicate. I do not think that great deference, that it might be well in cases where conciliation is at all possible, if the two members of the Court who represent the employers upon the one side, and the employees upon the other, were -invested with power to hold a preliminary meeting, to ascertain whether, from their knowledge of the wants of both sides, they can conciliate, and also adjudicate, calling Without in the President only as occasion might require. I do not think that the appointment of a Justice of the High Court as President of the Arbitration Court is necessarily a wise proceeding. Indeed, I",51,Honourable Members Hear Hear
198,Mr Mauger,The American Courts,52,Honourable Members Hear Hear
199,Mr Higgins,"As to the Bill itself,entertain very grave doubts about it. I say nothing whatever in respect of lawyers as a class, but I hold that the very qualifications which would make a Justice of the High Court a good Judge are those which are least in demand in a Court of Arbitration. . In the High Court he is bound by rules of evidence. He has to follow definite principles, and to act upon rigid laws. His course of life and practice are such as to disqualify him for entering sympathetically into a dispute between employers and employees. I sympathize very strongly with the observations which were recently made by Mr Justice McMillan in Perth when he stated that he had been learning rules of evidence all his life, and had now been appointed President of a Court in which he was called upon to disregard those rules. A very difficult question which we have to face is whether the other two members of the Court should be appointed for a term of seven years, or only in connection with each dispute. At first I was inclined to think that a special expert was necessary for particular disputes. Upon reflection, however, I doubt very much whether that proposal would work out well. My reason is that if a trade dispute arises, and we appoint to the Bench men representing both the employers and the employees in the particular industry affected, they will attend the adjudication as heated partisans. Their minds will be imbued with the feelings of the employers on the one side, and of the employees on the other. cates and less arbitrators. now. degree. patent examiners, a man who is skilled only in mechanical engineering is sometimes called upon to deal with soft-goods cases; but, with a very little experience, by bestowing attention upon the particular question under his ken for the time being, he becomes sufficiently expert to arrive at a decision. I have found that the best patent examiners are very often those who know the least about a particular industry and the men engaged in it. However, I am not bigoted upon this matter, and I mention it merely to show the present state of my own mind. I do not quite see how clause i g will work out. If we pay a permanent man jQyoo a year I cannot see how we are to remunerate a temporary expert at the same rate. I presume that we should have to pay him for piece-work, seeing that he is called in only for a special term. ThenI f a i l to .realize why, under clause 24, the President of the Court only should be charged with the duty of endeavouring to reconcile industrial differences. To my mind the representatives of employers and employees, if they are good men, are very often able to reconcile these differences much better than any President would be. if the members were chosen only for each dispute. the scheme of the Government is carried out. I would ask. the Prime Ministeri f clause 27 is valid under the Constitution? Of course our powers are limited to industrial disputes which extend beyond any one State. If a dispute occurs in New South Wales, I cannot see how the State industrial authority can delegate its powers to the Federal Court. 1 tended to meet disputes which may arise in one State, and then overflow. Suppose that an industrial trouble occurred in New South Wales, that the State industrial authority commenced to, investigate, it, and that it then overflowed to another State.

Before a case can be brought before the Court it will be necessary to obtain a certificate from the Registrar, or the approval of the President. under the New South Wales Act to obtain the certificate of the Registrar. that is so. Then it is provided that no industrial dispute shall be submittedto the Court by an organization unless the Registrar gives a certificate setting forth the consent of the organization, according to its rules, to the institution of proceedings. It will be necessary to show that the organization has given its consent at a general meeting, convened in a certain way. consent has been given in writing, under the hands of the majority of the committee of management. clause 36 is rather ambiguous; I do not know whether it is meant to provide that an award which is found to operate unjustly shall nevertheless be binding for all time. The clause provides that-the award shall continue in force "" until a new award has been made,"" and if we turn to section 47 we find that an organization may apply to have an award varied. gives.the Court power at any time to vary an award. circumstances, application cannot be made ""to the Court to vary an award. power to strike is to be absolutely taken away not merely conditionally upon an 'organization being brought under 'measure-it is difficult to see how a dispute can arise, and if no dispute can arise, bow will it be possible to obtain a variat tion of. an award? to have an award varied without the occur'ence of a dispute.

Some kind of It appears to me that limitation should be imposed. It is, to my mind, remarkable that it is the workers who, as a class, are most anxious to secure the passage of this Bill.

I cannot help recognising that, c f the three members of theBench, there will be two at least with bourgeois tendencies, with sympathy for the wage-paying, classes, as distinguished from the wage-earning classes, and it is a sign of the intense desire of the wage-earners of Australia, for peace, order, and good goI f the vernment at all hazards, that they are so anxious, in spite of these risks, to submit to a Court of this kind.

It seems to me from the wording of that clause that the Court cannot prescribe a minimum wage without prescribing an exception in the case of old and infirm workers. cases in which the Court 'should be able to make that exception, but it is a very dangerous power. The clause should be amended so as to make it clear that there shall be power to make an exception in respect to 'aged and infirm workers, and that the Court shall not be prevented from prescribing the minimum wage which may be applied, unless the exception be made.

If the funds of the organization are insufficient to satisfy a process proceedings may be taken against an individual member; but is it necessary that the funds of the organization must first be attached, or must it be proved that, even if the funds were attached, they would be insufficient? It may be considered that I am somewhat hypercritical in dealing with the Bill in this way on the motion for the second reading; but I have found that a discussion of the details at this stage invariably assists the progress of business in Committee. There is another question which has attracted a good deal of attention. I refer to the proposal to include the railway servants of the States, and, indeed, public servants generally within the provisions of the Bill. I may be doing the Prime Minister an injustice, but I understand that he has changed his opinion upon this question-that the first Bil l introduced by the Government was such as would have included the public servants of the States. mitted to Cabinet might have tacitly included them.

"" employer"" means any employer in ""any industry,"" and ""employ^"" any employee^ in any "" industry."" The only modification is the definition of an industrial dispute, which is not to be taken to include a dispute in which the servants of the Commonwealth or of a State are concerned. I have read the speech of the Prime Minister with great care. Whatever we may think of the conclusions which he has reached, I am surethat we all wish him well, and have to thank him for the frank and friendly way in which he has expounded this and other Bills which he has brought before the House. He has the goodwill of all in this Parliament, and I think of all who know him. But, in my opinion, It is a he has. come to his conclusion regarding the railway servants of the States upon insufficient reasons. Our power of legislation is confined to ""disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State,"" and, furthermore, we are confined to ""industrial disputes."" Therefore we cannot, by a mere stroke of the pen, include all public servants in the operation of the Bill. I take it that the railway officials are engaged in an industry-that of carrying passengers and goods by r a i l ; and that, similarly, the postal officials are engaged in an industry. But however industrious the officers in the Treasury or someother departments maybe, it can hardly be held that they are engaged in an industry. It is one thing to be industrious, and another to be engaged in an industry. they come under the definition of industry contained in the Bill? pand the meaning of the term used in the Constitution.. I take it that while the word ""industry,"" as used in the Constitution, applies to the railway service and to the postal service, it does not apply to many of the public departments. I am not going into to the postal service? A Government B ill never used to be a private industry; now it is a public monopoly. industry in Australia?

A quarrel between the railway servants and the Commissioner would be a more serious thing than a quarrel between a private employer and his employees, not only because of its indirect operation, but because of the fact that the railway employees have no choice of an employer. After the Victorian railway strike, expert engine-drivers were driven out of the service, and they have since been unable to find employment at the work which they weie accustomed to perform.

The mere fact of that ground, that we have not the power, being put before us, makes it expedient to test the question, whether we have it or not. It will be found practically impossible in future Parliaments to exercise the power if we fail to assert it now. If it were decided by the Court that <we had not the power, the matter would be settled once and for all. With regard to the construction of the Constitution, I respectfully differ from the Prime Minister. In his speech, as reported in Hansard, at page 786, the Prime Minister said* All those sections to which I have referred show that the same conception is running through the Constitution from first to last, and that the State is only bound when the State is expressly named. Of course the conclusion he draws from thai on Nor is that, inasmuch as the State is not expressly named in the Constitution where conFull power is conferred to impose general ciliation and arbitration are referred to, taxation, and, according to the Prime Ministhe State cannot be bound by any ter's view, that power would not apply to legislation upon the subject of conciliaStates; property.

The whole matter is left open. So a matter determining the rights inter se befar as I can find, however, in all cases in tween the States and the Commonwealth -which it is intended to exclude the States, or under section 74? to exclude States industries from the operation of the Constitution, express provision-is that it is a question that might be referred to made to that effect.

291,Mr Higgins,"No. My impression isadopted in America with regard to taxing Federal incomes by the State, or State incomes by the Federal power, has to do with the interpretation of our Constitution so far as it relates to our power of legislation in regard to conciliation and arbitration. Concerning American decisions, I have long held the opinion that they represent what the Judges thought the Constitution ought to contain, rather than what it does contain. However, I do not think those cases have anything to do with this matter. The only judgments which have been given by Australian courts are to the effect that these American decisions do not apply here. Similarly, the only judgment given by the Privy Council is one which tends to show that they do not apply even in Canada. The Prime Minister, as will be seen by reference to page 781 of Hansard of the present session, further statedI may point out, to give a clue to the argument which I intend to follow, that if the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill embraced public servants, a decision of , the Court might have the effect of raising their wages. That would increase the taxation of the State in which they were employed. It would impose a new obligation upon the States which does not now exist. Or the Court might lower their wages; in that case the men would not receive the amount of money which the Parliament of the State had voted for them. Increase the taxation which the State would require to impose ! Increase the Estimates and the Appropriation made by Parliament! Interfere with the Estimates and with the Appropriation! Why, every additional post-office that is erected, every increase that is made in the Defence Forces of the Commonwealth, every extra supply of ammunition that is purchased, every adverse judgment which is given against the Crown, involves an alteration of the Estimates, and necessitates the submission of supplementary estimates. The thing is done every year in the different States. If an action is brought against the Crown for breach of contract, and a decision is given against it, no execution is levied on the King; there is no enforcement of the judgment upon his drawing-room furniture, and no seizing of the assets in the Treasury buildings. We are a people who pay our debts. When a judgment is entered against a Government they make provision for its payment, and there has never yet been a case in which they refused to do so. Sir Queensland. there was never one in Western Australia. Suppose that a penalty were imposed upon the Railway Commissioners, under which an extra ,£1,000 required to be paid. The Government would submit supplementary estimates and ask Parliament to vote that amount. It is a disagreeable course to adopt, but it is one which is followed every day. I would also point out that in framing the Constitution there' was no intention on the part of the Federal Convention to exempt the railway estimates of the States from interference. Why, the Constitution itself gives us power to interfere even with railway rates. There is nothing that will so materially affect the railway estimates as the provision in the Constitution having reference to preferential rates. That will make a tremendous difference to the lines adjoining New South Wales and Victoria. It will mean a great loss of revenue in some cases, and a great increase of revenue in others. The States must submit to having their finances interfered with. that instance. tire Constitution there is no evidence of any intention to keep the railways sacred from the desecrating touch of the Commonwealth Parliament. deprive the States of the whole of their three-fourths share of the Customs receipts ? point yet. If , however, an impasse actually occurred between a State Government and the Federal Courts, I have no doubt that we could introduce a Bill to allow the Commonwealth Government to deduct from the balance of the Customs revenue payable to that State the amount of any judgment given against it. any judgment given against them simply because they have submitted to the action being entertained? can be brought against the Crown unless it is permitted by Act or otherwise.

We are asked to refuse to extend the operation of this B ill to the public servants of the States upon the ground that we do not possess the constitutional power to take such action. With me that consideration overweighs any question of expediency. If we believe that we have the necessary constitutional power, by all means let us exert it . only time for us to exercise it.

I have been informed by the proprietor of a newspaper in Western Australia that last week a press telegram occupied something over four hours in transmission. No doubt when there is a rush of business, as there has been in times past, allowance must be made for delays, no matter how aggravating they may be; but under normal conditions every effort should be used to expedite messages,. and particularly press telegrams, a delay in the transmission of which means annoyance and loss. I am sure that the Prime Minister will have the necessary inquiries made, and try to avoid repetition of the cause of complaint. Mr O'MALLEY (Darwin) -In.vie w of the tremendous expense to which a member is now put in defending his seat when another man wants it, and to prevent honourable members from being driven into the Bankruptcy Court, will the Prime Minister bring in a Bill to amend the Electoral Act, so as to provide for the trying of election petitions by a Committee of the House? attention to a question, of postal administration. In calling for tenders for supplies for the Post and Telegraph Department it has been made a condition, I believe, that white labour only shall be employed, with the result that in South Australia the cost has been more than doubled. There supplies, and it is difficult to obtain the services of reliable white men for anything like what it costs to employ Afghans. Under what provision of the Postal Act is the Postmaster-General required to make this stipulation, or is it simply a happy thought of his own? r External Affairs) I shall cause inquiry to be made as to the reason of the delay complained of by the honourable member for Fremantle. I cannot promise the honourable member for Darwin the pleasure of appearing before a committee of his fellow members for the trial of an election petition, because the experience of this State has shown that no more expensive tribunal was ever devised for that purpose. A leading barrister of this city, who was a spectator at a recent trial in the High Court, assured me that an ordinary court would have been occupied for three weeks in dealing with a matter which engaged the High Court only three days. myself.
