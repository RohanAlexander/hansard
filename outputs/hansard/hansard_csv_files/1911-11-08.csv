Certain restrictions, including veterinary examination, are imposed by these countries on the importation of horses from India. The Australian Quarantine Regulations provide that any horse imported into Australia from the United Kingdom must be accompanied by(1) A declaration from the owner certifying(o) that the animal has been free from disease during tlie six months nextpreceding shipment; (6) that it has' not ' been in contact with any animal suffering from disease during the six months next preceding shipment; ic) that it has not, otherwise than as required under (2) been tested with mallein during the thirty days next preceding shipment.

72,Mr Kelly,"It is certainly the bestwith a view of the future, and the best way would be to pass the item. We should have the satisfaction of knowing that, _ so far as we can arrange it, the Australian naval unit is being given a good launch by the establishment of a place where the omcers may be efficiently trained. must be admitted that Commonwealth industries and institutions of this kind ought to be located within Federal Territory; and I am unable to understand why the Government, without submitting reports to the House, should have selected a site near Sydney. As honourable members know, I have no bias against Sydney, Melbourne, or any other State capital. The fact that Sydney is obtaining some advantage ought not to cause any concern. The only question to be considered is whether it is the most suitable place. United States for a precedent, we see that the West Point College, though in the State of New York, is situated very far from the capital of the State. Honourable members ought to have had the benefit of the reports of the experts who recommended this site to the Government. The appearance of the Estimates is the first intimation we have had of the project; and it is doubtful whether the House is in a position to give a vote on the matter at this stage. It may be well to remind honourable members that this is not the first occasion on which governments have departed from the healthy principle of establishing all such institutions on Federal territory. Small Arms Factory was established at Lithgow there was scarcely a word of protest, although that was an instance in which we ought to have insisted on its location being on Commonwealth territory. a cordite factory has been established at Maribyrnong. this Government are taking no new departure; but, seeing that the Capital site has now been definitely selected, which was not the case when these other works were established, we ought to be given reasons for pursue is to erect only temporary buildings for the choice of a site for this College. It stands to reason that all such buildings placed on the Federal Territory add to the value of the land there. We get the increment of value; whereas, by establishing the College close to Svdnev, we are assisting to enlarge a city that is already too big-a n observation which applies to Melbourne and all the other Australian capitals.. I trust the Government will afford us more information, and to that end this vote could easily be postponed, so that the reports of the expert officers may be laid on the table. It is not often that I find myself in disagreement with the honourable member for Wentworth, but so far as the item under discussion is concerned nry views are entirely at variance with those expressed by him. The Minister must be convinced that the feeling of the Committee is that great national institutions of this character ought to be established in national territory. We should follow the example of other countries. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has pointed out that the young naval officers of the United States are trained a long way from If we look to the any large centre of population, whilst England's great naval training college is at Dartmouth, in Devonshire. population. the main arguments in support of the establishment of the Naval College at Port Hacking was, I understand, that such an establishment could be conducted far more cheaply in the vicinity of Sydney than at Jervis Bay. Such a contention, however, cannot Be seriously put forward. States Naval College is at Annapolis, Maryland-the capital of the State. which has set an example to the world, has its great Naval College a long way from the metropolis. I am satisfied that in any event after the lapse of a few years the Naval College will be established Then, close to Melbourne, in Federal territory; people will not consent to the naval cadets' of Australia being As I have said, trained outside the national territory. The expenditure of a large sum in erecting a Naval College at or near Sydney will prove within a few years' time to have been a waste of money. The proper course to until the territory in the vicinity of Jervis Bay is in a more advanced state of development. The erection of temporary buildings in the meantime would meet the situation, and eventually the College could be erected where it ought to be-in Federal territory on Jervis Bay. can assure the honourable member for Wentworth that I cannot recollect having ever",17,Estimates Additions New Works And Buildings

If we establish the Naval College at Port Hacking it will become another show place, and visitors to Sydney will say, "" Let us drive out to the College where the naval cadets are trained.""

Treating the subject from the financial stand-point, I ask honourable members whether twenty years hence, when Sydney has a population of 2,000,000, land within 17 miles of it will not be much more valuable than it is now. is to cost about £75,000, and the land that we buy by the foot will tie saleable by the square inch twenty years hence. [3.20] -On e is dumbfounded by the Minister's earth hunger. He seems desirous of buying up Australia. When it was proposed to resume a certain area in New South Wales for the Federal Territory, there was an enormous outcry, but the Minister, in addition to the territory already acquired, is buying large areas in the State. He evidently wishes future generations to recognise his prescience regarding land values. Our object, however, should be, not to acquire land to be sold later at a profit, but to make the best use of the territory ceded to us. The areas outside the Territory held by the Commonwealth will become legion if we proceed as at present. I should have thought that this before all Governments would have been in favour of placing all Commonwealth buildings within the Federal Territory whenever that was possible. member put the Maribyrnong Cordite Factory there? honourable gentleman's military studies should have informed him that temperature and climate are primary considerations in the location of a cordite factory, and the climate of New South Wales would not be suitable at all times of the year.

The Minister has not told us what he proposes to pay for the land, but he has endeavoured to inflame our cupidity by telling us that it will fetch an enormous sum at some future date. We do not want to re-sell this site. sell it. ter has told us that what we buy by the acre we shall be able to sell by the inch. I hope that there will be no re-sale. The College should be built at the most suitable place, and remain there. I agree With those who say that it should be established as soon as possible, and that could be done without waiting for the erection of costly buildings, by permitting the students to attend lectures at the Sydney University pending the getting ready of the College at Jervis Bay. To place the College and other Commonwealth buildings in Federal territory will foster the national sentiment. I hope that the Government, for the sake of economy and for what the Prime Minister calls general -utility, will adopt my suggestion, and, omitpolitical controla result whicli I should ting the item under discussion, will provide a smaller siim out of the ordinary Defence vote. If the present attitude of Ministers -is continued, many honourable members will support the motion of the honourable member for Moreton, because they cannot conscientiously agree to placing extra-murally, so to speak, of the Federal Capital area, these institutions, one and all of which should be placed within it, and be maintained there under proper supervision. I am not going to add to what has already been said with regard to the disturbing influences of a large and pleasure-seeking population, except that we do not want to place our young men who are going to do this very important work near distractions such as a large city undoubtedly affords. sures? Would the honourable member put them away in the bush ? able member seems to have a peculiar idea of what pleasure is. Some find pleasure in a crowd, others take much more pleasure in solitude. I would suggest to the honourable member that he might try the latter. It would be not only conducive to his own well-being, but would be a relief to a very large number of other honourable members in this Chamber. to support the protest against putting the Naval College near Sydney. I do so mainly upon general principles, because where other things are equal-and I think they are fairly equal in this case-al l our big Federal institutions should be placed on Federal territory. I am given to understand that the official reports favour Jervis Bav as much as they favour the site now under consideration. We are therefore safe as regards efficiency, convenience, and suitability in putting the College in our own area. I fully endorse the arguments which have been used against the selection of a site near Sydney. I object to putting the cadets under the pernicious influences of a big city, as would be the case if they were taken to Sydney. The Minister's remark with regard to a profitable deal in land goes by the board, as it is not the Government's function to become landjobbers. Another consideration which appeals to me strongly is that it would be a very good thing for our defence system, and particularly the educative institutions connected with it, to be in touch with Parliament and politicians, not because I think that that will bring the military under deprecate-bu t because it will lead to a better understanding between politicians and the Defence Forces. This may in future years help us to avoid those disasters which have befallen other nations when political influence in military and naval matters has become too strong. The plan I suggest would lead to politicians gaining a better understanding of the true relations between the army and the State. I have heard that there is a condition attached to the giving of the money from the Dreadnought fund to the Government, to. the effect that if the money is accepted the institution must be placed near Sydney. If so, I should not allow that consideration to influence me at all. It would be much better to forego the donation entirely, and maintain all our institutions in the place where they ought to be. Like other honourable members who have spoken on this side, I am opposed to erecting any Federal buildings of this character outside of Federal territory. The Minister has given us no definite statement as to whether the authorities who selected the site now under consideration have also visited the Federal Capital and Jervis Bay.

He should state whether they made a second choice, if any, and whether they visited and took into consideration the places I have named. Up to the present moment, as that information has not been given, I feel inclined to. support the motion, in order that we may have the College erected in the Federal City, and, if possible, every building for Federal purposes, should also be built there. discussion has wandered somewhat from its original purpose. It concerned originally the best site at which to establish the Naval College, but the proposition now being debated is how best to develop Federal territory. If honourable members wish to use the naval and military defence votes for the purpose of developing Federal Territory, well and good; let them wipe out this site and start at Jervis Bay. That would be perfectly logical and legitimate from the point of view of the development of Federal territory. But I take it that our purpose now is to consider how best we can start the Australian naval unit of the Imperial Fleet. If the Committee take the College to Federal Territory, they will undoubtedly put off its initiation for a few years, which will be a bad thing for the Australian people. delay ? ber knew Jervis Bay, he would know that it would be necessary to build a vast number of roads before anything could be done there. According to the Minister's report, the officers of the Home Affairs Department found that all the roads in the Federal Capital area had been "" let down,"" and that it was necessary to spend about £14,500 in putting them into a decent state. If we intended to establish the College at Jervis Bay, it would be necessary to start first of all to build roads there, and then, when the Naval College was established, we should have to begin the construction of a railway line from Nowra. At present the line stops short at Nowra on the northern side of the Shoalhaven River, and we should have to build a 20mile railway to connect with Jervis Bay. put a railway there. accepted by this Parliament, which must consider it afterwards upon its merits. Parliament should not be tricked into endorsing it at this stage, by taking an advance vote on this question now. The whole question of whether or not we shall have railway communication between Jervis Bay and Sydney, and between Jervis Bay and the Federal Capital, will have to be discussed on its own merits when the proper time comes. I venture to predict that this Housewill be very loth to construct the line between Jervis Bay and the Federal Capital,, in view of the fact that no advantage will be conferred on the Federal area thereby. It would be of great advantage to the State of New South Walesi f that line were constructed with Federal money, and, from a narrow point of view, I should be very happy to see it done; but I. think the chief anxiety of this Parliament, after starting; seriously to work to construct the Federal Capital itself, will be to limit, as far as possible, the total cost of the Federal Capital as a complete proposition. Railway construction will add to that cost, and this House, which represents the taxpayers of Australia as a whole, will, I am sure,, be very sorry to sanction the useless or avoidable expenditure of money on making; roads and railway lines that need not be constructed from a Federal point of view. That position will have to be considered later on; but why prejudge the matter now by deciding to establish the College at Jervis Bay, when the cost of roads, communications, and connexions will be mucb greater than the whole proposition put before the Committee in these Estimates? roads ?

However, as a New South Welshman, I shall be very glad to see that port developed. that port was one of the factors that induced a number of honourable members to vote for Yass-Canberra. had nothing whatever to do with the decision as between the Yass-Canberra and the Dalgety sites, because there was a port at each place. Undoubtedly Jervis Bay as a port is better than Twofold Bay, and that consideration might have weighed with honourable members. I ask honourable members, however, to consider that matter on its own merits. The question now before us is a naval one. If it was a question of how best to develop the Federal area, how -could the honourable member for Laanecoorie possibly advocate the construction of a cordite factory in Melbourne, while advocating the taking away of a work which has been given to Sydney from Sydney to Federal Territory at Jervis Bay? The thing is too transparent. We see this provincial bitterness, which all of us, I think, the influence I have mentioned in politicsTegret, springing up in the most unlikely -quarters. Even the honourable member for Laanecoorie, who knows and likes Sydney, is influenced by it to the extent of wanting to take this institution from even the neighthing to have everything centred in the bourhood of Sydney and to place it in the Federal area, not because he really cares about the development of the Federal area, but because he wants to see as much as possible done to prevent the Northern capiing climate of New South Wales is a dantal of Australia from getting anything in the way of the spending of public funds. I do not know that this proposition will benethe vigour of their constitution. The idea fit Sydney. I do not think it matters a brass button to Sydney whether the Naval College is placed at Jervis Bay or not. From the New South Wales point of view, if it is placed at Jervis Bay, the State will establishing this College there, is only a be benefited more than if it is placed at Sydney, because it will undoubtedly mean taking the first step towards the construction of a line from Nowra to Jervis Bay, and from Jervis Bay to the Federal Capital.

I do not know that he does. I hope that he does not, but undoubtedly we do see signs of a desire to secure the spending of public money in this State, and to prevent it being spent in other States. Such a tendency is most lamentable. The honourable member for Batman should ruminate over the fact that the honourable member for Laanecoorie says it is absolutely essential that the Cordite Factory should be built in or near Melbourne, because, if you please, the climate of Melbourne is the only climate in Australia in which it is safe to manufacture cordite 1 honourable member believe that ? orable member.

They are always most hospitable and generous in their treatment of those from other States, but we do find an influence which is really initiated by the selfish interests of a section of the Melbourne press. That is what we are suffering from in this debate. If it is a good Federal area, what an absurdity it is to talk about the climate of Melbourne requiring the cordite factory to be situated in Melbourne 1 It might as well be urged that the relaxgerous one in which to bring up young men to serve in the Navy, because it might sap is absurd, and we have heard enough to realize that this debate is based purely on provincial considerations.

However, the cost of construction at Port Hacking will be much less than at Jervis Bay, and the former is a much better situation from a naval point of view-a n opinion for which we have the authority of the advisers of the Government. It is not worth our while paying ,£40,000 for a second-class site; and in view of what we have heard from the Prime Minister, we should sink all our little provincialisms. If people desire to throw money at us let them do so by all means. To establish the College at Jervis Bay would be to commit ourselves to railway construction.

There are, however, exceptions to every rule; and the Prime Minister, supported by the authority of his expert advisers, has, I think, made out a good case for the Port Hacking site on the grounds of utility and economy. These, of course, are the two chief factors that should guide us in determining the matter. There seems to be some objection to the site owing to the proposed gift of money to the Commonwealth. Our first consideration, however, is whether this is the most suitable site; and, in this, we ought to be guided by those who have had experience in defence matters of the kind. am prepared to take all the money from commend this as the best site? . people who may care to devote it to this particular purpose, if people, sufficiently ter has assured us that this site was recompatriotic, are to be found willing to do so. mended on its merits.

Nothing could be done with a Naval College at Jervis Bay until wharfage accommodation had been provided in order to afford facilities for reaching the place; and we know at present that there are travelling facilities neither by land nor water, and no hope of any for years to come. Honourable members who imagine that this Parliament will be meeting on the Federal Territory in four or five years will be very much mistaken, for, I think, ten years is more like the lime that will be required for the necessary preparation.

I should say that quite two or three years longer would be required if we decided against Port Hacking in favour of the Territory. My opinion is that the Government are doing the right thing under the circumstances. We all desire to build in the Federal area as much as possible, in order to attract population, and give the Federal City a status; but we must remember that in the past honourable members have not made much fuss about expenditure on Commonwealth undertakings outside that Territory in Victoria, New South Wales, and elsewhere. to the site; and doubtless there is a patriotic feeling in favour of the establishment I ask the Committee to negative the amendment of",23,Maloney I Fear That The Always Too Generous

There is no desire to embarrass the Government in the slightest degree; but we hope that this debate will be taken as an indication that, not only the Naval College, but other Commonwealth buildings of the kind, shall be erected on Federal territory. The Commonwealth buildings are being scattered all over New South Wales and Victoria; and wherever one is established in one State, it seems necessary to give an equivalent in the other. The statement of the honourable member for Hunter that this has been recommended as the best site should not go unchallenged. If the honourable member will read the report, he will find that the site regarded as the best is in the vicinity of Hobart; so that, if the Government rely entirely on the recommendations of their naval advisers, the College will not be established at Port Hacking. The Military College has already been established on our own land, and I repeat the hope that the Government will take this debate as a strong indication that all such Commonwealth work should be carried on there. Amendment negatived. I should be glad if the Minister would explain the item "" Launch for trawler, £ 2 2 2 , "" and also give the Committee some information as to the benefit which the Commonwealth is deriving from the work of the trawler, upon which we have,spent something like £30,000. and Customs) [3.56] I shall deal with the general work of the trawler when we have before us the general Estimates covering the salaries of the Fisheries Department. voted for the purchase of a launch, and of that amount £ 1 7 8 was expended. Honourable members are now asked to revote the balance of £222. It was considered by the Director of Fisheries, and the captain of the trawler, that a launch was essential to enable the shallower waters, more especially around the islands, to be investigated. As honourable members are aware, the launch could be used where the trawler -could not possibly go. This proposal was first made some two years ago, and 'when I resumed office as Minister of Trade and Customs, I called for further reports on the subject. It was then arranged that the launch, if found not to be absolutely necessary to the work of the trawler, should be transferred to one of the other Departments. There is work for such a launchin the Naval Department, and even in connection with the Department of Trade and' Customs. If the trawler can carry on operations effectively without it, we shall devote this launch to other purposes. should like tbe Minister of Trade and Customs to explain where the proposed vote of £12,726 towards the cost of new quarantine buildings in New South Wales is to be expended. and Customs) [4.0] -The only quarantine buildings in New South Wales of which I know are those at North Head, and the animal quarantine station at Bradley's Head. The amount for which these Estimates provide is not sufficient to enable the whole of our quarantine stations to be placed in a proper state of repair. The States, anticipating that the quarantine services were to be transferred to the Commonwealth, did not keep the buildings thoroughly up-to-date, and, as a matter of fact, the quarantine station at Brisbane was done away with altogether, the buildings being converted into a leper station. On this year's Estimates, it was proposed by the Quarantine Department to provide for an expenditure of about £100,000 under this heading towards cost of construction and repair. The total cost would be about ,£250,000, but we decided that we should first of all ascertain exactly how we stood in relation to the matter. Believing it possible for us to learn something regarding the position of quarantine in other countries, and having regard also to the increasing size of steamers coming to our shores, which means increasing the accomLast year, a sum of £400 was modation. I took the matter to the Cabinet, and it was agreed that before we incurred so large an expenditure, we should inquire what other countries were doing.

This is one of the items that we watch very carefully; but as quarantine is in the nature of health insurance, it is most important that we should keep our quarantine buildings and grounds effective tor the purpose. I have not the details at hand, but I believe that the particular item under discussion is to provide for certain alterations which must be made to the buildings at North Head in order to make them habitable. notice that all the items under the heading of ""Quarantine"" are ""towards cost"" of new quarantine buildings.

Pending the receipt of the Director's report, we intend only to carry out works that are immediately necessary. [4.4] I should like to know whether it is proposed to establish an up-to-date quarantine station in North Queensland in the neighbourhood of Thursday Island? Thursday Island. day Island is the first port of call for vessels made. coming from, the east which are most likely to bring to Australia infectious diseases. It is, therefore, very necessary that we should have in the north of Queensland an up-to-date quarantine station, so that vessels arriving at the entrance to Australia from the east with cases of infectious diseases on board will not have the experience of the steam-ship Eastern, which was recently sent down to Sydney to be quarantined at tremendous cost to the owners, and also to shippers of cargo and passengers by that steamer. Will the Minister state where the sum of £1,200 towards the cost of new quarantine stations in Queensland is to be expended, and whether a new station will be erected with a view to provide for such a' contingency as I have mentioned? and Customs) [4.5] I believe that Port Darwin is the first port of call for vessels coming to Australia from the East, but if the establishment of a quarantine station, further south instead of in the tropics would meet the requirements, I think it would be preferable to the spending of a large sum in establishing a quarantine station in the neighbourhood of Thursday Island. If we cari make effective the quarantine station already in existence there we shall do so, but if , in addition,, a new quarantine station is necessary, I think that it should be erected in a more temperate latitude than that of Thursday Island. We expect to receive the report of the Director in February or March next, and unless this item be' passed, it will be impossible for us to acquire a site should a new site be necessary at Brisbane, or between Brisbane and Rockhampton. We desire to have this money available if the report of the Director is favorable to the construction of another quarantine station. In regard to the item of £500 towards the cost of a new quarantine station in Tasmania, I wish to ask the Minister what steps are being taken in the matter? Last year we had on the Estimates an item to provide for the purchase of a site at Triffitt's Point, but every one now recognises that the establishment of a quarantine station there would have been most undesirable. Land in the district is now being subdivided into building blocks. I think that tlie Department stayed itshand tial that something should be done. Several good sites are available, and the establishment of a station should be proceeded' with without further delay.

When the honourable member put a question to me a fortnight ago in regard to the matter I made inquiries from the Acting Chief Officer of Quarantine, and was told that the selection had been narrowed down to three sites. He expects to have & report from Dr. Purdey as to which is the best of these. The honourable member may rest assured that we are f u l l y alive to the necessity for a quarantine station at -Hobart. I agree with the honourable member for Lang that it is undesirable to overcarry either passengers or cargo where that -can be avoided, but we do not want to -expend large sums of money upon the upkeep of quarantine stations when it may ; be possible at slight inconvenience to avoid .anything of the kind. beginning of the year, I wrote to the Minister of Home Affairs about the Fleming.ton rifle range, on the Sydney side of the Nepean electorate, and was informed that a contract had been let for repairs to it, .and later I received a letter saying that ;the work was being expedited. Since then I have been told that the range has been resumed for railway purposes. suggested that further provision for rifle practice could be made in the neighbourhood, as there are about six clubs to be .accommodated. I thought that something -could be done for the extension of the -range at Ryde, but my suggestion was unfavorably received, as was also another -suggestion relating to the Parramatta range. 'been resumed by the New South Wales Railway Department, the Treasurer will have received money for it, and that money -might fairly be expended in purchasing a new site in the district. If further accommodation cannot be given at Parramatta or Ryde, a new site should be purchased. The departmental replies on the subject Jiave been very unsatisfactory, and I should like a definite answer from the Minister this afternoon. It is a hardship to members of the Granville, Clyde, and Technical College rifle clubs to have to pay fares to visit the Randwick range, freI understand that Dr. quently to find that the targets are in use by members of the regular Forces, they and the Randwick rifle club having the first call on the Randwick range. The members of the rifle clubs in the district to which I refer are beginning to think that the Government discourages rifle shooting. quite a number of items provision is made. I cannot say from for the construction of drill-halls, an expense which, no doubt, will grow, as in time every centre of population will demand a drill-hall. In view of the big expenditure which would be needed to meet these demands, I suggest that it would be better to do without drill-halls, and to disband the boys on wet nights, without counting it against them as a drill lost. I rose, however, to direct attention to a more important matter, namely, the need for providing facilities for drilling within reasonable distance of the places where the boys who have to be drilled live. I regret that the Department has been very slow to attend to a complaint which I made regarding the practice of requiring the lads from Morpeth, a fairly large town, with a considerable population surrounding it , to travel to East Maitland to be drilled, a distance of from 3 to 5 miles. I have protested against the arrangement on two occasions, but have not yet received a satisfactory reply. It is not fair to ask parents to pay the expense of railway fares in cases of this kind, and the boys cannot be expected to walk. Drills should be held close to where the boys live. The case to I have which I have referred should have been dealt with by this time; the Department ought not to need five or six weeks for its consideration.

No less than £6,500 is set down towards the cost of the Clothing Factory, which, I take it, is to supply uniforms for the Naval and Military Forces. There is also a Harness Factory to be established at Clifton Hill, which is near Melbourne. Are any Victorian members going to move for the excision of these items, and to insist on all these industries being carried on in Federal Territory?

At the same time, I cannot get £ 5 0 spent in my electorate, which represents half of Queensland. The honourable member could have the £50,000, and I should be quite satisfied with the odd £5,000, without complaining about roads. Did the honourable member expect the Commonwealth Government to carry the material for the Cordite Factory by flying machines, so as not to interfere with the roads?

Of course, I am glad that money is being expended in this particular direction, because it shows that the Minister of Defence means business. have been pressing on the Government, ever since I entered this Parliament, the necessity for manufacturing our own explosives; and, notwithstanding what I have said, I am gratified to see that a commencement is being made in this connection. no doubt desirable to establish our military works as early as possible, but that is not the attitude of some honourable members in connection with an equally important feature of our Defence Forces. When we were discussing our Naval College, we were told, 'Oh, the College is all right, but the location is all wrong "" ! Victorian members protested against the establishment of that College at Sydney, although the advisers of the Government had recommended the site; and the protest led to a definite promise by the Prime Minister that the question would come up for further consideration. I make no attack on the choice of Maribyrnong as a site for a cordite factory ; but I think that the Prime Minister should make a similar promise in regard to this and other works of the kind as he has just made in connection with the Naval College. This is not an ordinary vote like that for the extension of a post-office or the granting of telephonic or telegraphic facilities; it is for the establishment of a factory or factories for the service of the whole Australian people. If the development of the Federal Territory is so important that the Prime Minister was willing to withdraw from the Ministerial position, and assure the Committee that he would not proceed with the establishment of a military college near Sydney until we had had further opportunities of discussion, we are entitled to the same treatment in this and other cases. I am willing to vote the money, and to believe that Maribyrnong is the right place, and to further believe that Melbourne is the right place for harness and clothing factoriesI am not in a position to judgebut if, in the case of the Naval College, we are to decide offhand, not against the claims of Sydney-for none have been made, so far as I know-bu t against the recommendations of the official advisers of the Government, we ought to take the same course in regard to all these works. The honourable member for Maranoa is as keen as myself in the desire that the Cordite Factory should be pressed to a speedy completion; and I have no doubt that he recognises that the same argument applies to this factory and to the clothing and harI ness factories, as to a college for naval training. It is deplorable that we should have this provincialism in a Chamber of this kind; but the best way to stop it is to show that it does not pay. I confidently hope that the Government will give ns identically the same assurance as was given m the case of the Naval College.

I am not .concerned about the manufacture of harness or clothing, but I think we are making a great mistake in establishing a cordite factory in a suburb of a large city. In spite of what the honourable member for Fawkner says, the same principle applies to the cordite factory as to the Naval College. We are establishing one of the most important works that the Federation could establish in the manufacture of our own explosives. buildings for that purpose. MrM c WILLIAMS should be permanently established in the Federal territory. I thought we had made a great mistake in seeking to establish a Federal Capital at this stage of our history, but Parliament, in its wisdom, or In England they are otherwise; has so decided; and we have taken over a territory stretching to one of the .best harbors in Australia. Although we have all this land, we are purchasing For in a suburb like Maribyrnong, at an enormous price, land on which to establish a factory. It would be better for the Federation, and infinitely better for the workpeople, if the factory were erected where more room and better conditions could be provided than are possible in a closely settled suburb of a city like this, especially when, at a great cost, we are attempting to establish a city of our own. I hope that the Prime Minister, as in the case of the Naval College, will promise another opportunity for the discussion of the location of all these factories.

MrM c WILLIAMS It is a pity that ""the broad, national spirit,"" which is beginning to dawn on this Parliament, was not manifested last year; because I am afraid this is only one more of the very serious blunders we have made in starting. I hope that in the future all such works will be established on Federal territory, instead of our adding to the population and business of the two large cities, which already, unfortunately for Australia, contain much too great a percentage of the population. hope that this Cordite Factory is only a start, for I should like to see other explosive factories erected at different parts, of the Commonwealth, so that, in time of trouble, the permanent staff might be distributed.

I hope that the Minister is going to make some explanation in this regard. I am not asking for any more than he was prepared to concede to the broad Nationalis virtually ists of Melbourne. If the advice of the Government's expert advisers is to be subordinated to the views of narrow provincialists in this Chamber, let the principle apply all round. If provincial jealousy is to apply in respect of one item, let it apply in both cases, and when it is found that such a system will not pay, this will become in reality a National Parliament, and not the playground for provincial jealousies. ister, of Home Affairs) [5.6] -The sum of £29,000 is the total estimated cost of providing for the following:-Permanent Battery: Officers' quarters, stables (120 horses), forage store, barn, sick bays, pharmacy, forge, wheelwright and collarmakers' shops,"" water and sewerage, gun parks, mobilization store, company offices, guard room, men's barracks, non-commissioned officers' (married) quarters, earthworks, and lighting.

If the Government are prepared to provide on these Estimates £500 towaids the cost of constructing a road leading to the Cordite Factory at Maribyrnong, they should be prepared to extend the same principle to other States. I ask for an explanation from the Minister, as a very grave principle is involved. Tf these payments are to be made in one case, they should be made in all, and the equivalent of rates should be paid to the local governing authority wherever there are military or naval properties to which roads of access have to be made or maintained.

261,Mr Charlton,"The damage donerequired. I have never taken exception to a proposal on the ground that it would benefit any particular State, but Victorian representatives are so fond of asserting that no money should be spent in New South Wales except in the Federal Territory, that it is time that we pointed out the need for locating all Commonwealth works there, so far as that may be possible. The sum of £6,500 is put down for a clothing factory, which the Minister says will be temporary, but why spend money on a temporary establishment? It would be better to build a permanent establishment in the Federal Territory. I desire that the Federal Capital shall grow, and the only way to insure its growth is to bring as many persons as possible to live there. The honourable member for Maribyrnong gets no less than £29,627 for his electorate this year, including £500 for the road under discussion. Other honourable members should be similarly treated to prevent invidious comparisons. The electors will think that because they are far removed from the Seat of Government no notice is taken of their applications. principle supported by the honourable member for Hunter is one whose adoption I have advocated for some time past. The Commonwealth might very well agree, as an act of grace, to meet its obligations for municipal services, just as private persons have to do. If this is not done, logrolling is likely to take place. A shire council might allow its roads to fall into disrepair, to compel the Commonwealth to spend money on them. My suggestion is that the Commonwealth should pay a fair charge, but no more, for municipal services. There should be a uniform basis. The Minister has not made it clear whether this road is on Commonwealth territory or within the municipality. I know he says that it is "" access to' defence property,"" but the access itself might belong to the Commonwealth or to the municipality. If it belongs to the Braybrook Council, not a penny piece should be expended upon it until all claims of a similar kind have been equitably met. There are roads in the electorate of Nepean, in the electorate of East Sydney, and in my own electorate which are heavily used by the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth refuses to pay a penny in rates and taxes. We are not here to dole out public funds without responsibility, simply because one honourable member is a little cleverer behind the scenes than another. to do with it. for the district may have been cleverer behind the scenes than others. our own property unless we have this road. vote this money because the municipality has let its own property run down? Minister of Home Affairs that the £ 5 0 0 was for building a road which the Council would afterwards maintain. I presume, therefore, that it is the council's road. The claims of Nepean, East Sydney, Wentworth, and other electorates where roads may be proved to have been cut up, and in some cases almost destroyed, by Commonwealth use, will have to be taken into consideration if we are to spend money on this road. to be treated on their merits. ber for Nepean say whether he has succeeded in getting the claims of his constituency considered on their merits? The honourable member has not, nor has the honourable member for East Sydney, nor any other honourable member except the fortunate representative of this Melbourne constituency. Either all electorates should be put on an equal basis, everybody being treated alike, or we should not pass this item. The honourable member for Nepean is in a peculiar difficulty owing to the roads about Liverpool, and especially at Lithgow, being cut to pieces by Commonwealth usage, and the Minister's reply ought to be made to him. He is the most aggrieved. I do not suggest that he should move at this stage to reduce the amount, because the Minister might yet meet him and the Committee, whose general feeling is that the principle now introduced should apply all round or not at all. stand that the Lithgow Municipal Council made an offer to the Federal Government to form, and metal the road to the Small Arms Factory, and that the Government refused absolutely to have anything to do with it.

It was practically a private roadway, from one end of which there was no outlet, since it was cut off by the Saltwater River. private property. part of the Maribyrnong Estate; it was like a carriage-way running up to the old homestead. The State Government, however, having purchased land on the other side of. the Saltwater River, and having established a village settlement there, constructed a bridge across the stream, and offered to pay half the cost of making this road. The position now is that the Public Works Department of Victoria is contributing £500, whilst the Commonwealth is contributing a like amount for that purpose. open to public use?

The shire engineer will act in conjunction with the State and Commonwealth Government engineers, and they should be able to make the road to our satisfaction. Another point to be remembered is that the Commonwealth Government, by purchasing land on the other side of this road, have deprived the local council of a revenue of at least £ 6 0 per annum, since, as honourable members are aware, municipal rates cannot be levied on Commonwealth property. should re-imburse the shire to that extent. be prepared to assist honourable members in securing the construction of military roads in their electorates. Certain roads should be declared military thoroughfares. Portion of the road under consideration has been badly cut up by the carting of heavy loads of machinery and the materials used in the erection of tlie Cordite Factory. Failure to make the roadway now would involve the Government in still further expense. Heavy loss was sustained during the winter months since, in respect of certain parts of the roadway, big loads had to be conveyed through a veritable quagmire, which meant the employment of double teams. The Commonwealth Government have not gone off their own property. To all intents and purposes, the property still belongs to them; but they have deprived the shire of Bravbrook of certain rateable values, and it is only fair that this road should be constructed. As the result of this expenditure, the cost of cartage to the factory will be reduced. The Saltwater River skirts the Cordite Factory as well as the Military Horse Grounds, and access to those grounds will be obtained both by water-way and by road. Hence we have a proposed vote of £3,000, which is likely to be used for the construction, amongst other things, of a wharf. Together with members of the State Parliament, I played some little part in an effort to have the river made navigable, and that work is now being carried out at the expense of the State Government. It will be very useful to the Commonwealth Government. We are asked really to spend a very small amount to put the roadway in order. misunderstanding that has arisen has not been due to any fault of the Committee. We have had four distinct and mutually conflicting statements-the e from Ministers, and the other from the representative of the district-and I think that that made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong is really the first explicit statement we have had bearing on the situation. The principle still involved in this question could be settled immediately by the Prime Minister saying that he would take the whole question into his consideration, and would inform the House, on some future date, of the view taken by the Government regarding the desirableness of recompensing muni-",39,Carty Salmon Tha T Does Not Fence Property Towards Cost £500 Be Reduced

I do not think anything else need be said. As to the particular road under consideration, I think that the Minister will have to dedicate it to the public as soon as it is constructed. As a matter of common justice to the men who are being settled by the State Government upon land on the other side of the river, continuous and perpetual access to their property must be guaranteed them.

The road will be used for other purposes whether the branch line of railway is, or is not, constructed. think most of us are convinced that the Government have not given us full information in regard to this matter, and that to their failure must be attributed the trouble the Honorary Minister that he was misthat has arisen. know exactly what the facts are, but it is only reasonable that the Committee, when asked to pass certain proposed votes, should be afforded full information in regard to them.

Then, again, we have been told by the honourable member for Maribyrnong that the roadway is altogetherwithin Government property. pletely within our own property. way, when constructed, to be Commonwealth property, or are the public to have access over it? Notwithstanding the long discussion that has taken place, I am not yet satisfied as to the exact position. I do not think any one present knows the facts.

I do not know whether it is the experience of other honourable members, but my experience is that often after rifle clubs have been formed the members have to wait two years or more before they can fire a shot.

Yet no provision is made towards it, while an item of £13,608 is provided for a similar purpose in Queensland. The Minister has distinctly stated time after time that the Federal Government have no power to resume land in New South Wales for this very purpose. If so large a sum can be set apart to resume land for a manceuvre area in Queensland, the Minister's previous statements to me must be incorrect. The Liverpool manoeuvre area in New South Wales is tied up with the transferred properties, and I can get no satisfaction from either the State or the Federal Department. It is ""up to "" the Minister to do the straight thing to-night, and tell me exactly where the matter is hung up. The Government should say straight out what they intend to do. I am not against the manceuvre area being at Liverpool, because I think it is central for a large part of the population of New South Wales, but at present the owners of the private lands in the area are being squeezed between the Federal and the State Governments, and can get no satisfaction from either. This vote for Queensland proves that the letters I have received from the Department with regard to the Liverpool manceuvre area have been so much bluff.

What puzzles my constituents and myself is why that method of procedure should be followed in New South Wales, and not in Queensland. If the New South Wales Government will not resume the land; will the Minister state clearly what the Commonwealth Government intend to do? ister of Home Affairs) [7.52] -As Minister of Home Affairs, I am not in a position to state what the intention of the Government in that regard will be, because I simply carry out what the other Departments want done.

[7-57]--Division 6A relates to a proposal to pay into a Trust Fund on account of special works connected with telegraphs and telephones the sum of £600,000, and the Prime Minister has already promised that a special Bill will be introduced to deal with this matter. He intimated his intention to make a statement to the Committee, and I would like to know when he proposes to do so. I would remind him that when the honourable member for Darling Downs suggested that a footnote should be inserted setting out that this money is to be appropriated by a special Act the right honourable gentleman stated in reply that he had no objection to the adoption of that course. The honourable member for Darling Downs further asked -whether a special schedule would be provided, and the Prime Minister answered that he would think over the matter. Will the head of the Government inform the Committee of the position of affairs at the present time, and state whether he intends to bring in a special Bill to deal with this appropriation ? I do not think that the paying of so large a sum as £600,000 into a Trust Fund on account of special works connected with our telegraphs and telephones is a good precedent to establish. When the matter was previously discussed I took exception to the course which it is proposed to follow. Although it may be legal, I think that the paying of so large an amount into a Trust Fund to be expended on telegraphs and telephones just as the Treasurer chooses is stretching the Audit Act altogether too much. The only reason which I can see for the adoption of this course is a desire to get this money away from the control of Parliament so that the Government may do as they please with it. At the close of the financial year the ordinary votes will expire, but the proposed Trust Fund will be a continuing one. If it be a good thing to deal with £600,000 in this way, it is equally good to deal with other amounts in a similar way. For instance, the sum of £700,000 which we are asked to vote in connection with the extension of telephones and telegraphs might just as reasonably be paid into a Trust Fund. It is a travesty upon parliamentary government to place such a large sum as £600,000 to the credit of a Trust Fund for the purpose of special works on account of telegraphs and telephones. The same practice might just as well be adopted in respect of other items.

Sir JOHN FORREST the Treasurer to pay £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 into a Trust Fund for a special purpose, and to expend it as he chooses, it means that we shall take that amount away from the control of Parliament. The Government have no right to exercise a discretion as to what sum they will expend during the financial year. They have to ask Parliament for what they require, and they are in duty bound to expend the amount voted by Parliament unless good reason exists for their failure to do so. They cannot ask Parlialiament to vote money and afterwards spend it or not spend it, just as they may choose. It is proposed to vote a large sum of money which the Treasurer may or may not spend as he chooses. That was the old procedure under an autocratic form of Government, when Ministers could do as they liked ; but that has all passed away in the States, and there have to be Estimates setting out exactly what works are to be taken in hand.

These are the works which we thought absolutely necessary to bring the Postmaster General's Department up to a state of efficiency; and we ask Parliament to appropriate £600,000, leaving it to the engineers, and those who are capable of advising the Ministry, as to the best way to proceed, to recommend when the money should be expended, and generally to accomplish what we are aiming at. It is, I think, the only practical plan which can be recommended to Parliament. That is the position of the Government; and, in accordance with my promise, I have no hesitation in stating that we shall bring down a Bill, framed on the lines set forth in this schedule, and empowering the Government to spread the expenditure of the money over a period of two or three years, perhaps over a period of two and a half years. At any rate, I think that it ought to be left to our experts to. say how the money can be most economically expended in the interests of the Commonwealth, and of the people generally.

It requires, I repeat, an expenditure of about ,£2,000,000 to put the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services in proper order. I think that the Prime Minister is quite right, now that the money is available, in trying to make it available for the purpose of making the services efficient. I dare say that he has now received a report from the officers showing exactly wherein the services as a whole are deficient. The statement which he has just read to the Committee cannot possibly reflect the relative deficiencies in the different States. For instance, out of this sum of £600,000, New South Wales alone is to receive £266,000, or very nearly one half of it.

All that the right honourable member urged was that it was inadvisable to have moneys placed to the credit of a lot of Trust Funds unless those funds came from time to time under the review of the Parliament, so that we might know their character, the amount to their credit, and the manner in which they were being expended.

The Prime Minister enumerated the works to be carried out in Queensland, and the list is all very good in its way; but I wish the Committee to understand that because Queensland prior to Federation put her house in order by spending large sums in standardizing her telegraph and telephone lines, she has now to suffer. All that work was paid for out of loan moneys. The honourable member for Darling Downs tried to smother up the tracks regarding the expenditure of the £2,000,000 necessary to bring the Postmaster-General's Department up-to-date, but he knows very well-and I am just as guilty as he is, since I was a member of Parliament at the time, although not a member of any Ad£6,000,000 more than we were required under the Constitution to return to them. We find ourselves, consequently, up against a brick wall to-day.

Can it be said that Queensland has had a fair and square deal ? member mean by developmental lines? lines where none exist to-day-to the system adopted in pre-Federation days.

The State is going ahead by leaps and bounds; yet the Treasurer comes down with a proposal to spend there a miserable £28,000 on developmental works in connection with the Postmaster-General's Department. If a telephone or a telegraph line is desired in western Queensland today, local residents are called upon by the Department to pay half the cost, and to give a five or seven years' guarantee.

I received a letter to-day, in which the Department not only asked people who are living in the back-blocks of western Queensland to find the money for a telephone, but also to pay half the cost of the service. Penny postage, indeed! What does postage mean to people who are living in western Queensland? It means shilling postage I Tens of thousands of pounds have been spent on constructing conduits for telephones in the big cities. In Melbourne the Department ripped up the bowels of the streets to construct tunnels for the same purpose. But they have done nothing with the tunnels since. If only a portion of that money had been spent on services to make the lives of pioneers in the remote parts of this country more comfortable and easy, by giving them better communication with the outside world, I should have said that this Government had really undertaken a truly national work. We claimed that our Government was going to [85] be a Government of progress. We were going to show other parties what a Government could do. But what have we done? We have followed in the same tracks as previous Governments pursued. We have not done one whit better. I ask honourable members, in all seriousness, Is it fair to spend such enormous sums of money in and around the big cities, whilst leaving the We have doubled outside districts languishing? For my own part, I think it is about time we took a leal out of the book of country members in the State Parliaments, and formed a country party. They know how to squeeze Governments to some tune.

What does the Treasurer intend to do with the £[28,000 ? lines. Treasurer intends to spend the money in Brisbane. If he can show me that a single penny of it is going to be spent outside Brisbane, or on work that is not to connect directly with that city, I shall be very glad. That leads me to mention that I fought a battle for the Treasurer some years ago, when telephone communication was required between Brisbane and Gympie. I put up the fight of my life to get the condenser system between those two places. The departmental officials said that the work could not be done for less than £8,000. But there was a post-office official in Tasmania, Mr Hallam, who knew how to do what was required. I induced Mr Sydney Smith, who was then Postmaster-General, to let this gentleman go up to Queensland, and he did the work for about £250. some of us had great difficulty in securing even a slight recognition of the services he performed. deal more than did many of the officers in the professional division. Yet the Public Service Inspector set up a barrier to prevent him from getting over it. However.

In my electorate the Department is actually reducing mail services. In some parts the people have a mail only once a month, and are told that they are lucky to have any mail at all. Those who represent constituencies in the interior of this country know very well that the arrival and departure of the coach is a red-letter day in some small towns.

If the States followed a policy similar to that of the Commonwealth, no developmental work would have been done in northern Queensland; there would be no railways, telephones, and telegraphs extending out to distant places. Had the Stafe Government taken the view that a. work must pay from its inception, there would be no telegraph line to Ayrshire Downs, or out to the South Australian border, and Queensland would not have the longest mileage of railways in Australia.

I think that the pioneers of Australian development should be given telephone, telegraph, and postal services, whether they pay or not, so long as they can be provided at a reasonable cost. I am not unacquainted with the western and northern portions of the continent, and do not think that there can be better expenditure than in the way the honourable member has suggested. charged with neglect in the matter, because, during our term of office, we have spent twice as much on these services as any of our predecessors, while the Estimates for this year are an increase of 50 per cent, on the expenditure of last year, and we propose a further increase of 30 per cent, next year.

I think that this is the sixth year in succession in which I have congratulated the honourable member for Maranoa on a speech similar to that which he has made to-night. The misfortune is that we seem unable to effect an improvement in the system. No more unfair, unjust, or unstatesman-like policy can be adopted than that of the Commonwealth in regard to telephone extensions. The£ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 referred to is to be spent largely in the cities on the alteration of switch-boards, undergrounding of telephone wires, ancl other admittedly necessary works, but works not as urgent as the construction of new lines. The policy which In 1909-10, 241 miles our Postmaster-General has followed is cruelly unjust.

I consider that it was one of the greatest mistakes the Commonwealth could make to adopt that system before we had removed from people in the back-blocks the handicaps under which they labour in the matter of communication.

It is time that we did something more than bark about this matter session after session. We should take some definite action to secure the adoption of an entirely new system in connection with the extension of telephonic communication to the outlying districts. Where there is established a fairly wealthy community, and the prospect of a line paying, the Government erect lines at their own cost and risk, and if the district happens to be close to a large centre of population a very low telephone charge is made, but if a scattered community in the back-blocks ask for telephonic communication, a guarantee to cover any loss on the service is demanded before the Government will undertake the work. member establish telephonic communication whenever it is asked? bave a handful of people settled in any part of Australia who have no other means of communication, we should provide them with telephonic communication whether it pays or not. pared to accept a very large loss. pared to accept 25 per cent, more of loss than any previous Government agreed to. spect, the present Government are 25 per cent, better than their predecessors, but we desire that they should go another 7.5 per cent, better. member's limit; let him state it frankly? of the Government to fix the limit. So far we have had no reasonable policy at all in the matter of the extension of telephonic communication in the country districts.

He has not yet grasped what is aimed at. As Postmaster-General he followed, as the honourable member for Maranoa has said, in the footsteps of his predecessors, and no Government has so far dealt with the question of telephonic extension on proper lines. The Department is now losing by the enormous charges which are made for the use of the telephone over long-distance lines. It is cheaper in some instances to send a wire than it is to send a telephonic message between the same two places. We are throwing our telephonic service out of order, and making it a comparative luxury for those who, like",51,Tasmania

498,Mr Mcwilliams,"I do. I knowmost of our pioneers, have very little money to spend. I have no objection to the improvement of the telephone services in our large cities. Those who attempt to make use of them are agreed that there is room for great improvement, but I should prefer that they should remain as they are for the next three years, if the money required to make the necessary improvements in them were to be expended in the extension of telephonic facilities to places where there is no easy means of communication. Honourable members will agree that in some cases it may be a matter of life and death to have telephonic communication in order, perhaps, to summon a medical man. People in the large cities have letters delivered to them three or four times a day. They have their newspapers delivered in time for breakfast every morning, and can use the telephone at any time for a charge of one penny. But there are communities throughout Australia that are without any means of speedy communication. Instead of continually barking about the matter when the Estimates are under consideration, it is time that honourable members like the honourable member for Maranoa, myself, and. others, who feel strongly on the subject, started to bite. should like the Prime Minister to seriously take into consideration the possibility of withdrawing the guarantee conditions in regard to many telephone lines. I have said before in this House that I can understand that a demand for a guarantee is justified in certain circumstances. Where a line is to be constructed into a district which is not capable of any great expansion, it seems to me a reasonable business proposition to ask those who will be served to subscribe so much to meet the capital expenditure. where. show that the limit should be set where a line is asked for in a. district in which there butions, and let the Department be preis no possibility of extension, owing to the configuration of the country or for other reasons. If people in such a district ask for telephonic communication there is every reason why the Department should say, -"" We want you to subscribe so much of the initial capital cost, or guarantee us against loss for a term of years."" a doctor just as much as other people. would not, but there is a reason in that case why the Department should ask for a guarantee. The Department, however, are asking for a guarantee or a cash donation towards cost of construction in very different circumstances. A handful of people who go out to pioneer back country feel the need for telephone communication, and apply to the Department accordingly. To them every sixpence is of importance, and although the Department must see that in a few years additional population is sure to come to that district, there being any amount of room for development, and that a telephone line, if constructed, must eventually pay handsomely, they insist on those few pioneers putting up cash, or entering into a guarantee. That is utterly unjust and unbusiness-like. If private firms were constructing the telephone lines they would have quite enough foresight to recognise that they could stand a loss for a few years if for all time afterwards they were going to have a profitable enterprise. member think the telephones are paying now in Australia? but as Australia is opened up and developed the traffic on the lines is increasing, the revenue is growing, and they are paying more and more. telephone lines are going up every year. away from my contention that in circumstances such as I have described the Department should bear the whole of the initial cost, because eventually they are going to have a property that will pay them handsomely. This Parliament can generally do very little to help the pioneers of Australia; but in the postal, telephonic, and telegraphic services it can do a good deal. I should like an assurance from the Prime Minister that he will look into the whole of this question, and do away with the guarantee conditions and cash contripared for a few years to shoulder a small loss on lines in districts where there is bound to be an enormous amount of extension and development. shoulder 25 per cent, of the loss to start with. based on the Department's own estimate of the cost of construction, which in nearly",52,Tasmania

I wanted to ask the Prime Minister question upon broad lines, and I feel sure particularly about the vote of £600,000 that, had he done so, he would have comfor special works. I gather from his manded the support of a large number of remarks that he proposes to place honourable members. that sum in a Trust Fund under the very same items as appear in the schedule in relation to the present vote of £700,000. years ago. I noticed particularly that the items corresponded with the schedule word for word, doing, by means of what, for lack of a Personally, I think there is a great deal in better word, I must call a subterfuge what the Treasurer proposes tc do.

526,Mr Riley,"Does not the honorableing to the amount which we are asked to vote, but to the method which it is proposed to adopt. However, I have no desire to labour the question. I merely draw attention to it because I tliink that the whole of our financial practice, .particularly in regard to public works, needs serious -consideration, with a view to its remodelling. A great deal has been made by members of the Opposition of the proposal of the Government to pay £600,000 into a Trust Fund for the purpose of proceeding, during a period of two or three years, with , special works connected with the Postal Department. By innuendo, too, the soundness of this method of finance has been challenged. While such criticism may prove interesting to honourable members, its tendency is to create, in the minds of the public, an impression that the procedure which it is proposed to follow on this occasion is illegal. Such an impression is utterly unwarranted; and, consequently, die line of opposition which has been adopted by honourable members opposite is, to say the least of it, exceedingly objectionable. I think that the action of the Government marks a step in the right direction. As the £600,000 which it is proposed to expend upon special works connected with our telegraphs and telephones is to be placed to the credit of a Trust Fund, the Government will be in a position to insure a continuity of policy, with the result that, before many years have elapsed, this neglected Department will be brought into a state of efficiency. I am strongly in favour of this method of a Trust Fund, instituted by a Bill, a resolution, or a statement on the part of the Government. It is not unusual, at the end of the financial year, especially if times are dull, to find a sudden cessation of work; and this is very injurious to the community. The fact that the financial year closes on 30th June does not really matter to-day, but it has had serious consequences in the past when prosperous conditions did not prevail. It has meant the stoppage of public works in the winter time, when it should be the aim of the Government to even strain a point in order to insure employment. This is a point on which we have no certainty under our present system, so long as the financial year closes on 30th June. I do not know whether the Government can see their way to an innovation; but it is extremely likely that the inauguration of a Trust Fund system would obviate all such evils as I have indicated. call Parliament together earlier. it altogether depends on what Government is in office. It is quite possible that a Government might not be anxious to meet Parliament; and we ought to be constitutionally placed in such a position as to insure continuity in public works. A Trust Fund seems to me to be a perfectly sound financial method, so long as Parliament is informed, through the Government or by an Auditor-General, how the money is expended. There seems to be a fear in some quarters to trust the Government in regard to this and other matters, but, personally, I do not see any danger. The Government will have to be very smart during the next eight months to spend the money we have voted during the last few days. The chances are overwhelmingly against Ministers in this respect; but, in any case, I think they are entitled to some trust, seeing that in about eight months' time we shall be called together again, and put in a position to challenge any expenditure not in accordance with the wishes of Parliament. I think that if a Trust Fund system had been in operation in the States, some of them would have been in a better position than they are to-day. I never could understand why, in years of prosperity, a Government should not be able to constitutionally appropriate money under some system of the kind for the purpose of providing, say, telegraphic and telephonic extensions. Once this sound principle is admitted, it will apply to all public works; and, so far from condemning the Government, I think they have shown great foresight, sagacity, and statesmanship. Of course, such a method may be irritating to old, pedantic statesmen, who have been brought up in a narrow groove; but it is a move in the right direction, which, I think, will be of benefit to the community generally. I notice that of the £600,000 something like £41,000 is intended for South Australia, though I dare say that if all the items voted in respect of that State were added, they would amount to a much more considerable sum. I desire to urge, however, that the complaints or representations of the honourable member for Maranoa in regard to Queensland apply with equal force to the back country of South Australia.

It is a common complaint throughout Australia that in order to economize, post-offices are being closed at a much earlier hour than was previously done, and that postal facilities generally, such as the clearance of letter-boxes, and so on, are being decreased. It is a curious anomaly to find through a Labour administration of this great Department, that while on the one hand, £160,000 is to be spent in New South Wales in providing the telephone subscriber with more facilities, and vast sums in other States, in constructing conduits, and placing wires underground, the unfortunate user of the pillar-box, or the unfortunate sender of letters is to be served infinitely worse, in the interests of economy, than he ever has been served, at any rate, since the Commonwealth took over the Department.

In the same way, persons who live near pillar-boxes, and use them, find that theii letters, instead of being delivered next morning within the metropolitan area are delivered late next afternoon.

I do hope that when the question of facilities is taken into account in connection with the back-blocks we shall deal a little more generously with the people there than we do with those who live in congested areas, where the service The can be handled more easily.

Minister) [9.51] I remember that the honourable member asked for certain information, but the discussion proceeded, and I -was prevented in the circumstances from replying to him. Had he been in the chamber a little earlier, he would have known that I gave information in reply to a similar question, put by the honourable member for Nepean, the honourable member for Hunter, .and one or two others, respecting grants to rifle clubs, and money to be expended for the purpose of areas for rifle clubs and rso forth. So far as the expenditure is concerned, the honourable member will gather from his experience to-night, at all events, that one reason why all the money voted is not expended within the financial year, is that honourable members, undoubtedly in the full exercise of their rights, delay the (passage of the Estimates so long that a large part of the financial year is over before the Government can proceed to carry -out the works. I can promise him, how-ever, that every effort will be put forward during the ensuing few months to expend -every penny that has been voted for these purposes. The sincerity of the Government in respect of rifle ranges has been :Shown by the fact that they are proposing to expend in this direction something like £70,000 as against £17,000 spent during last financial year. Their intention is that -every facility shall be given to rifle clubs to secure efficiency. ister and Treasurer) [9.54]--Division No. 10, under which the Committee is asked to vote £468,700 in respect of special defence material, is designed to carry out a matter of policy. In the first place we ask for £300,000 for warlike stores, including field and machine guns, vehicles, harness and saddlery, arms, accoutrements, and other regimental and personal equipment, including ammunition. This equipment is required to place the forces in such a state that they could take the field fully armed ancl equipped with warlike and medical stores, tools, vehicles, &c. At present many articles of equipment are deficient. This amount is complementary to the £200,000 voted in 1910-n. Then again tlie division includes a proposed vote of £[20,000 for the supply of cloth for uniforms required by troops on -.the commencement of adult universal training, the money to be paid into a trust fund-the Military Clothing Material Account. We ask also for £5,000 in respect of a reserve of warlike stores, to provide reserve parts for existing field batteries for war. There is no arsenal here, and the distance from England, ancl the time therefore occupied, renders necessary the provision of "" spares.""

It is the total amount to be spent this year to provide for the equipment of the troops. four batteries this year? to provide some ammunition and other things later on; but not to any material amount. The item of £2,000, which stands next on the list, is "" towards providing apparatus for wireless telegraphy in the field."" I need not remind honourable members that wireless is now in use in nearly all Continental armies, and there is no reason why Australian troops should not experiment with it. There cannot be any doubt that wireless telegraphy will be an important feature in future warfare. The sixth item, £65,000, is to provide rifles for the Senior Cadets. I am sure that no honourable member will take objection to that. The seventh item, £31,700, is for a reserve of gun ammunition. The amount provided represents half the cost of providing increased equipment of ammunition for the fixed defence and Field Artillery armaments. I have scanned the whole of these items with the Minister of Defence; and, while much more was asked for, he admits that this expenditure will bring our Forces up to a state of efficiency. -This matter, of Defence expenditure will be discussed next week in connection with the Budget.

Great quantities of explosives are used in connection with mining, and in gassy mines it is essential that the explosives are such as will not give off fire. A company was formed some time ago to manufacture mining explosives in Australia, but it found that it could not sell its goods because they were not on the permissive list. When inquiry was made as to how their explosives could be put on the permissive list, it was found that samples would have to be sent to the Old Country to be tested. There the testing of explosives is under the control of a Board. If an Australian manufacturer sends explosives to the Old Country to be tested, he runs the risk of having them deteriorate on the voyage. On the other hand, imported explosives which have been tested in the Old Country may deteriorate on tlie voyage out, and there is also the danger that they may not have been tested. The tests at Home may be made periodically, and defective explosives may thus be sent out here. Seeing that human life is at stake, the Commonwealth should establish a testing station to prevent the use of any but safe explosives. tested, too. another matter.

641,Mr Greene,"Honorabl e membersthe honourable member for Richmond, I am extremely anxious to know the policy of the Government with regard to the Northern Territory, but I did not expect that it would be stated on these Works Estimates. The Prime Minister has promised us that the Minister of External Affairs will give us the Government policy when we come to deal with items affecting the Northern Territory on the General Estimates. [JO.25] -The honourable member for Darling Downs drew my attention to the fact that the Prime Minister had made a statement one day last week to the effect that when these votes came up the Government policy with respect to the Northern Territory would be explained. The honourable member for Darling Downs saidI wish to know from the right honourable gentleman if a statement of policy is to be made regarding the .development of the Nortliern Territory, where obviously there must be considerable expenditure of public works. We should know what is to be done, what gauge is to be adopted, and whether the line is to be ultimately carried forward to join the Queensland railway system. To that statement, the Prime Minister repliedI have asked the Minister for External AfTairs to make a statement of jjolicy during this debate. That referred to the debate on the Works and Buildings Estimates. the debate on the whole of the Estimates and on the Budget was practically the same. honourable member for Darling Downs then said that he would reserve his remarks until a later stage, being clearly of ihe opinion, like others on this side, that it was the intention of the Prime Minister to have a statement of policy made before this item was passed. member admit that this is practically the same debate as the Budget debate? tically. If the Prime Minister says he did not mean what the honourable member understood, I am satisfied. Affairs could not have made a statement to-night in any case. I quite understood that the full exposition of the policy and intentions of the Government with regard to the Northern Territory would be made in the debate on the General Estimates), but I take this opportunity of expressing my great disappointment with the official report which has been presented to the House. 1 never before read such a meagre report from any Department. It would be impossible for any one to take up an equal amount of space and say less in it than is said in that report. If toose in charge of expeditions of this character are to furnish such reports, it is time ihat the Government took action. No Government can ignore the fact that the Northern Territory is a real live question, and a heavy burden on the people of Australia. The subject must be taken in hand and dealt with in a thoroughly practical way, in order that at least some return may be got from the Territory for the enormous amount being spent on it. We all exceedingly regret that the Minister of External Affairs is unable to be in the House this evening, and I hope that before the debate on the Budget proceeds very far he will be able to make the promised statement, so that honourable members can debate the question when debating the Government's Budget proposals generally. I want it to be known that some of us feel that there must be no mark-lime policy in connection with the Northern Territory. It is far too serious and costly an item for us to sit down and allow the expenditure to go on as at present. Air.

It is headed"" Australian Meat."" "" Handling in London."" paragraphs which I wish to quote readComplaints have frequently been made as to the haphazard manner in which the meat is dealt with, and Mr Levy is now satisfied that the whole of the trouble arises between the time the meat leaves the steamer and gets into the hands of the consumer. The meat appears to be well looked after in transit from Australia to London; after that, there is ample room for improvement in the methods of its handling. It was somewhat significant, said Mr Levy, that at none of the hotels or restaurants at which he made special inquiries could he obtain an admission that either Australian meat or Australian butter wns used. He thought that something should be done to bring about the recognition of Australian produce. The quality was alright, and the fact that the meat or the butter was Australian should be loudly proclaimed, not concealed. I desire to ask the Minister whether it is the intention of the Government to do anything towards bringing our Australian products before the public of Great Britain? It was with amazement that I heard the statement made at a deputation which waited on the Minister of External Affairs, that 75 per cent, of our Australian butter was sold in London either as Danish butter or as butter from other countries. I maintain that our product is equal to that of any other country in the world, and that our producers, both in the meat and butter industries, are anxious that their products should stand upon their own merits. My anxiety is that the Government should do something in tliat direction, so that Australian products, when they reach Great Britain, should not lose their identity. Is it the intention of the Government to do anything in respect of Australian meat and other products, and if so, when? 'and Customs) [10.40] -The honourable member informed me that it was his intention to bring this matter forward upon the motion for adjournment. I may say at once that, at the last Cabinet meeting, it was decided to call for applications for the appointment of an expert in London to advise us as to how our products were treated there. The applications will be made returnable early in the new year. meat. We require an expert who will not only be able to advise us, but who will also be able to advise the High Commissioner, and thus prevent the publication of some of the tales which have been circulated in the press of Great Britain from time to time, to the damage of Australian products.

It is quite possible that, on account of the increasing cost of the Commerce Department, we shall have to slightly increase our fees. I think that the Department should pay its way; and I know that the exporters of meat have said that they are quite prepared to pay something extra in order to insure that justice shall be done.
