The Government, having considered the board's recommendations, arrivedat certain conclusions which are embodied in the schedule of duties, submitted to the House.

BEAM WIRELESS. ister enlighten the House as to the progress of the controversy proceeding abroad regarding tbe competition between beam wireless and the cable companies? How will tbe competition of wireless affect Australia's interests in the Pacific Cable Company? Is the Commonwealth Government, i as-a shareholder in Amalgamated Wireless Limited, inquestion. dom? tween beam wireless and the cable companies has created a serious and acute problem, which will be accentuated if the beam system sbould prove over a period of twelve months as effective as it has been for the few months it has been YEAR-BOOK. in operation. The cable systems are considered vitally necessary for defence purposes, and possibly they will be required also as an auxiliary means of communication. A committee representing the governments concerned, namely, those of Great Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) is to be appointed to investigate the relationship between beam wireless and the cable system, and to submit' recommendations to tbe various governments. It is not finally determined that that committee shall be set up, but the matter has been practically decided, though no appointments have been made. Only experience can show what will be the effect of the competition of the beam system on our revenue from the Pacific Cable Company, in which we are the largest shareholder, our interest being 6-18ths, Canada's 5-18ths, Great Britain's 5-lSths, and New Zealand's 2-18ths.. system itself, as we are shareholders in the Amalgamated Wireless Company, which is conducting the service, on a reciprocal basis, by which it receives messages from Great Britain and despatches messages to Great Britain from Australia.

55,Mr Mann (Perth) [3.28],"T regret,this policy can airily be waved aside on the plea, so often beard, that protection is tbe settled policy of Australia. If any policy is found, after trial, to be inimical a' great extent, that has already been done to the best interests of the country it sbould be capable of amendment. How does any policy become the immutable and unchangeable policy of a country? As a matter no reason why protection should be regarded as the law of the Medes and Persians, wbich altereth not, because, for many years, tbe people wbo, in the long run, have to determine the policy of the country, have had little opportunity, in fact, no opportunity, of voting upon the continuance of this principle. Time after time, when elections have been pending, other important questions have been introduced to divert the attention of tbe people and to deprive them of the opportunity to consider and to vote upon the tariff policy. A noticeable change is to-day taking ""place in Australian public opinion. Many people are asking themselves bow long is this oppressive policy of protection to continue, and where is it leading us. They are snowing impatience and distrust because the tariff has failed to bring about tbe results that were claimed for it. It is time that this policy, which is fraught with such direful consequences to the whole community, was made a vital issue at an election, and discussed thoroughly before the people, so that they may bave an opportunity to express tlieir opinion on it. This policy of constantly raising our protective duties bas a much wider effect than that referred to in the speeches of tlie Opposition during this debate, and so 1 am compelled to crave the indulgence cf the committee to permit me to review the situation somewhat more thoroughly than has yet beeu done, because the tariff policy has become of great and pressing importance, not only in our domestic affairs, but also in our imperial and international relations. As regards our domestic affairs, I propose to make no plea for any local or class interests. J sbould be entirely justified in discussing this policy from the viewpoint of my own State, but I do not intend to do so. It would also be within my right to enlarge upon its application to certain sections of the community, noticeably the primary producer, but, to by other members of the committee. Therefore,'I propose to discuss it in its relation, not to atiy particular territory of the Commonwealth, but to tbe federaof fact there is tion, the effect upon farmer and worker, upon the great mass of people in tlie cities who are more or less on fixed salaries, and upon our national prosperity and development as a whole. The Government could not bave chosen a more inopportune time than the present for placing further tariff burdens upon the people. The position to-day is serious for a number of causes, the effects of which have been gradually accumulating. I do not wisb in any way to speak in a lugubrious tone, or to tell a. doleful story, but it is necessary that we should pay heed to tbe warnings and statements of authoritative men in this community wbo have for some time been telling us that we are proceeding along the wrong path of government. Tbe particular directions in wbich tbey have found fault with us, are these-the y say that we bave been guilty of maintaining an artificially high standard of living, due to our fiscal policy, and its natural corollary, arbitration. I shall deal with the interaction of tbese two forces directly. They also point out that we bave adopted an attitude in defiance of the teachings of economists in relation to the post-war situation and international relations; that, because of tbe deliberate exclusion of competition, we are faced with a falling-off of productiveness, and a failure to develop to the utmost our resources of material wealth; that this policy bas caused interference with private enterprise, ingenuity, and individuality; and that we have failed to take our competitive place in the world's market, simply because the artificial maintenance of the high cost of production has crippled successful trade, which is the real life blood of national wealth and power. Por a long time the people have been realizing that the artificial standard of living that we have built up is getting more and more shaky every day. .Por the last two or three years we have beard authoritative men say that it only wants one setback, festo, issued in the Old Country, which say, a drought in Australia, to bring us points out how intimately the financial to our senses, and make us realize the faland economic troubles of the world are sity of tbe doctrines that we have supassociated with the necessity for greater ported. many of those prophecies to which I bave little later there was the remarkable conreferred are being fulfilled. A further ference held at Geneva known as the instalment of tbe protectionist policy is World's Economic Conference, which met included in this motion at a time when in May of last year, and with which I the policy is coming into grave disrepute shall deal later. I may also mention the among the people. During tbe past few Tariff Board's reports of 1926 and 1927, months an important series of public wbich are extraordinary documents, statements have appeared in Australia, showing how protection is failing to and I wish to refer to tbem as evidence fulfil the object which it was alleged that the opinions that I am expressing it would bring about.

57,Mr Mann,"Yes.to a true conception of nationhood and its with financial and economic distress. As responsibilities as a nation, we must have tbe courage to grapple witb those problems wbich are retarding our progress, and exert sufficient strength of mind, foresight, and courage to amend our ways in the light of experience. In spite of the warnings contained in the statements I have enumerated the Government bas shown no inclination whatever to recognize the seriousness of tbe position. Experience bas proved that whenever a country is confronted with economic stringency every effort sbould be made to use the minimum of revenue consistent with the absolute necessities of government, and to fact that if protection is only carried return any balance to the community by way of remissions of taxation. When a country is faced with financial stress tbe proper course is to enable private enterprise to become stronger and to adjust itself to the conditions which are apparent. I quoted in the House last week a speech of the president of the Bank of New South Wales upon this subject which I need not repeat. It is for the committee to realize that for four years the Government, in addition to budgeting on a no means niggardly scale, has spent over £.16,000,000 of surplus money. Although the Treasurer boasted of a reduction of over £S,000,000 in direct taxation, indirect taxation has been increased by £17,000,000. To put it in another way tbe indirect taxation per head in Australia in 1921-22 was £5 0s. 3$d., whereto competitive conditions and face the as in 1926-27 it had risen to £7 3s. 9^d. It has, therefore, overtaken altogether and outrun the growth of population. I have already pointed out on more than one occasion that indirect taxation imposes a burden upon the people equal to at blockade that was enforced upon our least four times the amount of the actual revenue received into the Treasury. I do not intend to prove that, because it bas been affirmed by every student cf tbe subject. Therefore, if we take the indirect taxation at £7 3s. 9£d. per head, the real burden is four times that amount, or £28 15s. 2d. per head. Tbe indirect taxation of a man, his wife, and tbrde children is, therefore, £143 15s. per annum, which is surely a burden grievous to be borne. That being so, we cannot wonder that the country is faced a matter of fact, the more we study the subject tbe more readily must we recognize that, although there are many causes contributing to our present financial position, the starting point of tbe trouble is our fiscal policy. I wish to show how this is so. First of all, under a protective policy tbe cost'of living is increased. I know tbe Minister for Trade and Customs will say that that is not so, and that he has shown before that prices of protected commodities have fallen under our present system. Honourable members opposite bave also been very insistent upon the far enough prices must be reduced. There are few such instances which could be quoted; and whenever one has been, the fact has been revealed that tbe drop in Australia bas been in consequence of an immense fall in prices in the markets of tbe world. Therefore, tbe effect of our protective policy is not only to raise prices directly, but also to prevent a lowering of the prices of commodities wbich, in the absence of such a policy, we should be able to obtain more cheaply from overseas. Tbe cost of living figure to-day is, I believe, 170, compared with 100 in 1911. Therefore, we are still paying practically war rates, notwithstanding the fact that the war terminated nine years ago. Every other country has been labouring strenuously to reduce tbe cost of its living and production, realizing that it must revert facts. On the other"" hand, we in Australia bave been endeavouring to persuade ourselves that it is within our power to maintain the artificial conditions that were rendered possible only by the trade during tbe war. Trade from every corner of tbe globe is knocking at our doors, but we foolishly shut it out, and decline to act in a way that would make our living cheaper, easier, and happier. The most extraordinary feature is the attitude of the Australian Labour party to tbe policy of protection. I have made a careful study of the matter, and bave obtained particulars respecting the view-point of the Labour party in every leading country. Without exception it is the opponent of bigb protection in those countries, because it realizes that the duties fall with particular severity upou the labouring man and the man of small means, to whom slight rises in the prices of commodities are a very serious matter. 1 have never been able to understand why the Labour party in Australia advocates a policy of high protection. I believe it is acting against the interests of its own people. under such a policy higher rates of wages can be obtained. great fallacies of tbe system under which we live. A workman thinks that so loug as be can secure higher wages, bis condition is being improved. He overlooks the truth of the saying, ""While wages climb thc stairs prices take the elevator."" Although wages have continued to soar, their purchasing power has decreased. I followed closely tbe speech of the bonorable member for Dalley( Mr It is also illogical and outrageous. The Theodore), on Friday afternoon. said that the only criterion of effective protection was the exclusion of goods from Australia, and added, "" If it only raises prices it is a fallacy and sbould be abolished. If it is not effective the Government must take the responsibility."" Tlie honourable member then proceeded to lay at tbe door of tbe present Minister( Mr Pratten) ibe blame for the existing volume of imports; but he bad to admit that that gentleman has at his disposal a battery of legislation, tremendous power, and tbe sympathetic support of a majority of honourable members for almost any proposal that be cares to make in the way of increased protection. Surely if the system has failed it would be better for us to say, "" Let us get rid of to impose such a condition, and it it,"" instead of Let us have more of it."" The honourable member for Dalley was obliged to admit that effectiveness could not be secured; therefore, the only conclusion to which one can come is that tbe tariff is responsible for the raising of to obtain it because the court fixes wages prices, and consequently, in the bonorable member's view, is a failure and should arguing along those lines the honourable member suggested further duties, aud even went so far as to urge a tax on brains and knowledge, in tbe form of books. could be imposed. The raising of prices has a reaction upon the Arbitration Court. Tbat court, as [ have said before, Mr Mann. has shown itself to be a logical absurdity, for tbe reason that no court can fix wages except on tbe basis of the cost of living, whereas they ought to be influenced by production. factor. The excuse, of course, is that factor. Tbe Arbitration Court has avoided it because it could not adopt any That is one of the basis otlier than the cost of living. I do not agree with the absurd recommendation which is sometimes made by the Tariff Board, that a duty should be imposed only on the understanding that the workmen should not ask for higher wages. posal. He suggestion is that only one section of tbe community shall bear the burden of higher duties. When workmen see that r higher subsidy is being paid to manufacturers to enable them to carry on their industry, they do quite right to say, "" We are entitled to a certain share of that subsidy."" One is constrained to take tbe view that when they make that recommendation the members of the Tariff Board bave tbeir tongue in their cheek. They must know that it is impossible to impose sucb a condition. As a matter of fact, the Government has brought forward proposals for tbe imposition of the duties recommended, and has entirely disregarded that advice. If the Board recommends the Government is found impossible to do so, the Government ought not to propose the duty. As I have said previously, the workmen act quite rightly wben they claim a share of this public subsidy; but they are unable on the basis of the cost of living, which, afc a consequence, is further raised. Thus be abolished. Instead of we have tlie spectacle of these two factors racing each other up parallel step-ladders, and tbe result is absurdity. Every body sees it ; every body knows it ; but no party has tbe courage to stand up and say that No more foolish tax it must stop. This Government is not merely perpetuating, but also accentuating, the evil, by the imposition of additional duties.",22,Tariff Customs And Excise Duties

When the present Arbitration Court was appointed I remember distinctly the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) saying it was hoped that it would investigate in a more scientific manner than formerly, applications for higher wages, and would pay regard to economic conditions, so as to determine whether it was economically possible for industry to pay what was asked. Tbe other day Chief Judge Dethridge felt obliged to make the following statementThis court is unable to find any economic basis upon which it can give its awards. We are, therefore, obliged to meddle and muddle through. That is due to tbe fact that we are continually interfering with the awards of the court, and introducing conditions whicli lead to their being upset. One of the principal factors of trouble is our customs law and administration. The policy of protection is responsible for one of our greatest evils: I refer to the over-population of tbe cities, and the ill value of the labour of our people so that balanced distribution of the population throughout tbe country. ing industries, wbich are established chiefly in the cities, we encourage the population to go there. to tbe cities by artificial conditions in relation to wages and employment, which cannot be extended to the outlying parts. The result is that tbe conditions of life in tbe cities are seriously at variance with those which obtain in the country districts. Such a condition of affairs acts as a hindrance to migration. Huge sums of money are being expended in an endeavour to induce settlers to fill what we call our empty spaces. In round figures it costs about £2,000 to settle a migrant upon tbe land. precious few. ber w ill become fewer, because we ask these men to live in places and under conditions that are not attractive. Our policy for years past has been directed towards encouraging l if e in the cities, aud discouraging life upon the land. While that is going on what f o l ly it is to spend huge sums of money on all sorts of fancifu l immigration schemes whicn are opposed to the present political and I scarcely expect the fiscal policy. We are doing a cruelty tithe men whom we induce to come bere. Many of tbe new settlers on the land are merely taking the places of others who found tbe conditions so irksome that they got rid of their holdings and returned to the city. I beard of one district which boasted of having 71 new settlers, but later had to admit that exactly the same number of older settlers bad lef t the land and gone into the cities. What is tbe use of spending millions of pounds in tryin g settle people on the land when our economic policy has the effect of drawing them off? When carefully studied, this system has an ill effect upon our internal affairs. We frequently bear tbe statement that it niatters not how much commodities cost so long as the money expended on their purchase is kept in the country. This is a glib, but meaningless statement. Money in itself is nothing, but the Government's fiscal policy, by artificially raising costs and prices, is reducing the exchangeable we cannot obtain sufficient surplus wealth B y stimulatfor the development of our country and are obliged to borrow. The surpluses wbicb labour would otherwise p r o d u c It is lured and wbich could be accumulated for developmental puiposes are non-existent. If a pipe is corroded, water will not flow through it , because all the pressure is nullified by internal friction. Similarly, this policy of high protection, by creating internal friction, uses up the energy and resources of our people, wbich sbould be devoted to furthering the progress of the country. Importations also are increased, partly by' borrowing and partly by other causes. I do not propose to dwell at length upon tbe subject of borrowing, and its influence in creating an adverse trade balance. Sufficient has been said already to indicate that this factor is very imperfectly understood and has been greatly exaggerated. 'Nevertheless the policy of borrowing abroad is unfortunately developing our imports at a rate with which our export trade cannot keep pace. The high customs duties,"" ih conjunction with the awards of the Arbitration Court, cause unemployment. An",24,Tariff Customs And Excise Duties

64,Mr Gut,I-ETT -We are settling,25,Tariff Customs And Excise Duties
65,Mr Mann,"We are; and the numextraordinary fallacy is current that if the hours of employment are reduced, more work will be provided for those not now fully engaged. Tbe effect of that policy is to cause more unemployment, because it reduces tbe productivity of labour and depletes that wages fund, from which all labour must be remunerated. Nothing bas been more harmf ul to this country than the erroneous thinking on this subject. I bave never been an advocate of tbe excessive hours and low wages for which men had to work a few score years ago, but wben other countries are realizing the necessity f o v increasing their productivity, for us to reduce the hours of labour, thereby reducing output and raising costs, is to create further unemployment. Similarly, high customs duties, by increasing costs diminish production and the demand for labour. ing together contribute seriously to the creation of unemployment. When honourable members prescribe higher duties as a cure for unemployment they are advising a form of treatment which will only aggravate the disease. Honourable members opposite have urged the Minister for Trade and Customs to have this schedule dealt with at once, so that many people now workless may look forward to a happier Christmas. God knows I would like the unemployed to have a happier Christmas than seems to be in prospect for them, but an increase in customs duties will not give it to them. Even the Leader of the Opposition admitted that the increase in duties last year merely relieved the unemployed problem for the time being. treatment a temporary stimulus was given to industry, but a reaction followed, and in the end the industry was weakened rather than strengthened. This policy is equivalent to feeding a person on tonics instead of solid food. Another reason for altering our fiscal policy is that it protects and encourages inefficiency. I agree with honourable members opposite that the blame for inefficiency in industry must not be laid entirely on the Australian There is a good deal of inefficiency in the management, manifested either in out-of-date processes and machinery or in failure to grasp the economic factors Mr Mann. essential to success. I have repeatedly heard advocates of high protection say in this chamber that such and such a company has tbe most up-to-date machinery and appliances for the cheap and efficient conduct of its business. How bave they become qualified to express an opinion as to what is the most up-to-date machinery? They are merely repeating what tbey have been told by the managements. I have in mind one big plant that is supposed to be as efficient as any in tbe world, but an expert steel engineer told me that its equipment is laughable when compared with that in up-to-date establishments elsewhere. In another instance, the machinery and plant imported and erected in Australia had been acquired from a company in England whicli was glad to get rid of its obsolete plant in Both tbese factors operatorder to substitute something more efficient. correct.

73,Mr Mann,"I am not going to menshould thoroughly understand that it is going to cost them more; if they understand that, then the policy of protection is no imposition on them. The trouble is that, proceeding from tbe particular to the general, people arrive at the fallacious conclusion that what is good for one must be good for all. If protection is applied to tbe whole range of industry the benefits cancel each other. Tbe finished product of one factory is the raw material of another, and the result of universal protection is to send up tbe price of goods all round tbe circle, at a cost to the community which it cannot bear. Tbis is the effect produced if protection is applied to more than a very limited number of industries. If one asks what industries it should be applied to the advocates of protection will reply that it sbould apply to our key industries. If it is applied to any industry at all, the last one it should apply to is a key industry, because that is an industry upon which many others are vitally dependent, and if the price of its products are raised, the prices of all the dependent products are raised also. Then, again, it is said that we sbould protect the industries necessary for defence in war time. are to live in a condition of preparation for, and expectation of war, but I say that every nation should live in expectation of peace. Apart from that, however, what industries are necessary to us in wartime? Some say, the steel industry; but is that more important to us than the clothing industry, or is clothing more important than food? There are hardly any industries, except those dealing with luxuries, which however small, may not prove of vital importance to us in time of war. The range of protection cannot be limited in that way. Besides, in time of war, tbe country would be in a better position if we bad tbe nation's wealth untramelled and unrestricted, so that it might be invested in tbe things necessary for war, which bas always been the case in England. Her position enables ber to marshall her resource's in time of war and meet it when it comes; that is why, as a rule, England is not ready for war when it comes, but is always ready in time to win the last battle, and that is the most 1 important. Protection is a thoroughly discredited policy. The trials we have made, and the facts and figures coming to light every day, show that there is something wrong witb it. It is daily demonstrating its failure. In view of its past history, every fresh application for increased duty is a fresh condemnation of it. It seems almost ludicrous to read that at the beginning applications were made for 5 to 10 per cent, duty on different articles. Tbe applicants said that that duty was not a very high duty, and that when the industry was established it could be taken off. The imposition of those duties was followed by further impositions of 15 per cent, and 20 per cent., and then of others up to 30 per cent., 40 per cent., 50 per cent., and even 100 per cent., while in some cases the rate is as high as 200 per cent.; and this sort of thing is still going on. Still the industries complain ""not enough, not enough""; tbeir cry is that of tbe daughters of tbe horse leech, "" give, give."" Where is it all going to stop? The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) the other day That implies that we resented the implication contained in a letter written by the chairman of 6. ""A. Bond and Company in regard to the failure of that firm. The firm said that its failure was largely, though perbaps not entirely, due to its not getting increased protective duties. I do not wonder that the Minister became indignant. Increased duty! Already there is a duty of 60 per cent, on the class of goods produced by this firm, and that is not sufficient for them, while on top of that a bonus of £45,000 was paid in respect to manufactured goods during tbe year. A few months ago, when tbe company made application to tbe public for increased capital, it tried to show that its financial position was sound, and that it had made a profit of £55,000 in the year. When it wanted to get fresh capital from the public it could put up a pretty tale of successful trading, but when it wants increased duty, it makes the pitiful plaint that it is impossible to carry on. At last this firm is exposed, and its employees are threatened with loss of work. It is because of trouble of that sort t6 working people tliat I raise my voice now, because tbe working people are being gulled into a false sense of tbe position -IH which protection will place them. Now -this firm bas tbe audacity to say that, in spite of high duties, and in spite of ithe bounty wbicb a bountiful government -has paid to it, it is unable to carry on because the duties are not high enough. The same sort of thing is revealed by some of tbe Tariff Board reports. If honourable members will read those reports quietly and dispassionately, tbey will not fail to observe the absurdity of some of tbe recommendations made. Tbe reports sketch tbe history of a firm, stating bow successful it has been, and emphasizing the profits it has made. In one case a report stated that a certain firm already has 86 per cent, of tbe Australian market, and yet tbe board proposes that it should have a further protective duty. What justification can there be for things like that? In addition to its failure as a practical policy-and I submit it has failed and is failing lamentably-pro tection 'has a bad effect on our public life. I want to quote two statements on this point. One is made by Professor Page, chairman of tbe Tariff Commission of the United States of America, in a book entitled Making the Tariff in the United States of America. In this book be describes the method by wbicb bigb tariffs are attained through the board. He saysThey are attained by liberal campaign contributions, by expensive paganda, by costly and by astute distortion of It would be easy to quote instances of all those things in this country, and these tilings are not making for purity in our public life, but are a degrading influence. For some months past, on many of our railway stations, there has been an elaborate system of advertising indulged in by a certain firm. Posters are displayed which depict two anxious parents bending over their son, who is studying a book. "" Where will your son get a job? Every boy cannot be a farmer."" It extols thc excellency of secondary manufactures, and shows how they ought to be encouraged. This firm, which is so anxious about tbe future of the boy, and Air. Al a wn. which points out that everybody cannot be a farmer, has shown its interest in this matter by discharging the whole of its night staff comprising 112 men, and retaining the girls. It is propaganda of this sort which is corrupting and degrading public life, aud wbich the protectionist system encourages and permits. I wish now to read a statement made by Mr T. F. Bayard, formerly the ambassador of the United States of America to Britain, when speaking at the Philosophical Institute in Edinburgh. He saidI n my own country I have witnessed the insatiable growth of that form of State Socialism, styled protection, which, I believe, has done more than any other causeTo foster class legislation and create inequality of fortune; To corrupt public life; To banish men of independent mind and character from the public councils; To lower the tone of national representation ; Blunt public conscience: Create false standards in the popular mind; To familiarize it with reliance upon Stateaid and guardianship in private affairs; Divorce ethics from politics, and -place politics upon the low level of a mercenary scramble. Tbat is a withering condemnation by a representative of one of the greatest protectionist countries in the world of tbe policy which we are trying to carry out and extend in this country. This policy is also becoming one of increased importance in connection witb our relations witb other countries, and witb other parts of the Empire. This and misleading provery schedule embraces proposals for inexpert lobbying, aud creasing' British preference. This quesevidence. tion of Imperial preference is one which ought to be given careful consideration by honourable members. In July, 1923, I spoke in this House at length on British preference, and again on the Government's proposals to increase the proportion of British labour or materials from 25 per cent, to 75 per cent., entitling such goods to preference. On both ' occasions I said that tbe system was illusory in its benefits and entirely inThe poster bears this caption, sincere in its methods. I doubt if what I am saying is likely to make the"" slightest impression upon certain honourable members; but that is a matter of indifference to me. I intend to state my views on this important issue, irrespective of any other consideration, because I am now speaking to a much larger and a On the 20th August the same journal much more influential audience than that statedwithin these walls. The people of Australia expect the position to be placed Mr Pratten, to which we drew attention refrankly before tbem. Tbey should not cently, be able to plead ignorance as to the con-tive Council of the Commonwealth of Austrasequences of this tariff, of be led astray lia, is very welcome. He had, he said, been by it. I have already said that imperial preference is illusory in its benefits, and insincere hi its methods. Tbis is now being recognized in Great Britain. I am afraid that I shall bave to trespass upon the patience of honourable members while I read a number of extracts on this subject from journals published recently in England. In the trade and engineering supplement of the London Times, of tbe 6th August last, there appeared the following paragraphsIn an interview published in The Times last week, Mr Pratten, tlie Australian Minister of Trade and Customs, made some surprising statements. It will come as a shock to many British citizens to find that Mr Pratten likens their attitude to that of Oliver Twist, who had the temerity to ask for more. Possibly Mr to build a wall of exclusion around Australia Pratten overlooked the fact that Oliver had hail an insufficient ration and, therefore, had an extremely good case, but most English people are under the impression that of late Australin has been showing a disposition to reduce the generous allowance formerly made to British trade, and that thc present position is th-is the wool and other industries would be only too glad to go back to the conditions ruling before Mr Pratten revised the Australian Tariff. Mr Pratten made no secret of his belief tha* course, give his fellow-citizens the reverse of the bounty of nature in showering raw materials on Australia put that Continent in a position to develop practically every essential industry, and that Australians were determined to develop them as quickly as possible, ""using the t a r if f "" as the quickest and best public speeches. method of stimulating tlieir growth. He insisted, however, that Australians were enthusiastic loyalists and expressed his own belief, that, in the preferential treatment given to products of the Mother Country through the tariff, it was possible that further development might take place in the direction of Imperial trade cartels. He added that, p ovided her national development was not arrested, he believed Australia would do everything possible to protect Imperial tracks against foreign aggression, and suggested that the thought was well worth pursuing in the interests of the Empire. It is not quite clear what Mr Pratten meant by Imperial trade cartels, as he went on to say that it must be realized that "" our first duty is to Australin and not to the British trader, whose only m terest in us concerns his profits on the goods whicli he sells.'' f Coming after the rather narrow views of the speech at Newcastle-on-Tyne by Sir George Pearce, Vice-President of the Execuimpressed with thu growth of Empire consciousness in Great BritainI wonder when Great Britain was ever unconscious of tbe Empire? and went so far as to declare . t h a t ia Australia they 'would have to adopt more vigorous measures if the}' were to keep pace with the people here. He expressed his appreciation and gratitude for the steps taken by the United Kingdom to assist the marketing of certain Australian products, but he frankly admitted that in Australia duties have been imposed on imports with the object of shutting them out and giving thc Australian market to the Australian manufacturer. I u addition, practically ail British-manufactured goods imported, whether such articli-sare manufactured in Australia or not, receive a preference of from 10 per cent, to 20 per cent, over the products of foreign competitors. Sir George Pearce characterized as foolish the idea that it is not only possible, but advisable and to shut out peqple and goods. Equally foolish is the idea tliat migration means u n : employment, but he insisted that these views were not shared by the majority of Australians, and declared that nothing was moru likely to prevent the spread of such pernicious? doctrines, and to encourage good will towards a more determined migration policy, than thc realization in Australia of the determination of the people here to assist Australian development by helping to market and sell Australian goods. We hope Sir George will , in duo the story. He should point out to them that nothing is more likely to discount the efforts made to popularize Empire produce here than lack of sympathy towards British exports, whether expressed in tariff legislation or Mr Walter Runciman, speaking of tbese mythical gifts from Australia to Great Britain, saidIf we are to be told, as we are very often, that the preference given is a g if t to this country, let us see how it is measured. I think Mr Bruce estimates that it is a g if t of eight million pounds, and in his valedictory speech before he came here lie once more made remarks about this g if t of eight million pounds That eight million is calculated on a rather curious basis. You take first of all the tariff imposed on foreign goods, and then you taKe the . tariff imposed under the preferential duties on British goods; and the difference between the two comes to eight millions. Therefore, says Mr Bruce, that is a g if t to Grout Britain of eight million pounds. Let us see what would happen if the tariff on foreign goods were doubled and the tariff on British goods remained somewhat where it is. You can easily see that the g if t might be represented, not as eight millions, but as eighty millions. The fact is that it is impossible to measure what is inaccurately called the "" g if t . "" The main object of thc tariff is to overcome the competition of all other countries in the world, British as well as foreign; and if the burden put upon the British manufacturer is less than that on the foreigner, that is not a g if t made to Great Britain, it is only an advantage given to certain British exporters and manufacturers which is not given to others. These are individual privileges given to individuals. viduals;. (Cheers.) tives talk about gifts the better. Let me. if I may, through the means of this audience, refer to the subject of the greatest g if t from the Government of Great Britain, and that is the g if t of Imperial defence. In Imperial defence it is still this country which bears the lion's share. In consequence of duties w l i i c h were i m posed by the last schedule, the A u s t r a l i a n and N e w Zealand section of tbe L o n d o n Chamber of Commerce, w r o t e to tbe Sydney Chamber of Commerce, respecti n g the effect of the A u s t r a l i a n t a r if f on B r it is h trade.

The Secretary of the London Chamber of Commerce has now received a letter from Mr ference. J. N . Bell, secretary of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, dated 7th September, stating that the memorandum was referred to a subcommittee of the Chamber, and that the following reply was adopted by the Council of tlie Chamber:"" While we appreciate the action of our Federal and State' Governments in inaugurating an Empire marketing scheme, for the purpose of inducing consumers in the United Kingdom to use more extensively products, we also realize that Australia has Mr Mann. imposed unduly high duties on many imports The fact should not be overlooked that almost all British goods imported from the United Kingdom enjoy preference in the -tariff rates; even so, the duties on most British manufactures still run unreasonably high. We cannot, however, disregard the fact that the volume of imports of manufactured goods into Australia has increased notwithstanding these high duties. So long as Australia continues borrowing money heavily from Great Britain and America and exports its surplus products mainly to Europe, it must accept from these countries imports on a correspondingly high scale-re There is a selection of indigardless of cost. An increasing number of There is no g if t to the nation. Australians is realizing that the abnormal The less Australian representaduties have created an artificial and uneconomic position. The illustration in the London Chamber's report is one of many which could be given. Whether the present duties shall bo maintained or altered is a political question. As Australian people are beginning to see that high duties are largely responsible for the excessive cost of living, also for the abnormally high costs of locally-manufactured goods, the tariff is becoming a live question within the Commonwealth. In many directions throughout Australia strenuous efforts are being made to induce our Federal Parliament to reduce the t a r if fespecially for imports of machinery and other articles used by primary producers. It has been shown that these producers are, because of the tariff, heavily handicapped as compared with similar producers in other countries which compete with Australia in oversea markets. We w ill bring under the notice of our Prime Minister the memorandum of tlie Australian and New Zealand section of the London Chamber, hoping that it w ill induce him and party to view this question in the same light as you do."" It is added that the Council of the Sydney Chamber has approved of a copy of the reply being forwarded to the Bight Hon. S. M . Bruce, the Prime Minister, for his favorable consideration. ExamplesT h e M e l b o u r n e A r g u s of the 2 5 t h No vember, commented o n the present schedule in tbe f o l l o w in g termsMuch has been made by Mr Pratten of the advantage that he is offering the British manufacturer in the shape of additional preHere, again, his policy of taking away with one hand what he gives -vith the other is repeated. Of this there are many notable examples. Leather cloth was, for instance, dutiable at 5 per cent. British preference, and at 10 per cent..and 15 per cent, against the foreigner. The new duties are 20 per cent., 25 per cent., and 35 per cent. No doubt Mr Pratten's generosity w ill be warmly welcomed by the British manufacturers, whose goods w ill be subjected to a duty of 20 per Australian cent, instead of 5 per eent. His compensation is a trifle higher preference against the foreigner. Many other "" concessions "" could be quoted. alterations leads to one conclusion only. It is difficult, if not impossible, to run with the. whole Empire, but the tariff schedule hare and hunt with the hounds. Mr Pratten professes to have framed duties which w ill encourage the Australian manufacturer, and will at the same time enable the British manufacturer to extend his trade relations with the Commonwealth. He increased the duties on a variety of British goods, but at the same time his preferences are slightly increased. No one will be pleased. The entire schedule reveals an utter lack of thought for the consumer. Speaking in the House of Representatives on 11th August, 1920, he said-""British industry was suffering severely owing to importations into Groat Britain of European steel manufactures. The quantity of iron and steel imported into Great Britain last year amounted to approximately 1,500,000 tons, valued at nearly £8,000,000. vasion that was crippling British steel interests also menaced Australia. The Ministry felt that it must do something to meet the competition of the gigantic German steel trust which had been formed to develop the export trade of that country. Members would appreciate the condition of the iron and steel industry in Great Britain owing to German competition and to the disastrous coal strike. Eveni f the strike was settled soon, it would be some time before the British industry would have recovered from the blow. Tn those circumstances tlie Ministry felt that there was no real urgency to deal with the British preference schedules, and that consideration could be postponed until next year. Tie gave a definite promise on behalf of the Ministry that members would have the opportunity of considering British preference rates which should be provided to safeguard the industry against British competition."" Mr Pratten has waited until Great Britain has shown signs of recovering from' the blow of the general strike, and lie thinks that the time has now come to give her another kick. The pity of it is that he should attempt to -excuse his action by hypocritical professions of an earnest desire to foster the trade of the Motherland. One more extract, and I shall have -finished. statedAs to the gesture of increased preference to Britain, this is a mockery. Thus Mr Pratten declared that the preference to British manufacturers of steel rails is increased. This is gratifying, but how? By increasing the duty against those British rails by 15s. a ton, while the general tariff is increased by 25s. a ton. Mr Pratten increases the duty against British rails, so as to keep them out of Australia, and then declares that he has given them a preferonce by making the duty against rails from other countries still higher. If British rails are kept out, what comfort is it to the British manufacturer that other rails are also kept out? Is that preference? The principle of Examination of the whole of tlie Imperial preference must embrace the before us contains specific duties levied admittedly against New Zealand, while the whole history of tariff relations with South Africa, New Zealand, and Canada, as an example of imperial sentiment, is not particularly edifying. One of the most extraordinary statements concerning tbe Government's policy that has come to my hands recently is contained in an official report concerning foreign affairs. These reports are regularly issued by the Prime Minister's Department, and there is a file of them in the Parliamentary Library. This particular report is on that file. It is headed "" Geneva Economic The same inConference,"" and was issued on 9th November, 1927. As I shall show, the attitude of the Government towards tbe Economic Conference has been one of contemptuous disregard. This report circulates among the press, schools, and universities throughout the Commonwealth. The introduction to it rather minimizes the importance of the Geneva Conference so far as Australia is concerned, but it goes on to say, ""Australia's economic policy is based on (1) Self-development, and (2) interimperial free trade and reciprocity."" ""With freetradej there would surely be no need for reciprocity, but still we bave the declaration that tbe Australian policy is inter-imperial free trade. I do not know where tbe policy was framed, or when -approved. I am beginning to wonder how policies are framed, how they get tbeir birth, and how they spring to adult life. I certainly should have no objection to inter-imperial free trade, as part of general free trade, but how can The SydneyE v e n in g News a government be sincere when it issues a statement like this, broadcasts it throughout Australia, and then introduces a tariff schedule increasing tbe duties against British goods? That is a glaring example of the insincerity and unreality of this alleged imperial preference. I should like to know whether the schedule is the outward and visible sign of the inward and spiritual grace of imperial loyalty. If so, it is certainly manifested in a curious way. The Government, by preaching with one voice high protection and with another imperial free trade is making a hopeless attempt to reconcile two mutually destructive policies. What an extraordinarily ungenerous spirit these increased duties indicate. We have taken advantage, of the generosity of the Imperial Government by establishing an Empire Marketing Board, whose object is to carry out a campaign to induce English people to buy Australian goods. A large amount of money has been expended on that project. bave received letters from Englishmen stating that the people of Great Britain are getting thoroughly disgusted because, while meetings are being held there at the instigation of the Australian Government to improve Empire marketing, it is imposing at this end duties against British trade. I bave already referred to the loans issued to us by tbe Imperial Government to further immigration We are asking for and getting every assistance to develop this country, yet our response is a stab at Britisb trade whenever we get the chance. up a trade of our own? tbe proposal to build up an imperial self-contained trade, but I shall deal with that later. If I were the MinisterI sbould not consent to one increase of duty against Britisb goods; The Mother Country is having a difficult time. Wc owe much to her, and we are doing little credit to ourselves by adopting this hostile policy against British trade and industry. but hostile. bonorable member's views, because the tariff policy is distinctly hostile to Great Britain. One has only to refer to the statement by the Minister himself concerning the iron and steel duties that we are just as much concerned in preventing British manufacturers as in preventing foreign manufacturers from doing business with Australia. We are piling the duties to a height which we think will be effective against Britisb trade. That is the first consideration. in tbe past. intention and not of the effect of the tariff. Hostility is rife in this schedule, because its intention is to stop English trade, and it is to-day stopping it to a ' great extent. When that end ha* been achieved then"" tbe higher duties ar^ scheduled against foreign trade. This slogan of imperial preference is like the Trojan horse, fair seeming and friendly in appearance, but containing in its bowels tbe very elements of hostility and bate. Hostility if.

Our whole attitude is bypocritical and insincere. That bas been evident in tbe past, and there is no change to-day. What is the use of such farces as that which, accordI see a grave danger in ing to tbe press, took place at the Manision House a day or so ago, where public men mixed the King's pudding made of Empire products, as part of the propaganda to increase the sale of Empire goods in Great Britain, while we, at this end, are piling up duties to prevent, the expansion of Britisb trade? to develop tbe trade of Australia? obligation to Great Britain, and we depend upon ber for our very existence. As Mr Runciman has said, the great burden of imperial defence is almost wholly borne by Great Britain, and from a sense of loyalty we have no rigbt to repudiate our family obligations by hindering Britisb trade in the way that We are doing. The evil or immorality 'if the protective-system is that it must prevent the entry into this country of 'goods of other countries, and we therefore cannot escape the fact that'we are trying to prevent tbe entry of Britisb goods.

83,Mr Mann,"We owe an immenseEconomic Conference which took place at Geneva in May last. For a long time the efforts of the League of Nations towards effecting international disarmament have admittedly been a disappointment to those who are deeply interested in that project. At' most of these conferences there has been much talk, but little result. Those in the Leagrto itself who have studied this subject bave been gradually forced to tbe conclusion that before physical disarmament can be brought about mental or moral dii-armament, including, of course, commercial disarmament, must first be attained. In consequence increasing efforts have during tbe last two or three years been made by tbe League to bring about international agreement on economi; questions, and last year a preparatory committee was appointed by the Assembly of the League to prepare the way for a great world Economic Conference. It will be remembered that, the agerda for that conference, as suggested by the preparatory committee,, was the subie-ct of discussion in this Parliament over twelve months ago. The committee ob-. tamed a most remarkable collection of d'oomrientary evidence from experts and 1 financiers thronghont the world, supported by the international chambers: of commerce, and the co-operative sureties -cii Europe, representing about 50,000,000 members fn Europe alone.

As I have said, it was purely an advisory conference of experts, and it was understood that tbe subjects were to be discussed without political bias or any view to political advantage. The conference submitted a number of conclusions, two or three of which are most important. One readsAlso, tliat the attempt to attain self-sufficiency is an unattainable ideal for most uations, that it is a mistake to suppose tliat it is always more advantageous for a nation to diminish its imports than to increase its exports, and that "" excessive protection, which reduces national production and purchasing power, in the end defeats its own object."" The report refers, also, to the false ideal of basing revenue upon high duties, wbich, it says, has placed some countries in a precarious position, and continuesThe attempts after tlie war to seek prosperity by a policy of economic isolation, have, lifter an experience of nearly nine years, proved a failure.

As the report is one of the most important issued I wish to discuss the Government's attitude towards the decisions reached, and to the subsequent development of questions arising out of the conference. The conference was supposed to be non-political, and to consist of economic experts. fortunately ,our principal delegate was not permitted to act as a non-political representative. Although the Government was entitled to send five delegates it sent only three, and of that number only one was selected and instructed^ before he left Australia. The other'two were apparently obtained under a method which is becoming rather common, bysecuring the services of two Australians visiting tbe continent.

It was not a political gathering, but was supposed to consist of independent experts considering economic questions. It was an advisory expert committee, and its findings were to be forwarded to the different governments for an expression of opinion. It is wrong for the representatives of the government attending such a conference to be instructed in such a way that they could not have an open mind. Notwithstanding the statement. I have quoted, the findings of tbe conference were unanimous. Every nation signed tbe report. When such an attitude was adopted, how could ourdelegate sign a report which said that we ought to review tbe tariff? But be did sign the report. Tbe important aspect of this matter is that whilst tbe report of the conference has received ""world-wide attention, it bas received very little consideration in Australia.

An announcement has since appeared in the press to the effect that Australia's attitude towards the second conference is to be one of indifference. Since then a conference consisting of S00 delegates of the Chambers of Commerce of tbe world, met at Stockholm, and has unanimously approved the recommendations of the Geneva Conference and submitted a detailed report. Notwithstanding this, the Commonwealth Government has not taken any action to carry out or even show respect to the decisions of sucb an important conference established under tbe auspices of the League of Nations. now before tbe committee, it is exhibiting an utter disregard of the decisions reached at that conference. have taken action? inform the honourable member.

Tlie policy of protection is bad wherever it is enforced; but its effects are becoming more apparent in Australia because it is here being carried to its logical conclusion. sult of tbe adoption of this policy by Australia, and of the operation of the alleged Britisb preference towards Australia, is this:-It is being suggested that the world should be divided into regional tracts, that zollverekis should be formed, one comprising the European area-whic h would be very powerfulanother the continent of America, and a third the British Empire. I ask honourable members to consider the implications. Under sucb a scheme the world would be -divided into three camps that from the outset would be commercially hostile, and that, before very long, would almost certainly become hostile in another sense.

Sucb statements are indicative of the spirit in wbich the affairs an extra tax on the people in this of the Customs Department are ordinarily administered, and of the kind of reception given to those who try to promote trade with other countries. Their profits are scrutinized and their rights questioned, as if they had no rigbt to exist at all; while tbe statements of manu facturers are always taken as true. Those who ask for increased duties are certainly making application for a personal advantage to themselves, even though what they ask may also advantage the country; it. is to increase tbeir proiits or, at any penal rate of pay on work wben other rate, to prevent their profits from diminishing. On the other hand, international trade is a matter of mutual -benefit. That constitutes the difference between the two. tages apply also to local trade?

I notice that -in some Commonwealth departments pre-f'irence is to be given to Australian tenderers over any others. Tbis Parliament determines, through tbe customs tariff, what advantage an Australian industry is to bave over outside -competitors. Tbis Parliament alone has the right to do this, and when action :is taken by other Governments, or by local bodies, in a similar direction, they are usurping the rights of this Parliament. When tbe South Australian Government imposed a tax on petrol tbe Oommonwealth Government took action against it for doing something unconstitutional. Yet it allows the same government to do a similar thing by imposing form. These are extra taxes imposed by authorities in Australia who have not tbe right to impose them. This Government, however, never thinks to take any action in this regard. As a matter of fact, it commits the same offence itself. If the Government allows preference to be given in this way, it is increasing the effect of the duties. Another step has now been taken.

Throughout the history of the world many men bave suffered, because of being ahead of their time, and while the honourable member was propounding his theories of free trade, the thought struck me, that tbe free traders in this country are suffering, of sordid money making ? I ask the honbecause tbey are balf a century behind the time. The speech of the bonorable member would bave made some impression 50 years ago, but it makes none today. He made some remarkable comments on the tariff schedule, which, he said, was framed on a policy of hatred of Great Britain. ordinary statement, because my complaint against tbe tariff schedule is that it disregards Australian industries to give preference to Great Britain. If the honourable member for Perth had been as eloquent in support of Australian industries as he was in advocating trade for Great Britain, he would bave rendered a very much greater service to this country, an important part of which he is representing in this Parliament. After having spent considerable time on a diatribe against tbe Government for its policy of hatred of Great Britain, the honourable member then criticised British statesmenship and eulogized that of Germany, simply because a Ger-' man statesman bad advocated a reduction of tariff, while the statesmen of Great Britain, according to what tbe honourable member told us, were not carrying out the decisions made at Geneva. He also told us that protection was a sordid money-making system, and he took tlie Minister for Trade and Customs, whom I have no doubt can capably defend himself, severely to task, because he had made and if given effect would produce nothing derogatory statements about certain British traders. * If the honourable member in reading the report had quoted about two paragraphs more, he would bave been a little fairer to the Minister. The Minister said that wben in Great Britain, he was entitled to dra*\ a line of demarcation, and he found it distinctly drawn, there being on tbe one side selfish interests, and on the other a predominance of men with Empire vision; so that his remarks about the minority who were selfish and out for profits, I think, were quite true. If it is Great Britain and to criticize some of the British capitalists and their methods, bow much more wrong is it for tbe hororable member for Perth to say that men, who are building up industries iiAustralia, are operating under a system orable member what of the importers. Are they all patriots? Are they pure souled philanthropists that we should give them free opportunity to import goods from anywhere? Are not the importers out for profits too? I admit that we have money-making,, and sordid moneyI t was an extramaking interests to satisfy iu this country. I admit that under our protectionist policy, some manufacturers in Australia have taken toll of the people, but prior to that the importers took toll of the Australian people without giving any service in return. It is our duty to see that when we impose duties to protect the industries of this country and to develop it as a nation, we so hedge tbem around that no one, whether importer or manufacturer, can take toll of our people. Failing that, if we bave to choose between being exploited by importers or by Australian manufacturers, then I prefer to be exploited by our own people. Had the community suflicient wisdom to grant to our Australian Parliament the powers that it should bave under the Constitution, and if effect could be given to what is known in politics as new protection in order to safeguard the ^interests of Australian consumers, then we should have a really genuine, sound and scientific system of protection. The honourable member's remedy is not a remedy at all, buj chaos. He said that tbe protectionist policy has brought about centralization and stimulated industry in tbe cities. I thank him^nfor admitting that it bas stimulated u Australian industries. It is better < 'for tbem to be",43,Tariff Customs And Excise Duties

[8.0],"The.stimulated in the cities of Australia than in the cities of other countries, and while I regret our policy of centralization, I prefer to see people working under reasonable conditions in the cities of Australia than under the sweated conditions of manufacture in the cities of the old world. The bonorable member then told us that in Australia it takes £2,000 to settle a migrant upon the land. Is the protectionist policy responsible for that? I suggest to him that he show the connection between the protectionist policy of this country and the cost of settling immigrants upon tbe land. showing how foolish it is to expect, under our protectionist policy, to settle migrants on the land. necessarily increase the cost of settlement. an immigrant on tbe land is primaril y tlie cost of the land. tionist policy has not increased the cost of land in Australia. member for Perth, also told us that high duties brought about unemployment. He lives in a world of his own. He is away up in the skies with his free trade theories. to look round the cities of Australia and in the provincial centres, and see what is the prime cause of unemployment to-day. find that it is the imports that year after year flow into this country and eventually close down Australian industry. is the cause of unemployment is to misrepresent the position. The tariff schedule that has been placed upon the table by the M in ister is from my point of view as a protectionist, a most attenuated document. pared, as I bave said before, more w i th an eye to Britisb preference than for the protection of Australian industries. While I bave no objection to reciprocal trade with GreatB r it a in and-other countries, I say that it must not be at the expense of Australian industries. I should really like to know what is the Government's policy on the fiscal question, because I am at a loss to understand it . Tbe honourable member for Perth quite surprised me to-day wben he read from a circular"" issued by the Prime Minister's Department. I confess that I had not seen it . In that circular is tbe declaration that the economic policy of Australia is (1) self development, with which I agree; and (2) inter-Imperial free trade and reciprocity. First of all inter-Imperial free trade is a distinct contradiction of reciprocity. When in the name of fortune has this country ever declared for inter-Imperial freeI spoke of that aspect as trade ? I see tbe stamp of inter-Imperial free trade throughout this tariff schedule. Its weakness, and also that of the previous schedule, is tbe weakness of I m perialism-to o much regard for Britisb preference and too little regard for Australian industry. To give some idea of the Prime Minister's outlook on the fiscal The cost of settling question, let me quote from bis remarks on the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) to tbe Budget. He saidI t is. Tbe protecAn additional tariff, barrier would certainly be a means of encouraging inefficiency and of The honourable maintaining conditions under which men can demand hours and wages that are not economically sound. In view of that statement, and that of the bonorable member for Wimmera, ( Mr. I ask bim to come to earth Stewart), respecting the action of the Leader of the Government in the Senatei n entering into a semi-free trade pact in Western Australia prior to the If he does he w i ll last election, it is very difficult to obtain an effective protectionist policy from the Ministry. Tbe view of the other leader in . the team is interesting. Last August To say that h i g h' protection the Treasurer told the settlers and farmers of New South Wales that lower wages and lower tariffs would prove more protective to Australian workers and industries. The honourable member for Perth said, during the course of his speech, It has been prethat he feared that he was making no impression upon the Minister. I sincerely hope that his fear was well founded. I believe that the Minister is a protectionist, but too much impression bas already been made upon him.

Tbe result is that tbe wagon is creaking and nearly broken, and tbe team is afflicted witb spavin, windgall and stringhalt, so far as the tariff is conThe suggestion has been made that, when cerned. We cannot expect any progress in tbe protectionist policy, especially when the Treasurer, co-partner with the Prime Minister in the Government of this country, says that we should get more protection for our workers and industries by having lower wages and lower tariffs, which be believes would reduce cost of production and enable us to compete successfully with the world. It sounds well in theory to those who theorize and ignore realities. If we were starting among tbe nations from scratch, our onlyconcern would be to see that wages and conditions were such as to enable the' workers to enjoy the comforts of life. The theory of deflation, if applied to-day"", Are they, like thc Avorkers, prepared to would immediately bring us up against realities. What are the realities? They are that *we have a burden of Commonwealth and State debts on which a fixed interest of £50,000,000 a year has to be paid. In addition there are private borrowings on which, roughly, another £100,000,000 a year has to be paid. . Tbese interest rates are fixed for long periods, and if what is called the policy of deflation is introduced we shall be playing into tbe hands of persons receiving a fixed, unalterable rate of interest on their bonds and other securities during the term of the loans. By halving the cost of commodities and reducing the wages to tbe same extent we would double tbe value of tbeir interest. demand for deflation are the persons responsible for inflation. profiteers, who during the war inflated the cost of everything. Prices having been built up, wages bad to try to follow. As the honourable member for Perth( Mr is Mann) said, wages went up tbe stairs and prices went up the elevator. Tbese people inflated prices and made huge profits by profiteering methods and scandalous lack of patriotism during the nation's agony. Tbey invested their ill-gotten gains while men were suffering in the trenches. They 3tr. Scullin. waved the flag whilst they made their profits, which they invested in long-dated loans at fixed rates of interest. Now they wish to bring down prices and wages so that the purchasing power of their returns in the form of interest may be increased. customs duties are increased, the workers should not ask for higher wages, irrespective of Avhether they have a just claim or not. Tbat suggestion is made in portions of the Tariff Board's report. Let me say, in reply, that Avages are fixed and determined by tribunals in Australia, based, presumably, first of all as a basic Avage, upon the cost of living, to Avhich an addition is made for skill. At any rate, Avages are determined by a tribunal. I should like to ask those gentlemen Avho say that the Avorkers have no right to submit their claims to a tribunal, what tbey would think of a tribunal to fix the prices tbe Avorkers have to pay. go 'before a tribunal which shall determine a fair price or profit? Of course, they are not. It is fallacious to say that the Avhole of our customs duties are a charge upon the people. They are to some extent, but not to the full extent. We receive, roughly, £30,000,000 a year in customs duties. This, some say, is the price Ave pay for protection. That is incorrect, because in the first place a large percentage bf that amount is not paid at all by the consumers of Australia, but by the importers and manufacturers of foreign goods. There is evidenceI am not going to quote it as the Minister bas placed it on record, but I and others have seen it recorded in many instances-that the imposition of customs duties has in Those loudest in their many cases brought about a reduction in prices charged in Australia. I Avill not I refer tc the claim that that is true in every instance; but it justifies a reduction from the £30,000,000. Then, again, approximately £13,000,000 of the £30,000,000 frankly admitted to consist of revenue duties quite apart from excise duties Avhich reduces the amount of protective duties to £15,000,000, of Avhich a fair percentage is not a charge at all upon the Australian consumer. Another percentage is Avhat Ave are paying fpr the right to get work in our own country, for developing oui own industries and keeping our own people employed. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that this is not an occasion for a general debate on the tariff The fiscal issue has been thoroughly threshed out, and irrespective of what any one says to the contrary, protection has become the settled policy of Australia. It is necesthe Minister had followed very closely sary, however, to examine the schedule closely and to particularize in some instances, because there is. a great need for industry of Australia, one of our foundaa revision of many of the items and an urgent need for immediate application of such revision. There should not be any delays or adjournments, but we sbould as quickly as possible proceed to discuss tbe items. I propose not to speak at length at this juncture, but to examine some of the items in the hope that some impression may be made upon tbe Minister, and that wben the items nre reached some amendments will be made in the interests of Australian industries. Let me give some illustrations. I do not intend to cover in detail the ground which the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) will traverse; but I should like to refer to the iron and 65s. general remain. In respect of item steel industry, which has been exhaustively inquired into by the Tariff Board. Probably no more exhaustive inquiry has been made into any industry for a longer period. Attention bas been called to it again and again in a forceful manner by honourable members, and particularly by the bonorable member for Newcastle, who represent a very important part of Australia in which this important industry is situated. It was my good fortune to visit tbe works quite recently. I do not claim to be an expert, but as an ordinary interested observer I consider that tbe plant at Newcastle is one of the best and most complex we bave in this land of ours. There cannot be anything much better in any part of tbe world. It is an industry which we should strain every effort to keep going. It is in competition with a huge European combine. The war had no sooner terminated than overtures were made by the great iron and steel masters of Germany, Prance and Belgium for co-operation? tb exploit the world's markets. Tbey have succeeded to-day in exploiting the British market. They have their agents in Britain, and foreign manufactured goods are sent to Britain to be finished off, and then exported to Australia as British articles entitled to come in under a preferential duty. That is what the Australia iron and steel industry is competing with at present. I was given to understand that tbe Government or the recommendations of the Tariff Board, but in turning to this big key tion industries, I find that the Government has not followed the board's recommendations. Take, for example, item 130 (a) relating to pig iron. The Tariff Board's recommendations were 30s. British preference, 40s. intermediate and 45s. general. The schedule shows that no alteration has been made. The old rates remain: 20s. British preference, 30s. intermediate, and 40s. general. Take item 136 b, ingots, blooms, &c. The Tariff Board's recommendation was 52s., British preference, 72s. intermediate and 140s. general. There has been no alteration, and tbe old rates of 32s. British preference, 52s. intermediate and 136 c, bar, rod, red, angle and tee iron, the recommendation of the board was 75s. British preference, 95s. intermediate and 150s. general. The rates in this schedule are 70s. British preference, 100s. intermediate, and 120s. general. In respect of item 152 a iron and steel tubes or pipes, the board recommended that "" on and after 30th June, 1926, the duties should be 50 per cent. Britisb preference, 60 per cent, intermediate and 75 per cent, general."" The schedule shows that the date has been altered U» "" on and after 1st January, 1929.""

The board recommended a duty of 60s. Britisb preference, 85s. intermediate and 150s. general per ton, but tbe schedule shows duties of 50s., 85s., and 100s. respectively. Under rails less than 50 lb., the board recommended 70s. British preference, 95s. intermediate and 160s. general, whilst the schedule provides for 45s., 100s. and 125s. however, we are dealing with very shrewd respectively. In regard to item 154c, fish plates, tie plates and rods, the board recommended duties of 75s. British preference, 85s. intermediate and 180s. general, whereas the duties set down in the schedule are 48s., 100s. and 125s. reserted and the finished garment was prospectively. In the case of rails of 50 lb. or over, the recommendation is for a British preferential duty of schedule provides only 50s. For rails less than 50 lb. the board recommended a preference duty of 70s. and the schedule prowere valued at £6,0*00 in 1925-26 vides for only 45s. In the case of fish plates, tie plates and rods the recommendation of the board is a preference duty of 75s. whereas the schedule provides for a preference duty of only 4bs. The same disparity exists practically through the whole schedule. Tariff Board? argue that the Government should slavishly accept the recommendations of the board. That would be an absurd position to take up, I suggest, however, that when a Minister introduces a tariff schedule, which differs to such an extent from the Tariff Board's recommendations as this one does, be should at least explain to the committee tbe reason for tbe disparity. After all, the board recommends to this Parliament, and the Government sbould pay some regard to its recommendations otherwise it should disband the board. If the board recommends certain duties to this Parliament and the Government in its wisdom or otherwise or for reasons of political expendiency does not follow the recommendations of the board, the Minister should explain tbe reason. I expect him to do so in regard to a number of the items. 105 aa, wbich covers knitted goods. Last year Parliament imposed a very substantial duty upon tbese. goods and rendered what it thought a very good service ta the trade. To a large extent our acitem 154 b tion appeared effective as the manufactures of knitted goods were for a time progressing. When we are dealing with foreign manufacturers and importers, people. These people found an important loophole in the tariff of 1926, through which they brought in piece goods knitted in tubular form, which only had to be cut into lengths, a few stitches induced. It is now proposed to remove this loophole, because it has been shown that importations have been coming in 60s. a ton, whereas the through it from Britain and Japan. In 1924-25 the importations of cotton piece goods in tubular form, at £72,000; and in 1926-27 at £175,000. By sending tbe goods out in that form, the oversea manufacturers defeated the intention of this Parliament, as expressed in the 1926 tariff. From July to September of. tbe present year the value of the imports of these goods wasSilk piece goods in tubular form .. £4,000 Artificial silk piece goods in tubular form .. 44,000 Cotton piece goods in tubular form 95,000 That rising tide of imports furnishes a cause of our industries going to tbe wall. Tbe duties proposed in the schedule represent about one-half of what the industry asked for. I repeat that the Government is not bound to give all that is sought; but it must be conceded that some explanation ought to be forthcoming as to wby it has been cut in half. Tbe fatal feature of the item, however, is that the duty is to be deferred until July, 1928.

In the face of that, what explanation does the Minister offer of the proposal to defer the operation of the new duty for a further seven months? I admit that he cannot prevent shrewd men, who keep themselves apprised of the trend of events, from anticipating what goods are likely to be protected and what are not. tbey make a few mistakes by importing goods upon which the duty is not increased, tbey lose only the interest for the time being on the amount they have invested; but, on the other hand, when they correctly gauge the position they are enabled to increase tbeir profits as the result of tbe increased duty. ber criticized tbe Government because it did not follow the report of the Tariff Board in respect to iron and steel. In fairness to tbe Government, it should be mentioned that the proposal to which he now takes exception was recommended by tbe Tariff Board. admit my having said that I did not expect the Government to follow slavishly tbe reports of tbe Tariff Board; but when it declines to do so it should give the reason. I should have refused to adopt the report of tbe Tariff Board to defer this duty; and I could give sound reasons for my refusal to any Parliament that wished to protect an Australian industry. There is an aspect of this matter which has been overlooked. Before the mills put anything on the looms they seek orders. In January of each year they take orders for articles that will be required for the ensuing summer trade. Next January they will seek orders for the 1928 summer trade. What hope will they have of obtaining any orders when there is a deferred duty on these goods that will not come into operation until July next? Japanese au opportunity to send their goods here. goods from Japan will be able to fill their warehouses with those ""goods. «If this is a duty that ought properly to be imposed, the Ministry should allow it to operate from tbe moment it was tabled. Wben tbe Australian millers seek orders next January for the followingsummer's trade they will find every warebouse filled with imported goods from the cellar to the garret. It will be two years at least before the Australian industry will derive any benefit from this duty, and in the meantime it will probably go to tbe wall. The biggest hosiery and underwear spinners and weavers in Eveni f Australia-Georg e Bond and Co. Limited, of Sydney-hav e gone into voluntary liquidation. Tbat may not be due entirely to importations, but I believe I shall be safe in asserting that they are largely responsible for the difficulties in which that firm finds itself. Tbe flood of imports bas affected that industry just as it has affected many others. One of the stated reasons for the liquidation is that the banks will not advance further moneys."" If that firm could turn into cash the goods it has produced tbe banks would not be asked to advance further moneys. profit of over £50,000 net during each of two recent years? pended on its works. : ber for Franklin( Mr Seabrook) probably knows that a firm may go into liquidation and yet be able to pay a great deal more than 20s. in the £ 1 / It may show a handsome profit wben its goods are being sold, and ytt be unable to finance the business in the event of failure to sell.

George Bond and Company may be worth not less than 30s. in the £1. I believe the firm made a profit of over £60,000 in one year, and £50,000 in another, and I have no doubt that if it could now sell its goods it could make a profit of £50,000 this year. We are passing through a period of financial stringency, and if the banks will not advance the money necessary to enable it to carry on until it can sell its goods, there is no other course open to it than to go into voluntary liquidation.

Wilkinson, managing director of tbe Globe Worsted Mills, Marrickville, who returned last October from a visit to Great Britain and tbe United States of America. He points out that balf of tbe machinery in tbe textile industry in Great Britain is idle, and says that the depression is due to the importation of cheap worsted and other articles from Belgium and Germany. I have not' the slightestdoubt that Australia is importing large quantities of those cheap commodities from Belgium and Germany, under the British preferential tariff, and with tbe label "" British goods "" attached. Whatever action was taken it would not prevent that sort of thing. With a high duty under tbe general tariff, and a low one under the British, there is the temptation to cheat, and foreign manufacturers will always take advantage of it. I wish also to direct the attention of the Minister to the item "" Timber,"" and I believe that in this I shall bave tbe support of the honourable member for Eranklin. The difference between honourable members who sit on this side and some bonorable members opposite is that we are protectionists with respect to all Australian industries, not alone for thost that are in our own electorates or onr own States. There are no forests in my electorate; there are a few old red gums on the river flats, and that is all; but I, nevertheless, wish to see our timber industry encouraged. I bave a passing knowledge of certainly of Victorian forests: There* is no important part of our Victorian forests in which I have not been. I lived my young life in the bush, and took an interest in our timbers'. One of my saddest contemplations, looking back over a period of 25 or 30 years, is the sinful waste that bas taken place of our beautiful Australian hardwoods. Little encouragement is given to the utilization of our barwoods, but on the other hand, we import every year millions of feet of timber that in most cases is not tbe equal of, and in the balance of cases, is certainly not superior to, our own. The hardwood industry is an important one. There are over 100 mills, Mr Scullin. about 75 of which are operating at the present time, employing probably 1,600 men. If they were doing normal business, they would be employing a number approaching to 3,000. The saw-milling industry bas to contend. against very keen competition. In this schedule an attempt is made to protect it, and in so far as it relates to oregon, it meets with my approval. That is one of the bright spots in the schedule; so far as the timber industry is concerned, it is the only bright spot. Buti f it is desired to protect Australian timbers, why not place an effective duty on all imported timbers, and not confine it to oregon? Japanese oak is a serious competitor of our Australian woods; so, also, is Pacific maple and Borneo cedar. Why not include those in tbe schedule? Japanese oak competes with Tasmanian oak and Australian blackwoods. . The importations of that timber in 1921 amounted to 4,300,000 super feet, and in 1926 to 6,600,000 super feet, an increase of 2,300,000 super feet. It is remarkable, however, that the value dropped from £175,000 in 192.1 to £135,000 in 1926, a decrease of £40,000; showing that the cheap labour of Japan has become cheaper, whilst our standard of labour has remained at relatively the same level, since 1921. There is no hope of an Australian industry competing on those terms. The old duty on all timbers was 3s. British preferential, 3s. intermediate, and 4s. general. The new proposal, which applies to Oregon only, is 8s. in each case. Tbat would be all right if Australian, it were not confined to Oregon. It will be found that hemlock, spruce, and other timbers will take the place of oregon as a competitor of our timbers, with tbe result that the local industry will again be , without protection. I would like to hear what explanation can be offered of what, appears to me an inexplicable anomaly. Item 291 ( H ) reads: "" Timber, undressed, in sizes less than 7 inches by 2$ inches-(1 ) Oregon,"" British preferential tariff lis., intermediate lis., general l is . In the existing tariff Item 291 ( L ) , "" Timber, dressed, n.e.i.,"" bearing duties of 6s., 7s. 6d., and 8s. 6d., is unaltered. The effect of that is that undressed oregon in sizes less than 7 inches' by 2^ inches will have to bear a duty of l is . ; but if it comes in dressed it will be origin. Notwithstanding the assistance admitted at duties varying from 6s. to Ss. 6d. One would imagine that when more labour bad been added to the article it wouia"" bear a higher duty. properly arranged schedule. orable member that this is not a properly arranged schedule. glaring that I can only attribute it to an oversight, which I hope will be rectified. Some people may say that tbe prices being charged for Australian hardwood are so high that imported timbers will be able to compete witb them. I find, however, that whereas the price of Australian hardwood has increased only Is. per 100 super, feet since 1921-fro m 28s. to 29s. -tb e price of Oregon has fallen from 40s. to 29s.; so that whilst the Australian timber had a natural protection of 12s. in 1921, to-day there is no margin in its favour. Mr A. Nichol, secretary of the North-western Millers Association, said in tbe course of a published statementIt had heen agreed that if the tariff was into-day. The local companies asked for creased on Baltic pine and foreign hardwoods, there would be no increase in prices. He also said that tbe proposal to increase the duty on Oregon only had created consternation amongst those engaged in the industry, and I can quite believe that it did. I turn 'now to the smaller but, nevertheless, very important industry of smallware weaving. operating in this industry, tbe capital employed is £100,000, the annual bill for wages and salaries is £131,000, and about 200 persons are employed. Tbe largest of tbese is tbe Australian Weaving Company at Collingwood, Victoria, which in 1910 pioneered this industry. I would like honourable members to pay a visit to that mill. They would spend a most interesting couple of hours, and would appreciate tbe enterprise of 'its founders. Prior to 1910 all the articles now manufactured in that and the two other Australian mills, were imported. while tbe local industry did very well; but a slump came after the war, when the manufacturers abroad did everything possible to recover their trade. They were prepared to, and did, sell articles' much below the cost price in the country of [95] given by the Industries' Preservation Act, or the anti-dumping duties, that process continues, tbe prices quoted in Australia being lower than those, in the United Kingdom. Tbe products of this iudustry are covered in the existing tariff by item 107A, "" Woven materials, badges, hat and cap fronts, medal ribbons, loopings for boots and shoes, labels and bangers, &c."" The anomaly is so The old duties were 35 per cent. Britisb preferential, 40 per cent, intermediate, and 50 per cent, general. In this schedule the British preferential tariff is unaltered, the intermediate tariff bas been increased to 45 per cent., and tbe general tariff to 60 per cent. The serious flaw in.this re-arrangement is the failure to increase tbe British preferential duty, although the principal competition comes from the United Kingdom. Large quantities of imports from Germany, Switzerland, Czecho-Slovakia and Holland are re-boxed in England by agents of the foreign manufacturers, and sent to Australia. The result is that many looms in the Australian mills are idle duties of 45 per cent. British preferential, 55 per cent, intermediate, and 65 per cent, general. Tbe request put beforethe Tariff Board referred to ""-woven and embroidered materials,"" but in this schedule the word, ""embroidered "" is omitted. That means that embroidered materials will come under item 106B, and will be subject to duties Three companies are of 15 per cent. Britisb preferential, and 25 per cent, general. "" Slipper, shoe, and blazer bindings"" bave been taken from Item 404, and bave not been included elsewhere in the schedule. Tbe trade suggests that those bindings also should be included in item 107A. I am informed that one firm in England, thc name of which I can furnish to the Minister, is quoting these articles at half tbe price at which it was selling them in Great Britain. A short time ago it was reconstructed after going bankrupta fate that is not surprising if it is dumpFor a ing goods in Australia at half the price at which it can sell on the home market. The local industry should be protected against this unfair competition. I draw the attention of the Minist tr to Item 384, panchromatic dry plates. The old duties on these were 25 per t ent.",49,Tariff Customs And Excise Duties

232,Mr Scullin,"I agree with the honBritisli preferential, 30 per' cent, intermediate, and 35 per cent, general. Under the new schedule this photographic material will be admitted free from the United Kingdom, and will bear duties of 15 per cent, and 20 per cent, under the intermediate and general tariffs respectively. The Kodak Company Proprietary, of Collingwood, bas asked that the old duty be restored, or that the item be omitted from this schedule. It is suggested that the new duties are based upon a misconception. Eighteen months ago inquiries were made by tbe department to ascertain if tbe Kodak Company was manufacturing panchromatic plates, and the answer was that experiments with tbem were being conducted, but tbey were not then being produced for sale. Since that time tbe firm has succeeded in producing large quantities of these plates, which are giving satisfaction to their customers. inquiry has been made by tbe department, and the company, not anticipating that this item would be altered, made no representations to the Tariff Board. All that it is asking now is that tbe old duty be continued. I am informed that panchromatic plates can be substituted for tbe dry plates ordinarily used for photography. If tbey were admitted free, they would compete with ordinary dry plates, and there would be a reduced output by a department that now employs 500 hands. The Kodak Company now manufactures 90 per cent, of all sensitive materials used by photographers in Australia, and a serious blow will be struck at this industry if panchromatic plates from the United Kingdom are placed oil the free list. The last item to wbicb I wisb to refer at this stage is 204 "" aluminium cooking utensils,"" the British preferential tariff on which has been increased from 25 per oent. to 35 per cent., ancl tbe general tariff town of Mildurai f the products of tbe from cent. Those in the trade are satisfied with the duty in tbe general tariff, but I am informed that some branches of the looal industry will be compelled to close if not. given greater protection against Great Britain, from which the principal competition comes. As tbe general tariff is being increased by 25 per cent., I sugMr Scullin. gest that tbe British preferential tariff be increased by 20 per cent., and so enable a struggling industry to carry on. Prom bis utterances, the Minister appears to be by conviction a protectionist; but this schedule is not soundly protectionist. I realize that the honourable gentleman experiences difficulties owing to the coalition in the ministerial party of free traders, protectionists and revenue tariffists. For instance, the honourable member for Perth announced himself, a free trader, and then said that more revenue would be raised by a free trade tariff than by a protectionist one. Tbe free traders and semi-free traders in tbe Ministry and on tbe Government benches are never tired of condemning Australian industries, and slandering Australian workers. Foreign goods seem to be tlieir delight, and they have a passion for cheapness. I asked the honourable memI n the interval no further ber for Perthi f he advocated absolute free trade, and he replied in the affirmative. Asked how he would bring it about, be said that he would reverse our present policy; in other words, be would step backwards. Do the advocates of free trade ever contemplate what would be tbe effect of introducing their policy into Australia ? It would mean the scrapping of the machinery in our factories, because they could not possibly carry on, and their buildings would be utilized as storehouses for foreign goods that would come from all parts of tbe world. The cheapest and nastiest labour one could imagine would be producing those goods, and we would be using tbem whilst our own people were turned into hewers of wood and drawers of water. tbe primary industries? fruits industry fare under a free trade policy? What would happen to the fine 35 per ' cent. to 60 per district surrounding it bad to compete with those of cheap-labour Mediterranean countries? Tbe dried fruits industry, sugar-growing, and other primary industries have been fostered and maintained by protective duties. But the honourable member for Perth advises us that the discarded and discredited policy of free trade, whicli no State in tbe Common-",51,Tariff Customs And Excise Duties

234,Mr Scullin,"Ho w would the driedwealth would revert to, is a new and a better system. I am reminded of the linesFaith, fanatic faith , once wedded fast To some dear falsehood, hugs it to the last. member pointed out, that our indirect Traders of tbe old world are struggling to recover from the effects of the war; their industries bave been reconstructed, and they have progressed sufficiently to be serious competitors witb each other. While engaged in the war, B r it a in lost much of her trade; but her industries are becoming restored, and competition is in progress between ber and tbe continent, ancl between the various continental countries. The struggle is keen ancl brutal, ancl Australia w ill be made a dumping ground for tbe exportable surpluses of Europei f we do not adequately protect onr industries. Our imports last year, as honourable members heard many times during the budget debate, exceeded our imports, and the arrivals in tbe country also exceeded tlie departures by 40,000. Therefore, we are in the position of im porting more goods than we export, and importing workers to do work bere while sending work abroad. If that policy is persisted in , serious depression must come, bringing with it dislocation in trade and disaster to the people. -The* committee sbould consider caref u l l y the proposed alterations of the tariff submitted by the Minister, and ought not to complain when honourable members take advantage of the opportunity now afforded for reviewing the economic and financial position of tbe country. It may be f a i r l y contended that economic problems dominate our national life, and determine tbe means by which we carry on the various operations essential to the welfare and progress of the community. The honourable member for Perth this afternoon dealt at some length with the position in which Australia finds herself to-day. W it h much that he said I can agree; from some of his statements, and particularly from his diagnosis and conclusions, I dissent very strongly. When he said that this country was taxed too highly, l do not think that any man would deny that he was right. If we took a referendum of the people on that question, it would be decided in the affirmative with loud acclamation. It is the only subject on which tbe people are likely to have an undivided opinion. Unhappily, it is true, as the honourable taxation has jumped fro m £13,000,000, in 1918-19, to £44,000,000, in 1926-27, and has doubled since 1919-20. It was then £22,000,000, and is now £44,000,000. It is a melancholy reflection upon the vanity of human wishes, and the limitations wbicb tbe Deity imposes on human ambitions, that this sbould have occurred during the regime of the Grovernment of which the present Treasurer is a distinguished member. He assumed office to reduce taxation, and that is tbe result! The honourable member for Perth has pointed to the consequences of excessive taxation upon industry. I , myself, had the honour of drawing the attention of the Treasurer to that a week or so ago. I quoted the Treasurer's own words to the effect that inevitably industry must be hampered when called upon to pay excessive taxation, because in such circumstances, tbe f r u c t if y in g stream of capital without which industry cannot bear f r u it abundantly, was diverted from its proper channels. Our present standard of livin g cannot be continued without an abundance of capital. This is true, not only of this country, but of tbe civilized world, and particularly of that part of it which was engaged in the Great War, and has to bear tbe heavy burdens wbicb it imposed. We bave evolved a high standard of living, and in order that we shall produce .sufficient, an abundance of capital is necessary. Therefore, anything which diverts capital, tbe bandmaiden of industry, from its proper uses is inimical to the welfare of the country. So much for that. Now we come to the diagnosis of tbe honourable member for Perth. He says that the cause of tbe existing depression, and of the ominous rumblings wbich fill us with misgivings of failure in industry, is the country's policy of protection. He instanced two or three firms that have closed, or are on the point of closing, dismissing their employees, and sending thousands of men and women; shortly before the festive season of Christmas, to j o in the ranks of the unemployed. It is a bleak",52,Tariff Customs And Excise Duties
235,Mr Hughes (North Sydney) [9.1].,"outlook for tliose people. But is protection the cause of their misfortunes? According to the honourable member protection is a parasitical growth, and tbe only proper occupation for us is what be calls primary industry. I do not agree with that. I pointed out my objections at some length last year, so that it is only necessary now to say that the honourable gentleman ignores fundamental facts. His view, wbich professed to be all-embracing, was confined to one narrow portion of the stage of human activity. He forgot the age in which he lives. His mind is riveted to tbe past. There was a time when people believed that the sun went round the earth, and there are some who, so far as their economic opinions are concerned, still maintain a like doctrine. Notwithstanding all proofs to tbe contrary, some still believe that tbe world is flat. So the honourable member considers that what is wrong economically is that the world is too highty industrialized, and that the way to political salvation is to follow the ""back to the land"" cry of some new Peter the Hermit. Those who are loudest in their denunciation system, and eternally urging men to go on the land, almost do it while enjoying the snug comfort of a great city. It is witb the utmost reluctance that they bring themselves even so far into the country as Canberra. There was a time when the bulk of the world's population was settled on the land. Will any one say that it was a better time to live in than now? When all were settled on the land, it was because there was no other way in which tbey could live. The methods of production were so primitive that only by consistent toil, from early morn to dewy eve, could a livelihood be won. That was the agricultural age, the elysium which the bonorable member regrets, and to which be bids us return. What he does not recognize is that now we are living in the machine age; that man has wrested from nature her most cherished secrets; that be is now able to produce in one day as much as once took weeks. Tbe bulk of mankind was then' compelled to grow food. and a few can now produce all the food Mr Hughes. that the many require. If most of our people were now to direct their attention to the production of food, as nine-tenths of them were doing even as little as 100 years ago, we should have a glut of primary products, which would prove beyond doubt that farming did not pay. Tbe gamut of men's requirements and demands is limited by tbeir circumstances; it is now immensely extended beyond tbe limits of a century ago, and is being further extended every day. We now require a thousand things unknown to our ancestors-pianos , motor cars, radios and picture films-and men released from the necessity of producing food are engaged in making them. The honourable member fails to understand that tbe world as we know it to-day differs very greatly from tbe world as it was. He does not understand that society to-day is a wonderful and complex thing; that wealth is being poured out so lavishly that the life of a poor man is more richly endowed today than was that of a nobleman in the 12th century. It is literally true that -the workers of this country are better of the present fiscal off than many in the middle classes in England of to-day. I am not invariably saying that this is rigbt or that it is wrong. Tbis is not a* court of ethics; we are here to deal with facts. Nowi t is a fact that the tendency of humanity to congregate in great cities is world-wide. It is not a feature of life in protectionist countries alone, but is more noticeable in the highly civilized countries than in those at a less advanced stage. England is a free trade country. It was once an agricultural country, but it is now dependent for three-fourths of its food requirements on overseas supplies. America has protection. By reason of its circumstances and its vast extent, there is naturally a bigger proportion of its population settled on tbe land. But that country, in which an ever diminishing proportion of the people is engaged in rural industries, has made itself a force in world politics by means of its great cities and the wealth that has been But those days have passed built up by the very system which the honourable member has denounced. Let us consider also tlie position of Eussiaan agricultural country. Tliere the people for all practical purposes are where they were 50 or 100 years ago, and probably' where they will be in 100 years to come. It cannot' for one moment be said that tbeir condition is due solely to tbe new fangled phase of government known as the Soviet system. It was the same under tbe Czars. Tbe bulk of the population of Russia is settled on the land. The standard of living there is low; the standard of culture, of education, is low. The condition of tbe people in agricultural Russia and in free trade England will not bear comparison with that of tbe people of this country. It is clear that protection is not the prime cause of the troubles that exist in Australia. These are. general; they prevail everywhere; even in free trade England, where agriculture is neglected, and in Russia where it is the principal industry. I shall not pretend that protection is a panacea for all industrial ills, or that it is more than a means to an end. Buti t certainly does afford an energetic, versatile and industrial people an opportunity to express themselves. It affords them a wider sphere for ambition. It gives them an opportunity to exercise that skill that is characteristic of our race. If I were asked what was the immediate cause of our present troubles I should say-apar t from our own sins-the sins of tbe Government-that it was the effect of the war. In our case, this bas been accentuated by excessive taxation, by the unfavorable balance of trade which has been responsible for pouring into Australia £19,000,000 worth of imports in excess of exports and so depressed the local markets and thrown large numbers of people out of employment. We must add to these excessive borrowing and Government extravagance, both of which have exceeded all previous records-and the violation of the principle which should govern all administration, that those who raise the money should spend it, perhaps the most effective check upon extravagance. Jf one government raises money_ and another spends it, Parliament is helpless. It cannot criticize expenditure, or if it does tbe are settled by other methods. In England answer is made that tbe money has been handed over to another government for purposes that are entirely proper, and that is the end of it. But apart from these things for which we are responsible, tbe effects of the war overshadow all. It has impoverished the world; we have felt its repercussion in this distant land. Australia suffers because the world is very poor. The honourable member for Perth spoke as though Eng-. land were a paradise. It is not. As thougb low wages were a cure for all economic ends; as if tbe workers ef this country were indulging in a senseless scramble for high wages without regard to circumstances; and as if , by some hocus pocus or reversal of the natural order of things, the position could be made different if wages were drastically cut down. It is clear be does not understand the position. What is the trouble in England? Last year a long drawn out industrial dispute there, culminated in the greatest industrial crisis in the history of the world. For a few days the industrial and commercial life of Great Britain was brought to a stand-still. What was the cause of that trouble ? Tbe coal-miners, as we know, were asked to work for less than what they thought a fair and reasonable wage. Consequently they went on strike. Protection was not responsible for that. The bonorable member for Perth also denounced the Arbitration Court. I remind him that tbe Arbitration Court bad nothing to do with the industrial upheaval in Great Britain. I am not blaming any one for what happened in tbe Mother Country. I am merely stating the indisputable fact that it is impossible for tbe coal mining industry to prosper unless coal can be placed on tbe surface at a cost below the selling price, whether the policy of the country be protection or free trade. The honourable member does not appreciate the fact that arbitration is not primarily responsible for the industrial unrest that is troubling Australia to-day. Arbitration deals with effects of industrial unrest; over the basic causes it has no control. America has not set up a system of arbitration for tbe settlement of industrial disputes. Strikes, wben they occur there, also there are no industrial courts, but industrial turmoil occurs there from time to time. Arbitration is merely a means of dealing with disputes; if there are no arbitration courts there is no alternative but strikes. I do not pretend that the tariff is without flaw. I question if the Minister would say that it is; every human institution bas its defects; but tbe duty of this Parliament is to decide what is the best policy for this country. The honourable member for Perth railed against indirect taxation. His remarks in that connection were most disappointing to me. By a process of reasoning entirely his own he showed that it would be possible to get more money for governmentalpurposes from a revenue tariff than from customs duties. people would not be so great. if the high cost of living is due to customs taxation, then the greater the customs revenue the higher must be the cost of living. I do not champion indirect taxation, but think it perbaps a. necessary evil. If tbe tariff is really effective in protecting our industries it will not bring in . much revenue. of living in Australia is due to the high standard of living enjoyed by remedy? A lower standard of living? world? Is it too rich, or too poor? Is it not a fact that, if the people of Europe were better off than they are, that is to say, if they now enjoyed the prosperity which was theirs before the war, it would be a very good thing for Australia ? The honourable member for Perth speaks about production. him.: to production, that there must be an effective demand. People do not produce merely, for the sake of producing. They produce in order to sell at a profit; if they are to achieve their purpose, there must be buyers. cannot be an effective demand for any commodity unless tbe people have the means wherewith to purchase it, in tbe form of money or its equivalent. It follows, therefore, that the greater the effective demand the greater the impetus to production. Australia, with its 6,000,000 people, enjoying a high standard of living, creates a more effective demand for goods than do any other 6,000,000 people in the world, not even excepting the people of America. Certainly the demand they create is greater than any 6,000,000 of people in England or Russia which, according to the argument of the honourable member for Perth, sbould be a paradise, because there practically everybody is on the land-a t all events, all but those who have not been put under it by the Soviet Government. To reduce wages is to weaken tbe mainspring of industry. I fail to see how, by reducing the standard of living we are going to stimulate industry. If it were possible to raise the people of all burden on the countries to our own -standard of living, that, perhaps, would be a great step towords the peace of tbe world, and certainly towards the happiness and prosperity . of mankind. The most effective way to stimulate production is to create the demand. Production does spring, ab initio, out of nothing. It starts in response to a demand. Taking industiy by and large, we can lay it down The high cost as a sound axiom that an effective demand is a condition precedent to production and an effective demand amongst the great our people. What is the mass of tbe people is measured by tbeir wages, and what those wages will buy. I What is the matter with the say emphatically that, no matter what, may be tbe cost of living in Australia, tbe wages of tbe working man here are higher and his conditions are better than in any other country, not even excepting America. The honourable member cannot, on a quiet review of the position, convince members of this Parliament, or any one Let me say this to else, that there is any practical alternaI t is a condition precedent tive to our present fiscal policy. If tbe 6,000,000 of people in Australia turn their .backs on what has rightly come to be regarded as the national policy of this country, what would be tbe position? It is customary for some people to speak of There Australia as if it were under a ban, and avoided by other countries as thougb smitten with a plague. Yet no other country bas advanced in population and wealth so rapidly during the last 25 years. And it has achieved its present remarkable position under a policy of protection. I do not deny that there are defects in our fiscaTsystem. AllI say is that it is",53,Tariff Customs And Excise Duties

I do not deny that instances of this can be cited. and large it is tbe best policy for this country. Tliere is no sucb thing as a perfect policy. But I point out to tbe honourable member for Perth that he has not been able to show us one progressive country that has not tbe policy of protection. It is perfectly true that England adopted free trade, and that it served her well for a time, but that many industries would not do better under protection is now tbe conviction of many of ber leading men. ""We all admire tbe splendid character of tbe British. that Great Britain under a colossal burden, and we wish most devoutly that her' conditions wer': better than they are. In the position of England, unhappily there is not much to give satisfaction. The honourable membe' 1 for Perth said nothing at all about the dole. Is that a mark of free trade? Is that one of the blessings of the free trade policy? At least we have not that iu Australia. As regards the tariff alterations proour purposes in peace and war. No posed by the Minister. I shall at this stage community can call itself a nation content, myself witb mentioning three unless it has, at its disposal and under great industries which seem to be in a very its control, the means of carrying on serious, if not a parlous state. One of operations to serve its purposes in time these is the great iron and steel industry of peace and to defend itself in time of -the basic industry of all. It depends war. no doubt upon coal, but coal, iron, and steel, grouped together, may fairly be wbich is typically Australian. Its relaregarded as symbolic of the machine tion to primary industries is direct and age. The Tariff Board in its admirable obvious; but, unfortunately, it is now in report has dealt with this industry at a most unsatisfactory state. We read a length and a perusal of that report fortnight ago that tbe works at Marrickshould satisfy anybody in this country ville bad put off one shift, and last that whatever may bave been said about week that Messrs. Bond and Company inefficiency, such a charge cannot be laid bad been compelled to close down their at the door of the great industry instiworks. Whether that firm will be able tuted by the Broken Hill Proprietary to carry on in some reconstructed form Company, Hoskins', and other firms enI cannot say. At any rate, it has reached gaged in the manufacture of iron and a crisis. If any enterprises are entitled to steel. It is very necessary that this point consideration, surely it is those that should be emphasized. Tbe Tariff Board minister directly to.the primary industries in its report saysThat thc company can fairly claim to hare staple industry, and tbe textile industry faithfully laid the foundation stone of a is a natural development of wool producmighty industry, that the organization is good and the expenditure of capital has only been tion.

The industry generally in all its ramifications directly employs close on 12,000 persons. If we are to accept tbe Tariff Board's opinion, we must realize, however, that it is in a most unsatisfactory position. The report says, "" The prospect is soniewbat ominious to Australia, and calls for very serious consideration."" It must not be thought that because I bave singled out the basic operations of the iron and steel industry that I think the efforts of the committee should be directed ""We realize entirely to the raw material out of is staggering which machinery and other iron and steel goods are made. But this is a basic industry, in which an enormous amount of capital has been sunk. Those engaged in it bave by tbeir efforts done, and are doing, everything to ensure efficiency. The enterprise is enormously important to the country. It is impossible that Australia can come into its own unless upon tbe basis of an up-to-date and comprehensive iron and steel industry, which shall serve I come now to the textile industry, of Australia. They go hand in hand with each other. Wool-growing is our greatest done muck to encourage the growth of cotton, and there is no reason at all why Australia should not become a great cotton-producing country. These industries ought to flourish; but they are in a depressed state. I am not suggesting for one moment that there may not be causes other than the lack of more adequate tariff protection for the failure of Messrs. Bond and Company. I know nothing at all about tbe circumstances of this firm, but I say that it has done everyMinister should alter the recommendathing that an enterprising firm can do to build up tbe textile industry. It is in a bad way. Two thousand five hundred of its employees have been dismissed. Whether tbey will be re-employed I do not know. dustry. This is also a typical Australian industry. It came to my knowledge the other day that oregon can be bought today in Sydney at a price nearly one half of that which ruled a year or so ago, and other soft timbers are being dumped upon our market at prices which make competition impossible. Tbis has demoralized the timber industry of Australia. industries, and sbould be encouraged. If we 'ever wake up sufficiently to the enormous importance of re-afforestation and the vast potentialities of timber-growing as a crop, I venture to say that the industry will become one of the greatest in Australia.' It is now so seriously menaced that, unless something is done, thousands of men will be thrown out of employment. The tariff schedule proposes to deal with those three industries, and, of course, many others, by raising duties and in other ways. We can discuss each item on its merits wben it comes before us; but as a general principle I take exception altogether to the Minister's method of dealing with the reports of the Tariff Board. Tbat board was established for a definite purpose, to deal with certain conditions about which there had been considerable complaint. This Parliament is necessarily not tbe best fitted institution to make inquiries into tbe circumstances of industry. We, who believe in protection and are not ashamed to advocate it whole-heartedly, are, nevertheless, reluctant to see assistance given where it is not deserved, and the Tariff Mr Bughes. Board was established in order to make diligent inquiries in no partisan spirit, and to make recommendations for the guidance of Parliament. The board has no interests at stake, no axe to grind. It is not affected by political bias. That was the reason for the introduction of the measure under which it was appointed. In my opinion, it was never intended, wben that bill was introduced, that the tions of the board before they were introduced into this Parliament. This committee was to be the final tribunal. If we thought that the board had not dealt adequately with any industry it was There remains the timber infor us to express our opinion and do what we thought was necessary. . And in this committee tbe Minister for Trade and Customs could ask us to fix tbe rates of duties higher than were recommended by the board if , in his opinion, they were not high enough. In my opinion, the proper course to pursue is for the Minister to bring down a schedule as recommended by tbe Tariff This is one of our native Board. If he thinks that the duties ought to be higher, he can move to increase them. It is then competent for bonorable members, if tbey agree witb tbe Minister, to raise the duties; but once tbe Minister has submitted a schedule of duties, honourable members are not in a position to increase any item in it. As it is now, if the Minister bas reduced tbe rates recommended by tbe Tariff Board, it is impossible for us to move to raise tbem. That is not fair to the committee. In one set of items in the schedule before us, the Minister has reduced the duties below the rates recommended by the Tariff Board. In another case the rates in the schedule are higher than those recommended by tbe board. We do not want that. We want tbe recommendations of tbe board, and then we can bear what the Minister has to say, and come to a decision. I am nol criticizing the Minister in any adverse spirit, but, in my opinion, he ought not to bave acted in this way. Those who believe in a protective policy are always willing to listen to anything that can be said from any quarter, especially from the Minister, wbo must be in a position to give us information. But as things are now, what are Ave to do when we are considering, say, a duty of 25s. and the Tariff Board has recommended 30s.? We are not allowed to move to increase the rate, and, therefore, can do nothing hut indulge in arid discussion. Of course, we can move to reduce rates; but that is nothing new; we have always had the right to do this. of Parliament in creating a Tariff Board was that the board should supply it with a basis upon wbich it could actrecommendations arrived at after the most careful inquiries Avithout bias and unaffected by any political consideration. The board's reports AvhichI have perused ful inquiry. I do not agree with all tbe board has recommended, but no one can 1 say that it is not carrying out its Avork in an admirable Avay. It Avould be far better if tbe Minister Avould give us an opportunity to discuss the tariff on tbe basis of the Tariff Board's recommendations; if he did not agree Avith those recommendations Ave' could bear bis opinions and choose between them and tbe recommendations of the board. I am pleased that this amended schedule has been submitted and I shall give tbe Minister general support. in any Avay to support eAery item. r It is our duty to exercise the most diligent and careful scrutiny over the industries that are protected, so that we may get full value for our money. Those industries that are not efficient-ther e are some of them-inflic t a grieAous r wrong on Australia and on other industries that would be a credit to any country in the Avorld. For that reason Ave ought not to support by our votes and our influence industries Avhich the Tariff Board has pointed out are not efficient. The Minister knoAVs very Avell that one industry Avas distinctly referred to as not being efficient. We ought to be told what that industry is. The Minister has no business to withhold that information from the committee. It was given by tbe board for a definite purpose. me. Avill agree that if the information was given to him, as I am led to believe it has been, it is his duty to divulge it to Parliament. Does the Minister agree Avith that? ditions under which the information was giA^en. A-ieAv of the report of the Tariff Board, The intention tbe existing unemployment, the country's adverse trade balance and the general admission that the tariff has failed, I feel like confining my remarks on this debate to one sentence, "" I told you so,"" and to the simple question, "" What are you going to do about it?"" The honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) has given a constructive and intelligent address on the present situation, but the right bonorable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) has simply floundered from ' pillar to post making references to Russia and other countries, and not offering one constructive suggestion to remedy our present economic position. One Avas entitled to expect from a gentleman of his experience some constructive suggestion; but although he endeavoured to make the committee feel that Avhat he was saying Avas of constructive value, he failed to put forward any practical suggestion. He has advised us to consider I shall not commit myself the facts. Let us have a glance at the facts. I was in this Parliament wben tbe Massey Greene tariff was introduced. We were assured that it Avould decrease importations and build up a market for the primary producers of Australia; that it would not affect primary production; and that as the result of it there Avould be no unemployed in Australia.

241,Mr Prowse (Forrest) [9.54],"I nmust have one. It is not sumcient to tell any thinking man that in the United States of America there is operating a high tariff without pointing to the other -conditions which exist in America. The 'two countries, America and Australia, -are not alike. For instance, wages in America are based on results, whereas in Australia our wages are based on the cost of living. We have an Arbitration Court which merely assesses the cost of living in order tofixrates of wages. It is not an arbitration court; it is simply an assessing court. would take into consideration the special circumstances of an industry. It would ask, "" If tbe industry pays so much wages, what will be left to the manufacturer? How can he sell his goods to the community?"" All tbese things ought to be taken into consideration. When we claim that Australia must show a white country's efficiency in order to maintain its White Australia policy, we are told that we are advocates of black labour. As a matter of fact, honourable members must know that it is not black countries but the white countries that are our competitors. great protectionists are also great believers in tbe Tariff Board. Tbey have in the past stated their willingness to accept every recommendation made by it ; but I want to know whether they are willing to abide by one strong recommendation made by tbe board which calls for attention. Perhaps in their perusal of the annual report of the board they have taken to heart the following paragraph:It is the profound desire of the hoard tliat this aspect of Australian industry should be considered without imparting into the inatter political consideration and charging the board with any particular bias. The situation is too critical to waste time on such trumpedup charges and calls for the serious consideration of all parties, classes, and individuals in the Commonwealtli, otherwise as the board has previously said, it can see nothing but disaster ahead. ferring? member seems to be ignorant of tbe contents of the board's report, I shall road the whole of the paragraph. It statesTHE Industrial Unions. Th* boiird regrets being compelled to place on record its conclusions, arrived at after the most intimate touch with a l l phases of industry within the Commonwealth, that there is a prevailing tendency which is calculated to abuse the protective system, and by forcing the pace 'under disadvantageous conditions to actually endanger the efficacy of the system. This tendency is not confined to one section alone, but is .common tn the industrial unions, the secondary producers and the primary producers of the Commonwealth. It is proposed to deal later with each group separately and to justify this far-reaching assertion. The board is profoundly convinced that if Australian industry is to lie maintained and safeguarded, it is absolutely essential that the leaders of industrial unions should recognize A proper arbitration court this serious menace of rising costs of production which the board has indicated. The board wishes it to be understood that it is not desirous of taking any side in the industrial disputes within the Couunonwealth, but it cannot be blind to the fact that simultaneously with the board being asked to consider large increases in duties on such important industries as timber, engineering, iron and steel, = brushware, copper (bonus), butter and cheese, glassware, clothing,. textiles, with the object of enabling such industries to exist, applications had been lodged and Arbitration Courts Federal and State-ha d been, and. were; being asked to grant not only increased wages but further improved' conditions and shorter hours, and State Governments were introducing legislation Honourable members who are at the time whicli further added to the already high cost of production. It must be borne in mind that evidence ar. the public inquiries revealed the fact that all tliese and otlier industries were in jeopardy, that some of those engaged as proprietors were threatened with ruin, and that unemployment was Serious. Then follows the portion I have already quoted. Perhaps that is clear to the honourable member for Maribyrnong. On several occasions I bave pointed out that there are two great combines-the manufacturers and the unions which represent the employees-shelterin g behind the tariff walls built up by this Parliament. As the Tariff Board distinctly states, these two bodies have at the expense of the consumer, and the primary producers, abused the protection afforded to tbem. Tbat is the phase of the question we should study if tbe Government's tariff's proposals are to be properly considered. The right honourable member for North Sydney spoke of our standard of living. A man who has much capital and chooses to live on it, can have a lively time for a short while; but this nation is living on its capital, ancl a nation or has not much to boast about.

243,Mr Prowse,"As the honorableon earnings, not on capital. information of thc committee I wish to read the following extract from Circular Read Chronicle of Tasmania, in which there is a good deal of common senseHas Australia for tlic last 27 years been engaged in a great fight between her right hand and the left ? Tho Minister for Trade and Customs, Mr Pratten, seems to think so, and has some warrant for his opinion. inception at the beginning of the century, now more than a quarter gone, the Australian Parliament has devoted more time to the tariff than to anything else. We have been passing real tariffs ever since, and each time the same tiling has happened. Imports instead of decreasing, have increased. Mr Pratten was the latest man to introduce a real tariff, and we gave him a free hand, just let him do as he liked without any discussion in Parliament or anything of the kind, though there is a sort of understanding that there is to be one some day. And yet Mr That is tantamount to a declaration of I'ratten is faced with the same old astounding result; imports are increasing faster since his new tariff than over they did before, which is enough to make Mr Pratten scratch his head. Asu result of the scratching he has come to the conclusion that our borrowing habit is to blame. The only thing to which the Commonwealth Parliament has devoted more energy than passing tariffs is borrowing money. Now Mr Pratten works it out that there are only three forms in which the money we borrow can come to Australia; gold, securities, and goods. Cold and securities we export, so they can be left out of the calculation. So, by u good deal of head scratching a really clever man can see that when we borrow money from England we must take it in goods (bar what stays in England to pay interest on what we have borrowed before). Mr Pratten has worked it out, and he asks indignantly what is the earthly use of his passing tariffs to keep goods out of Australia, when his colleague, Dr. Earle Page, the Treasurer, (Ioats loans at a still greater rate to force them to come in? Dr. Earle Page will no doubt ask-the free trade newspapers are already asking it for him-wha t is the earthly use of his borrowing money to develop Australia when Mr Pratten imposes duties to increase the cost of goods whicli Dr. Earle Page is introducing to develop her with? Wc may take it that Dr. Earle Page is Australia's riglit hand, and Mr Pratten her l e f t ; and that they are engaged in a great battle. "" How can 1 hope tu win,"" asks Mr Pratten plaintively, "" when the riglit hand, who is stronger than I , keeps hitting back? There is no sense in it . "" Neither he nor Dr. Earle Page nor anybody else seems to think that the only sensible thing for Australia to do would be to give up fighting herself-that is to say, give up borrowing money and increasing tariffsand sot to work producing wealth with both hands instead. That is good advice. The Australian members cannot dispute that fact. A list workmen would be entitled to the wages of Australia's exports for* the year For the they are now receiving if their production leaves a margin sufficiently large to enable industry to be properly carried on. The American manufacturers pay wages as high as, and in many cases higher than tbe wages we pay, and yet we bave to set up against tbem items in our tariff ranging from 20 per cent, to 60 per cent. Their goods Since its are produced, not by black, but by efficient white labour, ancl with the use of up-todate machinery. I have shown honourable members that tbe American manufacturer buys in tbe same market that we do his raw material for the manufacture of rubber tyres, and can sell a small Ford tire f.o.b. New York for £1 5s. 6d., while we require a duty of £1 10s. 7d. on it entering Australia. our inefficiency. Does Australia benefit from the manufacture of tires in Melbourne or Sydney? No. The transport of this country has to pay for it. Our production is handicapped because of the costliness of everything that runs on wheels. Instances similar to this could be multiplied. No person objects to Australians being paid good wages so long as they earn them, but until we adopt tbe basis of fixing wages according to the principle of productive value, we shall not be on firm ground. On tbe basis of the cost of living it would be possible to put Australia in an insular position. ""As tbe article wbich I have read points out, a greater amount of time has been spent by this Parliament in considering revisions of tbe tariff than on any other subject. What does it all mean ^ Australia? We have had a drought, and our exports will decline still further than they have already declined, and our adverse balance is estimated this year to be betweei. £40,000,000 and £50,000,000. What can be done by our secondary industries to meet the situation with which we shall be faced? Will they be responsible for the introduction of any more wealth ? Not a penny. During this year it will be made apparent that tbey -have so far been carried on the back of primary productions. It is not to be' wondered at that there has been a slackening in our exports. Honourable 1926-27, which has been compiled from Commonwealth official statistics and issued by tbe Town and Country Union of New South Wales, shows that the value of tbe exports of primary production was £144,775,511, and that that of all exports, apart from primary production, was only £10,168,293. Who provides the money which makes it possible for emplyoment to the found for those who produce that £10,168,293 worth of goods? The primary producer. The State of Western has been struggling under a great hardship in that she bas bad to buy in the clearest market, and sell her produce in open competition with every other nation. Tbe right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) on more than one occasion bas declared bis commercial faith in tbe following terms: "" We want to buy in tbe cheapest and sell in the dearest market."" He said once that we ought to pray for a rise in the prices of the goods that we bad to sell, and for cheapness in those that we needed to buy. The day of reckoning is close at hand. Last year Western Australia purchased from tbe eastern States goods to the value of £9,000,000, while those States bought from her to the value of only £1,500,000. The adverse balance against her was, therefore, £7,500,000. Out of that £9,000,000, if allowed to buy in the cheapest market, she would bave saved at least £2,500,000 for developmental purposes. Personally, I do not wish to see tbe establishment of factories in Western Australia under tbe conditions iu which they are maintained in the eastern States. incubus on the country. Australia was prevented from having factories by the eastern States manufacturers. It proved to be one of the best blessings that could possibly bave beeu bestowed, although it was not the result of placed upon bim. Common justice deany good intention on the part of the eastern States-because people on to the land to produce real wealth that would maintain and feed her people, and export her surplus, bringing new capital into the State. If that and every other State had failed to have a yield this year, who would have paid for Australia's costly manufactures; and whence would have Mr Prowse. come the money necessary to meet our interest bill and other obligations?. Factories would have closed down rigbt and left. The right honourable member for North Sydney said that England lives almost entirely on her manufactures. Quite so. Mauritius lives almost entirely on ber production of sugar, aud F i j i formerly occupied a similar position in relation to ber banana industry. Can Australia expect to live on her manufactures? She cannot produce for ber own needs without hobbling and handicapping Australia her own people. Primary production could be made Australia's emancipation. Tbe world will not take our manufactured goods because the cost of production is too great. But we could treble the output of our primary products, which we can sell, if they were not handicapped in order to foster secondary industries. secondary industries we should not be able to purchase our goods as cheaply as we do now. The importer would raise the prices of those goods just as he did previously. saddled with these exotic industries; or, as the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) bas said, if we bad only a few-, sucb as munitions supply and others that are necessary to tbe defence of Australia, our potential wealth is sucb that there would not be any rise in the cost of living. A revenue tariff, of course, is necessary. A vicious circle has been created. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) has advised those primary producers wbo are not already there to get into that They are an vicious circle so as to make it complete. Western What would happen if they did? is in it to a big extent. into it by the burdens wbich have been mands the policy wbich tbe Treasurer it forced ber suggested, but statemansbip repudiates it.

Honourable members, however, will continue this' blind orgy of meddle and muddle, disregarding the warnings of even their precious Tariff Board, and ignoring economic facts, until Australia is compelled to walk a much harder road than that on which it is travelling now. This country's resources will enable it to stand up to a great deal, but unless we are prepared to base payments upon results, we shall be unable to meet our great honourable member do with the old men? obligations. Tbe right honourable member for North Sydney spoke of the high standards of do? living enjoyed by almost every individual in the community. Burdensome tariff duties have been in operation mostly efficiency has been often referred to dursince the war, and during that period Australia enjoyed an apparent prosperity. Our people bave been spending easy money that came to them in various ways-the high prices of our wool and wheat during the war, the subsequent distribution of tbe accumulated profits of the wool and wheat pools, the back pay drawn by the soldiers, tbe war gratuity, and heavy expenditure upon war service homes. All these extraordinary disbursements bave created an evanescent prosperity; we have been "" kidding"" ourselves that we have been making money and spending income. No Parliament bas power to maintain the prices of wool and wheat, the two commodities from which the income of the nation is mainly derived. The primary producers are obliged to accept the world's market price for their produce, and upon the promust first step backward, as it is often ceeds from this source our credit abroad is based. The burden that the export industries can carry is limited. It would not matter if only a few industries were being protected; but when every factory has to be bolstered up with high duties, it is impossible for the primary producers, wbo bave to sell tbeir surplus in the markets of the world, to carry tbe burden ancl pay interest on £1,000,000,000 of debt. I appeal to members of the committee to put aside their shibboleths and do some serious thinking on this problem. It is idle to answer me by saying that I want to see a black Australia. I want Australia to remain white, and if the workmen were advised differently this country could become a paradise for the white worker. Let a minimum wage be prescribed if necessary, but pay every many according to results so that each may, according to his physical and men. tal powers, earn as much as he can. Every man's labour should show a profit, and the country should get something from his services. After they had made a profit, would the honourable member send them to the graveyard as the Americans are said to ing this debate. Tbe American community puts this argument to the working manTlie more you produce per man the more there is to divide per family-that is our philosophy. Wages, dividends, and profits are up, and costs are down. The increase in the use of machinery has not meant unemployment. When a magnetic crane handled by two men began doing tlie work done the day previously by 128 men, it did not mean that 12G men were discharged. That view is the reverse of that which is taken in Australia. Our working man thinks that if the hours of labour are reduced there will be more work available and less unemployment. No greater fallacy was ever conceived by thinking men. The greater the production, the greater the employment. I bave said before that if we want to go forward, we necessary to pull down in order to build up. If the incomes of all of us, whether from wages or profits, were reduced by 33$ per cent., there would be no unemployment in this country, we would be able to sell our manufactured goods abroadand develop our primary industries. Tbe 66$ per cent, would buy as much as the 100 per cent, buys to-day, because the purchasing power of money would be greater. Of course, I am asked where this policy of reduction is to commence. My answer is that if our heads do not prompt us to make a start, our stomachs will'later on.

Why should the secondary manufacturer be given protection at the expense of tbe man wbo goes on the land, and. endures tbe labour of clearing, burning off, should set up a high wall of protection ploughing and growing crops? This excessive protection is the cause of the present centralization in the big cities, and that is bad. We find that the worker in the city, who after all is being paid from the products of the land, votes for the continuance of protection because it is the immediate means of providing him with his wages. Arbitration Court and asks for higher wages. He proves that tbe cost of living has gone up, and so be receives his increase. When wages go up the manufacas much extra protection as he needs to meet the increased wages. Who pays for this, if not the primary producer? The farmer is not only saddled with the duty I on machinery, which appears striking because it is most obvious, but protection also imposes many other extra charges upon him. He bas to pay a higher railway freight because tbe railway workers demand higher wages, and he has to pay more to his employee because the latter has to buy dearer clothes. Thus it has gone on until we have an adverse balance this year of £19,000,000.

He expressed the opinion that tbe associated Chambers should get some interpretation of the legal position gave an assurance that he would, upon his return to Melbourne, refer the whole matter to the Crown law authorities. A t the 23rd annual conference of the Associated Chamber of Commerce of Australia held at Perth last March, tbe f o l lowing resolution was carried:1. (o) In the opinion of this conference the charges for duty against the same cargo in the same vessels operate harshly as between State unci State. (6) it is desirable that counsel's opinion be taken as to the wisdom and practicability' of nuiking alterations in the Customs Act to enable the same incidence of duties on all ourgo discharged at all Australian ports ex the same vessel. The opinion of Mr .T. S. O'Halloran KC, was obtainod. He concluded that there was nothing in the constitution to prevent an alteration of section 132 of the Customs Act in such a way as to give eifect to the desire of the Associated Chambers of Commerce. The opinion of counsel was referred to the Chambers of Commerce in tbe capital cities. The Sydney chamber considers that there is f u l l justification for pressing.tbe Commonwealth Government to bave tbe necessary alteration made in the Customs Act. Tbe Melbourne chamber is of the opinion that many difficulties are in the way of carrying out the resolution, and suggests that as thc matter iB of such importance, it will be better to defer taking action with the Government until after the next conference. This would give the various chambers an opportunity to consider it fully, and delegates to the conference would be able to discuss it with full knowledge of the views of their respective chambers. The Brisbane chamber presumes the matter will be proceeded with by submitting the resolution and copy of counsel's opinion to the Minister, and, if the opinion of the Crown Law officers coincides witb it, an alteration to tbe Customs Act in the direction desired would relieve the State of a very great disadvantage under which it has been suffering. The Adelaide chamber considers that the present is not an opportune time to approach the Pederal Government with a request to amend section 132 of the Customs Act. Perth chamber reconfirms its support of the resolution, while the Hobart chamber holds that the Minister should be asked to reconsider the position in the light of counsel's opinion, and consult with the Pederal Attorney-Goneral. The position now agrees with Mr O'Halloran's view that there .is no constitutional objection to the making of the change desired by the associated chambers. The constitutional objection which has been raised so often' is wiped away. To my mind, the existing practice with regard to the incidence of the tariff taxation is unconstitutional. The Miuister maintains, however, that new anomalies would arise and the administrative difficulties of the department would, be greatly increased if the proposed amendment to section 132 of the Customs Act were made. No doubt 'the matter will be reintroduced at the next conference of the Associated Chambers to be held at Hobart earl) next year. I sbould like to have the Minister's assurance that the fullest consideration will be given to thc resolutions passed at both the twenty-second and twenty-third annual meetings of the Associated Chambers in conjunction with the opinion given by Mr O'Halloran and confirmed by the Attorney-General, and that the Minister will communicate with the President of the Associated Chambers of Australia without delay. I would also ask that details be given of the administrative difficulties and fresh anomalies which the Minister affirms would arise if the suggested amendment were made in the Customs Act. This will enable the conference to arrive at a definite and final conclusion. I feel sure that the Government realizes that full and sympathetic consideration should be given to the requests of the conference, representative as it will be, of the commercial life of the nation. I do not intend to refer in detail to the tariff schedule, but I should like to read oue letter that I have received from the chairman of directors of a firm of structural steel contractors, engineers and iron-founders, of Brisbane. It is dated 1st December, 1927, and readsWe have taken tlie personal opportunity of wiring you as follow:Extra tariff steel not justified; will dol ay building progress in Queensland. You know already delays automatic exchange. The above wire, as you will understand, is is that the Attorney-General in relation to the increase from 48a. to 70s. per ton on steel structural sections, which is in our own, and the ironmasters' opinion, a severe set back to Australia, and Queensland in particular. We would be the last to turn down Australian muaufactiied goods, -but in this vase we appeal for a fair deal for Queensland employers and employees, which appeal is indeed applicable to the whole of Australia, from the writer's own personal 'knowledge, having just returned from a visit to -Sydney and Melbourne. The Broken Hill Proprietary cannot supply the demand for structural steel, and it is, 'therefore, tmfair to (five further protection, at least until they give -evidence of becoming more efficient. As an instance, we would state, that it took tliem some eight months to supply us with S00 tons of steel for a contract, which we could have obtained from GTeat Britain in three months in one ship. That they cannot supply the demand, is also proved by the -stocks which they hold on hand, and which a fortnight ago, did not equal by half the amount -of our own stock, and we arc only a small firm. We have tried for Australian rolled sections on every occasion before placing any orders, and in the majority of cases, the delivery has been double what could be obtained elsewhere, and in one cose we were notified that uo orders for Queensland could be accepted. Thc present situation is such, that the extra tariff will make the importation of steel prohibitive, and as the demand cannot be supplied in Australia, we would ask, what are we to do with our employees? We have laid ourselves out for the specialization of structural steel work, and consider that our appeal should have somo consideration, otherwise we say emphatically thut this trade is doomed, and as the particular class of machinery used cannot be adapted for any other purpose, we must go out of existence. We earnestly appeal to you to usi> every endeavour tn right matters, when we can look forward with confidence to the future. I particularly wish the Minister to deal with the points raised in that letter, and to give a reply later in the debate. If there is one industry that sbould be protected under the tariff, it is the great key iron and steel industry, but the statements contained in the letter I have just received give mc considerable concern. Any other remarks that I wish to make regarding the schedule I shall defer until the individual items are under discussion. Progress reported. HOU R OF MEETING .
