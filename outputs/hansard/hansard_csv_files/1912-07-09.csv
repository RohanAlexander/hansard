Debate resumed from 5th July {vide That the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency's Speech, as read by the Clerk, be agreed to by the House. That the following words be added to the Address :"" And to inform Your Excellency that the Government merits the censure of the House and the country for its failure to realize its national and constitutional obligations, for flagrant neglect of its duty to secure industrial peace and good order, and to uphold the law within the Commonwealthj for its maladministration of public affairs and public departments; igi2. for its grossly partisan actions and appointments, and its reckless irresponsibility in the financial affairs of the Commonwealth."" speeches which we have heard from the Opposition side during this debate, the Labour party have been blamed for all the industrial unrest that has existed in Australia for some years past, it being forgotten apparently that industrial unrest is not confined to this country, but prevails all over the world to-day. Opposition members, knowing that they could not repeal the measures with which the Government have honestly endeavoured to advance the interests of Australia, are using the Brisbane strike as a weapon with which to fight the next elections. They forget that the great coal strike which occurred in Great Britain a few months ago was settled, not by a display of the military, nor by the imprisonment of the leaders, but by the passing of the Minimum Wages Act, which recognises a principle which has been fought for during the last fifty years, and recognition of which has opened a new path for the advance of the workers. Along that path many sections besides the coal miners are now rapidly ..marching. The Prime Minister has been blamtd by the so-called Liberals for not sending the military to Brisbane; but in Great Britain, when Messrs. Houlder Brothers and Company applied to a Liberal Government for the protection of some men whom they had engaged during the strike of the transport workers, the reply of. the Home Secretary was that it was not the duty of the police to protect strike breakers,. but that had actual disorder arisen it would have been the duty of the Government to restore order. At Brisbane no actual disorder had taken place 'when the Premier of Queensland asked for the military, and he had the..police at his command for the maintenance of order. The intimidation of the people by the military, the seizure of union funds, and the imprisonment of strike leaders is all that the intelligence of the Fusion suggests for the settlement of industrial disputes. The honourable member for Brisbane, in his very fine address,. proved conclusively that, in the first place, the men were deliberately locked out by the manager of the tramway company, who hates unionism as much as the Fusionists hate the Labour party, and endeavoured to kill it at the start, so far",14,Setup

6,Mr Ozanne (Corio) [3.3],"In theas his company was concerned. The Leader of the Opposition asked what the Prime Minister had done to settle the Brisbane dispute, although he knew well that there was no opportunity for Commonwealth interference. tration Act, which he himself framed, the Gommonwealth Court cannot take cognisance of a dispute until it has extended beyond the limits of one State, and for five months after the New South Wales coal strike commenced the honourable member, who was then in office,' did nothing, because he was powerless to interfere. We had to go to the miners of Jumbunna and other centres, and ask them to make a common issue, before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court could be approached. But when we tried to extend the powers of the Court so that its jurisdiction might be more effective for the settlement of disputes, the Opposition and the press persuaded the people to vote against the referendum. system of settling disputes is experimental, and it is our duty to do what we can to make it effective when opportunities arise. The Opposition have never assisted us in this, but have, on the contrary, thrown obstacles in our way. Therefore, it is rank humbug .for honourable members opposite to try to place on the shoulders of the Government the blame for the present industrial unrest. The Leader of the Opposition intends to introduce something which will prevent strikes. operation and profit-sharing. always been a very strong advocate of these principles, because under the conditions I found existing I thought it was o the best policy 'which could be established; but I would tell the honourable and learned member that at this stage his proposition is made too late. We have driven the honourable member and his party from ditch to ditch, until now, in the defence of their citadel, he proposes to capitulate and offer us something which we do not want. When we are dealing with the interests of the nation, we cannot simply turn to a section of the community who may be fortunate enough to be in a co-operative concern and say, "" Yes, we are quite willing that you should receive the profits of this industry."" the action of men such as Badger. The What is going to happen to the casual employ6, the ordinary farm hand who works for only a few months in the year, the clerks and the girls in offices who are not permanently employed? What, I ask, is going to happen to these persons under this system of profit-sharing? When we are dealing with the interests of a nation, it is absolutely essential that our legislation shall be moulded in the direction of seeing Under the Arbithat every individual in the community gets his share of the profits produced. From time to time. I have heard many leaders of the other side roundly denounce Socialism from the platform. They could not say anything bad enough about the system. But when they propose to introduce co-operation, or profit-sharing, is not that piecemeal Socialism ? When we teach the community in sections to co-operate and share the profits, does it not mean that eventually all the sections will unite and the Government: will control the whole of our production and distribution in the interests of the nation, and that thus we shall attain to that Socialistic regime which honourable members opposite are so happy in denouncing? As We realize that the present I stated previously, it is not my desire to traverse the ground so ably covered by the honourable member for Brisbane, but I wish_ to mention that when the case came before' Mr Justice Higgins he distinctly called the occurrence at Brisbane a lock-out, and not a strike. Furthermore, he found that the claims of the men were absolutely just, that they were within, their right in wearing a badge. We are told now that the whole trouble with arbitration is that the men refuse to obey the awards of the Court. But Mr Justice Higgins has told us that the He proposes to introduce comen have obeyed every award of the CourtI have during its term. As far as the employers are concerned, what do we find ? A l though His Honour found in favour of the men, we find Mr Badger, the manager of the Brisbane Tramway Company, not only refusing to recognise the award by appealing to the High Court, but endeavouring to victimize the men by refusing to employ them again. That seems to me a most unfair way of dealing with great industrial questions. While I am against strikes; while I realize that strikes are like warvery fruitless only too often to those who win; while I desire to see a system introduced under which we could have as little loss as possible, at the same time words fail to adequately express my contempt for honourable member for North Sydney, in speaking the other day, could not say anything bad enough about unionists. I realize that he is a new member of the Opposition,. and perhaps he is not yet acquainted with of peace, consequently unionism is in the the views expressed by many of its leadinterests of peace. We organize our men ing members. Therefore, for his informathey place their case before the Arbitration tion I shall quote from Hansard a few reCourt, and we trust that a satisfactory set marks made by them as far back as 1904. tlement will ensue. But by their actions The Reid-McLean Government gave legisthe Fusion are practically encouraging lative recognition to preference to unionists. strikes. With the spread of education the In 1904, when the honourable member for people are recognising their strength, and Ballarat introduced his Conciliation and if honourable members opposite do not act Arbitration Bill, he saidThe issues as we put them are : Preference? strikes which will, to my mind, be a disYes! unionism besides preference? Yes! For what sible for the 'result? purpose? For the prevention and settlement of gentlemen sitting on the Opposition benches. industrial disputes. the Leader of the Fusion Government, said ineffective. This question of industrialism is he was absolutely in favour of preference closely allied to the question of immigration; to unionists.

10,Mr Ozanne,"The quotation is taken It is essential that we should invite populacity of Geelong, notwithstanding its prosperity, I had the sad duty of addressing -a meeting of the unemployed; and yesterday I had to bring before the Minister of Mines the same grim subject, and ask him to find work. I see from the newspapers that there are a number of unemployed in Melbourne, some 900 in Sydney, and goodness knows how many in other centres of population; and yet we find casual labourers being introduced. I have an objection, not only to the immigration of the casual labourer, but also-and a still greater objection-to the preference that is being -shown by the Victorian State Government to immigrants over Australian-born applicants. Of course, the State officers say that this is not so, but I will read the following paragraph from the AgeThe preference which is being shown in the employment of immigrants on railway works is exciting considerable indignation among railway employees. Yesterday it was reported to the Victorian Railways Union that trouble was threatening among the casual labourers employed at the Melbourne Goods Sheds, since five immigrants, said to be Germans, who had recently arrived, were given employment, whilst men who had been working at the sheds for nine or ten years were forced to stand aside. It has been the practice for years, that the men in the "" A "" and "" B "" sections, numbering about 400, should be regularly employed , while there is any work. to do. The fact that they, as well as others who have been working at the sheds, had been overlooked in favour of the newcomers caused much dissatisfaction, as it was understood that labourers were to be -granted preference since there has always been enough labour of this class available. . Here we have a definite statement to the effect that five Germans have been given preference over Australian-born men. Furthermore, the report from which I have just -read an extract states that Mr R. Jones moved That a protest be made against the State Government giving preference to immigrants for railway employment. At Newport Workshops '-(he said) a large number of casual hands were feeing put off to make place for immigrants, which was grossly unfair to Australians. Mr Watt ancl his officers say that employment can be found for any man willing to work; but I should like to' know why, if that be so, when Mr Plain, the State member tor Geeiong, made application yesterday to have 250 men placed, he was told by tlie Premier that the Railways Commissioners would be able to find work for only twenty. I have no objection lo an immigrant simply because he is an immigrant. I realize the dreadful conditions that prevail in the Mother Country, where millions of people are starving and millions more are on the verge of starvation, and I should only be too happy to extend a hearty welcome to them in Australia in order, if possible, to secure them happier and brighter lives. But if it means that by reason of such immigration our own men and women have to walk the streets wanting food and homes, I am totally opposed to the present system of tion representative of the Victorian Government in England, has, as I say, been sending out casual labourers instead of the right class of immigrants; and the position became so acute that only the other day he received word not to send any more on the same lines. The Age newspaper saidNow that the sending out of farm labourers had been checked, it would be possible for Mr McLeod to devote his attention to securing land seekers as a class of immigrants whom the Government desired particularly to encourage. We ought to encourage land-seekers in the first instance, and not send out casual workers simply to overcrowd the lahour market. ' Notwithstanding the loyalty that causes the breasts of our opponents to swell with pride, it seems to me that they are alwaysmore loyal to other workers than their own. I ask representatives of farming electorates how loyal the State Government is to men and women who seek land in their own State of Victoria? We have one of the biggest irrigation farms in the world at Werribee, where I lived for many years, and amongst the residents there were a number of trained irr'igationists; but .when Mr Mead divided the Cohuna land, instead of giving preference to those who thoroughly understood irrigation, he, except in a few instances, retained the best of the blocks for Russian immigrants. When these men from Werribee went to Cohuna they had to pay their own railway fares; they had to engage their own vehicles, to view the land at their own cost, and then to go before the Board to make their applications. But we had some Russian immigrants to this country. How were they treated? They were met at the wharf, they were franked over the railways, waggonettes were provided for them, the ground was ploughed in readiness for them, cowsheds were built, and they were supplied with the best land available. Surely every right-thinking man and woman would condemn such a difference in treatment as that.

Although in the past honourable members on this side have . granted Protection to a number of industries, and although many employers on rereiving Protection have deliberately deceived their workmen, I believe that, in Victoria at least, there are to-day honest -emplovers who are not receiving adequate Protection. We should not sacrifice the honest employer because of the actions of dishonest men. by the actions of dishonest people only, we -could have no further confidence in humanity. I understand exactly what was Protection for his industry. Although he stated in my electorate that the remarks I made last year were not correct, and that he did not promise his employees a living wage That did not satisfy the proi f he were given Protection, I repeat again that he did make that promise to his employees.

29,Mr Ozanne,"Of course McKay supsay that they will refuse any further Protection so long as they are unable to protect the workers and consumers as well as the manufacturers. But while I admit that they have justice on their side in taking that stand, I also acknowledge at the same time that we have many industries . in the Commonwealth that are deserving of much greater Protection than they at present receive. As our industries, extend, our imports should become less if our Protection be effective. But what do we find? Year after year our imports are increasing in value by millions of pounds. That is evidence that there is something radically wrong. tunately, the Federation can protect the employer, but cannot protect the workman or consumer. We can protect the worker where a dispute in any industry extends beof talk in reference to the increased priceyond the limits of one State; but, even in such a case, where the verdict is given in favour of the workmen, it is subsequently set aside by the High Court. Some honourable Fusion members affirm that under the Wages Board system the employees engaged in the various industries of Australia will obtain a living wage. But they must know perfectly well that in connection with many industries it is impossible to secure the sanction of the Legislative Council to the creation of a Wages Board. ber is speaking for Victoria alone. I know happens in Victoria. State it is impossible to get Bills providing ing to themselves an absolute profit of for the establishment of Wages Boards in certain industries through the Legislative this question, we shall find that wherever Council. Consequently the Labour party refuse to protect merely one section of the community. They desire . to protect not merely the manufacturer, but also the"" worker and consumer. It is true that there are many protected industries in Victoria, but there are several others in connection with which Wages Boards have not been established, and in these the employees are not in receipt of a living wage. At the last referenda we asked the electors to vest this Parliament with power to restrain the operations of trusts and combines. Of course, we realize that there are some combines whose operations are of a beneficial character. If a combine be established for the purpose of introducing more efficient machinery in connection with any industry, and thus of bringing about more economical production, it follows that the consumer -must obtain a better and cheaper article. In such circumstances the creation of a combine is amply justified. But a combination which is formed merely for the purpose of exploiting the worker and consumer must necessarily be detrimental to the best interests of the public, and the sooner we are empowered to restrict its operations the better. Government deal with the trusts which are already in existence? Constitution we do hot possess effective powers. The Government have already prosecuted the Coal Vend and the ShippingI realize that, unforRing, but both are still in existence. In the absence of increased powers under the Constitution, we are absolutely helpless tosuppress them. We have heard a good deal' of commodities, but I say that though prices have gone up during recent years,, wages have risen much more considerably.. I believe that the condition of theworker to-day is much better than> it was several years ago. But under our Wages Board system the moment that the employ6s in any industry are granted a slight increase in wages-a n increase of say 5 per cent -the employers in that industry raise the price of their commoditiesto the tune of even 50 per cent. Not long, since, the employees in the chaff industry, were awarded an increased wage of is. 9d. per ton. The middlemen at once raised: In this the price of chaff 5s. per ton, thus insur3s. 3d. per ton. If we choose to investigatethe employer is called upon to pay an additional 3d. in wages to the worker, he takesvery good care to pass on to the consumer an additional impost of is. Until this Parliament is vested with increased powersunder our Constitution, thisunfortunate state of things will continue. I have nothing to say against the price of a commodity being increased slightly, as the result of an increased wage being granted to those engaged in its production. I do not believe that any man desires to obtain cheap goods at the expense of his fellows. It is true that some increases in the cost of commodities have resulted from the granting of increased wages to the employees engaged in their production; but, in other cases, the manufacturer has insisted upon grabbing a much larger profitthan he was entitled to.

35,But The Only Mr Ozanne,"The honourable member that side of the House. I find that the Federal expenditure, according to the last Budget, included £5,776,000 paid to the States, £2,190,000 for invalid and old age pensions, £673,000 for interest and sinking fund on transferred properties, £1,873,000 for defence, £3,930,000 for the Postal Department, £4,306,000 for new works, £200,000 for naval subsidy, £621,000 for the sugar bounty, and ,£'433,000 for the Northern Territory. Do honourable members opposite propose to reduce the expenditure on any of those items ? They do not, with the exception of the item of old-age pensions. The honourable member for Flinders, in the same speech, said, regarding old-age pensionsNow, another enormous expenditure of the (.government is that on old-age pensions. regard to this I want to be perfectly frank. .1 think the system is not only wasteful and extravagant, but is based on a principle that is fb itself rotten to the core. Ts it any wonder, then, that when we turn to the platform of the so-called Liberal party, we find that old-age and invalid pensions ate -embodied in plank number 13? As soon as the Opposition get into power, it will be a case of ""Good-bye""; those pensions will be wiped off the slate, and then we shall have the condition of things that once existed in Victoria. were very low, the Government of this State, instead of going to the wealthy of the community and asking them to make up the deficit, cut down of the civil servants, and reduced the amount of money that was going to the old-age pensioners. Yet the members of the party opposite will go round and ask the aid-age pensioner for his vote, and the civil servant for his vote, telling the people that we are their enemies and that they, the members of the Opposition, are their friends. If a man put his hand into my pocket and tried to take some of my money, I should soon know whether he was a friend or not. When revenue has to be raised and great national works-to be carried out,'the members of the party opposite always put the taxation on the shoulders of the people who are least able to bear it, and then they talk about class legislation. legislated in the interests of every section of the community. We hnve tripd to introduce a condition of things that will be fair to -«very man, woman, and child. The Opposition cannot say the same, or anything like it. They also fpll us that since we have been in power we have given all the good jobs to Labour supporters. Mr Ozanne. members of the Opposition know that the chief complaint amongst our Labour people is that all the good positions are going to the Liberals, and I think that complaint is borne out by the facts. In appointing our omcers, we ought to select the best men, whether they are Liberal or Labour, and I believe that that has been the aim of our Government. They have endeavoured always to select the best men, because they realize that their administration is on trial, and they could not possibly afford to appoint a man who would be likely to be a failure. They do not ask a man whether he is a Labour man or a Liberal. Members of the Opposition have quoted the appointments of Mr Ryland and Dr. Jensen. I could quote the names of twenty other In gentlemen who do not belong to the Labour party, and who yet have been placed by the Government in very responsible positions. Is Mr Miller, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, a Labour man? Ts Mr McKay, the Land Tax Commissioner, a Labour man? Is Dr. Gilruth, the Administrator of the Northern Territory, a Labour man? Are Professor Baldwin Spencer, Mr Francis, Mr Clarke, Mr Beckett, and Mr Deane, Labourites ? Yet they have been given absolutely the best positions that When the finances we could offer to any individual. All that the members of the Opposition can say in support of their charge is that we have appointed Mr Ryland and Dr. Jensen. From the wages the information I have, I can say that those two are very capable men; and when the result of their administration is known, honourable members will find such to be the case. I wish to touch lightly on the proposition for a maternity bonus. This is a question about which the unthinking will laugh and smirk; but, I am confident that throughout Australia the judicious and the humane will applaud it. I can cite instances from my own knowledge where, if the bonus had been available, the lives, not only of children, but of mothers, would have been saved. Our friends opposite, instead of giving us credit for this humane measure, go round to the ladies' leagues and other meetings, and make fun of it. They say that it is a Our party have political bribe. What care they about the suffering of the poorer section of the community? The members of the Women's National League can afford to smile at this proposal. Born with a silver spoon in their mouths, nursed in the lap of luxury, they have not to worry in the most critical Surely the period of a woman's life. They have no consideration tor their less fortunate sisters. Of course, when they want a vote they ask them round to a cup of tea, and are very nice. The honourable member for Flinders said of this proposalAs a piece of political fly-paper it might be Whereas the States received from the banks considered one of the most profitable articles something like £90,000 per annum in note puton the market. It was not a dream altotax, the Commonwealth makes £180,000 gether; it was an inspiration. (Laughter.) They say that inspirations come from Heaonly £4,000,000 worth of notes being in ven. If that be so, this proposal is Heaven circulation, there is more than £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 sent. But how ought they to receive a proposition something wrong about the old state of of this kind? He said they ought absolutely affairs. Furthermore, as the Prime Minto oppose it by every means in their power.

Although this party has been directions? There was no end and no stopping place to this kind of thing. Why not provide charged with extravagant finance, honourable for young couples who wanted to furnish? This most serious question is treated as a been extravagant. The honourable member huge joke.

When we turn to the Savings Banks, we find that, in 1908-9, the increase in the number of depositors was 62,536; in 1909-10 the increase was 85,117; but when Labour came into power, that is in 1910-n, the increase amounted to 116,539. show ? It simply showed that our legislation was securing a fairer distribution of wealth; that, whereas previously many of the workers were in a state of semi-starvation, and many of them only got sufficient to enable them to live, now they are able to save a little for a rainy day; they are becoming depositors. The amount at deposit in 1908-9 showed an increase of -£2,930,467; in 1909-10 there was an increase of £4,039,559; while in .1910-11 (he increase amounted to £6,276,184. The greatest increases in connection with the Savings Banks have occurred during the regime of the Labour party. I claim that, since our advent to power, we have kept every pledge which we made to the electors. Here is the constitution of the Labour party, which I took round with me when I fought the last election. On our fighting platform you will find these planks1. Maintenance of White Australia. 2. 3. 4. Values. 5. Citizen Defence Force. 6. 7. 8. 9. With the exception of the Navigation Bill, every measure referred to in the fighting platform is the law of Australia. On our general platform we find the nationalization of monopolies, and, if necessary, the amendment'of the Constitution to provide for it. of the Constitution was necessary, we accordingly passed a Bill, and I am pleased to notice that, although we were so badly beaten at the referendum, the Victorian Government, and other State Governments, are going to confer upon us the increased industrial power which we asked for. Although the Victorian Government fought so bitterly against us, 1 see that there is a proposition in the last Governor's Speech lhat the power shall be conferred upon the Federation. Mr Oeanne. Government promise many things, and carry out very few of them; but, still, that proposition is contained in the recent Governor's Speech. When we turn to the Fusion programme, what do we find ? The Leader of the Opposition went to Ballarat and told the Women's National League that the party were going to give them a proWhat did that gramme which would astonish the world. Apparently, it more than astonished the honourable member for Flinders, because, when he read it over, he described it in these wordsA l l the bones had been carefully removed, and nothing left but a kind of gelatinous compound, political food for infants and invalids, warranted not to cause the slightest inconvenience to the weakest digestion. for Flinders. Continuing, be said Unless they could arrive at something the people could grasp and understand as a definite, clear, and progressive policy, and not a vague tissue of generalities, it might in the long run be best for Australia if the Labour party had another three years' tenure of office. If a leading member on this side went to a place and described the Labour' programme in that way, how long would he be in our movement? Nationalization of Monopolies. which was to astonish the world, and which Graduated Tax on Unimproved Land more than astonished the honourable member for Flinders, was repudiated by him, and Commonwealth Bank. now we have these honourable gentlemen tellRestriction of Public Borrowing. ing us, "" Oh, that platform does not matter, Navigation Laws. we are going to draw up another platform Arbitration Act Amendment. much better than the last one.""

How long would the Labour party last if it When we found that an amendment adopted such a policy? It was not my intention to occupy so much time;, and, in conclusion, I wish to say that since the Labour party has been in power it has kept every pledge which it has made to the electors. That is unique in politics. The Fusion motto in politics is, "" Promise as much as you like, but do not carry it out."" Every promise that we made to the people from the platform we bave carried out.

I shall not discuss that grant, nor shall I discuss the merits of other items of proposed expenditure; and I merely mention the fact so that we may get, if possible, a clear view of our present position and of our prospects when times change, as they are bound to da Last year, the revenue was estimated at £19,500,000, but our expenditure kept pace; and, from what we can see, there will be the same process in connection with our revenue of £22,000,000. I wish to ask the Treasurer this question: Has he, as the responsible head of the Government and the leader of his party, ever set down on paper the obligations of this country, incurred not only by the present Ministry, but also by their predecessors? Has he ever set down the amounts that he will have to meet ere long, and asked himself where he is going to find the money? I have tried in vain to find in the speeches of the Prime Minister and his colleagues any clue to the method by which the grand total of the commitments of the Commonwealth is to be met. Therefore, I have been driven in upon my own resources, and have tried to compile a list, which I shall put before honourable members. I am conscious of its incompleteness. I do not think that it covers the whole of the contemplated expenditure. But it is, at all events, sufficient to make us pause. There is one thing that of course stands out as a primary duty of this country, in its own interest, ""and for its own preservation. That -is the organization of defence. The policy of military and naval defence now being carried out is not that of any one party, but of all parties. The proposals were initiated by the late Government, and are being realized by the present Government. I believe that the people of the country will insist that whatever happens the policy that has been introduced in that regard shall be continued. That being so, defence is not a party matter. But defence depends upon finance. Like almost everything else, it comes back to a matter of money. One would therefore be entitled to expect that in facing the great question of ways and means, the Government would have endeavoured to pursue in regard to finance a policy of a non-party character. I feel sure that had the Prime Minister, when he came into power, with an unexampled majority in both Houses, realized They are his responsibility, and invited, as he might well have done, the aid and assistance of men on this side in settling the finances of the country on a reasonable, business like, and proper foundation, he would have secured effective support from all sides. I can say for myself, and I believe also for others, that we should have been only too pleased had the right honourable gentleman taken that view of his position. Had he done so, he would not have adopted the course that he has followed, and which, ere I sit down, I shall show is not. the success which he and his supporters desire to make us think that it is. It is defective in many respects, and, in view of the obligations which have been incurred, will be positively dangerous if continued. The estimate which I have before me deals first with defence. Lord Kitchener's scheme for a seven years' period involved an expenditure of £1,834,000. But Senator Pearce, the Minister of Defence, said in the Senate not long agoSo far as I have been able to judge, Lord1 Kitchener's estimate of £1,800,000 will be exceeded. I ' believe that in round numbers it may be said that the Defence Force when inf u l l operation will cost us not less than £2,000,000 per annum. .1 may say, in passing, that I believe that probably £2,000,000 is considerably under the true estimate. However, I do not wish to overstate the case. I would rather give . my honourable friends opposite the benefit of any doubt, and let the difference be on their side. I now turn to the nayail scheme.

They never made any attempt to arrive at itThe matter continues to engage the serious consideration of the Government. And now this year there is the still small voice saying, "" it is hoped that an early opportunity will present itself ""-the opportunity is not to be made by anybody, but is to come along"" for settling the question of the consolidation of the State debts. ""States recognised their proper obligations to How are the mighty fallen 1 The Prime Minister, when he laid down his policy in the famous Gympie speech in 1909, made much of the absolute necessity of taking over the State debts. He pointed out, by ; means of some calculations, which I should not care to father or back up, that there would be a saving of £26,000,000 over a period. Would it not have been a nice thing if lie had saved that amount and put it into the Fleet? That would have been what I should call good business, but we have not heard anything more about it. In my speech on the State debts question, in 1906, I pointed out that a scheme on the lines I suggested, with a sinking fund of J per cent., would pay off the whole debt of £250,000,000 in about sixty years. The Prime Minister did not acknowledge his authority, but he quoted me, and of course imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. He told the people that that sum could be saved by taking over the State debts, and that even with a sinking fund of J per cent., which was the remainder of my illustration, the total amount would be paid off in eightyseven years. It was in 1909 that the Prime Minister made that speech. We are now, in 1.912, in totally different circumstances, bedifficult by taking over things from the cause the honourable gentleman has a Government, as he had not then, with a majority in both Houses. Yet all he now says is that he trusts an opportunity will come along to deal with this supereminently important question. That is a lamentable state of affairs. I do not say that the settlement of the State debts question is an easy thing, and I might tell the honourable gentleman that he has complicated. it a good deal since that time, and made it more difficult to settle on reasonable terms, because any settlement that In the Governor General's had to be come to under my scheme meant a reasonable co-operation with the Governments of .the States, whose minds I sought to disabuse of suspicion, and whose States, responsible tp the people of their separate States for the development of their own territories, I always sought to respect. While I wanted the Federal Gomost vernment to have a control of the borrowings so as to arrange them, I never contemplated, but protested against, the idea that, when the Commonwealth did take over the State debts, they should in any way hamper the States in borrowing money to develop their own territories, provided that the the Federal Government, who, of course, would be responsible for the debts.

100,Mr Harper,"I was going to showwithout any deduction whatever, and incurred no responsibility. Our David viewed his neighbour Naboth's vineyard, his little £90,000 a year. He said, ""I will take that,"" and he took it. There are other things that the Government have done, but I shall not deal with them, as they are beyond the scheme of my remarks at present. I have given one case, which shows the spirit in which the Governments and interests of the States are looked upon by the powers that be. These things do not tend to harmony or co-operation. We ought to co-operate as far as we can, because we are all servants of the Australian public, a fact which apparently is forgotten. to do things that will cause a feeling of irritation and annoyance to intervene in important affairs. While Ministers are open to the charge of having missed a great opportunity, of having kept the country in ignorance-if they are not in ignorance themselves-of the enormous responsibilities incurred, and of having failed to tell us how they are going to meet those responsibilities, they have not kept out of finance. They have begun at the wrong end. I always recognised that when the debts of the States came to be taken over, and other financial arrangements made, there should be a commission of the Treasury, an organ of the Commonwealth, which would be above all the States ih finance, to deal with the renewal of the State debts, the flotation of additional loans, the facilitation of flotation, the reuncomfortable for him. But that is what moval of competition, and so forth. I advocated that. I did not advocate the establishment of a bank, though a bank might answer the purpose. When Ministers established a bank, they should have commenced in that way. They might have got their good man-I believe the Prime Minister was prepared to pay £10,000 a year for such a man, and they might well have paid that-and consulted with him . before framing their banking law. Instead of doing so, they have appointed a man to a position which they have made for him, and which it will be very difficult for any trained banker to fill. They should have started their bank before dealing with the note issue. Who ever heard of a note issue except one administered by or through a bank or banks ? It was to be expected that the bank would be started on proper lines, that the administration of the note issue would be part of its functions, and that other things would follow in proper sequence; but the cart has been put before Ur. Harfer. the horse. These facts show that Ministers have never carefully considered the finaiicial_ obligations of their position in connection with either the public expenditure, the taking over of the debts of the State%, or the starting of a bank. They began with a land tax. One may not be opposed to, or even be in favour of, a proposal of my honourable friends, but if he dares to criticise their proposal, or if he is not willing that the thing shall be done exactly as they wish to do it, his name is anathema, they will have nothing to do with him, and they denounce him. as an opponent of the proposal itself. The imposition We ought not of land taxation was always admitted to be within the power of the Commonwealth; but it was understood by the framers of the Constitution that any 'direct taxation should be imposed only under the stress of extraordinary circumstances. The Government had a perfect right to propose a land tax, and had a majority to pass it, but it might have listened to those who pointed out that it would be wise to act justly in the matter, and that regard should be had to the fact that this is a debtor country. We owe £240,000,000, of which £180,000,000, and possibly a good deal more, is owed to Great Britain. Surely mere business prudence would have suggested that the land tax should not be made as obnoxious as possible to our creditors. A prudent business man would not slap a creditor in the face, or make things the Government did. An objection to the land tax is that it was never proposed to the electors that city property should be taxed, and that holdings in various cities and towns all over Australia, of companies like banking corporations should be aggre""gated, and treated as one large estate for the application of the progressive rate. pose did that serve? ber may well ask. A land tax was advocated by the Labour party as a means for promoting settlement, and it is claimed to have had that effect, though, as the honourable member has shown, on insufficient grounds. What bursting-up policy can be served by taxing the land on which branch banks are built, or, taking my own case, factories in different States of the Commonwealth? I am made to pay a large sum annually because I have interests in different properties in five States; they lump the values together, and make",33,Smith Th E Honourable Thereby I F We Had Not Borrowed About

What good thing is served by doing that? Of all pitiful, mean things, and the most impolitic, the imposition of what is called the absentee provision is the worse. I say "" t h e most impolitic."" because it is the part of the scheme which, perhaps, has done more than any other to cause a feeling of bitterness amongst British investors, of which the Prime Minister, according to my advices from London, had a taste when he met a number of city men there. It has caused a deep-seated feeling of injustice. And what is the whole product of the absentee tax ? Can the right honourable gentleman say ?

It is very often the very small things in life which cause the most irritation. We make £ 6 2 , 0 0 0 out of the absentee tax, and we get the name of being unjust, unfair, ungrateful ; because many of the persons who are thus exceptionally taxed in England have, perhaps, never been in this country, but have sent their money here for investment when money was greatly wanted, and have been content for many years been content with a very small interest. I can assure the honourable gentleman. A to respect old age. late Prime Minister of England, the Right Honourable W. E . Gladstone, had a good able member that I did not allude to him, deal of money invested here at one time, and that he was not in my thoughts. but his successors have withdrawn a large portion of it .

The Again, let me ask, was it ever people who sent their money here and invested it in good faith have good reason to feel a sense of irritation. I recommend the Prime Minister, who heard what people in London think of the absentee tax, at an early date to consider whether, seeing that so small an amount is involved, he ought not to repeal it. I am not interested in absentees. I do not know any absentee freeholders, but I know absentees who are not freeholders. It is only absentee freeholders who are specially taxed. If a man has a station in Riverina which is bringing him in £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 , he may, if he is a leaseholder from thc Crown, live where he likes; he does not pay a shilling of our land tax. Buti f a man has the same value in freehold, and lives in London, he has to pay heavily, and his property is depreciated. I recommend my right honourable friend, if he contemplates dealing with the State debts, to clear the decks before doing so, by making it known here and abroad that he is prepared to do a fair thing all round in taxation and other I s that all that they are matters.

I desire to say something about the as the result of the Labour policy there would be no more 20 per cent, dividends, no more large bonuses. What are the facts about the banks? The total paid-up capital of the banks is £20,000,000. They have what is in America called a surplus, but what is called here a reserve fund. They have a rest of £10,000,000, which is composed of surplus profits, over and above what they choose to draw in dividends. If a bank makes £10,000 in a year and declares a dividend which absorbs £5,000, the directors put £5,000 to the reserve fund of the bank for its benefit. And that sum, although it is not part of the capital account, is part of the capital. That is where honourable gentlemen on the other side make a great mistake "" A little knowledge is a danwhen they talk of 20 per cent, dividends.

Some of the banks declared a dividend of 20 per cent, on a small paid-up capital with a big reserve. ing price of the shares. directors, and shareholders in banks are not, as is sometimes said, bloated millionaires; they include tens of thousands of people of small means, who may hold from five to twenty shares, because they get a better return than they would get from leaving their money in the Savings Bank. On the 30th June, 1911, the liabilities of the banks were £148,000,000, the assets were £159,000,000, and the capital and reserves were £30,000,000, with 2,003 branches throughout the States of. Australia. The banks are a great civilizing instrument. Wherever there are a few farmers or other people in a village, the first thing they do is to send to Melbourne or Sydney an application for the establishment of a branch bank, which at once brings them into communication with the rest of the business world. Without such a means they feel that they are outside, not knowing what is going on, and they find it impossible to remit ot draw money, or transact business generally. To traduce banking institutions, as they are traduced, is simply an evidence that people have very little knowledge of the facts they profess to understand. The banking system as carried on in Australia has been of enormous and untold benefit. The banks have enjoyed the confidence of the people; and in the great cataclysm of 1893, 1 think only one or two of the smaller banks did not pay 20s. in the £ 1 . On that occasion shareholders suffered, but creditors received their money, except in the cases referred to. It is not often one gets an oppojtunity to put the true facts before the public, and I desire to do so now. I have here a return with which the Prime Minister must be acquainted, because 1 think he had it inserted in Hansard. It is in the form of a parliamentary paper showing the paid-up capital and the profits of all the banks from 1885 up to the present date. From 1885 to 1892 the-average profit on banking stock, without counting the reserve funds, was from 12^ to 13 per cent. In 1893, the year of the crisis, the average profit The banking institudropped to 7.20 per cent., so that it will be seen that the lot of the banker is not always a happy one. In 1894, it fell still further to 4 per cent., in 1895 to 3 per cent., in 1896 to 2.81 per cent., while in 1897 it was 3.7 per cent., in 1898 it was 3.16 per cent., in 1899 it was 3.27 per cent. Then it began to rise. In 1900, the year of the inauguration of Federation, the average profit rose to 4 per cent., in 1901 it was 4.88 per cent., in 1902 it was 5.15 per cent., in 1903 it was 5.50 per cent., in 1904 it was 6.05 per cent., in 1905 it was 6.31 per cent., in 1906 it was 6.42 per cent, in 1907 it was 7.26 per cent., in 1908 it was 7.44 per cent., in 1909 it was 7.70 per cent., and in 1910 it was 7.74 per cent. For the year 1911 there is no return. For about ten years the average dividends of all the banks, on their stock, and not including reserve funds-man y of the banks lost their reserves-wa s from 2 per cent, to 4 per cent. An honourable member opposite referred to me as talking like a schoolmaster, and perhaps I do; but there is a lesson to be learned from these figures. And the lesson is, I think, a telling answer to the misrepresentations which are so current, and which have such a mischievous effect on the mass of the people who have no accurate knowledge of the facts of the case. serves ? men, I am sorry to say, are not ashamed to insinuate that every man who has anything to do with business or finance, or who is an employer, is by nature a villain.

I wish to point out that the banks do a great work, and recognise that they have an important duty to perform. I believe that they do it admirably. It is not because I am a bank shareholder that I say that. I get no dividends out of banks. I know of what I speak, however. I know how their business is conducted. banking is not the haphazard game that my honourable friends opposite apparently think it is. They say lightly, "" We are going to start a bank which is going to do good to the workmen by giving them overdrafts at less than they would have to pay the other banks."" will have no overdrafts. do not get overdrafts unless they have very good security; and even then there is in connection with many of the banks an unwritten law that as a rule ho bank director shall keep his account with the bank of which he is a director. It is true that I keep a small amount of money-that which I receive from this Parliament-in an account with the bank of which I am a director; but that is always a credit account. be a shareholder of the bank of which he is a director. holder. It is one of those banks that got into trouble, and I had the honour to help it running down, he directs his subordinates through. I have some shares in it, but I get no dividends from them, being satisfied that if the shares do not return me dividends in my lifetime they are a good asset, and my heirs and assigns will get something out of them. member say that the directors of the Van Diemen's Land Bank had no overdrafts with the institution? the Van Diemen's Land Bank. I wish to impress upon honourable members opposite that banking is by no means an easy matter. They talk as though banking were quite a simple business. One honourable member referred to the banks having £50,000,000 of deposits on which they pay no interest, and looks upon that as a very heinous offence; but I apprehend that the men who have credit balances are not foolish. They would not keep their they could get anything upon it. They must be obtaining some advantage. There is an all-round advantage. It is to be remembered that against these deposits the banks have to keep a large sum unemployed. That is where the occupants of the Treasury bench seem to have made a very grave blunder. TheyI know that talk about gold as if it were merely a commodity. In fact, the Prime Minister says that it is. In this country, gold is, in a sense, a commodity, because we produce gold and have to ship it to make up for deficiency of export of other commodities. Regarding gold as being of value in itself, Ministers took from the banks £10,000,000 of their gold reserve, as' confusion in their ideas as between coin and credit. Coin is the' basis of credit. Coin indicates credit. If a bank has £10,000,000 in coin in its coffers, and is known to have it, the banker lends out money accordingly. If he finds that his coin reserve runs down to, say, £5,000,000, he must draw in his advances, recognising that he is getting into a dangerous position. Banking is the science of dealing with money not merely taking into account the purely economic side of finance, but also judging of human nature and human impulse. It is extraordinary how an able banker can tell you in a moment exactly what his position is. He gives out his orders accordingly. When he finds that his reserve is to withhold making advances for a while. At such a time an intending borrower going to a bank manager, not knowing that he is acting under instructions, and being informed by the banker that the proposed loan does not suit them, goes away dissatisfied, and pronounces him to be a hard hearted, unreasonable man. The true reason is that he has no money to lend, because his head office has notified him that advances have gone beyond the bank's income from deposits, and that it is therefore necessary to draw in a little in order to let the existing obligations falling due to the bank increase until the balance is adjusted.

Let honourable members look at table 64, page 4.3, of the last Finance Bulletin. there an account of coin and bullion held by banks of issue from 1902 to 1911, and in table 58 we have the total liabilities of the banks to the public for the samp years. I have taken out the figures, and find that for the eleven years in question the average holding of all banks in Australia was 21 per cent, of gold coin to the whole of their liabilities to the public. member will also notice that the total of noninterest-bearing deposits is £62,000,-JOO. with the point I am now discussing? All their liabilities to the public-includin g deposits at call, deposits on time, and note issue-ar e included in this return, and it shows that they were trading on a margin of 20 per cent. With a gold reserve of 20 per cent., the banks can make advances to five times that amount. The returns that 1 have here show that in Canada the banks have a margin of only 10 per cent., but those figures are misleading, since they do not include the gold which the Canadian banks may have in New York, which is, so to speak, their "" L o n d o n , "" as a financial centre. I mention that fact only because I do not wish honourable members to draw the inference that our own position in this respect is much better than that of Canada. Table 67, which also appears in this bulletin, shows that for the whole eleven years' period the banks actually held in coin and bullion 51 per cent, of their call liabilities, including notes. The Treasurer of the Commonwealth, however, in respect of a more subtle and uncertain liability, desires to have a gold reserve of only 25 per cent. These are instructive facts. of of five times that amount of credit. That being so, a banker knows that he is on safe ground when he has 20 per cent, of coin to his total obligations. trouble ahead, he, as a wise man, quietly reduces his advances and gets his coin up io its proper ratio. I have shown that from 21 per cent, to 22 per cent, is the margin which bankers have found by experience to be safe; and honourable members must recognise that banking is not that rough-andready system of trading that many seem to think it is. On the contrary, it is a highly technical science. tive. is more timid and sensitive than is the banker. Some of us, who are not bankers, but who are thrown very largely into association with them, are sometimes surprised at their sensitiveness and timidity. A man coming in from outside, and possessing a firm grip, is able to "" put a little ginger "" into them sometimes to make them do that which they think is off the beaten track, but And the honourable which is necessary, and generally proves satisfactory. There are two matters in respect of the past for which the Government take credit in His Excellency's Speech, and these are that the note issue and the land tax have each proved a great success. I desire to remind the House that the Land Tax Bill was only introduced in 1910, and that the tax itself, although it was made retrospective, was not paid until late in the financial year 1910-11. Ministers and their supporters, however, claim that in this short period the tax has had a marvellous effect in settling people on the land. The honourable member for Wimmera demolished that contention so far as the effect of the tax in Victoria is concerned, and, in doing so, he followed up the figures that I put before the House in 1910. I then traced up to that year the position, not only in this State, but in New South Wales, and showed that, long before a Federal land tax was seriously spoken of, a great movement in the subdivision and settlement of land was taking place. The reasons for this are on tlie surface. They have nothing to do with, the land tax. The introduction of improved systems of farming, the use of superphosphates, and the bountiful seasons which Heaven has sent us, were and are the causes responsible for the subdivisions They show that £10,000,00 0 and settlement that have taken place up to gold will bear a superstructure the present time. I need say no more on that subject. Let me now refer to the note issue, which If he sees is the Government's one little ewe lamb. We are told, in the Governor General's Speech, that it is a great success. During this debate, the Prime Minister, as well as the mover and seconder of the Address-inReply, emphasized this point; and the Honorary Minister, by way of interjection, asserted that the Opposition are becoming so envious of its success that, in a very short time, they will be claiming it as their own.

On the 9th of November last Senator Pearce said in the only deliverance I have been able to find which throws any light on the intentions of the Government in this matterWe had a report from Admiral Henderson as to what, in his opinion, were the best lines on which to base the Commonwealth naval policy. In their naval policy the Government are endeavouring to follow these lines, as far as the recommendations made cover the immeson saw fit to refer to a period of time covering twenty-one years, which he divided into three periods of seven years each. The honourable senator was wrong in that, as Admiral Henderson dealt with a period which he divided into four periods of five years each; but perhaps it comes to about the same thing. Senator Pearce went on to. saySo far the Government are directing their attention to the first period of seven years; although, as Admiral Henderson points out, what is done to-day ought to be done with a view to the period ahead and the development which will follow from the taking of the pro-, posed steps. I claim that that shows that the Government, while necessarily dealing only with the present, are doing so on the supposition that the policy adopted is to be continued and carried out. As a matter of fact, and, as I have already said, it stands to reason that we cannot and dare not stop. We have taken up a certain position with respect to the Government of the Mother Country, and in the eyes of the world. It is a right and proper position. We say that we are going to defend our country, and we must pay the cost. My objection to our friends of the Government is that they, apparently, have not counted the cost. I say that we must count the cost which we shall be called upon to pay and provide the money. I shall now proceed to deal with the note issue. I was hopeful that the Prime Minister would be present to tell us . in what respect or respects he considers it a success.

As my honourable friend experiences a difficulty in making his meaning clear, I am endeavouring to act the part of the Good Samaritan by saying for him what he wishes to say himself. I take it that what honourable members opposite mean is that the Commonwealth note' issue has been a success, because it has aggregated £10,000,000, and latterly £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , as against about £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 when the notes were issued by the banks. view. the makes answer is that it did not require to be made safe, and that it was a good deal safer when it was in the hands of the banks. Formerly, they were responsible for the note issue, which, including the State of Queensland, totalled on an average £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . In all the States except one these notes were a first charge upon the assets of the banks, and if my honourable friends had desired to make the issue safer, they could have accomplished their object by simply passing a short Act making that condition apply to all the States. If that had £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 would then have had behind it the security of a first charge on j ithe whole of the ase'sts of the banks. It £30,000,000 of coin, which, in my judgment is a good deal better than the security about which honourable members opposite have talked so much. ThenI would invite the House not to lose sight of the difference which exists between coin and credit. I ask honourable members to draw a distinction between immediate and ultimate ability to pay. I have heard the Prime Minister declare that the CommonweaUh note issue has the whole of the resource? of the Commonwealth behind it. So it has. I do not doubt that ultimately Australia will pay all her debts. But whether she could pay them on the nail is entirely a different matter. I repeat that a distinction must be D i d they ? How wondrawn between the ability to meet obliThis gentleman gations immediately, and the ability to meet them ultimately. When we are told that If he were to express the Commonwealth note issue has the security of all Australia behind it , instead of £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth of gold, my reply Otherwise, the is that any banker would say, "" We do not want the Commonwealth security. We would rather have the gold."" When the Government say that the security of the Commonwealth is a better practical security than is the gold, I say that it is not. As I have previously pointed out, a man who has a bill to meet is not inclined to proffer Commonwealth securities for his debt. The creditor wants coin. Nothing but coin will satisfy him. Consequently, if the Government have so disposed of the coin of the banks that they could not obtain it immediately if it were demanded, the I differ from that security offered to the public is not half as It has also been affirmed that good as it was previously. I will deal security of the Commonwealth presently with the other contention, that the note issue safe. My the amount of the notes in use has been doubled. We have all been given to understand that in compelling the banks to keep a certain amount of Commonwealth notes we are following the precedent established by Canada. I wish that we had. If before going into this scheme the Prime Minduring the last few years ister had made a study of the banking system of Canada, he would have been prevented-assumin g he were permitted to exercise his own judgment-fro m falling into a most grievous error. I do not intend to describe the Canadian banking system, but I wish to make perfectly clear the position of the note issue there. In been done, the note issue of Canada it is true the banks are compelled to keep 40 per cent, of their reservethat is of their indebtedness to the publicin Dominion notes. But these notes are would have been backed by practically gold certificates, because the arrangement is that while the banks thus piit 40 per cent, of their funds in the hands of the Government, the latter are required to keep only 25 per cent, of $30,000,000that is, £6,000,000-in gold. Upon all the notes issued in excess of $30,000,000, dollar for. dollar must be kept in gold in the Treasury. That position is very different from the position into which the Government will plunge this country if they have their way.

174,Mr Harper,"I have been able to obtain returns-the Dominion notes issued in Canada aggregated about $80,000,000, or £16,091,278. The Treasury, on the same date, held specie to the extent of $62,759,800, or £12,551,960, and special sterling debts guaranteed by the Imperial Government, and considered as good as gold, to the extent of £3 9>3338 Thus they held in round figures £13,000,000 in gold against an issue of £16,000,000, or 87 per cent. That is a very different position from ours. But there is a still greater difference, because the Canadian Government, in projecting this plan for their finances, did not attempt the rather ignoble policy in which our Government indulge, of trying to abstract a few thousands out of the banks or from the States. They went into this matter honestly to secure that the bank note issue would be above suspicion. I think another reason was that as Canada was not a goldproducing country, and until 1908, when a mint was established at Ottawa, the current coin in Canada was United States and British money, Canada had no gold issue of its own. But after the Yukon fields were opened up, a branch of the Royal Mint was established at Ottawa; and, to some extent, they are producing gold; but in Canada, as in the case of Glasgow, Dublin, Liverpool, and Manchester, whose reserves are held in the Bank of England in London, apart from the deposit which is held by the Government in Ottawa, the reserves of the Canadian banks are mostly held in New York. Consequently. I think it is quite likely, although result has been attained in Canada, but we it is unavowed, that this provision was intended also to retain within the Dominion of Canada, in view of possible eventualities, a certain amount of gold coin which otherwise would not be there. The Dominion note issue then is represented, to the Prime Minister repeated the statement, that extent of 87 per cent, by coin absolutely held, and so those notes are really gold cersuccess. tificates. They are used by the banks as such in their exchange operations, because they are just as good as gold. I omitted to sav that the notes for 1 dollar and up to 4 dollars are issued by the Dominion only, safety, and revenue. while notes for 5 dollars and over are issued by the banks. When that £16,000,000 of notes was issued, no less than £11,607,500 was in large .notes of £100, £200, and £1,000, which were used and held by the banks as legal tender notes or gold certificates, which to them were the same as gold, which they counted in their reserves as gold, and which, in Mr Harper. making their advances, they considered as gold. The Canadian banks are allowed to issue notes to the extent of their capital, and these notes are the current coin of the Dominion. At the same time as there was $80,000,000, or £16,000,000, worth of Dominion notes, mainly in the hands of the banks, there were bank notes issued by the banks for $71,847,552, or within $8,000,000 worth of the total amount of the Dominion notes, and these, with the exception of £3,462,058 worth of small Dominion notes, were the currency of the country. In Canada there is no note tax. The Government holds the reserve, and' leaves to the banks the duty of providing an elastic currency for the people. I could, if there was time, quote from the last report of the Commission of the United States Senate which is inquiring into the best system of public finance for the United States. It is stated in that document that the Canadian system is most elastic and admirable. The proof of that lies in the fact that, in the great crisis of 1907, when the United States of America had a terrific financial convulsion, affecting even London and Europe, the Canadian banks came through with flying colours, and almost without pressing their borrowers to reduce their advances. The system is very complete, and, as I have said, furnishes an elastic currency. Elasticity is the primary requirement of any currency. It should adjust itself to the requirements of the people, increasing as they increase, and shrinking as they diminish. That here have done the very opposite. Now that the Prime Minister is present, may I ask him in what respect he considers the Australian note issue a success? It is stated in the Governor General's Speech, and the the Commonwealth note issue has lieen a wealth notes more convenient than the bank notes? In my opinion, they are not, and cannot be shown to be, more convenient ; and, therefore, I dismiss the plea. I have already shown that they are not more secure than the bank note issue, because the bank notes were a first charge on the assets of the banks, and had behind 1",41,Smith An D The Directors Against The Note Issue But There Is A

Now for the third plea, that they provide more revenue than the bank notes. I have gone into this matter with considerable care, and it has opened to me a most interesting study. That the honourable the Treasurer should tell Parliament and the country that the present arrangement would be more advantageous than that which it displaced, passes my comprehension. The Government passed an Act making Commonwealth notes alone legal tender, thus preventing the Queensland Government from continuing the issue of notes. It passed another Act, with whose terms the Prime Minister was apparently not acquainted, making it penal for any bank after a certain date to issue notes, the penalty being 10 per cent. The Prime Minister apparently did not understand that that was the effect of the measure, because he contradicted the honourable member for North Sydney absolutely when he drew -attention to it. This is the Hansard report of what occurred-take these notes because they would be liable to a 10 per cent, tax if they did not. lber that that is not so.

Apparently he goes'through the world with his ""head in the air and his chin up, without taking the trouble :to .ascertain the mean[22] o ing of measures for which he is responsible. When he contradicted the honourable membei for North Sydney, he was evidently not conversant with this provision. The law practically compels the banks to take the ThereCommonwealth notes. . Those who control these institutions very properly pointed out the objections to the proposals of the Government. They stated that they were paying a tax of 2 per cent, to the States on the notes that they issued, and that they were bearing the whole cost of providing, renewing, and keeping a register of those notes, which they estimated to be equivalent to from J to I and possibly 1 per cent., making the total cost of the note issue to them from 2f to 3 per cent. That is what they were paying for a system which, while a convenience to them, was also a great convenience to the public. The Government took over the issuing of notes, and incidentally the control of the till money of the banks. Under the old system, the bank note issue had not cost the banks anything except the maintenance and the tax. The till money consisted of their own notes, which did not count unless they were used. The till money, it turns out, amounts to three-fifths of the Commonwealth note issue. We are told that the note issue is a marvellous success, because the amount, which used to run from £3,800,000 to £4,000,000, has gone up to £9,000,000 or £10,600,000. And an honourable gentleman who spoke to-night-and he is not singular-insinuate d that owing to this supposed increased circulation the banks, when they had the note issue and were paying the tax, falsified their accounts and understated the amounts in issue. That was a very nasty insinuation to make, and one which should not be made except on the clearest evidence. Now what are the facts? They are set out in the Financial Bulletin, No. 5, and anybody that runs can read. In table No. 60, page 42, is set out the amount of bank notes issued from 1902 to 1911 by the banks of Australia. Up to the new issue, Queensland had its own issue separately, and, incidentally, the Queensland issue shows what margin is required for till money. There is a considerable margin needed for that purpose. I find that in 1902, when the amount of notes in the hands of the public in Queensland was £557,651, the total note issue for Australia was £3,862,786, including that of Queensland.

I am now merely indicating what would have happened if the note issue had been instituted in 1905 or 1906 instead of at a time when the coin in the banks was at an unprecedentedly high figure, and pointing out that, but for the fact that the financial position was very easy, the transfer of this £10,000,000 of gold coin would have had a serious effect. I am not a man. who is wise after the event. I told the Prime Minister last, year that, in my opinion, his legislation would have the effect of raising the bank rate; and it has done so. The very first occasion on which there was an appearance of a beginning of bad times, the bankers found that they had to give a higher rate for money than previously, and the rate went up J per cent.

The rich, or comparatively I have been rich, man who has plenty to live on is not, as a rule, enterprising; it is the struggling man who requires the aid of capital, and who, in borrowing money, has to pay every time. This is a peculiar result for the Labour party to bring about; and I challenge the Prime Minister to contradict my clearly logical conclusion. The Government take 10,000,000 sovereigns, and lock them up, diminishing to that extent the lending power of the banks; and instead of making the currency elastic, they have made it as dull as lead. The power of the banks to advancemoney was diminished, according to the bank returns, to the extent of, perhaps, £50,000.000. That is a curious result to be brought about by a Labour Government who do not believe in capital, but who are really "" greasing the fat pig.""

Of this sum it is estimated that notes amounting to about £3,682,000 are in the hands of the public, the banks holding upwards of £6,000,000. purpose of the Government in holding a reserve of pound for pound beyond ,£7,000,000 was understood to be the protection of noteholders by insuring a payment in f u l l in coin of notes presented. If , however, the fixed proportion is altered as now suggested, ancl the banks for any reason found it necessary to materially reduce the amount of their Commonwealth notes it would seem that the reduced gold reserve would not suffice to pay in full the notes held by the banks. The banks have freely given their assistancewhich they have done honestly and fairlyin regard lo the establishment of a Government note issue. They hold at present upwards of 60 per cent, of the issue. It is, however, a matter of considerable disappointment and regret to find that it is proposed to make a change in conditions which they have regarded as essential both for tlieir own protection and that of the public at large. Mr W. H . IRVINE -What was the date of that? last year. I would say to the Prime Minister that he is committing an act of political dishonesty if he does not keep up the reserve. from the banks a £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, and lending it out at 3^ per cent. amount out of it which is not worth considering in the light of our public credit and honour. having taken away £10,000,000 which the banks would otherwise have had in their coffers, and which would have enabled them to keep up their advances in accordance with their usual practice, the Prime Minister, his Government, and his party, have done this country a grievous wrong. Whenever the fact becomes known-if what I aro saying secures publicity-it will have a great effect. Because the facts are incontestable. does these things is a success is ridiculous. I say that the coin held by the Treasurer, as far as it is represented by notes issued in excess of £ 7 , 0 0 0 , 00 0 ought to be retained in the Treasury, so that these notes should be in Australia, as in Canada, equal to gold certificates; and that the hankers should be able to take them into their balance-sheets as equivalent to coin, knowing that they have only to send to the Treasury for coin if they want it . What has been done with this money ? We are informed that it has been lent to the States. I told the Prime Minister last year that I thought that his views about the State debts question were such that it was a wrong thing for him to grant loans to the States. The He ought to have made them face the music of finding their money elsewhere, if he wanted to come to terms with them for the transfer of their debts. Nothing does more to convince me that the right honourable gentleman does not mean to touch the State debts than his action in lending the States money. I have been greatly interested in tracing out a peculiar series of transactions in connection with the note issues of which I should like to have an explanation, and pending which I do not desire to characterize as I should do under other circumstances. I confess that I was put on the track as to these peculiar transactions by the Prime Minister himself. The Age asserts that Hansard is not read by the people. I confess that I do not read it very often, but I occasionally turn to it, and sometimes discover in it some interesting items. In pursuit of information concerning the note issue and its alleged success, as claimed by the Prime Minister, I turned to Hansard to see what the right honourable gentleman had to say in respect of it when He will be practically taking making his Budget statement last year. I forced loan of found that on 26th October, 1911, he described the actual position, and, foreshadowHe will be getting a beggarly ing the introduction of a Bill which was to increase the public convenience, he spoke very strongly of its success. The AusI feel that in that respect, tralian Bank Notes Tax Act came into operation on ist July, 1911, and since that date the banks have ceased to issue their , own notes. The Prime Minister, as reported in Hansard, Vol. LXL , page 1900, said of the Australian notes issueAt the close of the financial year the Australian notes in circulation amounted to ,£8,031,217. In addition, the f u n d , had received interest amounting. to £6,400. The total amount to be dealt with thus amounted to £8,037.626. We disposed of the amount in the To claim that a measure that following way, viz., we obtained gold amounting to £3,352,281 ; we made investments, of which I shall give details presently, amounting to £4,642,500; we held on current account in the banks £iq,346, and we had spent in purchase of note forms and other expenses £ 3>4°Q2 .

He gives particulars of other examinations he made, and he generally says what the proportion' of notes to coin was. But I quote his own words concerning an examination he made on the 14th November, 1911Singe the 30th June last a number of visits have been made to further check the gold coin reserve, the total gold verified on the 14th November, 1911I ask honourable members to note the datethe j4t.l1 November, rgn-and the fact that Mr Fisher's speech was made on 26th Octoberbeing £4,692,077, of which sum £4,668,000 was placed under seal; £23,000 was seen in thc .Inner Treasury; and £1,077 Treasury Teller on account of the reserve. As the notes in circulation then amounted to £10,076,335, the reserve was equal to about 46 per cei\t. of this amount. But Mr Israel does not go on to add what I have added. I took out the figures, and I find that the statutory reserve of coin which should have been in the Treasury on the date of that examination was not £4,692,077, which Mr Israel says was there, but £4,826,335, so that the gold reserve was short by £134,248. I am not now discussing how the money was afterwards invested, but the fact that the coin which, over the signature of the Auditor General, is said to have been held at the date of that examination was £134,248 short of the amount required by law. That needs answering or explanation. To go back to my question as to how the money was disposed of, a very strange thing Happened in that connection. The right honourable member for Swan was last year very exacting in making inquiries as to the Trust Fund. information is sometimes insatiable. The honourable member for Parkes was equally persistent. It is really almost laughable to consider the way in which this matter was handled, l t remains to be seen why it was so handled. I find that, on the 31st October last, the honourable member for Parkes asked the Prime Minister the following questions upon notice1. The difference between thc amount of the notes issued (£9,718,084) and the gold coin reserve (£4,686,148) being £5,031,936, will he say on how much of the latter sum the Treasury is actually receiving interest? 2. W ill he say to whom those moneys out of the latter sum have been lent, and at what rates of interest are the borrowers being charged on the several advances? Mr Narfer. 1. £4,959,048. This sum is arrived at in the £ Notes in circulation ... ... 9,718,084 Gold in Treasury ... ... 4,686,148 Notes issued for which payment had not been received at 25th October, 1911 ... ... ... ... 83,000 4>948J936 Interest received from investments ... ... £38,055 Less expenses of Note Issue ... ... 27,943 4,959, 4S 0 Then followed a list of investments, which w as n e l d b V t h e is the same as on the 30th June already referred to. But the sting, as usual, is in the tail. There is an item of £316,548 described as Portion of investment of £619,000, as explained below. That is money which was received at some period, which was paid into the Trust Fund, and, instead of being invested for the note issue, was left there in order, as I consider, to conceal the fact that if the Department had paid for these investments it would have brought the gold reserve considerably below the statutory amount. This is the explanationThe amount of £316,548 is portion of an amount of £619,000 which has been invested from the general trust funds in the following way, viz. :Victorian Government debentures (face value of £300), interest at the rate o£ 3^ per cent, per annum ... ... ... £294,000 Tasmanian Government inscribed stock, interest at the rate of 3^ His appetite for per cent, per annum ... ... 300,000 Fixed deposits with banks, interest at the rate of 3^ per cent, per annum ... ... ... 25,000 £619,000 As funds were not available in the Notes Fund when the investments were made, the amount was invested temporarily out of the General Trust Funds. As funds accumulate in the Australian Notes Account transfers are made to the Notes Account. When I read these answers I am irresistibly reminded of the Prime Minister's first Budget, when he balanced the income with the expenditure to a penny. I come now to the experience of the right honourable member for Swan some three weeks later. Upon the 12th December of the -same year, as well be seen by reference were set apart, and that he, as a trustee, to Hansard, page 4123, the right honourable would not consent to anything of the kind member asked the Treasurer, upon notice1.

To say the least of it, with the information before me, it appear to me that the replies of the Prime Minister were rather disingenuous. As Hansard will show, there is no greater stickler for the sacredness of the Trust Funds than is the Prime Minister. I recollect the occasion upon which the honourable member for Ballarat, as head of the Government, proposed to temporarily transfer from the Trust Funds the sum of .£1,500,000 for the construction of ships of the Fleet unit. sent Prime Minister rose in his place and. repelled the idea with great warmth. (He said that these Trust Funds should be ,'kept sacred to the purpose for which they proposed. Upon other occasions he has law is perfectly clear on the subject. Sec(1) The moneys derived from the issue of Australian notes and any interest thereon shall be placed to the credit of an account called the Australian Notes Account, which shall be a Trust Account within the meaning of the Audit Acts 1901-1906. (2) Part of the moneys standing to the credit of the Australian Notes Account shall be held by the Treasurer in gold coin for the purposes of the reserve provided for in section 9 of this Act, and the Treasurer may invest the renotes on 30th November, 1911, mainder, or any part thereof(a) On deposit in any bank; or (*) in securities of the United Kingdom, 01 of the Commonwealth, or of a State. 1 submit that when the Treasurer had a surplus in hand, if he did not keep it in Government debentures (face gold, he should have placed it in a bank at interest, so that he might be in a position to get the money if he required it, as he might do if a demand suddenly arose for gold. That is the whole object of the provision which I have quoted. It is no answer to me to say that nothing has happened. That is what many defaulters have said. I remember the case of a high official in a bank in Melbourne who was the custodian of the treasury. I believe that in every other respect he was a thoroughly honest man. But he observed that a certain quantity of gold was lying in the bank earning no interest. He thought it was a great shame that it should lie there idle, and accordingly he took the liberty of abstracting it and substituting copper for it. He invested that money, and did very well, and ultimately he repaid it all. He did not mean to swindle the bank. But where did he land ? In gaol. I say that for any trustee -it does not matter whether he is going to make a profit or not-to use Trust Funds in that way is extremely reprehensible. If the object was to make money out of it for the public, he would be doing a very wrong thing. These funds were there for a purpose. It might be that they would never be required for the purpose, but, inasmuch as it was provided by Statute law that they were to be there for that' purpose, no official, Thereupon, the preand no political head, has any right to depart by a hair's breadth from the obligations of the trust deed in any circumstances whatever. I should like to hear the explanation of these transactions, and I hope it will be satisfactory. is not, it is a very bad example to is the very time when the Government, set to the officials in the Public Service, might not be able to raise any money at all and others.

210,Mr Harper,"The honourable memberlater on. I presume he has not seen the honourable meinber about it yet. Another reason why these matters ought to be cleared up is to be found in the extraordinary statements made by the Prime Minister in this debate, on 25th June last, as reported in Hansard of this session, at page 112. He was upholding the success of the Australian note issue, and saidThe Australian Notes Act has been singularly successful, notwithstanding the opposition to it and the fact that honourable members opposite suggested that it was dangerous legislation. We only said it was dangerous if the Government did not keep a proper reserve, and I have shown that they need looking after, to say the least of it. gentleman also saidThe point I wish to emphasize is that the# basic principle of our note issue is that neither the banks nor private persons are asked to bring their gold to the Treasury and accept notes instead of it. If at any time they want gold they can bring their notes back to the Treasury and get gold for them. In a rather undignified way, the Prime Minister stated by interjection that there was plenty of gold in the Treasury, and that if the notes were presented by the lorry load, they could be paid. The honourable member for Indi suggested that were the banks to make a demand on the Treasury for goldto which they were entitled according to his own statement-the Treasurer would retaliate by withdrawing the Government balances in the hands of the banks. The return which I have prepared shows that there is very little money with the banks. In the middle of June of last year there was £1,100,000, and on the 26th June of this year only £425,000 with the banks. The Treasurer, instead of leaving his money with the banks, is putting it into investments of a long-dated character. It is possible that the banks would prefer the Government to take awav its money. Bankers are timid men, and they might argue, "" The Treasurer has deposited £200,000 for a period of twelve months, but if he becomes hard up, he may say, ' I want that money, and therefore I must break my deposit.' "" Politicians have done that before. It might be considerably inconvenient, for a bank to have to find £20o-,ooo under such circumstances. Apparently, the Treasurer intends to invest his surplus money in fixed securities of long date, but if he suddenly finds himself in want of money, he will' have to pay a ruinous price for it. Any attempt to sell his securities, even in England, would bring down the value of Australian securities generally, both here and in the Old Country. Parliament has empowered him to reduce the reserve behind the Commonwealth notes to 25 per cent, on the whole; amount issued, and he has promised that it shall not be less than 40 per cent, until after the next election. Probably he finds it necessary to keep a reserve of between 25 and 40 per cent, as a working balance. VVe are entitled to a full and complete explanation, so that Parliament may know' the position. At some future time a Government might find itself in want of money through lack of foresight, and might use the 25 per cent, reserve, The honourable making the currency inconvertible, in which case the country would be in a helpless position. Reverting to the statements of the Prime Minister, although in; one column of Hansard he is reported as saying that the banks have only got to bring their notes to the Treasury to get their money, on the next he saysI go so far as to say what I recently said on the platform in the electorate of Werriwa, that the banks are too intelligent and too caref u l of their interests to make a raid on the Treasury. It is a "" raid on the Treasury"" to make a demand for the repayment of one's own money 1 Because such an act would undoubtedly recoil upon themselves. A distinct threat. Buti f they did make a disloyal attack upon the TreasuryIt is disloyal to ask for your own ! If t went to the Treasury, and it were inconvenient for the Prime Minister, or any one in his position to pay, he would say, ""You disloyal man, 3*011 blackguard., I shall make your demand recoil on your own head.""Buti f they did make a disloyal attack on the Treasury we could meet it, and afterwardsHere comes the sting in the tail againthey would require to be dealt with as people should be dealt with who endeavoured to do an injury to the community. Good heavens ! A man goes to the Treasury and says, "" I want my 1:0,000 sovereigns "" for Commonwealth notes; the Treasurer has not the money, and says, "" Clear out, or I will have you put out."". It seems almost madness. These statements are on the same page in Hansard. On one side is the statement, "" Come one, come all, your:' money is here ready for y o u "" ; while on the other side we are toldI f they did make a disloyal attack on the Treasury we could meet it, and afterwards they would require to be dealt with as people should be dealt with who endeavour to do an injury to the community. That is a curious idea. I do not know how far that will enhance in the minds of the public, or the banks, or anybody, confidence in this note issue. The fact is that the banks have behaved well. They pushed the Commonwealth issue as they pushed their own notes. They do not pretend that they do it because they are loyal, or disloyal, or anything else. They say that it is good business, that it is more convenient than to send coin to their branches. But suppose that all the banks said, "" Very well, we are not going to keep any notes, but to pay in coin."" ancl that they had no notes in their tills, how long would the Treasurer's note issue continue? That is the treatment which the banks get. The Government supporters suggest that the bankers might rush the Treasury; and the Prime Minister, after saying that they have only to come ancl ask for their money and they will get it, says that they will be dealt with as disloyal men if they do. It is time that we understood where we are. It is time that the people in this country understood the position. This policy of talk, talk, talk to you, evidently. in that way. there is talk and babble. There is talking sense. I may be right or I may be wrong in my inferences; but I think that every honourable member in the House will admit that I have been fair in giving my authorities. I have stated facts, and have drawn my inferences, admitting at the same time that there may te other explanations. I can do no more, I. cannot be expected to do more. The chatterers opposite may laugh, because they can only do that, and nothing more. very different thing to get up to answer me, which they will not do. strong. for Parkes knows f u l l well that in 1893 the New South Wales Government saved the banks. man was a youngster when the banks failed. I was a well-grown man, and was in the thick of the trouble. The honourable member was up country somewhere, pushing his way very properly, and he knows very little about the matter. When he talks about"" the New South Wales Government, I say that they did the right thing. I have always said, and I repeat, that if the advice I gave to the Treasurer of Victoria and the Premier had been acted upon similar action would have been taken in Victoria, and we would not have had so severe a collapse. WhatI am saying now will be taken in the same way, I expect. It is my unpleasant duty to point these things out, and to be railed at because I do it. I feel that as long as I retain a seat in the Houseit is my duty, to the best of my ability and my strength, to bring before Parliament the best thought I can bestow on public matters. If I begin to think, and speak, perhaps, at length in consequence, because I have such a multitude of subjects to deal with, I am railed at. I have any amount of matter which I have not touched. stead of getting up and chattering, I am railed at. It is easy to make a speech. I could make a speech for an hour, and say nothing, with any of them. I could make a speech which, when I had finished, would remind me, or my audience perhaps, as I have been reminded by the speeches of many honourable gentlemen on the other side in this debate, of the crackling of thorns under the pot-crackl e and nothing left behind. I flatter myself that I have to-night put a few matters before Parliament the end of which we have not heard. Therefore, it will not be like the thorns crackling under the pot. The pot will boil the honourable member. I feel that I have done my duty in bringing this matter forward. profit ?

If the policy of the Government be carried on in the way it has been, we shall be like a ship sent to sea without a chart, compass, or rudder, drifting on, not having any adequate conception of what ultimately may happen. It is well with us now; but we are laying the seeds of trouble that may be most disastrous to the future of Australia. I have been nearly sixty years in the country, and may be regarded as very nearly a native. Australia, and I owe much to the country I love it.

After the four or five hours' speech we have heard from the honourable member for Mernda, I think the time has come when there should be some limitation to the length of speeches. I venture to say that the address of the honourable member will not be read by a hundred people in the country. thought. in the speech, anyhow ! able member for Mernda, during the whole of the evening, has been given every indulgence by honourable members, and it is only fair that other honourable members should be heard. honourable member for Mernda has come here to-night as a special pleader for the banks. I do not stand here as a special pleader for any particular institution, but as a representative of the people. honourable member said that the Labour Government and party are like a ship without a rudder or captain. But what do we see to-day? We had the same prognostication before the Labour party occupied the Treasury benches, but we find that the ship of Labour, guided by the present Ministry, has brought prosperity to this country, not only in Victoria, but in every State. The result is that, as the honourable member said, the rate of 'interest has gone u p ; and in every country where there is prosperity the rate of interest rises. When the honourable member for Mernda, in 1893, was at the height of his financial prosperity, the rate of interest went down, and so did the value of the property of the people who had trusted in the banks. Mir. HARPER I was not connected with the banks. shortly afterwards; and the people who have All my interests are in relied on the credit of the banks in the past have suffered. Now we, as a Labour party, have come along to carry out the promiseswhich we have made to the people of this country. We told them that we wished to break down monopolies. The first important measure that we passed was a Land' Tax Act, by means of which we struck at land monopoly. Then we tried to strikeat the banking monopoly. My honorable friend knows how effectively we are striking in that direction, and hence his special pleading for the banks to-night. I ventureto predict, notwithstanding all that my honourable friend has said, that the people of the Commonwealth prefer an Australian, note to a note issued by the banks for which. he has spoken. The honourable member is an old and skilled debater, and understands the art of setting up a man of straw for the purpose of knocking it down. Hehas said that the Government has been extravagant. He enumerated the works that we have in hand. He alluded to the transcontinental railway, the building of the Federal Capital, and the settlement of theNorthern Territory. These enterprises, hesaid, would cost a large amount of money, and he declared that they could not becarried through unless we entered upon a borrowing policy. He has calculated that it would absorb £50,000,000 to carry out those obligations, and, on that assumption, I venture to say that the he argued that we must borrow money. ThePostmaster-General interjected that we do not propose to borrow for the purpose of constructing battleships or for military purposes. That is our policy. The We do'not say that we will not borrow for reproductive works. The programme of our party contains simply an item in favour of the restriction of public borrowing, and' we have never pledged ourselves that we would not borrow for useful works. But we are determined not to borrow for thebuilding of a navy. We can point to the example of the grand old Mother Country, which we are glad to imitate in many ways.

This Labour Government repealed the Naval Loan Act, which my honourable friend supported, and which his party placed upon the statute-book for the purpose of borrowing £3,500,000. Notwithstanding the alleged extravagance of this Government, we promptly repealed that measure, and, so far as we have gone, we have borrowed nothing. lent money to the States. Nevertheless, we shall have a surplus to show at the end -of the financial year. These are simple facts. This is the sort of "" extravagance "" ' that my honourable friend alleges against us! I am not surrounding the subject with a maze of figures for the purpose of mystifying the people, as my honourable friend has done. This Government came into power having to meet a deficit of over £600,000. They have got over that difficulty, and have ended this financial year with a surplus of £2,000,000. Has the party opposite any record like that to show? No, sir. The speech just delivered really had nothing whatever to do with the motion of censure, which condemns the Government as being responsible for industrial unrest. their irresponsibility. member for Wimmera was speaking, he -said that if there were one measure for which this Government was entitled to admiration and support, it was that establishing the note issue. vere a proper gold backing. able member's statement is in Hansard, which tells no falsehood. The honourable member gave credit to the Government for this one measure. I think that the honourable member for Ballarat also eulogized the Government on account of the note issue. . These honourable members are quite out of tune with the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. I wish nmv to say a few words on the industrial question. Industrial unrest is a subject which I have made the study of my life. I think there is a great deal of truth in what has been said, that there is a considerable amount of social discontent, not only in this country, but in every civilized country in the world. I maintain thar no palliative will be sue cessful in settling it. We are living in an age when the people have higher desires and aspirations than has ever been the case before. What was sufficient to satisfy our forefathers will not satisfy the workers of to-day. What was good enough for workers twenty years ago is not good enough for their descendants now. The industrial worker of the past was persuaded to believe that he was only created to be a worker, and that he must be content to reOn the contrary, we have ceive what was barely sufficient to keep body and soul together. But education has been spreading, and a different spirit has come over the people. The coal-miner who goes down into a mine and hews coal for 2s. 1 id. or 3s. per ton sees that that coal is supplied at the ship's side for ns. per ton, and is retailed for 25s. He has intelligence enough to reason that somebody has been robbing him. Where has the surplus gone ? He commences to inquire. He knows that the consumer is taxed by having to pay a high price for his coal, while the man who produces it from the mine gets very little for his labour. Hence there is discontent amongst the coal miners. Why? Because they know that they have been robbed out of a large share of what they are producing. They will be discontented until they get a fair deal. The same applies to an artisan. He can figure out how many thousand feet of timber go to the construction of a house. He knows what it costs to construct the building. He knows what is paid to him and to his fellow-workmen. He has intelligence enough to calculate that he is not being paid properly for his labour. The same is the case all over the world. Consequently, there is universal discontent. In the past, Parliaments have passed measures with the object of keeping the workers under by brute force. Governments have built gaols and penitentiaries, maintained constables, and elevated Judges to the bench to keep them in subjection. That was considered to be the function of a Government. Brute force was employed against those who dared to voice their discontent. But Governments in the future will have to be conducted upon different lines. They will have to attend more to the establishment of schools, universities, and institutions of a benevolent character. They will have to maintain hospitals and insist on a healthy environment for those who do the world's work. They wiil have to pass legislation to insure that the worker shall get a fair deal. Until that result is brought about, we shall still have discontent. It is useless for any honourable member to try to mystify",54,Smith An D The Directors Against The Note Issue But There Is A

The honourable member for Mernda tells us that the banks must have till money. What is the till money that they Capitalists always try to make us believe that there is something so grand and sacred about banking that the workers must not dare even to look at it. It is such a profound science that the workers are not supposed to know anything about it. honourable member who has just resumed his seat says that the bankers must have till money. Let us see how the system works. IfI desire to borrow £400 or £500 for the purpose of building a house, I make known my desire to a bank manager, who at once says, "" Have you your deeds?"" say that I have, and I produce them. after an inspector has certified that the security is sound, the bank manager asks, A ' How do you want the money ?

And this, in short, is the great institution of banking which the workers dare not look upon. learn something of this important question Mr Riley. of finance. I am afraid we have not learned much from the honourable member for Mernda to-night. ' It was only because of his extreme age that we refrained from inwant? terjecting, and, so to speak, "" putting him off his perch "" ; but he is so vain in his own conceit that he thinks he knows all that is to be learned of banking. I come now to the question of industrial unrest. If this Parliament desires to bring about inThe dustrial peace, it will have to study industrial conditions more closely than it has done in the past. Why are industrial conditions so acute as they are to-day? It is because there has grown up in the mind of every worker a deadly suspicion of the employing class. The workers distrust the I man with money and the man with land. I Then, do not say whether they are right or wrong in doing so, but it is a fact that, in the mind of nearly every worker to-day, there is a deeply grounded suspicion of the landed and capitalist classes that employ That matter them. I had the honour to be a member of the Arbitration Court of New South Wales, and in that capacity I saw large employers of labour take the oath, and heard them give evidence that they could I get the not afford to grant better conditions to their employees.

My answer was, "" The industrial sysstem has greatly changed of late years. In former times there was a great army of small business men, and it was not' hard for a man who was a keen, smart mechanic to accumulate a little money and set up in business for himself. Since then the system has changed. Men have become concentrated in larger industrial enterprises, with the result that no working man to-day can set up in business for himself and successfully compete with those who are already established. The outlet for the employ^ is becoming smaller. opportunity than there used to be for employees to become foremen or managers in the various industries. The big industrial concerns of to-day have done away with many managers and overseers, with the result that the brain-power of the workers which used to find an outlet in the positions of supervisors or foremen, and eventually of employers, has ceased to do so. Instead of that great brain-power going into the employing class, it is gradually drifting into trade unionism. have become captains of industry in the trade union movement, whereas they formerly went into the capitalistic class. The trade union' movement in this and every other country is consequently being led by the brainiest, The bravest, and best men they can produce."" Notwithstanding the sneer of the honourable member for North Sydney when he said that he has no time for these trade unionists, let me remind the honourable member that a great disaster occurred in the Atlantic a few months ago, and that those who in that disaster stood out prominently as brave If a representative of the men and women were drawn from the industrial class, who form the trade unionists of the world. Who were the men who stood by their fellows on the Titanic in th« On one occasion, after we had hour of disaster? The firemen stood al their posts till the water was up to their knees; the engineers stood by their engines in the engine-room, and obeyed the commands of the captain to the last; the stewards stood by, put lifebelts on the passengers, and tried their best to save life. They did not run away from their posts. I Even the bandsmen on board the vessel, knowing that it was their last hour, stood together, and played the hymn, "" Nearer my God to Thee,"" whilst ""the skunks of wealth and position tried to get away as fast as they could, and left over fifty of the third-class passengers' children to go down, How do you account for while they occupied the boats. The working people are responsible for the great trade union movement in every civilized country in the world, and yet we have men in this House who profess to be representatives of the people, and who sneer at trade unionists, and say they have no time for them. God help such men if those who are in the trade union movement took such a narrow view of their duty to their fellows. To-day, every reform' we have comes from men who are prepared to make sacrifices, not from men like those who fought in Africa, and burned farm-houses, There is less and broke up pianos in the belief that they were adding to the glory of the Empire. The men who, whether it be in the coal mines or elsewhere, are not afraid to sacrifice their lives to relieve suffering, and to help humanity, are the men of the working classes, who are sneered at in this House. They have proved themselves to be of the class that should dominate every country, because they save the country. They are not destroyers; they are builders up. Some Brainy, intelligent men of the speakers who have preceded me have said that since the Labour Government came into power the cost of living has gone up.

245,Mr Riley,"which is probably known to many honourable members, middlemen are gathered as flies gather around a pot of honey, and they control the prices of chaff, butter, and dairy produce generally. Not a single thing is sold in that street on any morning until a telephone message has been received. certain number of their class regulate the prices of commodities, and any one who sells below that fixed price is a marked man. They absolutely dictate to the community the prices which must be paid. I cannot speak for Victoria, but I know that in Sydney the consumer has to pay is. 6d. per lb. for butter. I have the pleasure of knowing the secretary of the Cold Storage Union of New South Wales. I made inquiries from him, and when I asked him whether there was a scarcity of butter, he said, ""There are thousands of boxes of butter in the cold storage."" And3 et they say there is a scarcity of butter, ! and the price has gone up from is., which would be a fair price, to is. 6d. per Ib. Who is getting the extra profit? it, but the consumer has to pay the extra price. I made further inquiries, and I found that the wholesale grocers have a meeting every Tuesday in Sydney, at which they decide upon what are known as "" convention lines,"" and in this way dictate the price of -every commodity which they include in those lines. If a traveller goes to a grocer, and says, "" This line used not to be so high. Why can you not cut it down, and -give me a fair show? I cannot sell at this price,"" the answer is, "" I cannot do it ; it is -a convention line, and I cannot sell under that price."" It is not the Labour party who get the profits from these increased -prices. They do not sell chaff. They do not sell butter or potatoes.

I remember that in this country sixteen years ago one could get a 2-lb. loaf of bread for 2^d. to pay is. for it. -the days of the early gold rushes. Today we have to pay 3^d. for a 2-lb. loaf of 'bread. -money in opening up the country, in the construction of railways, in the sinking of artesian wells, and in the giving of assistance to farmers; and, nothwithstanding die fact tliat we now have millions of acres under wlieat, and produce more wheat today than ever before, our people have to pay i d . more for each 2-lb. loaf of bread A than we had to pay fifteen years ago. What is the reason for this? We are producing more wheat than is sufficient for our own consumption. We have been exporting wheat for years, and last year we exported nearly as much as Canada did. But, notwithstanding our great increase of production, the consumers of the country are called upon to pay more for their commodities. When we tried to secure an alteration of the Constitution which would enable us to control the people who regulate prices to the consumers, we were opposed by our honourable friends opposite in the interests of State rights, but riot in the interests of the people. W have a nice little company e doing business in Australia known as fhe Colonial Sugar_ Refining Company. I think it was within one month after the referenda proposals were defeated that the directors of that company, at an ordinary The farmer is not getting business meeting, sitting round a table, found that they had only 190,000 tons of sugar in bond, and resolved to raise the price of sugar by £ 1 per ton. These people, by merely carrying that resolution, put into the pockets of the company £ 1 9 0 , 0 0 0 . That did not make the cane grow any better, and it did not help the cane-grower, or the cane-cutter. Later on, they raised the price another £ 1 per ton, and to-day the consumer is paying £ 3 ios. per ton more for sugar than he had to pay at the time the referenda proposals were submitted to the people. Yet honourable members opposite stumped the country against the Government when they asked for an alteration of the Constitution which would have enabled us to prevent this kind of thing, and they now blame the Labour party for the increased cost of living. The increased price of sugar amounts to Jd. per lb. to the consumer, and a family consuming 6*lbs. per week has to pay an increased sum of 3d. per week, or is. per month. If this Parliament, with all the power it has, were to I remember. when we had decide to put a tax on all consumers of sugar of is. per.month, the people would be T h a t must have been in up in arms and would say that those who were responsible were unworthy of their position, and should be hurled from office.

The man who charges a high rent because there are two or three persons after his house is taking advantage of circumstances. He simply says to his tenant, "" If you We are told that we are not cannot pay the increased rent, you must get out."" That is a strike. 1 I shall stand up to that do hope that the workers will never give up their last weapon of industrial warfare they do not desire strikes if they can secure justice. I recollect reading in the newspapers a little time ago that the coalminers in England had demanded a minimum wage because of the increased cost of living. The .miners of Germany declared that they would support the British miners on that account. All over the world the cost of living has gone up. Whilst we have been fighting for shorter hours of labour and better wages, the advantages which we have gained have been filched from oui pockets. In time to come, Parliament will have to regulate the prices of commodities if it cannot effectively deal with combines and trusts. We have solved the problem of production. We consume more than we produce. The workers produce more than our forefathers did. But we have no power to control the distribution of that wealth, and until we possess that power, strikes, locks-out, and turmoil will continue. So long as men labour under Naturally, the landinjustice, so long as they are unable to maintain their wives and families in comI t is good for the country fort, we shall have industrial unrest. TheI t is also day has passed when they ought to be satisfied with their lot and look for their reward hereafter. I believe that this debate has had the effect of clearing the political atmosphere. During his speech upon this We are told that the motion, the honourable member for Brisbane made a deliberate charge which has not been answered. He stated that the master bakers of Brisbane entered into a conspiracy not to produce bread whilst the strike was in progress. He read the resolutions which were carried by them, and which were intended to starve the workers into submission. He also read the motion which was carried by the master retailers in favour of closing their shops. Nobody has ventured Many to contradict the accuracy of his statements. Yet we have been told that the strikers in Brisbane endeavoured to starve the workers",58,Smith An D The Directors Against The Note Issue But There Is A

It was the same old conspiracy-the same old lies. But the people of this country judge men by their past and by the company they keep, and I feel confident that when the time comes for the electors to pronounce a verdict upon the position, they will be found supporting the Labour party.

267,Mr Fisher,"The Leader of the Oppogo on, as I do not intend to detain the House long, more particularly as we have very seriously to consider and digest the telling indictment of the Government by the honourable member for Mernda. The honourable member who followed him left that speech very carefully alone. He treated us to a typical declamation, which contrasts very unfavorably with the speech of the honourable member for Mernda, so moderate in tone and accurate in fact. It is very hard to make any reply to such a speech as that to which we have just listened. The honourable member for South Sydney traversed in a few minutes a great number of subjects. gave us a great deal of declamation, there is very little meat on the bones that he threw at us. His address may be regarded as is being thrown not only at honourable members in this House, but more particularly at the heads of electors by Labour candidates at election time. are beginning to suspect a good deal of that kind of thing, and to ask for something more than mere declamation. is one of the duties of the Opposition to point out, as we are doing now, in what respect those who have indulged in declamation and promise in the past are not equal to the task of carrying on the affairs of the country in the way that they ought to be carried on. member for South Sydney spoke very strongly and ardently of the rights of the workers, but not once did he give us the slightest suggestion that the workers had any duties and responsibilities. We had a good deal of the cant and clap-trap of cheap socialistic handhooks. given to understand that the difference between the wages of the coal-miner and the retail cost of the coal represented plunder on the part ot certain capitalists, something to which the miner himself was entitled. thing had been sufficiently criticised before now to have died of shame, and that it was impossible for it to raise its head again; but here it is as bold as ever. We are given to understand that there is no such thing, apparently, as an outlay upon machinery in connection with the production of coal, that there is no cost incurred in getting the miner down to the coal, and that there is nothing worth considering in the distribution of the coal to the public. These, of course, are mere trifles in the [23]2 I am quite prepared to eyes of honourable members opposite, and I suppose are not worth considering in comparison with the advantage of making the points on which they apparently rely to influence the people at election time. One of the most astonishing of the honourable member's contentions was that outside of trade unionism no bravery could be exhibited by any individual.. He told us of the dreadful loss of the Titanic, and of the bravery of the men who siood to their posts until death. I am glad with him that we have such a record of British bravery. We are all proud of it ; but to insinuate, as he did, that only trade unionists were capable of such bravery is Whilst he to adopt a line of argument quite unworthy of any one who admires bravery wherever it is found and whatever form it may take. did they ? tempt for those who played the cur and The public the coward as have any honourable members on that side, and I am glad indeed that there were men who by no means could It have been connected with trade unions wbo played their part b that dreadful happening quite as heroically as any man or woman could have done. The honourable member for South Sydney gave us some very frank statements about the Brisbane strike. It is not without very grave The honourable significance that this discussion has moved around that industrial episode. It has undoubtedly formed the gravamen of the attack upon the Government, and the Government have done their very best to meet it. We have had the Prime Minister, with that air of injured innocence which We were so becomes him, giving us to understand that we were entirely wrong in holding him to be in any degree in sympathy with the strikers. We have had the comic turn of the Attorney-General, who is always amusing, if not instructive, and perhaps better I thought that that kind of than any one else, can enable members'to spend an interesting hour in this Chamber. The speech of the honourable member for Brisbane was, perhaps, the most surprising effort of all. He gave us to understand that the strike was the creation of a capitalistic press; that it was a kind of picnic on the part of a few angelicbeings, whose innocent pleasures were interfered with by dastardly police, also the tools of the capitalists. I shall not accuse the Government of any sin of omission in connection with the strike,",60,Smith An D The Directors Against The Note Issue But There Is A

270,Mr Fowler,"I have as much connor charge them with neglecting a duty uncloubtedly. imposed by the Constitution, but I shall accuse them of a sin of commission. The point to which I urge attention is one to which the importance it deserves has not yet been attached. What occurred at Brisbane was, undoubtedly, in the nature of a general strike. Messrs. Coyne and Company endeavoured to make the disturbance a general strike. It has been well said by a leading English publicist, that the essence of illegality is the infliction of injury upon an innocent third party. If such injury is inflicted upon women and children -and this is proved to have happened, in spite of what the honourable member for Brisbane has said to the contrary-it partakes of the essence of immorality. An occurrence partaking of the essence of illegality and immorality should surely be reprobated by any Government. I have here a very interesting article written a short time ago by Mr Ramsay Macdonald. It was published in the Socialist Revietv. He says that the pivot of syndicalism is the general strike, and goes on to remark The new revolution which syndicalism and its advocates of the Industrial Workers of the World contemplate has avoided none of the errors and pitfalls of the old, but it has added to them a whole series of its own. It has never considered the problems which it has to meet. It is, as expressed in the Outlook of this month, a mere escapade of the nursery mind. It is the product of the creative intelligence of the man who is impatient because it takes the earth 24 hours to wheel round the sun. In Australia there is still less justification for syndicalism and the general strike, in view of all the efforts that have been made -some of them fairly successful-to meet industrial troubles with legal machinery. Therefore, any one who assists to carry out or sympathizes with a general strike, is waging warfare of a particularly cruel and immoral character. The Prime Minister, when he sent his historic telegram to Messrs. Coyne and Company, said to them, in effect, "" Well, gentlemen, you are getting along very nicely; go ahead."" When he sent his subscription to Messrs. Coyne and Company, he endorsed the general strike. It is all very well for him, and for members of his party, to say now that they do not approve of the general strike; the'fact remains that when that industrial upheaval took place in Brisbane, neither he nor any other Minister had a word of condemnation for it. On the contrary, by their actions, they signified that they were at one with the strikers in waging war upon society, in Hr. Fowler. order that their ends might be achieved. It is not without grave significance that it was during the regime of Labour that the mace disappeared from its place in this Chamber. It now appears that the sovereignty of this Parliament ber may refer to the removal of the mace only on a specific motion dealing with my action. only incidentally. WhatI wish to say is that the Prime Minister and his Government are quite prepared that the sovereignty of Parliament ber is doing what I have said he may not do. to the removal of the mace. WhatI wish to say is that the sovereignty of Parliament, of which' the mace was the symbol honourable member that only on a specific motion dealing with my action may he refer to the removal of the mace. If he insists on referring to the matter now, I must take a course that will prevent him from doing so. the Prime Minister and his Government, at the time of the Brisbane strike, were prepared to relegate the rightful authority of this Parliament to the Trades Hall at Brisbane. The substitution of industrial for political control is the inner meaning of syndicalism and the general strike. Those who expound syndicalism point out that it is the method by which the workers will achieve the control of the industries, and, incidentally, of all the affairs of the country. It is a reasonable deduction that the Prime Minister and his Government, in endorsing the strike at Brisbane, are, with the syndicalists, prepared to put aside the authority of Parliament in favour of that of the statesmen of the Trades Hall. An honourable member on this side remarked a few nights ago that one could not very well criticise a Government which had produced a surplus of £2,000,000; hut, to my mind, the fact that such a surplus has been piled up without regard to the financial necessities of the country, is a matter for condemnation. It has been the practice of this Government to put surplus money into Trust Funds. I contend that it is opposed to all the canons of taxation that the Government should do this",61,Smith An D The Directors Against The Note Issue But There Is A

276,Mr Fowler,"I wish to point out thatkind of thing. They may plead that the money is rolling in upon them. There is no doubt that it has done so. But I do not think that they can claim any very special credit for the flourishing state of the finances. The good rains that Providence has sent us probably had more to do with that than anything else, and the way in which the money is splashed about is a fair indication that they are not concerned so much about conserving the resources of the country as exploiting them to their fullest extent. In their anxiety to spend this money, they are embarking on almost chimerical schemes. The Northern Territory question is undoubtedly a very serious one for this country. We have there a problem requiring the most complete statesmanship, the most serious consideration, apart from party altogether, but we find the Government proposing to adopt a method of settling the land which has not' yet been tested with good results anywhere in the modern world, and that is the system of leasehold occupation. In Western Australia, if in any part of the Commonwealth, the Government might very well have learned a lesson. There we have a Labour Government, and one of the leading planks of the Labour party of the State is no further alienation of Crown lands. I may say that I always regarded it as quixotical, and it kept me from taking any part in the Labour movement of the State. A Labour Government has been in office there for over eighteen months, but has not yet taken the slightest step to reduce that important principle of the party to practice. What does that mean? It means that members of that Government are so fully seized of the injury which would occur in applying this plank of their platform that they have refrained from doing so. There is no doubt that it is not a very courageous attitude for them to adopt, perhaps not even an honest attitude, but it is a very significant commentary upon the weakness of this policy of non-alienation of Crown Lands, that a Labour Government in a young State, with a large amount of land settlement before it, should be very careful indeed to refrain from putting into practice this one important phase of its own platform. I would not mind these experiments so much, although they may cost the country a great deal, if the Government were carrying out its obligations in other directions, but that is just what I find it is not doing. The report of Admiral Henderson on the Naval Forces laid before the members of this House a year ago contains some very important recommendations indeed. Among other things, it points out that two primary bases ought to be established in Australia, namely, one at Sydney and the other at Fremantle. The Fremantle base is at least as important as the Sydney base. To my mind, it is even more important, lying, as it does, at the very front door of Australia towards Europe. Admiral Henderson is very definite in connection with the importance of establishing a large naval base at Cockburn Sound, near Fremantle. This is what he saysThe harbour of Cockburn Sound, including Owen's Anchorage and Jervoise Bay, to b examined thoroughly as soon as possible bj experts, with a view to locating the site of the future Naval Dockyard. The site should include space for graving docks, building slips, work-shops, storehouses, and all plant, & c , for the building of ships and for the repairs and maintenance of a Fleet. It appeared to me that a site in the vicinity of Jervoise Bay was best suited for Naval Dockyard requirements. A channel for deep-draught ships would have to be dredged through the Parmelia and Success Banks, and slight dredging would be required in other places. It would probably also be necessary that a short .breakwater should be thrown out from Woodman's Point. Admiral Henderson, speaking of this naval base, indicates that the needs of the Fleet will be met byist. The completion of the dock now building at Fremantle and of the repair and refitting shops proposed to be attached thereto at as early a date as possible. 2nd. The temporary provision of a base for six destroyers and three submarines in the Swan River. 3rd. The dredging of the channel, so that large vessels can find a safe anchorage in Cockburn Sound. 4th. The provision of adequate reserves of coal and oil fuel, &c. In another part of his report, Admiral Henderson again refers to the matter. On page 12, he saysPort Western is a very good harbour, and until Cockburn Sound (Fremantle), which is f a r more imfortant from a strategical point of view, is ready, this port should be utilized by the Western Division as one of its principal anchorages, and as a place where ships should be able to replenish with coal or oil fuel. WhatI have read goes to show that Admiral Henderson was very anxious that the work of establishing a naval base at Fremantle should be undertaken as early as possible, that no time should be lost in commencing the work, and that while Westernport should be utilized for certain purposes, the Fremantle base, together with that of Sydney, should be rapidly developed also. What is the position to-day? amount of noise made in this State, a great deal of work is about to be undertaken at Westernport, much more, I believe, than Admiral Henderson ever contemplated, but not a single stroke so far appears to have been done at this important base in Cockburn Sound. to the local Government to help them. trip was undertaken a few months ago while I was in the State, but beyond that, there appears to have been nothing else done. Sir want the State to help them. the Government are waiting for the State authorities or not. They seem to have the money, and they ought to utilize it without any delay in getting this important base ready for the work which is required of it. I charge the Government with deliberately neglecting this important part of the work in order to placate other portions of Australia ment is challenged no deputations are received, with some kind of pretence at development, all but routine work is postponed, and members such as that being carried out at Westernof port, and the playing at ship-building at front Sydney. Another matter of a very serious character decisions. is the way in which this Government have have bungled the arrangements for commencing the work on the transcontinental railway. At Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie some hundreds ber must not read any comment in a newsof men have gathered, relying on the promise paper on a debate which is before the of the Minister of Home Affairs that work House. of May.

I believe that the Premier of Western Australia has had to issue instructions that the men at Kalgoorlie shall be their Departments. supplied with the necessaries of life. This is not creditable to the Government, and although I admit there was some little hitch in order, sir, I must bow to your ruling.

There is another matter in this connection) which is not to the credit of the Government, and which will be found to be more seriousOn account of a certain as time goes on. I refer to the appointment of the superintendent of the work of construction. We in Australia realize, of course, that this railway is one of the biggest, problems yet met with in railway construction in the Commonwealth. Above a l l , there is required great administrativecapacity. When the name of a certain individual was mentioned in Western Australia as having been appointed to this position, everybody was asking who he was, where he came from, and what was his record. I made application to the Minister to have access to the papers dealing with the appointment, but was very politely refused. The JOHN FORREST -The Government Minister pleaded a certain custom which, I am given to understand, exists, of closing up the Departments, not only to the public, but even to members of Parliament, while a no-confidence motion is being debated. I see, however, from a paragraph in yesterday's Age, that the Federal Ministers have fallen away very much from this custom, assuming, it is a custom. While a Government's position as a Governthe Cabinet, who are supposed tp be on the Ministerial Bench on sufferance only, refrain from embarrassing possible successors inoffice by committing the country to debatableDuring the last fortnight F e d e ^ ' Ministers, secure with their caucus majority, broken most of these precedents. given me access to those particular papers.
