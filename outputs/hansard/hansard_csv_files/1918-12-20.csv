0,Question Opens Up A Very .Big Vista. I Pre,"the Empire, should not be accepted, besume that my friend is a student of the influence of gold upon our currency, not only in regard to the past, or during the war, but also in regard to the future. The Commonwealth Government have practically commandeered all the gold of Australia during war time. It is only by that means that we have been able to serve the British interests, not the speculative, but the national, and keep our own reserve right. We still may have to keep a hold on gold in the interests of the solidity of our paper currency; but I am not sure as to that. man informed me that he had exported £26,000,000 worth of gold. £26,000,000 worth of gold had been exported for the British Government-for British Government purposes, and not for speculative purposes. A microscopic portion, about £28,000 worth of gold, I believe, has been exported for sound private reasons; but the gold currency of the Commonwealth and the raw gold of Australia have been placed at the service of the country and the Empire, and not at the service of any of the holders of it . monwealth Government get the profit on the exchange? microscopic. It is not that which the honorahle member has in his mind, or which the gold producers have in mind. be held in January, I thought that the honourable gentleman might consider that aspect of the question. tlie track. It is alleged that there is an appreciation in the value of gold in some portions of the world, some of them enemy portions, and some of them doubtful neutral portions, but we shall not allow our gold to drift there. The suggestion was made to me yesterday by the Chamber of Mines in Victoria, apparently speaking with the knowledge of some of the other Chambers of Mines, that the offer of 5s. per standard ounce in excess of the standard price, whicli the British Government is supposed to have made to cause it was not liberal enough. I was also asked not to permit any sale of Australian gold to the British Government, unless it appreciated to a higher figure. It is a matter that requires careful consideration. We have no desire to depress the gold-mining industry. Therefore, I am studying the matter with great care, and I shall not come to a decision upon my own judgment, but will accept the highest advice that can be obtained upou the subject. Johnson) -The honourable member for I said that Dampier( Mr Gregory) has intimated that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., ""The quarantine conditions at Fremantle."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. I would not have taken this step had it uot been for certain information which not the Comwas conveyed to me from Western Australia yesterday evening. Deplorable conditions have existed at Fremantle during the last three or four weeks. It would seem that some one has been exceedingly callous in regard to the welfare of our returning soldiers. I understand that, on armistice day, one man lost his life through being drowned in an endeavour to get away from a troopship at Fremantle, and that a large body of soldiers, either through force, or because they had cajoled the guard, was able to get away from a vessel, and go into the city. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene), who is in charge of quarantine matters, will probably tell us that, by this time,. the difficulties have been fairly well overcome. He may also tell us that, in the future, it is very unlikely that boats will put into Fremantle with influenza cases on board. However, as there may be instances of such vessels arriving there, provision should be made by the Quarantine Department to see that",33,Setup

For instance, it has been said that the Department kept these men on a plagueinfected ship. It was referred to as "" The Black Hole of Calcutta,"" and similar statements were made. The facts are that two days before the vessel arrived on the coast Ave were advised that there were 150 cases of influenza on hoard. Every preparation was made to deal with the outbreak the moment the vessel reached Fremantle. On the arrival of the boat we found that there were nearly 400 cases on board, showing that while the vessel was at sea, and before it came under the control of the quarantine authorities, the disease was spreading like wildfire, through the ship. We removed all the cases from the vessel, and proper measures were taken immediately to bring the disease under control on the ship. The result was that, on the first day after the 150 cases had been landed, there were only eight additional cases; on the second day, six cases; on the third day, two"" cases; and on the fourth day, one case.; and yesterday there were no cases. This proves that the steps taken by the authoris why the quarantine authorities have ities were effective in stamping out the disease on the vessel. The essential duty of the Quarantine Department is to try to stamp out the disease in the shortest possible time. That is a grave duty which we owe, not merely to the men on board, but also to the people. The steps we have taken have been effective in discharging that duty. The whole trouble has been as to-whether we should keep the men on board or land them on Garden Tsland or on Rottnest Island. For many reasons, Garden Island is out of the quessonally look into this matter, and ascertion. modation oh Garden Island such as there is on Rottnest Island,, and it would have been extremely difficult to organize arrangements for the reception of the men in the time available.

In order to stamp out the disease it is necessary to examine every man daily and remove every infected person at once. If the men had been lauded on Rottnest Island, we could not have done that. The honourable others who have had close association with the soldiers will know that the moment they were landed they would have wandered all over the island. There would have been the greatest difficulty in rounding them up for medical supervision. We could not have maintained that close supervision of the men which is essential. that. ber must know that, if men were allowed to wander all over a fairly large island, they could not be closely supervised.

I asked the Minister whether, in view of the terrible death-rate in this disease, he would ask the Cabinet, if he could not do it himself, to request every medical man in Australia to place himself at the disposal of the Government, so that all the doctors could be organized should the disease pass the quarantine barriers. W h a t is keeping this disease out of Australia at the present time? If the Minister has not visited the SydneyI have been quarantined quarantine grounds, he should go there.

The Minister said Why did I urge the use of the quarantine station at Albany? It is because in the summer time-ever y Western Australian representative will bear me out in thisAlbany is a most healthy resort. I know I promised to make in the quarantine grounds there very well. The station at Fremantle is situated on hot sandhills, and, at the present time, I asked the Ministhey are very hot. I could give the names of no fewer than five medical men in Perth who agree with me that Rottnest would be almost ideal for a quarantine station. Auckland, in New Zealand, lost 5,000 lives during the recent influenza epidemic. In view of that calamity, why should we consider the cost of removing the few inhabitants of Rottnest to some other place, to make the island available T then askedfor quarantine purposes. If force were necessary to effect our ends, we could use the War Precautions Act. There is splendid fishing off Rottnest, and magnificent bathing, and the island is a healthy place. Had the present inhabitants been turned out, there would have been plenty of vacant accommodation, and any more that was required could have been provided by the erection of tents, which are very suitable for the use of sick persons.

The death-rate in New Zealand during the influenza epidemic has been eight times greater than that among our soldiers at the front. I asked to-day if the Government had any information as to the position in the United States of America. A member of this House has seen a letter, in which it is stated that in San Francisco every one has to wear a mask, and is liable to the penalty, not only of a fine, but also of imprisonment, for neglecting to do so. Schools, theatres, and churches are closed. If the Minister wishes to go to Western Australia, the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) will be glad to accompany him, and I would be glad to do so, if he could put up with my unpleasant presence. sometimes. thinks that, I must adopt the mav iter inmodo in reminding him that every vessel after a long voyage with crowded passenger accommodation is troubled with vermin, but these can be exterminated, as Professor Love, of London, has shown, by opening the hatches and pouring concentrated and condensed carbolic acid gas into the holds. The gas, as it rises, kills every living thing coming within its influence. If my manner in asking my question offended the Minister, it was not meant to do so. We both wish to keep disease out of our beloved Australia. I ask the honourable gentleman, therefore, not to regard anything I have said as personal. I addressed h i m mainly in the hope of helping him in this matter. We, in Australia, should congratulate not a medical man, but I know that good ourselves that we have prevented the work has been done in preventing the dis. spread of this disease beyond the quaranease from getting into Australia. If the tine stations. ment has done splendid work in achieving healthy men who are on the transports on this.

It must be borne in mind tary to take action. know what life on board a vessel is for not of persons of disgraceful antecedents, the rank and file. When I was travelling, but of men, many of whom, intellectually as a private meningitis broke out, and on and socially, are the equal of their two occasions I was a contact. I have seen men forced to live in places beyond description. It was impossible to prevent this, because' we were at sea. The case of our transports is different. The lads who are arriving by them have been nine or ten weeks on the ocean, and have not had a pleasant voyage. The military like to exercise control as much as possible, and it would take a very strong Minister for Defence to bring it about that the men should be allowed on the deck used by the officers. There is no greater crime than for privates and non-commissioned officers on board ship to breathe the same air as the officers, who are supposed to be of different clay. The lads resent this distinction keenly. A compound could be erected at Rottnest within two days, and the lads could be given freedom to roam about tbe island as they liked. A f t e r eight or ten weeks on board ship they naturally wish to get on land again, and I do not see anything to prevent my. suggestion from being carried out. I would not make it if I thought that its adoption would increase the danger of the disease getting into Australia. Private persons who may be living on Rottnest now could be removed. Surely after three or four years' military service our lads deserve some consideration. What are the military doing in connection with their food supply ? I have seen the diary of a lad who was on board the Medic, and I know that his account of the conditions, though awful to read, is true, because I have seen such conditions myself. All the luxuries that Australia can command should be sent to the quarantined vessels; fresh food, lemon peel, raisins, currants, and similar things, which are practically unobtainable in Great Britain. The lads should be given every comfort.

Those who, after a long voyage, have found themselves detained on board ship when she has beeu anchored in port, know how tedious the experience is. Such a detention, though lasting perhaps only a few hours, seems longer than a week at sea. The officers and soldiers on board the transports in quarantine should be looked upon as in a situation analagous to that of first, second, and thir d class passengers during a shipwreck, when there is no talk of any one class getting to the boats first. All should have the free r u n of the ship. The men should not be cooped up like steerage passengers. A few pounds of Taisins and similar delicacies would be greatly appreciated by them. W it h in a . few weeks, apples ought to be available. Mr .FOWLER -The public of Western Austrajia has been sending large quantities of f r u it to the transports. The men on board are being well looked after in that respect. it ; but it should be the duty of the Department, to make proper provision for feeding the men; the Department should not depend on the good-will of the public. Certain hardships are unavoidable in connection with quarantine, but they should be made as little as possible. By smoothing things the Department will add to the laurels it bas won by keeping the in fluenza epidemic at bay. explanation, I wish to say that if , when the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) was speaking, I showed a little heat, I regret it . I wish also to acknowledge the tremendous assistance that I have received from the Western Australian members, and particularly from the honourable member for Perth( Mr. Fowler). I omitted to mention the matter when making my speech. The honDuring the war, big orable member has been of great assistance to me in dealing with the difficulties that have been caused by the influenza outbreak in Western Australia. [12.30] I am pleased with the success of Those living there the efforts of the authorities to keep the disease out of Australia. I am proud of the work done by the Quarantine Department, and for that reason I should like, if possible, to have the control of returned soldiers arriving here on infected ships transferred from the military to the quarantine authorities. If that were done, the position of these men would be much improved. A f t e r a long voyage people are always anxious to get on shore. We must not forget that our soldiers have been away for years, and that on the voyage out here they have the same old ""stew""-the same old military mealsserved up to them. They are naturally anxious, therefore, to get clear of the ship as soon as possible. In every other country ravages of Spanish influenza have been wide-spread. I believe that in the military camps of the United States of America there have been some 20,000 victims of the disease. We have reason, therefore, to be grateful for the work that has been done in keeping it away from Australia. In their anxiety to rejoin their friends, soldiers might be apt to forget that if they were released too soon the consequence to their friends, and to the whole community, might be disastrous. We should, however, make the conditions of life in quarantine as comfortable as possible for them. There have been many unreasonable complaints no doubt, but if these men were removed from strict military discipline, and m i l i tary conditions as to food supplies, while in quarantine, there would be much less trouble.

Minister has been good enough to mention my name in connection with the efforts that have been made to keep out of Australia this fell disease. Never in the whole of my political career have I had such a sense of responsibility as I have had in regard to this matter, and that feeling has been shared, no doubt, in a much higher degree by the Minister and the Director of Quarantine. I felt in a very difficult position in regard to the threat of the disease entering Australia. The Director of Quarantine is eminent in his profession, and whilst I certainly 1 put before the Minister and the Director the representations of certain citizens of Western Australia, that changes should be made in the arrangements, I recognised that Dr. Cumpston probably knew nil.re than I did as to the proper methods of treatment, and I was, therefore, somewhat on the horns of a dilemma. It would have been a fearful responsibility had the acceptance of representations made in certain direction as to the relaxation of the arrangements made by the Director of Quarantine resulted in the introduction of the disease into the Commonwealth. It was in my own humble opinion much better that there should be a little undue stringency rather than an undue relaxation; it was better to err on the right side. If the Director's measures to cope with this disease have been I have no successful, as I trust they have, then certainly his actions have been fully justified. Had the disease gained a footing in Austrahai t would have caused our losses on the battlefields to sink relatively into insignificance. HadI been on board one of those quarantined vessels, with a knowledge of what the position was, I think I should have said, "" It is better for me to endure a few days' privation on this ship than run the risk of introducing Parliament the disease into Australia, and, perhaps, amongst my own near and dear relatives."" I hope that the efforts of the Director of will be continued with the same fortunate results as hitherto in regard to the exclusion of the disease from Australia. Question resolved in the negative.

54,Mr Groom,"Generally speaking, thefavour of the arbitral power of the Oourt, but declared that it had not the power of enforcement. Mr .TTJDOR -Quite so. The Oourt was further askedIs thc award invalid by reason of the appointment of the President for seven years only? The answer to that was "" No"" ; and the Court also answered in the negative the third inquiry, "" Is the award enforcable by the said Court?"" The Chief Justice said that the Conciliation and Arbitration CourtHwas invested with ample and complete jurisdiction to declare and enforce the mutual obligations of the parties. The exercise of the power to impose .penalties was admittedly an exercise of the judicial power. If the Court had not the power to impose penalties, then that power would be non-existent elsewhere. If that Court could not enforce its awards, it seems to me a sound position to take up that no other Court could do so. If the Conciliation and Arbitration Court has no power to enforce its awards, however, we might as well have no such tribunal. Under this B ill it is proposed to give the Governor General power to appoint any Justice of the H i g h Court to be President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. A t the present time the President of the Court can depute other Justices of the H i g h Court to act for him, to take evidence, and to make awards. The powers of the President's deputies are as wide as his own. delegated to the deputies, but under this amendment, instead of leaving that power of delegation to the President, we give it to the Governor General. amend section 44 of the principal Act by striking oub the provision that penalties for breaches "" may be imposed by any Court of summary jurisdiction constituted by a police, stipendiary, or special magistrate,"" and to in sert instead, "" may be imposed by any District, County, or local Court, or Court of summary jurisdiction."" It was held tice Higgins, that the Arbitratio n Court ought itself to have the power to impose penalties in the same way as County Courts and other Courts; and in Committee an amendment to that end ought to be inserted. Otherwise, there may be varying decisions all over the Commonwealth, whereas uniformity is necessary if we are to avoid industrial trouble. Local justices of the peace may be in terested in the particular businesses affected; and it is quite possible, for in stance, that there might be different decisions at Footscray and Port Melbourne in connection with the wheat stackers. If an amendment of this kind is made, I have no objection to the B ill . As to the validity of the decisions of Mr Justice Isaacs, Mr Justice Powers, and Mr Justice Rich, as Deputy Presidents of the Arbitration Court, if that is not upheld, industrial chaos will result throughout the country. I am, as I have said, a believer in arbitration, and in the peaceful settlements of disputes, as contrasted with the force of starvation on the one side, and the force of numbers on the other. It would have been a national calamity had the H i g h Court arrived at any other conclusion than that the decisions of the Deputy Presidents are as binding as those of the President. validity has not yet been decided. the awards of the Deputy Presidents, it will, as I have said, mean industrial chaos. I do not know when it is intended to call Parliament together again, hut if the Deputy President's decisions are proved to be invalid, my advice to the Government is that they should bring in a validating measure at the earliest opportunity.

Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. If industrial arbitration is to be effective the Arbitration Court should have power to enforce its own awards. I do not attach a great deal of importance to the arbitration system from a worker's stand-point; in fact, I believe that the existing system is quite wrong, but if honourable members were actuated by a desire to break it down, they could not go about doing it in a more effective way than by allowing police magistrates in local Courts to adjudicate upon actions for the recovery of penalties for breaches of awards. police magistrate will have to decide is whether there has been a breach of an award. pose less confidence i u local magistrates who may be the friends, personally or socially, of an employer, whose default they are asked to adjudicate upon.

The effect of the amendment is merely to give power to the President of the Arbitratio n Court to enforce his awards by reason of tlie fact that he is a Justice of the High Court. Of course, I can quite understand that if the parties are empowered to bring their cases before the Arbitration Court, they w ill not make much use of the other tribunals mentioned in the Bill-County Courts, District Courts, and local Courts. I support the amendment in the interests of good government, which cannot exist when there is industrial turmoil . If there is a genuine desire to continue working as amicably as is possible under the existing economic circumstances, the Government would be wise to accept the amendment. It merely gives to a Justice of the High Court the power which the clause proposes to give to magistrates in local Courts. If we would seek to maintain our arbitration system, we should do our best to facilitate procedure under it instead of creating the suspicion in the minds of the workers that they are not getting a fair deal, which may eventually lead to the complete break-down of the arbitration system.

The whole question of arbitration law will of necessity be reviewed at a later stage. not hear the Minister's speech in introducing the Bill, but the explanation he has just given enables me to understand some of the difficulties. Perhapsi t is easier to point out what amendment is desirable than it is to give effect to it , higher Court. In my opinion, we would owing to the fact that the President of the Arbitration Court is not permanently appointed. Ever since 1894 the Australian Workers Union has stuck to the arbitration principle, and, of course, has brought numerous instances of breaches of awards before the Courts, and applied for the imposition of penalties in regard to them. It is clear that the time of the Arbitration Court should not be occupied -#ith these small matters, which can very well be referred to other Courts. But there often arise doubts as to the precise meaning of awards, and cases occur in regard to which an ordinary magistrate is not competent to decide whether there has been a breach of an award. Mr G-KOOM -The parties can always go to the Court for an interpretation. some ready means of getting interpretations. an award is an offence against the law with which any 'Court would be competent to deal, but there are breaches which are not deliberate. Sometimes a person who makes them believes himself to be within his rights, and, occanals to impose penalties, and extends that sionally, he is supported by legal opinion. Such cases must be dealt with by a Court that is competent to state the law. We do not want what are practically Police Court cases taken before the Arbitration Court, but there should be an easy means by which either party could obtain from the Court an interpretation of the law. I am doubtful whether the Bill covers the whole field, and I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of introArbitration Court the power to imducing a provision for the quicker settlesible. Many cases arise in which it is necessary to establish what the law is, but the more we can avoid costly litigation the better. Many disputes in connection with awards occur in the back country, hundreds of miles from the capitals, and it is often necessary to send barristers there to conduct the cases of the employees, because the local lawyers have been engaged by the employers. This is costly enough; but, in addition, there is often the expense of going from a lower to a do well to increase the number of Courts that may impose penalties for breaches of an award. In the old days a local magistrate's Court was occasionally somewhat under the influence of the big man of the place. But kings are fast disappearing in all walks of life, and I think that the Police Courts could well be intrusted with many small matters arising out of breaches of awards. We might well have a promise from the Minister, however, that at a later stage our arbitration system will be fully considered. I understand that that is contemplated by the Government. The clause deals with something incidental to a recent decision of the High Court. It does not affect or vary any principle laid down by that decision. To that extent, we can welcome the resolution A clear breach of of a doubt that arose as the result of that decision whether power resides in any Court to impose penalties fixed by the arbitral authority. One cannot take exception to this clause, because it makes clearer the power of subordinate tribupower to a Court which hitherto has not possessed it. The contention of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor), which was supported by the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine), neverthe!ess remains unanswered by the Government.

If by Act of Parliament the President of the High Court can be given the power which, prior to the decision to which I have referred, he was thought to have, I cannot see any reason for not doing so. The Minister has pointed out that where there is doubt as to the interpretation of an award, it is proper for the President to resolve it. But, apparently, what is contemplated is rhat action should be taken to obtain from the President an interpretation of an award, and that fresh proceedings should follow to induce another tribunal to impose a penalty for a breach of the law. That is a duplication of legal process which I am sure the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Spence) would not desire. The Government introduced the Bill with a kind of apology, and the Minister made it clear that it was not intended to enter upon the field of debatable principle. The honourable gentleman, however, did not state a sufficient reason for not giving to the President of the Arbitration Court, who is the person making the award, and by training and capacity is eminently fitted to enforce it, the power to enforce it. The honourable gentleman stated that he believed that this Parliament has the constitutional right to invest the President of the Arbitration Court with penal power, and the decision of the High Court is not contrary to that opinion. I shall support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor). back the law to the state in which it was believed to be before the High Court gave its recent decision. We ask no more than that. Had not the second reading been passed so quickly, I should have liked to say a word or two on the subject of arbitration generally; but that can hardly be done on a clause of this character.' This provision, however, and the difficulties which it indicates, serve to illustrate the disadvantages under which this Parliament and the country labours because we have not wider and more certain powers of legislation in respect of conciliation und arbitration.

I have had the advantage of a conversation with the new member for Swan( Mr Corboy), who is a returned soldier, and by no means a feather-bed soldier, and who expressed a strong desire for an opportunity to speak on this clause. precated which would place the soldiers in the position, as he expressed it , very directly, of "" scabbing"" on their fellow workers. I do not admit that the soldiers returning to this country are desirous to take advantage of some section in an Act of Parliament to place themselves in a position in the world of industrial competition of advantage against their fellow workers, or to be put in a position where inducement is held out to them not to join industrial organizations. Although the policy of the Commonwealth Government on all sides has been one of industrial organization, this clause is an invitation to our returning soldiers not to join unions, and thus aid in the peaceful solution of industrial trouble, but to take special advantages which this Parliament was not likely to refuse to them owing to the fact that they are returned soldiers. If I thought that the soldiers were coming back in an attitude of hostility to organized labour-that there were men amongst them who, if I may use the word, have been weaned from their allegiance to organizationsI would suppose them to be only too glad to take advantage of a clause like this. that they will come back better unionists than they went away, and that many who previously were not members of organizations will become so on their return. There has been developed a spirit of comradeship and fellowship with their fellow workers of all grades, whether on the battle-field or in the industrial arena, and I am sure they have no desire to take advantage of a clause which I think should not have been offered for their acceptance.

I can imagine a shearers' shed in which most of the men are working under a preference decision of the Court; and it may so happen that one or two soldiers desire to accept the same preference. Then, on a board of shearers, there may be a majority of returned soldiers who are unionists; and I ask whether it is not He degoing to create considerable trouble if it any preferential treatment is found that we are giving to some returned soldiers the same preference as is enjoyed by others who have taken part in the fight of organized labour for better conditions. Instead of cementing the happy relationships that have been formed on the battlefields, I am afraid we are creating a cause of dissension.

That, I think, is the main reason why conciliation and arbitration has failed, because, as the phrase implies, it depends on a good spirit between the parties. It may be f a i r l y said, on the other hand, that the men have rushed to the Court and sought to make it a tribunal for settling all disputes and generally regulating their wages and conditionsa power which is not vested in the Commonwealth Court, and could not be vested in it under the Constitution . 1 these two factors, with ployers anxious to defeat the whole Act and the men more than anxious to take advantage of even greater powers than the A o t gave the Court, the measure, in a great degree, has been brought into disrepute. There are many workers in the various organizations who have been anxious to drop the whole system of arbitration-wh o have despaired of making it a success-and have resorted to what is called "" direct action."" A f t e r all, "" direct action "" is the policy which has been accepted by the employing classes for probably a thousand years -the policy of force.

Lt -Colonel ABBOTT It is an excellent system. A t least it should be if it is All that is apart from carried out as it was intended it should be carried out. I am closely in touch It was with soldiers' settlement in New South Wales, and it seems to me that it has a tendency to work in the opposite direction. I am opposed to the purchase of high-priced estates in settled communities, where there are railways, because the capital values of the holdings will crush the men for all time. I suggest that it is better to go out where there is vacant Crown land, or where cheap freeholds or leaseholds can be acquired, for half the price demanded for land near railway centres. Then, having purchased these lands, let a pioneer railway be constructed by the Repatriation DeUntil partment, and let men be settled at mixed farming. There is a tendency to urge men to go on the land quite apart The total number discharged from their ability or disability in that r e g a r d , a i d very often the capital value of a holding a man takes up is a drag upon h i m for all time. But by adopting the policy I have suggested, we can Accepting these figures as a settle returned soldiers in circumstances in which the capital value will never get them down while at the same time the community will benefit by the settlement of land which previously has remained undeveloped, and that portion of the Those who have come back first Commonwealth will get a decided fillip or impetus. As my time is very limited, I shall touch on the B ill and repatriation work in a general way only. In my opinion bhe Repatriation Department and the Repatriation Act fail to render help to one section of the community which is We must not imagine most deserving of assistance. To the 30th June last, 52,536 of our men had died on active service, leaving behind them 6,321 widows and 10,400 children under the age of sixteen years.

The Act makes provision for vocational training. mother and children can get certain allowances under Act. But what are they? A widow or a widowed mother of an unmarried son, gets £2 per fortnight if the husband or son had been receiving 6s. per day, and that rises in gradations until, if the deceased soldier had been in receipt of 10s. per day, the widow or mother is allowed £2 12s. 3d. per fortnight. engages in vocational training, the Repatriation Department ance to 35s. per week, and allows for the first child 20s. a fortnight; for the second child, 15s.; and for the third and every subsequent child, 10s. are dead the allowance made for each child, up to ten years of age, is £1 per fortnight; 25s. per fortnight; sixteen years, 30s. per fortnight. the Repatriation is a branch, steps in. The Minister may, on the recommendation Boards,make arrangements to pay such amounts as are necessary for the education of the children, and he may pay fees for their vocational or professional ing. Under widow and one child may receive, inclusive of pension, 51s.; with two children, 54s. 6d.; and with three children, 58s.; with four children, 61s. 6d.; and with five or more children, 64s. 6d. There are also provisions for an allowance of £35 for household furniture, and £150 for the purchase of a business or stock, or the lifting of mortgages, &c. Those are practically all the benefits which the widow and children receive under the Repatriation Act. This Bill is intended to make Lt -Colonel Abbott. provision for soldiers and their dependants; but I ask that a proper and systematic scheme be evolved for taking charge of the children of fallen soldiers, and safeguarding their f u t u r e welfare. It is all very fine to say that there are State charitable institutions. Would any honourable member say that the child of any soldier hero should be sent to a home, and and say, "" Oui receive charity in any form? There are cases in which soldiers' children are motherless, and their father has died on active service. I made inquiries at the Repatriation Department regarding the We know that the widowed provision for children in such cases, and will not honourable members be surprised the War Pensions to hear that there is no machinery in the T Department for ascertaining where the children are, and caring for them? The Department consoles itself with the thought that the children will be attended to by the trustees. Money is paid for the benefit of the children to the trustee or next of k in. Taking an extreme case, If the widow suppose the uncle is a drunkard, and this miserable pittance is doled out by the increases her allowDepartment to him, what chance will the children have? There exists a need for special supervision over the distribution of that money. We should have a staff If both parents of humane inspectors, male and female, who will follow the money to its destination, and see' that it is applied for the from ten to fourteen years, benefit of the children-that it goes upon and from fourteen to their backs in the form of clothes, or into Then their bodies in the form of food; or their Act, of which this Bill minds in the form of education. The Department should insure that those chilof the State dren get a proper start in life, and, above all, that sympathetic and humane treatment isi given to them to compensate as. far as possible for the loss of their trainparents, and to build their lives upon the Repatriation Act, a sure foundations instead of allowing them to be kicked from pillar to post. If I had the time, I could quote many cases of this kind. The Repatriation Department replies that it gets reports from Local Committees. There should be in every district, or shire, or municipality an accredited council or committee charged with the responsibility of attending to the claims of returned soldiers, and their first and greatest duty should be to locate every soldier's widow and child. In the district of Tamworth, it was discovered that there was poverty and starvation amongst the dependants of soldiers. Last winter, some women had not enough blankets, and their children were sick and hungry. One benevolent lady, who raised money for the purchase of a battleplane, and has rendered other patriotic services, heard of some cases. She scoured the district in a motor car and the reports she f submitted to the Committee regarding the distress amongst soldiers' widows and kiddies wpuld positively shock honourable members. If such conditions obtain in country districts where people can get food and necessaries, what is happening in the cities and suburbs, where population is congested ? A t Tamworth, we found it necessary to appoint a weekly dependant's day, on which contributions of goods were' received, and all soldiers' widows and dependants were visited. The orphan children of soldiers should receive preferential treatment over all other children. It is the duty of the Department to ascertain where these children are, and establish hostels where they may be maintained and educated. That system should not bear, the brand of charity. Let tlie children wear a badge showing that they are soldiers' kiddies if you like, but let us care for them as a duty we owe to their fathers. Some of the millions of pounds that are being spent ought to be sent to the different States. Some soldier's child in the back country may be a village Hampden, touched by Providence with the wand of genius. Let us see that each child has. an opportunity of getting a fair education, and that the girls have every inducement to go straight and live moral lives. If a widowed mother is too sick and weakly to be able to give close attention to the rearing of her children, it is the duty of every one . of us to see that each child is given a chance in the world. If one kiddy of a dead soldier should go to the dogs, or, by reason of his or her father's death should not have the same T opportunity as other children have, we as legislators and the people, of Australia w ill be primaril y responsible. A nation's moment. biggest asset is its growing children, and in the years to come, more than ever before, we must establish for the masses of the people a broad system of primary, secondary, and technical education, which shall be compulsory for every child who is living in an industrial blind alley. Under the system which operates in Germany and in parts of England, a lad enters a factory for a week, and next week he is compulsorily sent to a technical school for vocational training. There he is made completely au f a it with his job, and is qualified to become a better citizen. That is a duty which the country owes to every one of its people. In regard to the B ill , tlie homes idea is an excellent one, but we have not given enough consideration to the children. Mr. T. G. Adamgon, of Tamworth,has produced an excellent pamphlet which, during this festive season, would provide a text for us all to study"" What is happening to the children of departed soldiers?"" Let the time never arise when it can be said that we, the people of Australia, and the members of this Legislature, were responsible for the failure in life of any dead soldier's boy or girl. reviewed the subject of repatriation. that is so. I waited patiently to have an opportunity on the Estimates to discuss the subject of repatriation, but the only chance I have had is now, when I have only a few minutes to spare before catching my train. It seems almost a sacrilege to touch the subject in the superficial way I am obliged to do it . Let us remember during the holidays what are our obligations, and let the Minister for Repatriation come forward when next we meet with a comprehensive scheme which will search out every soldier's child, and give to it , not charity, but the fair treatment which the father's sacrifices demand, so that those 10,400 children I have mentioned will have opportunities as good as,if not better than, would have been theirs had their daddies lived. W it h the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, I regret that this B ill has been brought forward at the last Although repatriation is the most important question with which Parliament could deal, we have had no opportunity to discuss it , except in the dying hours of the session, when more",49,Geoom

116,Mr Mcgrath (Ballarat) [4.42],"than half the members of the House have departed to other States. Members on both sides of the House declared that we would not break the promises we made to the soldiers. We have broken those promises. Four years of war have gone by, and we have made very little provision for them, and to-day, when peace is about to be proclaimed, and when it is almost certain that many thousands of soldiers will be returned in a few months, there is nothing but chaos in the Repatriation Department in Victoria. State Repatriation Board and the Deputy Comptroller have resigned, and nobody seems to know what has been done, or is to lie done. million pounds for repatriation,but, owing to the operation guillotine, we have had no opportunity to discuss how it shall be applied. There cannot be a member who does not desire that justice shall be done to our returned soldiers and their dependants, and yet there are many things happening that ought not to happen. only the other day I received a complaint from a soldier who had lost the use of his arm, tliat after six months his pension had been reduced, and, on writing to the Deputy Commissioner on the subject, I was informed that, under the Act, a reduction to three-fourths of the rate granted must be made at the end of that period. the people of this country that such a reduction should be made. A man who has lost the use of an arm is no more capable at the end of six months, during which he has been drawing a pension, than he was at the beginning of that period. of hardship. New England (Lt -Colonel Abbott) says bhat we are not looking after the children of dead soldiers, and we are not doing so. Then there are the cases of mothers who have lost sons, who went away at an age when they were contributing little or nothing to the upkeep of the family, but who, had they not done their duty to their country, and had remained in safety in Australia, would now be earning £3 or £4 per week, and assisting materially to maintain the home. tion is given to these facts in the granting Mr MoOrath. of pensions. Then there are the illegitimate children. A t the end of two years pensions cease to be payable in respect of them, and the mother must disclose the facts to the rest of the family. There is no proposal to alter that state of affairs. No proper provision is made for vocational training. It is not to be wondered at that Major Cunningham resigned, because all who have had anything to do with the'Jolimont office know that it was absolutely ignored by the central authoThe rities. * a fine, broad-minded man. We have voted a him, though I do not forget that he threatened to court-martial me. StillI of the found him conscientious in the work that he was carrying out, and he showed a fair grip of the questions with which he was dealing. » It was impossible, however, for him to do useful work. A joinery business was acquired in Ballarat to enable the repatriated soldier to be For instance, taught a trade, but the Central Board did not inform Major Cunningham of what had been done, and to this day, although twenty men are learning a trade there, Mr Hicks, who is mainly responsible for vocational training, and is really a fine officer, has received no notification on the subject. Letters were sent from the Jolimont office to the CenSurely it is not the desire of tral office, and though months elapsed, no reply was given to them, and nothing was done in regard to them. As a result, the. Deputy Controller has resigned, and a whole body of men are in a state of ferment because they can do no useful work. I do not agree with those who I am besieged with complaints suggest that we should hand over the The honourable member for control of repatriation to a non-political body. Parliament should exercise full control. the Government are to blame for that.

120,Mr Mcgrath,"The supporters ofgoodwill and our debt to our soldiers, but I venture to say that there will be serious trouble in Australia if 20,000 or 30,000 men arrive back here within the next two or three months. those who have already returned complain bitterly. Nearly 300 men who have been passed by the doctors as f it for vocational we can do for them is too much. Men training are still walking the streets, drawing a sustenance allowance, and there is nothing worse for a man than to be idling in Bourke-street or Sturtstreet, Ballarat, under such circumstances. It does not matter what money may be required for machinery, or what difficulty there may be in getting in structors, we should provide for the education of these men at once. As soon as a man expresses a desire to be vocationally trained, he should be able to begin his training. I know that a soldier is not much inclined to return to civilian work. The honourable member for New England says that he thinks 30 per cent, of the men coming back, apparently as fit as when they went away, will not be as fit for work as they were when they left. I venture to say that 60 per cent, will never again be so fit for work as they were before' they joined the ArmyI f a doctor certifies that men are able to follow their original civilian occupations, they are not eligible for vocational training, and I ask the Government to hav« that regulation reconsidered. Many men who went away as miners, having now seen the world, do not wish to return to their old occupation, and we should give them an opportunity to learn a trade if they so desire. The fact that a man has not been wounded should not be a reason for denying him the opportunity to learn a trade. Our soldiers have made the greatest sacrifices possible for their country, and those who are lucky enough to return in fairly good health should have the privilege of vocational training. We should endeavour to find out what each man is best adapted for, and train him accordingly. for that, nor is there any provision for like to discuss now, but I have not the financing the man who returns fit and time. My desire is t h a t Australia shall well. vision for helping the fit man, though, as that may be dangerous to this country, a matter of fact, no doctor can determine that a returned soldier is absolutely fit. A man who has* been through a barrage and over a parapet is never the same Many of again. Those who know what the Australian soldiers did in the last stages of this war will agree with me that nothing like Robert Blatchfdrd, an ex-sergeant major of the British Army, a well known and very capable journalist, have publicly stated that had it not been for the three Australian divisions that retook Villers-Bretonneux after the Germans had captured it , and -were threatening Amiens and, after it , Paris, the war must have continued for perhaps ten years more. These divisions were brought down after the Allies had been driven out', and the order was given to re1 capture the place. The action of our men in driving back the Germans probably materially shortened the war, and perhaps saved years of fighting. The boys are not coming back to pre-war conditions. They have fought and have saved the Empire, and they want better conditions than they left. Many men who were miners will not be content to go back to mining. them to do so. MrM c GRATH No provision is made for the setting up of the men in business, if they were not in business before they enlisted. I have had twenty miners refused the opportunity to train at the School of Minesi n Ballarat, because it was said that they were in good health, and the regulations provided that they should return to their original occupation. man into a business.

This amendment will extend the concession to cases in which licences are granted to owners of businesses to construct works, buildings, or other improvements on land for the purposes of the businesses, provided the works, buildings, and other i m provements will pass to the licensor without compensation to the licensee upon termination of the lease. Public tramways, constructed on public thoroughfares or through private properties under licence, will thus be benefited.

Where a man under a building lease, for example, undertakes to lease for with the building intact, at the end c f that time, the money that has been spent on that building has to be amortised within the period of the lease.

If four men join in partnership, their stock being joint and their land several, the desire now is to bring the land into joint account, so that as an asset earning profit it should be allowed as a portion of the capital to be accounted on. If some of the land is mortgaged, or if there is borrowed money against it , we want to bring it into f u l l account, unmortgaged, to deduct .the amount of the mortgage, and to show the net amount that has been thus introduced as an asset into the partnership, and to give credit, after getting that net amount, for the amount of the mortgage at borrowed rates. This accomplishes that, as I promised it should, but the original provision did not. I move That the Senate's amendment be agreed to. appreciate very much the performance of the Acting Prime Minister's promise to put the several owners of an estate worked in partnership in the same position that a single owner of the same property would occupy. I endeavoured to point out when the B ill was in Committee that many of these properties would be returning only 5 per cent, or 6 per cent, interest, but would still come within the operation of this tax. That, I am sure, was not the intention of the Legislature or the desire of the Commissioner. There is only one point to which I wish to refer. It seems to me that if this amendment were not made, those partners would obtain the .advantage of the larger provision which the Act itself makes for the provision in respect of which they are allowed 10 per cent, on the borrowed money. However, I do not wish to press that point, and I appreciate the very generous and f a i r concession made by the Government and the Commissioner. a rather complicated matter for a layman to follow.

ThisB ill has come down from the Senate with a list of nine amendments, which wil l be dealt w it h when the committee stage is reached. doubt that the Repatriation Department has given, and is giving, careful consideration to the problem of housing our returned men and their dependants. I remember hearing Mr Bradshaw, the secretary of the Plasterers' Union, Melbourne, who was a member of the State Repatriation Board whicli recently resigned, say in the course of an address at a meeting at which two members of theFrench Mission were present, that that Board had been considering how best to provide homes for the returned men. There are many complaints from widows and other dependants of difficulties in this connection. One case, which is possibly typical of many, is that of a widow of a tramway employee who was in receipt of a pension of about £ 1 15s. a week, and who was considerably inconvenienced and harassed in consequence of, on three occasions, having her rented house sold over her head. there is no power under the moratorium to prevent a landlord selling his premises; but the hardship is none the less to a woman with a small family. This woman is anxious for some assistance from the Repatriation Department in the way of purchasing a home of her own. The definition clause of the B ill defines "" E l i g i b l e person "" as "" a n Australian soldier who is married, or about to be married, a dependant for whom it is necessary to maintain a home, or a female dependant of a soldier."" This, of course, covers the case of a widow or widowed mother; and the Bill presents an opportunity of providing homes, possibly on much better terms than can be obtained from any building society or other financial institutions. The honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) who has had so much experience in connection with the Langridge Building Society in Melbourne, may be able to tell us how the conditions compare. which the payments extend is longer under the B ill than is usual in the case of ordinary building societies. The shorter the term the larger the instalments. interest is lower under the B ill . interest in the case of a. building society I have no is 8 per cent., anyhow. ber of soldiers-' wives join in the renting of a house, which is looked after by one of them while the others go out to work. The other day I had to make a complaint here about the treament accorded to a lady who applied for some assistance at the Repatriation Office. She had saved about £150, and a building society or other in stitution had told her that if she raised such an amount they would immediately advance £ 3 5 0. However, it was necessary for her to raise an additional £ 5 0 , and it was that necessity which took her to the Repatriation Department, where she had a difficulty w it h one of the officers. I am glad to know, however, that that matter has been satisfactorily cleared up. I am anxious , that this B ill should come into operation at once, but I regret that we are dealing w it h it at a time when it Of course, cannot be given the consideration it deserves. down any new principle; it is merely liberalizing principles already . in existence. repatriation work something that has been carried on so f a r by other institutions.

There is a shortage of homes in every capital city in Australia. I know of many cases in which several soldiers' families are living together, but when the fathers return each f a m i l y w ill require a home of its own.

160,Mr Ttjdor,"We are bringing intoreaching every room. These terraces, which were such a feature of building construction in Melbourne some years ago, are a survival of the crowded area conditions of the cities of the old world. ment Act of Victoria provides for a minimum area on which a house may be built. able member to a crowded area within 70 yards of the Richmond Railway Station, where there is one block of land, with a frontage of 200 feet and a depth of ab^ut 50 feet, on which seven houses stand. Six of them are terrace houses, and they stand on a frontage of 80 feet with a depth of 50 feet. The Victorian legislation referred to by the honourable member is a step in the right direction, and I hope that other States will follow the example, if they have not already done so. I presume that the Minister's proposal will be to build houses on the lines of the clerks' homes scheme at Glenhuntly. I agree with what the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) has-said, that there are oscillations of feeling as to whether public undertakings should be controlled by Parliament or absolutely divorced from it . If the Housing Committee of the Repatriation Department is absolutely divorced from political control, it will be impossible for returned soldiers or their dependants to speak to their parliamentary representatives and have grievances redressed. parliamentary representative now, but he is powerless to help them; and so is Parliament. further, and placed) the Commissioner absolutely outside Parliament, it would be a step in the wrong direction. honourable member. give Parliament less control over the Repatriation Department, it may be necessary to give Parliament more control over it. Furthermore, it may be necessary to have the portfolio of the Minister for Repatriation held by a member of this House. In saying this, I have not one word to say against the present Minister (Senator Millen). When the original Bill was before the House, I said that the repatriation scheme was so big that in all probability it would wreck Ministries and kill Ministers. It is a difficult problem to handle. Human nature is encountered in soj many phases of it. We are all anxious that the utmost generosity should be extended to the men who have done their best for the Commonwealth, but the utmost care must be exercised in the appointment of a Commissioner, and in seeing that the people with whom he comes into contact may receive the fairest of fair treatment. give the Government my most cordial approval in their proposal to enable the various beneficiaries set out in the Bill the opportunity of establishing homes on the most favorable terms possible. Those beneficiaries are(a) An Australian soldier who satisfies the Commissioner that he(i) is married; or (ii) is about to marry; or (ih) has dependants for whom it iB necessary for him to maintain a home; or (b) the female dependant of an Australian soldier; "" Female dependant "" means the widow of an Australian soldier, or, in the case of a deceased Australian soldier who was not married, his mother, provided that(a) she is a widow and was prior to to the enlistment of the soldier dependent upon him; or (b) her husband is so incapacitated as to be unable to contribute materially to her support; Another class of beneficiary is referred to in clause 46, totally or permanently incapacitated soldiers, for whom provision may be made at the request of the Department of Repatriation. When the Government scheme, as embodied in Regulation 88, was before this House for consideration, I made special reference to the omission of anything in the nature of provision for the establishment of homes, and I have had the pleasure of consulting the Minister on the matter. I have now to congratulate him and the Government upon having come down with a very comprehensive scheme in reference to this fundamental part of repatriation work.

167,Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [5.42],"Irepatriation effort -with which I have been associated, before we endeavoured to do anything for the soldier we set out to provide homes for the 'widows and little children of the fallen, and on every occasion on which we made an appeal for assistance, the fallen soldier's comrades approved of the principle that the widow and children should be the nation's first care. I was particularly pleased at the attitude of the honourable member for New England (Lt -Colonel Abbott) who stressed the case for the widows and children. The honourable member scarcely gave the Minister and the Government credit for the very generous provision they have made, and in order that his remarks may not stand by themselves, and lead any dependant to believe that inadequate provision for her has been made, I point out that recently the Minister issued a statement showing that with the building of a home for soldiers' widows and children, plus the pension and the repatriation allowance, a very fair provision had been made for them by the Australian people taking into consideration the whole of the circumstances of our finance. In addition to bhe provision under this housing scheme, the weekly allowance, including pension, bo a soldier and his wife, is 60s. ; ditto, with one child, £3 3s. 6d.; with two children, £ 3 7s.; with three children, £3 10s. 6d.; with four children, £3 13s. 6d.; with five children, £ 3 17s. A widow with one child receives, £2 l is . ; with two children, £2 14s. 6d.; with three children, £2 18s.; with four children, £3 ls. 6d.; and with five children, £3 4s. 6d. We cannot do too much for bhe widow and children of fallen soldiers; bub wibh this housing scheme, plus the financial provision I have mentioned, an honest and fair endeavour has been made by the Government to meet all cases. Broadly speaking, this Bill lays down a great fivndamental principle byrendering it possible for all the beneficiaries mentioned in the measure to establish homes without the payment of more than a nominal deposit. That is, indeed, a generous conception of what this country owes to its soldiers and their dependants. The maximum cost of a house and land is fixed at £700. I do not think the Commissioner will aim .at spending the maximum amount, nor do I think it would be wise to do so. Whilst the price of building material and all the costs in connection with the creation of a home are exceedingly high to-day, yet economic conditions, and the exhaustion of the world's spending power, will not permit prices to remain for long as high as they have been for some time past. Wibh the pace at which bottoms are being built in America, Japan, and Great Britain, and with the necessity for getting back to a rapid exchange in commodities, the high prices of all building materials must fall substantially. The only danger I see about rushing headlong into a building scheme is thab owing bo a fall in prices properties may materially depreciate in value, and the soldier may find himself faced with the obligation of paying off a property the market value of which is considerably reduced. But that is not sufficient justification for us to mark time. I was one of the first in this country to advocate a housing scheme for returned soldiers. I am a convinced beliew that people should live in their own homes. The home is the first institution of life. People who live under their own roofs are always happier. They are not faced with the disturbing influence of increases in rent and the necessity to seek other houses. They are able to settle down to improve and ornament their homes. In this scheme for enabling soldiers and their dependants to have their own homes, the Government will have the backing of the country. Of course, none of us can shut our eyes to the fact that the scheme will require most skilful organization and rigid administration in order to prevent a land boom. The Minister indicated that the Government are likely to spend £50,000,000 in the building of homes, and that 17,000 soldiers are to be settled on the land at, say, an average cost of £1,500 per holding, which would represent another £25,000,000. If this country sets to work to establish homes in the cities and suburbs, and at the same time there is another army of buyers out to settle 17,000 soldiers on the land, in twelve months there will l»e, unless we are very careful, a huge land boom. I counsel the Government to take power to compulsorily acquire properties if necessary. As a rule, I am not an advocate of compulsion in regard to the acquilic generally, as well as for the soldiers, sition of other people's possessions, but when the future welfare of our defenders is concerned, I am prepared to stand by that principle in order that properties may be acquired at reasonable rates. If a land boom is permitted to take place we shall place a load of debt on the man least able to bear it , the man who has been incapacitated by war service. WhilstI desire to stimulate the establishment of homes and settlement on the land, I feel bound to issue a word of warning that a man who starts off on a property owing 100 per cent, of the purchase money for land, stock, and implements, and has to. work out the proposition by himself, will have a very tough problem indeed. Eor that reason I shall be no party to putting about his neck a burden of charges which are in excess of reasonable market rates. If that is allowed to take place many a man will"" be discouraged, and when the bad times come he will be tempted to abandon his holding. I take it that the idea of the Minister is to create a Homes Department within the Repatriation Department. big business proposition, and w ill require most skilful handling. to be a scheme of standardization in order to cheapen construction, and a large staff of designers, builders, supervisors, and inspectors. expenditure of this £50,000,000 will mean the establishment of a huge organization. the Minister has left the door open for a private movement, and has made provision for a soldier to erect his own home, provided the Commissioner approves of the site and the price and the conditions of the contract. missioner will allow a soldier who has a small property, or the means to acquire one, and thinks he can build more cheaply than the Department, the opportunity to do so.

More homes are badly needed for the puband I hope that the result of these new activities will not be that in the metropolitan areas, astute people will rush to buy up building blocks, but that the M i nister will for t if y himself with the necessary compulsory power to acquire properties at a reasonable rate. The Government must be firm, and create a public conscience regarding soldier settlements in the city and the country, otherwise there will be a boom in land values. There is nothing worse in the world than for a man to be tied up to a property on which he will be "" pulling the devil by the. tail "" all his life. I do not think there is anything more disheartening than for a man to be on a broad acres proposition that has been purchased too dearly, and is unsuitable, and in respect of which he is unable to carry on. The Minister will probably find that not only will there be a big body of earnest men and women who are keenly desirous of establishing homes, but that, unfortunately tliere will also be those who are reckless, and will not look after their homes. Por that reason it will be necesThis is a sary, I think, to get some of the outside business brains of the community on the There will need staff.

169,Mr Rodgers,"The Commissionerany land or lands and dwelling house to, or make any advance to any eligible person, unless he is satisfied that the person has a reasonable prospect of carrying out the terms of the contract of sale or advance. Under the State legislation in Victoria, in allotting lands provision is made for a Qualifications Committee, which consists of very eminent men. But in my judgment, if this B ill is administered in the same way as the Victorian Land Settlement Act it will result in a huge centralized system, under which every individual soldier applicant will have to come to Melbourne, from wherever _ he happens to be in the country, to satisfy the Commissioner that he has a reasonable prospect of carrying out the terms of the contract of sale or advance. Notwithstanding the fact that there are Local Committees with experienced men who have known the soldiers from their boyhood, and are aware of their fitness or otherwise, there is, under the State Act, a compulsion on the part of every soldier who desires to qualify for land settlement to dome to Melbourne to be examined by a Board. The persons examining him will have his credentials before them, but they w ill have no means of checking any statements he may make. I suggested that this work of examination might be left to Local Committees. That would save enormous expense to the State, as the State, of course, pays the railway fares of applicants. I have suggested a Local Committee, consisting of the local shire president, a local surveyor, and the president of the local Bepatriation Committee. be able to carry out the work of testing applicant much better than any central Board could do. If a similar system is adopted in the administration of this B ill it will mean that every individual soldier in Victoria who desires to be established in a home must satisfy the Commissioner as to his fitness by a personal visit to Melbourne. scheme with a similar provision, a man ment, housing scheme, and general purmight have to come from Western Ausposes of repatriation, and this Parliatralia cr Queensland for the purpose. in this Bill to enable the Commissioner vernment or the Repatriation Commisto delegate certain of his duties to desion.

It is nonsense to send a soldier 200 or 300 miles away from people who know all about him to be examined by three or four men who know nothing about him. to decide whether he is qualified to have the benefits of the measure extended v> him. Broadly speaking, I cordially support the B ill . I regret that such a measure was not introduced earlier, and I regret also that it should be debated in a thin House in the last hour of tbe session. There has been, in my judgment, altogether insufficient discussion in this Parliament of the subject of repatriation. 1 do not desire that Ministers should become restive under criticism, but we are going to criticise a scheme which may land this country in an expenditure of £100,000,000. It is our bounden duty, if we have any suggestions to make, to out them forward. I have made suggestions when I thought it right to do so, and 1 shall continue to follow that course. I fear that we made a great blunder in the first place in handing over the administration of the scheme of repatriation to an outside body. I say nothing against the Government nominee. I do not think that any more qualified man for the work could be found in the Commonwealth; but in this Parliament we deliberately, in connection w i th the repatriation scheme, voted to entrust the fulfilment of the nation's obligations to six gentlemen, not one of whom we knew, Such a committee would and without one provision of the scheme being laid before us. It might be the the qualifications of an most perfect which the ingenuity of man could evolve, but that did not absolve this Parliament from its cardinal obligation.

So that I may not delay other honourable members who desire to speak, I shall conclude by summarizing what I have already said. In view of the termination of the war, and the early r e My only desire is to offer practurn of our fit soldiers, the Government should revise the. form of financial assistance that is being rendered, so as to bring suspended from 6-30 to 7Jj.5 p.m. within the operation of the scheme the great body of men who will return uninjured. For these we have made no provision whatever, except for those who happen to come, within the housing scheme. I desire to drive home the point that the repatriation scheme, when drafted, dealt with the then pressing problem of how to provide for the disHowever, abled and sick. There is practically an entire absence of any provision for an unmarried man who returns fit, after four and a half years abroad, and who has missed the emoluments of those years and all the chances of advancement in private life. We have not prepared to meet the termination of the war, and the return On the geneof -tens of thousands of able-bodied men, who desire to make some step forward in life. There is nothing harder than to have around one half-a-dozen returned men, proper subjects for assistance, and to have to discriminate between them. All have struck their blow and played a noble part, and the discrimination is too wide between the fit married or single man, as against the injured and sick, who were the first to return. I ask for a review of the provision in this regard, in order tliat the Minister, as I think he might well do, may enlarge the scope of the scheme, so as to include a new class of beneficiaries.

I hope the result -will prove benehim, does not look for charity, or expect ficial and free our soldiers' widows and dependants, and the soldiers themselves, from the fear of the landlord's knock. late hour, after a very strenuous week's work, I shall follow the excellent example for the administration of this scheme set by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), and be brief in my remarks on this Bill. the Government upon having introduced a measure whicli will do a great deal to make the man who has fought for his country take a great interest in its affairs. The honourable member for Ballamarks, made a reference to broken promises, which has frequently been made in this Chamber. Public men make many promises on the platform which are not fulfilled. My mind goes back to a couple of years ago, just after I returned from the Front. A t that time. I heard many of our public men say that the people of Australia could not do too much for the man who had fought for his country. I have never heard any one express an opinion to the contrary. No Government would be adversely criticised for doing too much for the man who has done BO much for his country. I heartily approve of this Bill, but I hope that considerably more sympathy will be shown in its administration than has been displayed in the administration of other measures which have passed this House. The War Pensions Act is one which I have in mind. who have, to administer the War Pensions Act so much as I blame Parliament for having restricted the discretion of those who are called upon to administer its provisions, and I hope that the same mistake will not be made in regard to this Bill. The country is treating those men who wish to settle on the land very well, the financial assistance they are receiving being of a very liberal character. Under this Bill the amount of the advance will naturally be more limited. Nevertheless it is proposed to make an advance up to £700, if necessary, for the purpose of building a soldier's home, and the money will be lent under exceptionally easy, terms. The Australian soldier, as I know to get something for nothing. He is quite prepared to undertake whatever responsibility may be thrown upon him by this Bill if he acepts the benefits given by it. I hope that those who are responsible will make certain that no home will be built on a block of land less than a I compliment quarter of an acre in size. In this way the conditions which obtain in many of the congested areas in metropolitan districts will be obviated. My suggestion, if carried out, would have a beneficial effect in many ways. It would enable a soldier to devote his spare hours to beautifying the property that was eventually to become his own. Every returned soldier who secures a home for himself will naturally take a greater interest in the affairs of the country by reason of the fact that he has some stake in it . The style of building to be erected, and the class of material to be used, are matters which do not concern us very much, but there are many industries which may be affected. In the Corio district, one of the finest sawmills in Australia had to be dismantled because it could not be made to pay, owing to the fact that the company which erected it were obliged to treat timber brought all the way from Siberia-. There is an abundance of timber in Australia which can be milled, and those who have had the experience of sawmilling which I have had, know that it is an industry which is I do not blame those capable of giving employment to a great many returned soldiers. There is a possibility that small centres will grow up around our sawmills, in which returned soldiers employed will be able, with the assistance granted under the provisions of this Bill, to provide themselves with homes built of material which they have perhaps worked up for themselves. I hope that special care will be taken in the selection of those who are to administer the Act. On one occasion a returned soldier, with a little capital, expressed a desire to embark upon a certain industry, and submitted to the Local Committee an application for assistance.",68,Robert Best I N Any Event The Senate S Amendment Ad D The Following

182,"Rat ( Mr Mcgrath), In His Opening Re","His application was strongly recommended by the Local Committee, but, as a clerk at the counter in the Repatriation Department took it upon himself to pass judgment upon the application, it did not go any further. Subsequently the soldier was approached by the chairman of the Local Committee, and asked how he had fared with his application. He pointed out that nothing had been done in the matter, because he had been advised by the officer at the counter not to proceed with it any further, as the Government would not consider suoh a proposition. The chairman of the Committee, who is a Melbourne solicitor, although he lives in the country, immediately communicated with me, and I got into touch with Senator Millen. The result was that the Minister expressed his willingness to give the soldier an opportunity to put his case before bim, and the officer at the counter, I understand, was suitably dealt with; For a man who would act as he did, and take upon himself the responsibility that he assumed, dismissal was not more than he deserved. The Local Committee at Geelong comprises some of the best business men in the city. Some of its members are generously giving up the whole of their .time gratis to this particular work. Yet they are handicapped in very many ways. They are not even allowed to pay a soldier's fare to Melbourne without having to go to the trouble of filling in numerous forms, and complying with other Departmental requirements. caused by this red-tapism' are not conducive to a very good feeling among the men who apply for assistance, and I hope that a great deal of it will be avoided in the administration of this measure, so that the returned men may approach the responsible officers, and have their business expedited in a way which, apparently, is foreign to many Government Departments at the present time. to get the benefit of the assistance of Local Committees for his new demobilization scheme, he should make an immediate announcement as to his attitude towards them. Otherwise the members of the Committees will not continue to act on them. great dissatisfaction among many of the members of these Committees. At present we have on them business men capable of advising the Minister, and anxious and willing to do anything they possibly can, within reason, for the returned soldier. These men are becoming dissatisfied because they have absolutely no power. If the Government desire that hearty co-operation which is necessary they ought to widen the powers of the Local Committees. Repatriation is the most pressing problem with which the country is confronted, and if it is found necessary, as I think it will be, to amend the Act, generous though it is, I hope we shall be given an opportunity of dealing with the matter soon after the House reassembles, so that we may have some chance of coping successfully with the enormous quantity of work that lies ahead. I join with the honourable member for Corio ih the hope that the Government will very early after Parliament reassembles give the House an opportunity to deal in a full and comprehensive manner with this all-important question. In the closing moments of the session it is quite impossible to deal with the subject as completely as we should like to do, and, therefore, our remarks must be restricted to a few features of the Bill before us I shall content myself, therefore, with stating my chief points without The delays elaboration. I offer my sincere congratulation to the Government on the introduction of this measure. The building of homes for soldiers is a very important branch of repatriation, and one which I hope will be developed in every way possible. This scheme can be of great advantage in re-establishing the soldier in civil life. For the most part this Bill is founded on the South Australian Act, which has been successful so far as it has gone, and gives us some indication of the probable usefulness of the machinery we are setting up. One feature I wish to emphasize is the vital importance of the Government encouraging local effort.

The returns received show that 5,858 applications have been received, and tliat 3,508 have been approved, of which number 1,754 were allotted blocks. What an extraordinary tale that is! During the last two or three years all that we have been able to do for the returned soldier by this process has been the settlement of 1,754 men upon the land, although 3,508 of the applicants for land were qualified men. I think that some explanation of that failure is necessary. In Victoria there has receutly been resumed 70,196 acres, at a cost of something like £1,000,000, representing about £13 per acre. Nine hundred and seventythree applicants for blocks were well qualified, and yet only 604 of these have been duly placed upon the land. We cannot contemplate with equanimity what will take place when the remaining 200,000 men return to Australia and 50,000 of them expect to be setttled on the land. We are totally unprepared. I hope that the Government will give attention to the points I have emphasized, and that a fuller opportunity will later on be afforded honourable members to more completely consider this all-important problem. upon this Bill as the most important measure which has been before the House this session. It offers some opportunities for the fulfilment of the promises which we have made to our soldiers that we' would do our best for tliem on their return from the Front. It is unfortunate that we should be asked to put it through as practically the last measure to be considered this session. I am warned that if it is delayed it is possible that the benefits it proposes may not be extended to our returned soldiers for some considerable time. I should like to suggest that if this has been a financial session, next session must be devoted to dealI ask the Minister in charge of the meaing very fully with repatriation.

That is the sysof Parliament and country. The total expenditure involved undeT adopting. this Bill may run into £70,000,000; yet we are asked to put it through with a Chanter) couple of hours' discussion. In the circumstances, I shall place upon the shoulders of the Ministry the responsibility for this measure. But I want to sound one grave note of warning. The honourable member for Kooyong expressed . his regret at the small number of soldiers who have been settled on the land. I am inclined to think, on the contrary, that it is not a bad sign, because, after long experience in the country-havin g during the greater part of my life carried on farming pursuits, and not in a big wayI want to say that under the conditions of land settlement at present, at any rate in Victoria, where land has to Ibe acquired at the market value, only a very small percentage of our returned soldiers, even though they may be trained to country pursuits, are likely to make a success of it. We might look for success in places like Mildura and other irrigated areas, where land can be secured at a comparatively low price, but if our returned soldiers are to be settled on land which we have to go into the open market to buy, a very small percentage will be able to make a success of it. Unless the Government keep a sharp eye on the business, and see that none but the best land is made available for the settlement of soldiers, that settlement may result disastrously. WhilstI am afraid that the success of land settlement by soldiers, so far as Victoria and the more closelysettled States are concerned, is foredoomed to partial failure, the spectacle of men being held up for months waiting for blocks is not very gratifying to those who believe that the returned soldiers should get everything that we can give them.

Most of the widows of soldiers will be young women, and it may be hoped that the greater number of them will marry again. A young widow has a home built for her under this Bill, and she immediately gets married, and some one who did not go to the war at all will derive the benefit of this measure. I wish to direct attention to the importance of this matter. another phase of the question raised by the honourable member for Indi. widowed mother of a soldier may not have been a widow when he left for the Front, but while he has been away her husband may have died, and she may have been dependent for some time upon the soldier.

224,Mr Higgs,"No. In Queensland, asof £50,000,000 is contemplated, and that w ill carry us over a very long period. We should provide for something in the nature of an examination, but I do not think we ought to be so r i g i d as we are under the Public Service Act with regard to tbe age of candidates for employment. The Commonwealth Public Service seems to be a kind of close preserve for boys of sixteen, who may enter as messengers aud work up to higher positions. Good luck to them, I say; but if a man of t h i r t y or for t y years of age can pass the necessary examination, then, as the Leader of the Opposition has suggested, he should be allowed to enter the Service. No doubt the B ill is being rushed through, and, though we have every ground for complaint, we dare not offer any obstruction or criticism that might delay its passage. The Ministry, however, must see the danger there is in having an inefficient staff. should be sorry if the selection of the Commissioner were left to the Public Service Commissioner. the person who makes the selection ought himself to have some technical knowledge; and I would much rather see it left to the intelligence of the Cabinet. the salary to be paid the Commissioner is absurdly small. If we require the services of a good man, we must pay an adequate salary; and certainly a man with all the necessary qualifications for this office could do far better for himself outside the Government Service. A m I to understand that, all things being equal, returned soldiers are to have preference in the selection of the members of the staff? ter for Works and Railways) [9.1] -.The B ill does not provide for preference in that way. The matter is left to the Commissioner, but presumably he will follow the law that operates throughout the Commonwealth Service, and definitely provides for preference to returned soldiers. with the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), when he says that there is no security of tenure. what the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford) has said,-1 take it that the Commissioner will be selected by the Government, who will take the responsibility for his appointment. By this clause, the Commissioner is allowed to select his staff, the members of which will be employed during his pleasure. I have a very vivid recollection of what happens in other countries, and what happened in Australia when there were no Public Service Acts, and persons were appointed to the Public Service simply because they were friends of Ministers. Honourable members who have had any experience of public Departments will admit that the men who have won their way into the Service, and into the higher positions, are much superior to some of the older officers who were appointed by political influence. I am afraid that by means of this clause we are leaving a loop-hole for political influence to creep in . of appointment under our RailwaysA c t . I am not sure that it is a wise method.

Her husband had l e f t her and enlisted in Sydney under another name. She subsequently received information that he had been killed, but when she made inquiries at the Defence Department she found that another woman had made a claim to his deferred pay. Eventually a copy of his will came to hand from Sydney, in which he bequeathed all his money to a single woman living at Kyneton. This woman had advertised his death as his wife, and had given in the advertisement, not only the name in which he had enlisted, but also his real name. in first with her claim before we heard anything of the \yill, we should have paid over the deferred pay to her. officer of the Department in Sydney to see the Curator of Estates in Melbourne, and I have been able to arrange an appointment with h i m for her.

To paragraph a there can be no objection. In regard to paragraph 6, the Regimental DebtsA c t is an Imperial Statute, and I believe that the Imperial officers hold that it applies to the Dominions. If it does apply, paragraph b is unnecessary, but we are inserting it in order to make assurance doubly sure. Paragraph c is the only one to which I think reasonable objection may be taken. It , however, merely makes this measure relate back to the beginning of the war and covers only if this measure had been in operation at the time.

I should like to see a legal officer appointed iu the Defence Department to deal with all these estates. In both the Repatriation Department and the Defence Department there has been a woeful lack of legal knowledge in the administration of estates. These matters are technical, and I have found clerks in the Department dealing with estates about which they had no legal knowledge. The Minister will see that it is hardly right to expose the rightf u l beneficiaries to carelessness or neglect in. the Department. the Department against the consequence of carelessness or negligence. show that if there had been a wrongful disposition of a property prior to the passing of this Bill, the Department would not be indemnified in respect of that also.

But for that qualification paragraph e would ba most objectionable. qualification makes paragraph c less objectionable. Is the Minister perfectly satisfied that under this clause no legal injustice can be done to the rightful owner of a deceased soldier's estate? Mr ""WISE -Not when the honourable member uses the word ""legal,"" but I say that no injustice has been done. The object of this Bill is to cover cases in which legal injustice may have been done. agreed to, I hope that the Minister will attach to the Department a legal officer with some clear understanding of how tliese estates should be dealt with, so that there may be no careless administration. I regret that we have not had more legal advice regarding this clause. I am afraid of its retrospective character. It seems strange that, after four years of war, legislation should be brought forward to make legal a bungle that may have taken place in the Department a couple of years ago. Buti f the Minister will give the Committee his assurance that from a legal stand-point the Bill is fair, I shall offer no objection to it. I desire that the estate of a soldier shall be protected from any negligence that might have taken place in the Department. I ask the Minister whether if a bungle did take place and the Department paid money to a person not entitled to it, would this Bill exonerate the Department? ister) [9.57] -No; because in the first place the Bill only covers cases upon which a decision has 'been given by the prescribed authority, who must be the Minister, or Secretary, or one of the oflicials at the head of the Finance Branch.

Standing Orders suspended, and Bill passed through its remaining stages. ister for Works and Railways) [10.9] 1 move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a short Bill designed to give necessary relief in certain cases. The first amendment of the principal Act for which it provides relates to telegraph messengers who displayed their loyalty by enlisting before they were eighteen years of age, and did service oversea. Some are still away, and we feel that it is hardly just that these lads, having enlisted, should be put out of the Service. The amendment is to cover their case. The second amendment of the principal Act for which this Bill provides, deals with certain positions in the Public Service in respect of which it is not considered desirable to have competitive examinations. It is hardly fair, for instance, that cleaners, who have been in the temporary service for some time and have given satisfaction, should be required to undergo an examination in order to become permanent officers in the general division. It is proposed to specify certain classes of these, servants, and to enable them to be appointed without being submitted to a competitive examination. A further amendment of the principal Act covered by this Bill arises out of the report of the Royal Commission into the loyalty of oflicers of the Public Service. The final one deals with the question of holidays. Under the principal The existing law provides for the observance of eight holidays per annum, and also for the recognition of such holidays or half-holidays as may be proclaimed in the different States. It is now proposed to secure uniformity by providing that in addition to the eight holidays per annum covered by the principal Act there may be observed "" such additional days or half-days, not exceeding in the whole, in the case of any office, four days in any one calendar year, as are prescribed."" Special holidays may also be declared. holidays named. This would cover the Peace holidays. power in such a case to proclaim a general holiday throughout Australia. vision is, I take it, to have uniform holidays throughout the States. States there are only ten public holidays. Under this Bill the observance of eight holidays is assured; four more may be proclaimed, and, in addition, special holidays may be declared. Certain other amendments relating to hours of employment are also made by this Bill. mit the Bill is much improved as the result of amendments made in another place. I am glad that the Senate struck out tlie clause which deprived public servants of rights secured by an award of the Court. There are one or two features of the Bill, however, on which I should like some information.

The clause applies bo that Commission, and to that Commission only. clear that the object is to enable the Government to summarily dismiss certain persons from the Public Service without the formaliby of an inquiry by Departmental Boards, or the operation of any of the other machinery which is considered necessary to secure justice for the public servants. I am not prepared to agree to any course that will apply special treatment to any class of persons in the Service. If certain persons are disloyal, disaffected, unworthy for any reason of public trust or confidence, bhe facb should be besbed by bhe machinery provided for brying members of bhe Public Service. The war being over, we should nob continue these special punitive provisions by new legislative measures directed to the penalization of men on account of their blood. Men who are good -enough to have been appointed to the Public Service in the ordinary way should have the f u l l measure of justice and protection that the Public ServiceA c t provides. I am not satisfied that the Commissioner who has made this inquiry is fitted by temperament to furnish a report tliat will be just to all the members of the Public Service. I believe, with the honourable member for Yarra( MrT u d o r ) , that persons were brought before the Commission secretly, and catechised and cross examined in a way altogether foreign to the principles of British justice. I do not say that I have complete proof of bhat, because one likes to hear both sides; but I have heard circumstantial statements, by persons whose word I am prepared to take, that the treatment before the Commissioner of some members of the Public Service was not such as to do credit to the community in which it was tolerated. A t any rate, on the broad principle that we should not differentiate against and penalize a section of the Public Service, I am opposed to this It is really the Barnet clause. T h a t is a Commisnot desirous that any one who has been proved to be disloyal should remain in bhe Public Service; bub persons who have been before the Commissioner, and have given evidence, do not know what his report will be. The sort of quesbions asked were these-""What is your name?"" "" H o w old are you?"" "" W h a t is your posibion ?"" "" Where are you employed ?"" "" How long have you been so employed ?"" "" A r e you married or single?"" "" H o w many children have you?"" "" W h a b is the age of the eldest boy ?"" In one case the man questioned replied that he had not a boy, and was asked the age of his daughter. "" H a v e you any brothers?"" "" D i d your brother t r y to enlist?"" To that question the answer in one case was, "" Yes, but he was rejected."" Then came the question, "" What doctor rejected h i m ? "" I do not know what doctor passed my son when he enlisted, and, had he been rejecbed, I would nob have known whab doctor rejected him. The man was asked, "" Where was he examined?"" He replied, "" I do not know."" The Commissioner then said, "" You had better find out."" He was asked where he was born, and the birthplace of his father and mother. To the last question he said, "" In Victoria, bub I do nob exactly know where."" When asked the birthplace of his grandparents, he said bhat he did nob know. I know where my parents were born, bub I know the birthplace of only one of my grandparents, though bhey were allj born in Soubh Wales.

We discussed this matter at great length when the Bill was previously under consideration. Honourable members expressed their . disappointment that clause 2 did not grant to men who had served overseas the seniority to which it was understood they were entitled on their return. It was the object of the honourable member for Melbourne to make provision that preference should be given in the Military Forces on the principle that underlies the preference which is given to returned soldiers in the Public Service generally. The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) has been very persistent in calling attention to the fact that eligibles on the Head-Quarters Staff, who had not served abroad, were seeking to make the Military Forces a close preserve to themselves. ister for Defence) [10.57] -The proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne deals more particularly with the question of seniority.

I desire to insure that, at auy rate, so far as the Defence Department is concerned, any returned soldier or sailor who is qualified and available shall receive any appointment to the Department. The proposed new clause and the amendment are likely to bear hardly upon those officers who were willing to go abroad on active service but were prevented from doing so. "" o t h e r things being e q u a l "" are inserted, in the clause. cover the cases I am referring to ? serve the rights of those members of the Forces who desired to go abroad but were nob allowed to do so. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment,which will secure justice for returned soldiers. Some time ago the Department sent thirty clerks to England, only one of whom was a returned soldier. Surely amongst bhe soldiers ab bhe Fronb were clerks who could have been chosen for the work in England, thus saving the expense of sending bhem all the way from Ausbralia. If bhis amendmenb is carried, ib will prevenb a recurrence of any nonsense of bhab kind. [11.7] I do not like opposing an amendment of this character; but tEe Committee should be careful in whab ib is doing. If the amendment were carried a young sergeanb-major who had been bo the Front would be entitled to promotion over . an older sergeant-major who had been refused permission to go because of his age. We know that the sergeant major is the backbone of regimental organization and training. Is a highly competent older man to be compelled to stand back whilst a younger, vigorous I fighting man gebs promotion over his head ? If bhab is done bhe organizabion of . a company or regimenb may be complebely upseb. A lob of the delay in connection with the sending to Australia of soldiers' papers, which the Department required to have in hand before finalizing the payments due to the men, was due to the lack of administrative training on the part of the officers in the field. It is necessary to have men who understand military organization and the financial regulations. A young captain may be a fine fighting man, but he might nob be conversanb with or qualified for the administrative work, attaching to the position of captain of a company. The intention of the mover of the amendment is that returned soldiers shall be appointed to all positions. WhilstI believe in giving preference to the returned soldier, there is a danger of carryT h a t is why the words, ing the principle too far, and of doing an injustice to some men who desired to go to the Front but were not allowed to W o u l d those words do so. ister for Defence) I ' l l . 8 ] I am sorry bhab I cannot accept the amendment.

After consultation with the law officers of the Crown, we have determined to release those offenders. I am not quite sure whether it will be possible to release them all before the Christmas holidays.

As to those who have been incarcerated in the more distant parts of the oontinent, it will be difficult, if not imposoccasion to do .so. I am sure that the sible, to release them before Christmas; but honourable members may rely that celerity will be used. I have already explained that the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) has taken a very careful review of the cases of certain internees in the internment camps. Some releases have already been ordered, and a careful review of the cases has been and will be undertaken during this and the following week, to see whether, with due regard to the safety of the Commonwealth, clemency can be shown. I have nothing further to add, unless I may be permitted, on behalf of the Government, to express to yon, Mr Speaker, our thanks for the way in which you have conducted the deliberations of the session. It has been an arduous session, straining many of us to the very limits of endurance. You, sir, I am sure, have felt the ful l weight of. this;. but you have never varied from the strict path of impartiality you have set yourself. The members of the Government, and honourable members on this side generally, are deeply sensible of j our unfailing kindr ness and courtesy on every occasion. I desire also to use similar expressions of grateful thanks towards the Chairman of Committees, Mr Chanter. That gentleman is in years beyond most members of the House, but he has kept to his arduous labours through this session with wonderful tenacity, and he and his deputies, the Temporary -Chairmen, have -considerably helped the passage of the large number of important measures which since September last, this Legislature has placed on the statute-book. I wish, also, to pay to the officers of the House, the clerks and attendants, our thanks for the way in which they have lightened our labours. In another Legislature I have enjoyed the privilege of attendance of the same kind, but I have never seen at any table the work of the officers give more satisfaction, .or done wibh greater promptitude. We have so few opportunities to acknowledge to those gentlemen who attend us so unceasingly our appreciation of bheir unremitting labours that I gladly use this Leader of the Opposition will join with me in this acknowledgmenb of our obligation. I include with the officers the Chief of Hansard and his sbaff Honourable members may not have observed, but Minisbers, and I in particular, have known the strain tliat has been thrown on ""them, especially during bhe lasb week or two. All through the session it is bad enough, because our work goes on unceasingly, and the long hours that we have sat recently, have strained to their utmosb sbrebch the* nerves, and drained the physical powers, of the gentlemen who record our speeches."" It became a question a week ago whether we should not have to take measures to relieve them, but their determination, and assistance bhab Mr Speaker was able to render, have enabled them to continue, although both Houses have been sitting excessively long hours. I wish the Hansard reporters to know that we thoroughly appreciabe their labours.

It has Been a great thing to witness the changes of heart and mind in the people of Australia since hostilities were terminated by the signing of the"" armistice. We have been, perhaps, too busy to note all the kaleidoscopic changes, ancl what they mean to the history of mankind generally, but when we get further from them we shall be able to appreciate the magnitude of the events that have occurred under our very eyes. I trust that the peace conditions settled between the belligerent forces may make for the greater freedom of mankind and the more permanent uplifting, stability, and prosperity of the civilized nations. dially join with the Acting Prime Minister on behalf of not only those members of the Opposition now present, but the party generally, in expressing our acknowledgment of our indebtedness to you, Mr Speaker, and to the officials of the House, including the messengers, who make our path as easy as possible.

We have had, as the Acting Prime Minister has said, a"" strenuous time, but we have had strenuous times before, and those of us who may be fortunate enough to be elected to future Parliaments have strenuous times yet to come. congratulate the Acting Prime Minister on the way in which he has led the House. though not agreeing with everything he has done, can sincerely congratulate him shown. cult for a man to fill an office when acting for another than to fill it as its proper occupant. who have worked in an acting capacity, as I have done on more than one occasion, know the difficulties of the situation. I congratulate the Acting Prime Minister on the ability he has shown in very difficult and trying times, and on his capacity aud good nature. Our work may appear easy to those who watch us, but it is not really so easy. I re-echo the honourable gentleman's wish that we may all have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. The people of Australia are realizing that the holidays this year will be brighter than they have been for the last four years. I hope that when we re-assemble we shall find still greater happiness existing throughout the civilized world. Johnson) I desire to thank you, Mr. Acting Prime Minister, for the very kind words of appreciation which regarding my conduct of the business of the House as its presiding officer, and I desire to acknowledge the consideration that I have received at all times from yourself as Acting Prime Minister and from Mr Tudor as Leader of the Opposition, as also from honourable members generally.

I should like to add to what has fallen from the lips of Mr Tudor in paying my meed of"" praise, as D r . Maloney would say, to the Acting Leader of the Government for the manner in which he has conducted the business of the House. He has, by his courtesy, tact, and strong sense of humour, as well as great administrative capacity, in no small measure conduced to the harmony whioh has generally marked our proceedings. I am sure that all members of the House thoroughly appreciate the difficulties of his position, and recognise the admirable manner in which he has performed the arduous duties of his office. On behalf of the officials of the House in all tlie departments, I have to thank the Acting IPrime Minister for his eulogy of their services, and to add to what he has said my appreciation of their unfailing loyalty, and my testimony to the excellent manner in which they perform ' their duties and their willingness to do their best under very trying circumstances. I am sure that their work and their conduct generally is highly appreciated by members on all sides. I thank you, Mr Acting Prime Minister, for having so readily acceded to the request of Mr President and myself that you should pay a sum of money out of your Advance by way of war bonus to the lower-paid servants of the House. They, I am sure, greatly appreciate this , consideration, which has been given because of the effect of the war in increasing the cost of living. I again thank the members of the House generally for the assistance I have received on all sides while presiding over its deliberations, and I wish them a happy Christmas and a prosperous new year, which I trust will usher in an era of permanent peace -the Mother Country. I hope that this [371] I thank the Acting Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for what I have to thank honourable they have said concerning me. I apI acknowledge, too, preciate highly their kind remarks concerning the manner in which I have performed my duties as Chairman of Committees. Members may at times feel somewhat irritated because they are not called when they think they should be called, but general good feeling has been shown towards me, and whenever I have appealed for support I have received it . The duty of the Chairman is to apply the rules and orders which have been laid down for the government of our proceedings. I am sure that Mr. Speaker will acknowledge that it would be very painful for the occupant of the Chair to have to appear to act harshly at any time. It is not real harshness, and it is only displayed in conformity with the duty specially laid down in the Standing Orders to be carried out by the Chairman. I thank honourable members sincerely for the support I have received from them at all times, and I take this opportunity of thanking the Temporary Chairmenf o r the assistance rendered to me whenever I called upon them to relieve me for a short period; they have always responded, although often at considerable inconvenience to themselves. Now that we are going into recess for the first time for five years, may I express the wish that honourable members w ill enjoy that peace that Christmas always brings, without the dreadful happenings to which we have of late years been accustomed. May I be permitted, also to divert a little on this occasion in order to t say to the Acting Prime Minister and his colleagues that I hope that they w ill give effect to the wishes of the parents, relatives, and friends of a very large section of our Forces who have done a great deal towards winning the war, and who have been through the Gallipoli, 1 Egyptian, and Palestine campaign, that, before they are finally returned to Australia, they shall have the final opportunity of visiting the heart of the Empire",100,Cuted Under The Wae Pbecautions
418,Mr Chanter (Riverina) [11.58],"general desire will be pressed by the Government on the authorities at Home, and that, before another Christmas comes, we shall have welcomed back to Australia all our brave men. I thank the Acting Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and Mr Speaker for the complimentary manner in which they have spoken of me. Minister and Treasurer) [12.2 a.m.] I have wired to the Prime Minister fully on the matter to which the Chairman of Committees has just referred, expressing the strong desire of the Government and Parliament that the ANZACs and other warriors who have gone into the Levant and Mesopotamian country shall be given the opportunity of visiting Great Britain before returning to Australia. I have no doubt that the matter will be strongly stressed by the Prime Minister. In my previous remarks, I omitted to refer to the general spirit of consideration shown by honourable members to the Government and myself. I welcome the spirit of courtesy that has grown up in the Chamber. My relationships with the Leader of the Opposition and his fellow members on that side have been pleasant to a degree. Of course, we have had our differences. We must continue to have them, separated as we are by stronglyheld political views, but my experience has been in the past-and there has been a recurrence of it this session-that there is no occasion for us to develop personal hatred or antipathies. The ordinary courtesies which can be observed by most men in every walk of life can be observed by representative men in a deliberative Assembly. I not only hope that we may have a continuance of that spirit, but also that there may be a perpetuation of it so long as this Parliament exists. It lightens public life, and gives a little zest to the otherwise onerous load that Ministers carry. TO LONDON . the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) asked the following questions :Is it a fact that as stated, that the Department is sending over thirty clerks from the Defence Department to London for the purpose of investigating soldiers' records, and the work of the Australian Imperial Force in England, and, if so, is it true that out of the thirty men to be sent, only one is a returned soldier. I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information :The facts are that twenty-five clerks and two officers will shortly be sent to London, together with a large mass of information compiled here to ascertain and correct differences between Australia and London as to individual soldiers not drawing rates abroad, which, of course, affects the rates of allotments in Australia. The work is necessary and unavoidable, and is practically only anticipating the work to be done upon demobilization, thus avoiding irritating delays to the soldiers upon discharge. As regards the proportion of returned, soldiers to be included in the number of clerks mentioned, the facts are that up to the present twenty-three have been selected. Of these, eight are returned soldiers, while most of the remainder are medically unfit, including rejects. The work is of an exacting nature, involving large experience of a particular class, so that selection cannot be confined to returned soldiers. Many of the latter who have been employed on the work up till recently have refused to go on with .the work to London. the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) asked the following questions :1. Isi t a fact that on the hospital ship Afiltiades, which arrived in Australia in August, .1917, with approximately 800 men on board, mostly invalids, military police were used to keep the men off one side of the promenade deck, the same being used for seventy officers and sergeants? 2. Ts it a fact that, on the same ship, onelegged and otherwise disabled men had to go up and clown several flights of companion-ways to bunks and meals, while the officers had almost the whole of the cabin accommodation to themselves? 3.
