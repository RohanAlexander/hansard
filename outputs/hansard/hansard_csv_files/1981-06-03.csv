The fact is that an Airbus and DC9 fleet, with some Boeing 727s since 1957 some 24 years have elapsed, almost a of Trans-Australia Airlines-that decision means quarter of a century, and the accounts, financial a departure by the two major airlines from the performance and efficiency of Ansett Airlines of past practice of utilising the sharing of spare parts Australia have not been analysed publicly in that stocks, maintenance equipment, flight simulators time.

It will also determine the first class time to time about the lack of public analysis of fare differentials. accounts and the paucity of information on the Under the provisions of the Bill such reviews operations of each airline, a rough kind of comare to be held concurrently for Ansett and TAA parison can be made.

With this change, that position ducted within three years of the enactment of this will no longer pertain. Unless there is an accurate Bill.

To have a public inquiry every ducted publicly. One of the very contentious time there was a major fare review would result in points of the whole two-airline policy was brought extended inquiries.

When one takes legislation, as in the Schedule to the Airlines account of the scope of responsibility-it covers Agreement Bill, which prescribes that there be not only the trunk operators, but also the regional only two operators over the entire trunk route operators and the commuter operators-the network, it is a nonsense to suggest that they Committee would hold, on average, one inquiry suffer from a risk of disclosure of information.
