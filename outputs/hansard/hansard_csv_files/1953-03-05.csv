From my personal experience, I know that the Prime Minister is good enough to provide those letters on the recommendation of honourable members. that it is well known to honourable members that before they write in asking for -such letters they should satisfy themselves in the matter. I am bound to tell the honourable member that I have no reason to think that that is not done. As he is aware, these letters are supplied as a privilege, ami they ought not to be made available to persons who are not suitably recommended. That is why members of Parliament arc responsible for asking for the letters to be issued. been made to me by quite a number of women's organizations in relation to the International Labour Organization Convention that dealt with the subject of equal remuneration for women workers who perform work of the same value as that performed by males. As the convention was concluded a considerable time ago, will the Minister for Labour and Rational Service inform the House of the action-that has been taken in relation to the matter or the action that it is proposed to take ? prepared, which I shall make available to the Leader qf thc Opposition and other honourable members who may be interested in the matter. in the House? COAL. Minister inform thc House whether the Western Australian Government recently asked the Commonwealth for financial assistance to enable the provision ' of amenities on the Collie coal-fields? 1 remind the right honourable gentleman that last year the Commonwealth paid to New South Wales to provide amenities on the coal-fields, more than 4d. for every ton of coal mined in that State, but that less than l i d . a ton was paid to Western Australia for that purpose. Will the right honourable gentleman assure the House that, if the Government intends to continue subsidizing the provision of amenities on the coal-fields at the expense of thc taxpayers, financial assistance will be provided by the Commonwealth on an equitable basis, so that no particular State shall be favoured? honourable member's question relates to ' policy, I cannot deal with it now. I may say, however, that tbe Western Australian Government has asked for further assistance, and that matter has been the subject of inquiry and correspondence. In fact, thc latest manifestation is now on my desk awaiting my signature. Thc honourable member may be assured that the matter is well in hand.

I have received a letter from an aged war pensioner who has great difficulty in calling at his post service homes scheme helps to relieve office each month to collect his pension. He has asked that the department adopt the simple method of posting his monthly cheque to him. Will the Treasurer issue appropriate instructions so that war pensioners may receive their pension cheques by mail in the same way as age pensioners receive paymonts from the Department of Social Services? have the proposal considered/and will let the honourable member know what can be done to meet the request. asked the Minister for Social Services a question in relation to the trend shown by official figures relating to certain catemencement of each day's sitting of this gories of war service homes. I am certain that the honourable gentleman, misunderstood the import of my question. By way of explanation, I point out that the figures that he supplied to me last week show that houses that are semi-constructed by the War Service Homes Division, in the sense that thcy are fully controlled by the division from the beginning of construction, have increased by 2,000,whereas the number of new homes taken over has decreased by 500 and the number of old homes taken over has decreased by 4,000. Is the accent to be further placed in future on control of construction by the War Service Homes Division to the detriment of transactions iu the other two categories? stand thc honourable member yesterday. many such stations have been established I now realize that, when he referred to by thc present Government, and how houses constructed by the War Service many were established during the eight Homes Division, he had in mind houses years of office of the Labour Government ? that are built by private contractors on behalf of the division.

BOURKE -Can the Minister for Health inform me whether any research is being conducted by his department into important aspects of industrial medicine, such as occupational diseases and other matters which affect the health of workers? If any work is heing done in that connection, are the results being made available to those members of the medical profession who make a special study of such subjects? Sir search in Australia, for which funds are provided by the Australian Government, is under the direction of the National Health and Medical Research Council, which was established by the present Minister for External Affairs fifteen years ago, when he was Treasurer. That organization consists of representatives of the Commonwealth and the various States. Each year it selects for research certain subjects which frequently include matters such as those referred to by the honourable member. The results of such research receive general publication. Postmaster-General said, in reply to a question, that during the term of office of the Labour Government, tbe accounts of tbe Postal Department had shown an annual deficit of between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000 on several occasions.

A notable instance of such improvement is the Chemside Hospital, which is being established quite close to Brisbane and which, I understand, is estimated to cost more than £1,000,000. a question to the Ministerf o r Health by stating that I am informed that hearing aids in Australia cost approximately £50 each. This exorbitant price is claimed to be due to the existence of patent rights, the real value of the equipment being about £5. As the present price of hearing aids makes it impossible for pensioners to obtain them, w ill the Minister undertake to have investigations made overseas with a view 'to securing hearing aids at a reasonable price? If that is not possible, perhaps his department might be able to secure the Australian manufacturing rights and have such equipment manufactured here, as was done in the case of artificial limbs for disabled ex-servicemen, and thus enable needy individuals to receive hearing aids at a just price. ment makes special provision in every capital city for the examination of young deafened school supply of hearing where necessary.

Minister for Defence) [11.2] I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1951, it ie expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred [19] to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to this House the results of its Capital investigation, namely:-The proposed erection of a dairy research Laboratory at Highett, Victoria. The work proposed is designed to provide laboratory facilities and administrative, library accommodation, and so on, for oflicers of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization required to carry out research into problems connected with the dairy products industry, which the dairy research section of tbe organization is being continually asked to investigate. The present laboratory premises used by the section are urgently required by tbe Division of Industrial Chemistry for that division's research into minerals utilization. The committee has reported that as the production of dairy commodities must be rapidly increased, there is an urgent necessity to extend the work of the dairy research section, and that the laboratory should, therefore, be commenced as soon as possible. Tbe proposed method of construction is brick walls, reinforced concrete floors and corrugated asbestos cement roofing. The estimated cost of the project is £152,100.

Opposition menibers interjecting, Leader of the Opposition sat down, the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) was the only member to rise. member for Hunter( Mr James) did not rise until I bad called the Vice-President of the Executive Council. Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has claimed that under the proposed limitation of time for the remaining stages of the bill a large number of honourable members will have no opportunity to speak on it. That the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) be not further House is prepared to listen, I shall allow heard. able gentleman will not be in order in moving his motion at this stage. tive arrangement was made between the Calwell), as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and myself and it was based on the. practice that was followed by the Government of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member of allowing cognate bills such as the bill now before the Chair and the Banking Bill to be debated together up to the committee stage. If that arrangement had been adhered to, an opportunity would have been given to twice the number of honourable members to speak on the motion for the second reading than has been the case. However, when the honourable member for Melbourne was absent from Canberra oh Tuesday his leader reversed that tentative arrangement. I leave it to the House to say why the right honourable gentleman took that action. honourable gentleman is now dealing with a matter that is not before the Ohair. Leader of the Opposition said that under the proposed limitation of time a sufficient number of honourable members would not have an opportunity to speak on important clauses' of the measure. If he wishes to pose as a tactician, he will need to employ other than the bumble-footed methods to which he is now resorting. If he had adhered to the arrangement that his deputy made with me, twice the number of speakers would bave been enabled to address themselves to this measure. But, now, the Leader of the Opposition rises and protests that the Government is not providing suflicient time to enable the House to debate the bill fully. I repeat that the right honourable gentleman himself proposed the restrictions about which he now complains; and I have no doubt that he did so in an endeavour to get back on his deputy. I merely wish to say that when an arrangement is made Opposition members interjecting, the Vice-President of tbe Executive Council to continue. the Leader of the Opposition that when he appoints one of his colleagues to make an arrangement President of the Executive Council cannot canvass that matter. pass over it, because all honourable members know to what I was about to refer. The Leader of the Opposition has said that if the "" guillotine "" is to be applied he has no fault to find with the allotment of times for discussion of the various clauses. His objection is that the total time to be allowed for the remaining stages is insufficient. He knows that if the arrangement that I had made tentatively with his deputy had been adhered to, the House would have been enabled to debate this bill and the Banking Bill for six full days, but, as I have said, he chose to limit this debate to two days. Now, he is complaining. He cannot have it both ways. The proposed limitation of time will be sufficient to permit 50 honourable members, using their ful l allotment of time, to speak on this measure in committee.

I said that I would agree to that suggestion tentatively, but that 1 should have to report the matter to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), who would then consult his colleagues about it. tively "". able gentleman stated the position correctly up to that stage. I reported the matter to my leader, who consulted our other colleagues about it, and the Labour party then decided that the bills should be considered separately. We had a perfect right to do so. It is a right that any Opposition, regardless of the political party that constitutes it, possesses. ThatI should be pilloried because of something that happened in that fashion,, and that it the Leader of the Opposition is quite unfair. Having made that explanation, I conclude by remarking that it is all I wanted to say when I asked for leave to. make a statement.

In committee: Consideration resumed from the 4th March (vide page 568). Clause1 agreed to. Clause2 (Establishment and functions of Commonwealth Bank Board). -This is tbe vital clause of a bill which deals with one of the three vital issues on wbich, I believe, this Government was elected-banking . Clause2 contains the machinery for constituting the General Banking Division of the Commonwealth Bank as a separate legal entity. But this new legal entity, the Commonwealth Trading Bank, is to take its instructions from the Commonwealth Bank Board. I voted for the second reading of this measure because I regarded that as the first vital step in the separation of the functions of the central bank and the trading bank. I believe the Government is correct in taking that first step. 1 believe also that the customers of the bank should be allowed to hecome accustomed to the separation, so that confidence and trust in the new bank may be fostered. The proposed amendments that I circulated are intended to empower the Government at any time, by administrative or executive action, to appoint a bank board, which could take over the direction of the Commonwealth Trading Bank and would not be responsible to the central bank. By that means there would be a complete separation of the functions of the central bank and the trading bank. 'Under the amendments the presiding member of the board that I envisage would be responsible to the Treasurer, in the same way as is the Governor of the central bank board today, and, in the event of any dispute, the papers would be tabled in this House, .Tn.mes, R. in order to make the matter public in Joshua. R. the proper way. My proposal would merely give the Government power to McLeod, D. establish a board if it wanted to do so. Minogue. D. A possible objection to the proposal is that tbe Government may not be able to carry out any special job. I hold-and Peters, E. W. I think other people hold also-that a Watkins, D. O. special task such as providing funds for superphosphate production and housing Daly. F. M . could be undertaken, because the tradSheehan, T. ing bank would still belong to the Government. As was pointed out during the second-reading debate, I believe that the complete separation of the banks would make nationalization more difficult in the future, and when the people became accustomed to them working smoothly and efficiently, the matter would no longer be a political issue. Furthermore, the present professional status of the employees of both the private banks and thb Commonwealth Bank would be maintained. I consider that they have made a particularly fine contribution to the development of Australia. All acknowledged banking authorities adhere to the view that there should be a complete separation. When Labour introduced the Central Beserve Bank Bill in 1930 the Senate appointed a select committee to inquire into and report on its provisions. Paragraph 16 of the report of that committee contains thirteen accepted conditions and functions of a central reserve bank, as laid down by Sir Ernest Harvey of the Bank of England. He statedA central bank should not ordinarily compete with the trading banks for general banking business. That means there should be a separation of functions in order to allow the central bank to do its work properly. Sir Ernest Harvey also statedA central bank should not engage in trade nor have any interest in any commercial, industrial, or otlier undertaking. I believe that, whatever happens to-day or later on, eventually there will be a central bank in Australia, completely divorced from trading functions. We are moving towards that end. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) quoted last night from a question that was asked by Mr Chifley,",21,Governmen T Members No
111,Mr Jeff Bate (Macarthur) [11.25].,"and answered by Sir Ernest Eiddle, during tbe enquiry by tbe Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems in 1936 and 1937. I understood the honourable member to say that Sir Ernest had said that he thought that the activities of the trading bank could not be interfered with because it was joined to the central bank. I agree with the contention that there is interference with the efficiency of the trading bank and much more interference with the efficiency of the central bank, when they are tied together. ber for Fremantle did not say anything of the sort. vital things in Australia to-day is the regulation of credit. I believe that the central bank is getting towards an effective regulation of credit. Buti f the Commonwealth Bank Board found that it had to do something about special accounts or to take something away from the private trading banks, and at that time its members were worried about a trading bank difficulty, the minute they tried to carry out their job they would suffer from an ""inhibition. Because of its split personality, the board could not give a correct decision. In the buying or selling of securities, or the regulation of the note issue, the central bank would find itself in conflict with its own interests in its own trading bank. Eventually, they should be separated completely, because their separate and clear-cut interests will grow away from each other. Eeserve banking practice all over the world shows that separation has been manifestly successful. England and America are good examples. As I said before, the amendment that I have circulated seeks to give the Government power to do this at a later date. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN ( Mr Bowden) -Order! The honourable member has not yet moved his proposed amendment. the amendment but in view of tbe fact that I have been advised that it will not be agreed to I propose to withdraw it. I believe that I have achieved my purpose, which was to draw attention to tbe most important need for the eventual separation completely of the functions of the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Trading Bank. When one is in a fight to achieve something worthwhile, although he may lose the first round, he can then bring the matter up at every opportunity. bonorable member entitled to speak to a proposed amendment that he has not moved ? The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN Order! The honourable member is entitled to speak for ten minutes on any subject related to this bill. ing to the clause under consideration, and referring to an amendment that I have circulated. I make it clear that I intend to keep up the fight to achieve this eventually. I believe that separation will come, and I shall do everything in my power to bring it about. Opposition) [11.40] -As the Chair has taken notice of the existence of a proposed amendment that has been circulated but not moved, I suppose that it will not be out of order for me to refer to it. Had the amendment been formally moved, I would have expressed the view that it would be strongly opposed by us. The substance of tbe amendment that the honourable member circulated but failed to move clearly indicated the intentions of a considerable number of honourable members on the Government side of the chamber. The bill provides that a connection shall be retained between the trading bank and central bank activities of the Commonwealth Bank, through the Commonwealth Bank Board. That association will not be terminated. However, had the proposal of the honourable member for Macarthur been accepted, there would have been a complete separation of the Oommonwealth Trading Bank from the central bank. The whole plan of the Government then would have been revealed more openly. That plan, as we see it, is that the general business activities of the Commonwealth Bank shall be segregated from the central bank notwithstanding the fact that they have been intimately connected with the conduct of",22,Governmen T Members No

117,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Leade r of thethat bank for 40 years. Tbe General Banking Division of tbe Commonwealtb Bank is to bave a new name. Some people see little significance in that proposal, but I consider it to be of great importance because inevitably it will affect tbe business of the Commonwealtb Trading Bank and will confuse depositors. Tbe bonorable member for Macarthur has revealed, perhaps unconsciously, the inescapable consequence of the Government's proposals which, in his view, do not go far enough. The honourable gentleman's comments on the evidence given by Sir Ernest Riddle, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, before the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, needs drastic correction. The truth is that the report of the commission has not been quoted accurately in this discussion by any honourable member on the Government side of the chamber, including the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden). The Treasurer quoted from paragraph 577 of the report, but he read only the last sentence of that vital paragraph. I shall quote the earlier portions of the paragraph, which are of the utmost importanceAlthougli it is unusual for a central bank to honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr earry on trading bank activities and to control a savings bank, we consider it desirable that the Commonwealth Bank should do both. Through its trading bank activities it possesses when he gave evidence before the royal powers of competing with the trading banks which can be exercised as and when required. Similarly, its saving bank activities add to its ability to regulate tlie volume of credit and enable it to compete, if necessary, w i th the State savings banks. We are of opinion that the use of its trading bank activities as an adjunct to central banking policy is in keeping with its central bank functions and is to be approved. That clearly conveys an express recognition by the commission of the necessity for continuing the trading, or general business, activities of the Oommonwealth Bank as an essential and integral part of its functions. It cannot mean anything else. However, lest there be any doubt about tbe matter, I refer honourable members to paragraph 521 of the report, which statesThe present structure of the Commonwealth Bank, consisting as it does of a central bank with trading bank powers and a savings bank, is, in our opinion, essential to the efficient exercise of its functions as a central bank. In other words, the commission firmly held the opinion that the present structure of the Commonwealth Bank should not bo altered. But that structure is now to be altered. Therefore, I say that this Government has virtually torn up the report of the royal commission. Although its members held varying political views and entertained different theories on the subject of financial and monetary reforms, they were unanimous on that point. This measure will strike two serious blows at the Commonwealth Bank. First, it will strike a blow at the Commonwealth Bank as the central bank, because the General Banking Division at present carries out some of the functions of a central bank, as the report of the royal commission clearly states. Secondly, it will strike a blow at the general business of the hank. The General Banking Division will be separated from the central bank, though not entirely divorced from it because a link will be retained through the Governor and the Commonwealth Bank Board. The General Banking Division will become the Commonwealth Trading Bank and will cease to be part and parcel of the central bank. The Beazley) bas quoted striking statements that were made by Sir Ernest Riddle commission. Mr Chifley asked the following question:Do1 understand that, if you did have funds available you would not make an advance to a customer of another bank nor allow him to transfer his business to you ? Sir Ernest Riddle repliedThere is no definite undertaking that we will not do it , but as a general rule we will not. Later in his evidence, Sir Ernest Riddle confirmed that statement in answer to questions asked by the chairman of the commission, Mr Justice Napier, Mr Abbott, and other members. Therefore, it is true that, while the Commonwealth Bank was managed by a board, its General Banking Division was not permitted to compete with the private banks although the board had no authority from the Parliament to restrict the bank's activities in that way. The statute of 1945 made active competition a duty of tlie 'Commonwealth Bank, hut this measure will render the execution of that duty practically impossible. The clause that the committee is considering, and allied clauses, provide that the Commonwealth Trading Bank shall be established as an entirely new entity. It will take over certain assets and liabilities, but, for practical purposes, it his proposal, but they have clearly will bave to start afresh and make its way against the competition of the private banks. However, it will be hamstrung from the outset. The Government's proposals for the crippling of the people's bank in this way are completely opposed to all the findings of the royal commission on the subject of fair competition. This Government does not want to have fair competition between the Commonwealth Bank in its trading activities and the private banks. It wants to hinder the Commonwealth Bank, just as the Commonwealth Bank Board did formerly. There is no doubt that, when this Government talks of promoting fair competition between a great public utility and private interests, it means that it will then in the possession of the committee? do everything possible to prevent the successful management of the people's asset. That is evident, not only in relation to the Commonwealth Bank, but also in relation to other public utilities. We have seen what tbe Government bas done to Trans-Australia Airlines. That is a successful government utility. I do not criticize the rival private airline, but the amendments which honourable members clear fact is that the private airline was not able to withstand competition from Trans-Australia Airlines. Therefore, the Government intervened in order to make tbe conditions of competition more favorable to the private enterprise than to the Government airline. It has departed from the idea of true competition and has established a statutory combine or cartel under which everything associated with the activities of tbe two major airlines is controlled. Routes and fares are now controlled and there is no competition. In this bill, the attack upon the people's assets is more indirect and perhaps more sinister than it was in the case of the airlines. The proposal that has been discussed [11.50] -Wheneve r I hear the Leader by the honourable member for Macarthur of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) quote indicates the true intention of many Gofrom the report of the Royal Commission Dr. Evatt. vernment supporters. The honourable gentleman has been publicly supported outside this chamber by the honourable member for St. George( Mr Graham), the honourable member for Evans( Mr Osborne), the honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Wheeler) and other members of the Government parties. They have failed to come forward to support revealed their intention to weaken the Commonwealth Bank again. I repeat that this measure will weaken the bank in two ways. It will weaken the central bank and it will weaken the General Banking Division, or the Oommonwealth Trading Bank as it is to be known in future. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Bowden) -Order! The right honourable gentleman's time has expired. Deputy Chairman. If an honourable member involves the Commonwealth in the expense of printing proposed amendments are the proposed amendments Must they be moved by tbe honourable member concerned, and can they be withdrawn only with the permission of the committee? If that be not the position, do you consider that this is a matter that might be considered by the House, in order to prevent public money from being wasted upon the printing of indicate that they propose to move, but which they do not proceed with? Could some method be evolved by which an honourable member who involved the Commonwealth in the expense of printing proposed amendments could be compelled to meet that expense himself if he failed to proceed with them? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. I do not think there is much substance in the point raised by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward).

119,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar),"on Monetary and Banking Systems, I am reminded of the saying that the Devil cites the scriptures for his own purposes. Paragraph 669 of that report seems to me to be the vital paragraph upon which the remainder of the report depends. It contains the following passage:The view of the Commission, as set out in Chapter V., is that the most desirable banking far towards preventing the nationalizasystem in the present circumstances of Australia is one which includes iprivately-owned trading banks. The system which we contemplate is one in which a strong central bank I agree that the honourable member for regulates the volume of credit, and pays some attention to its distribution. All of the recommendations of the commission were based upon the assumption that the private trading banks would continue in existence, and that there would be no centralized monopoly of credit. But that is no.t the objective of the Labour party. The objective of the Labour party is to have only one bank. It is easy for the Leader of the Opposition to say, as he has said in this chamber, that nationalization is a dead issue. It is not a dead issue. It is simply "" playing possum "". The High Court has ruled that this Parliament has no power to nationalize banking by direct legislative action. That is a fact, just as it is a fact that the Labour party tried to do so. When that legislation was before the High Court, Senator ArmstrongI shall be corrected if that is not the right name, but it was a senior Minister of the Cbifley Government-speakin g at Goulburn said, "" We are ingenious men. There are other ways of doing .this besides a simple act if the court should rule the act invalid"". We know that the members of the Opposition are still set on the nationalization of banking. If they cannot achieve it by direct legislative means, they will endeavour to achieve it by indirect administrative means. They have boasted that they will do so. That is in keeping with their character, and it is what they are doing at this moment. The requirement that all banks shall be nationalized has not been removed in any respect from the constitution of their party, to which they are subservient and the mandates of which they are here to carry out. Do not let them hope that they can conceal their real intentions by fair words, by taking a sentence here and a sentence there from the report of the royal commission, and by glossing over the fact that their objective is to destroy the wbole of the foundations upon which that report was built. It is with some regret, a regret that is shared by other honourable members on -this side of the chamber, that I say I do not think that this bill will go very tion of banking by administrative action. I , for one, wish it went further. Although Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) could scarcely have moved his proposed amendment with effect, I join with other honourable members on this side of the chamber in saying that I hope that at some time in the future further action will be taken to erect a bulwark against the administrative designs of the Labour party in relation to the complete nationalization and centralization of banking. I do not say it is possible to give any effective guarantee that the nationalization of banking will not be achieved by administrative action, because nothing in an act of the Parliament can be protected against a future Parliament. The only safeguard against socialism is to keep the Labour party out of office. I think that we should be doing wrong if we were to give the public any impression that this measure will, in any effective manner, protect our banking system from administrative nationalization, which is the basic policy of the Labour party. Tbe Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) has said that the measure goes a. little way in that direction. It does, but only a very little way. It would be unfair to say that it went no part of the way, but if it aroused in the public mind an illusion that any effective safeguard had been created, it might, to that degree, do harm rather than good. The small protection would not confer a benefit commensurate with the loss occasioned by an illusionof safety. This measure, good though it is in certain respects-and it will have my support because of those good features-migh t have provided a greater safeguard against bank nationalization than it actually does. I do not know whether I should go further than that. I have described the measure to myself some times, not as the Commonwealth Bank Bill, but as the Coombs Consolidation Bill. Perhaps that is an unfair criticism in some respects, because the measure will improve the existing situation, but no substantial improvement of the situation is possible by legislativemeans while there is a possibility of the re-election to power in this Parliament of a party that is devoted to the nationalization of the banking system as the first and vital step in its road to complete socialization. I do not want to give any one the impression that I clo not think some features of the bill are good, but I want to go on record as having said that I do not think it will confer upon the banking system of Australia mucb protection against those people who are out to socialize that system by administrative means, having failed to do so by a direct legislative method of attack. The honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) foreshadowed an amendment, the effect of which would be completely to separate the proposed Commonwealth Trading Bank from the Commonwealth Bank. The honourable member, having embarked upon a course, is not lightly diverted from it. In the past, having moved or supported a motion, the bonorable gentleman has even voted against the Government which he supports. So from his unexpected action in withdrawing his motion this morning we must deduce that some moves have taken place behind the scenes. After having prepared his proposed amendment in roneod form he had it printed by the Government Printer for presentation to the committee only this morning, he stated that he wanted to withdraw his amendment. Then he said that this would not be the last of the proposal and that he would push on with it until it was accepted. Without being suspicious, there is only one reason we can deduce for the action of the honourable member. I believe that he has been told by the Government that it would be politically unwise to move his amendment at present. This is not a popular measure. It is a measure at wbich the people of Australia look with apprehension, and it might have a bad effect, from the Government's point of view, on the elections which are to be held in South Australia and Queensland on Saturday. It might also have a similarly bad effect on the Senate election which is to be conducted shortly. So the honourable member has been told not to force his amendment to a division and that when the electoral storms blow over and there is peace and quiet again consideration will be given to his proposal. I believe that the honourable member has been prevailed upon by promises of further consideration of this matter. No doubt he has the assurance that if the Government is so fortunate, and Australia so unfortunate, that the Government will be returned io office at the next general election his proposal will be given effect. With elections pending in two States and a Senate election in May the Government does not dare to proceed with the proposal of the honourable member for Macarthur. It is certain that private persons dominate the thinking of this Government. This action will serve as a stark warning to the people of Australia that the Government does not believe the statements that it has made about the Commonwealth Bank but supports the move of the honourable member for Macarthur. There will be a real prospect of the honourable member's proposal being given effect in the tragic circumstance of the Government's being given a new lease of power. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) said that the bill did not go far enough. In effect, he supported the honourable member for Macarthur as other honourable members opposite supported him. But the honourable member for Mackellar did not want to frighten the electors. He did not want to tell them his real purpose and that of the Government. He said, in effect, ""We might frighten the people of Australia into returning a Labour government. So let us hide our fell purpose, disguise our motives, deceive the people and avoid telling them our real objective because they might elect a Labour government again."" There is no",25,Governmen T Members No
120,Mr Tom Btjrke (Perth) [12.0],"doubt that the people will elect a Labour government at the first opportunity. I invite the Government to test the confidence of the people by holding a general election at the time of the Senate elections in May. Opposition members have sought to find out why the Government has introduced this bill at such a time as this. The bill will do no good. It will do some harm and it foreshadows tbe real intentions of the Government. One of those intentions is to weaken the Commonwealth Bank's power to compete with trading banks, and the bill will have that immediate effect although it will not do so over a period of ten or twelve years. The Government's other intention is to try to deceive the electors. It wants the cry of "" socialization "" again to nationalize them if they accord witb stampede the people. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Bowden) -Order! This is not a second-reading debate. The committee is dealing with clause 2 of the bill. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member has done sufficient electioneering. member for Mackellar spoke on these matters. When the 1945 banking legislation was before the HouseI pointed out, as a spokesman for the Government, that the legislation originated in the crisis of the 'thirties. Had that crisis not occurred and had the Australian Government not been defied by banks, private and government, the legislation would never have been placed on the statute-book. Whilst the trading banks accept the direction of the central bank and accord with Government policy there is no fear of their being nationalized. It is when they refuse to accept that direction that the private banks run the danger of the control that governments have had to impose on them and of even greater controls. The matter was dealt with by G. D. H . Cole, the English economist, who said that the trading banks in England would remain private trading banks as long as they liked to act as if they were nationalized and accept the direction of those competent to decide-the Treasurer and the central bank which, in the United. Kingdom, is the Bank of England. The Australian Labour party has developed its policy over the years. Its purpose has been to ensure that Australia's natural resources are used and that the Australian economy is developed in such a way as to create the least dislocation and bring about the maximum good. The Labour party has never sought to do anything that would not increase the good of the people, but final assurances are needed. The private banks cannot be traded out of business by the use of section 48 of the Constitution as the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) alleged. They can be nationalized only by an amendment of the Constitution and tliere will he no intention to Government policy. decide that? was never very alert in his handling of bills in this House and he is getting worse. He asks, "" Who will decide whether the banks accord with Government policy ? "" Obviously, the government of the day will decide that. Unfortunately, the present Government has had the power to make such decisions in recent times and it has ruined the Australian economy and aggravated the problems of both private enterprise and Government enterprise. It is from the actions of governments such as this that private enterprise is in danger. Encouragement to export has been given and then cut off. Finance has been expanded and then contracted. The fits and starts of this Government's policy have been the greatest blow ever delivered to private enterprise. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order!

T.he triennial conference did not alter that objective by one iota, so it still stands as the Labour party's policy. Mr ""WABD -Hear, hear! bonorable member for East Sydney( Mr honourable member for Perth had been Ward) because he is one of those honourable members opposite who still proclaim the real objective of the Labour party, whilst the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) try to disguise it in words. I admire the honourable member for East Sydney for being at least consistent. The honourable member for Perth has said that the banks arc safe now because of the Australian Government's lack of constitutional power to nationalize them. He did not say, however, that the triennial conference of the Labour party, to which I have referred, carried a resolution to the effect that if Labour gets back into office it will hold a referendum to amend the ConstitutionTo provide such powers as are necessary toi' vernment advances made by the bank's effective government in the interests of tlie people. That would mean, in effect, that all the instruments of propaganda-that are available would be used by the Labour party, if it regained office, to persuade tbe people to amend the Constitution so as to permii the nationalization of banking. Constitutions can be altered by persuasion. If the Labour party succeeded in having tbe Constitution amended it would have a charter as wide as the seas to do anything that it liked with the banks or with any industry. In order to camouflage tbe Labour party's objective, the honorabie member for Fremantle, the schoolmaster of the Labour party The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Bowden) -Order! I remind the Postmaster-General that I prevented the honourable member for Perth from indulging in a second-reading speech at this stage. The statements that the Postmaster-General is making have no relation to the clause now being considered by the committee. Certain statements are mado in an amendment, to which an answer is allowed to be given, but beyond that I intend to ask the committee to adhere to the subject-matter of the clause, or we shall never get through. I shall therefore rule against any continuation of propaganda or electioneering speeches. Temporary Chairman, I accept your ruling, but I considered that it was necessary to reply to the statements that the allowed to make. This clause provides for the separation of the functions of the Commonwealth Bank into two divisions, to be carried on by the central bank and the Commonwealth Trading Bank. So far as we on this side of the chamber are concerned this is not a matter of protecting the trading banks or of injuring the Commonwealth Bank. It is a matter of providing freedom for fair competition in the industries and enterprises of the nation. It is meant not only to preserve the trading banks, but also to preserve the trading bank activities of the Commonwealth Bank. In the last two or three years the subsidiary divisions of the Commonwealth Bank have shown an improvement of business. Under this GoRural Credits Department have increased from £14,700,00Q in 1950 to £39,300,000 in 1952. That increase is a clear indication that no restriction has been placed on the Commonwealth Bank to prevent it from doing this most important class of business. It is an adequate answer to people who say that the Government has endeavoured to hamstring the bank. I am an admirer of tbe Commonwealth' Bank. I believe that it has performed a most useful service for Australia, but I believe equally that the trading banks have performed an extraordinarily useful service for the nation, and that the people ' of this country ought to have a choice in relation to who is to be their financier when they require financial accommodation. It could be a most serious thing if there were only one authority that a. person might approach for loan accommodation and if rejection by that authority of the application meant that the last door had been closed.

It is essentia] that every person sbould bave an option of going to anotber bank if tbe first bank that he has approached for financial accommodation refuses to make it available. The clause provides for tlie Commonwealth Bank to be divided into two sections, one of which will be the central bank and the other the Commonwealtli Trading Bank, both of which will be controlled by the Commonwealth Bank Board. It ought to be clear to everybody that it is not the function of a central bank to engage in day-to-day trading activities with retail stores, manufacturing industries, farmers, and so on. The job of the central bank is to be there as a bulwark of the credit of the country, so that if any bank should get into difficulties through its assets not being liquid enough at any particular time, it would have available to it the resources of the central bank to help it to meet its obligations or overcome its temporary problems. This bill will give effect to this on the same footing as the private trading function of the Commonwealth Bank. On the one hand will be the central bank and, on the other, completely separate from it, will be the Commonwealth Trading Bank, which will, operate on equal terms with private trading banks. 1 do not say that it will operate on less advantageous terms. The terms will be competitive terms. If the Commonwealth Trading Bank wants business it will havo to go out after it as the trading banks have to do. That, indeed, is the essence of enterprise in this country. When a housewife does not like the meat supplied by one butcher she can go to another butcher, but if there is no other butcher near, because the law prohibits one from operating in the vicinity, then she has to take what the only available butcher cares to sell her. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN Order! The Minister's time has expired. [12.20] -In addressing myself to clause 2 of the bill, I note how we are now departing from the essential unity that formerly characterized the Commonwealth Bank in all its activities. The degree of that departure can be gauged by reference to section 9 of the Commonwealth Bank Aet, as it appears in the 1945 legislation. That legislation was amended recently by the act which reconstituted the Commonwealth Bank Board, thereby intruding a second body, which was given power to determine policv. into the affairs of the bank. The appointment of the Commonwealth Bank Board segregated the functions of the bank, in the ordinary sense, from those of the Commonwealth Savings Bank. The legislation now before the Parliament attempts to go further. The clause with which we are dealing contains the kernel of the change, because it is the one that proposes to set up the new section, the trading bank section of the Commonwealth Bank, and to segregate it from the Commonwealth Bank as a central entity. To date, nothing has been suggested by the Government to indicate how the functioning of the bank as a trading bank has proved unfair in its competition with the private trading banks. If as the Government claims, it wishes to put the bank banks, in my opinion the Government should seriously consider the wording of proposed new sub-section (3.) of section 9. I shall read those words in order to indicate that the Commonwealth Bank, in its trading functions, is to be asked to do things that the private trading banks are not asked to do. In that sense, at least, there will be discrimination. The relevant words of the sub-section are as follows:The Board shall, in determining the policy of the Trading Bank, determine that policy in such a manner as not to conflict with the policy of the Commonwealth Bank in relation to the Commonwealth Bank acting as. a central bank. So far, no evidence has been adduced to indicate that, in the past, conflict arose between the trading section of the Commonwealth Bank and the central banking functions of the bank, but if it is envisaged, that conflict may arise, and if this (Melbourne Ports) proposed change is to be made in the name of fair competition, why does not the Government go farther and give to the Commonwealth Bank Board overriding powers as far as the private trading banks are concerned if , in the opinion of the board, such banks act in a manner which conflicts with the policy of the",29,Governmen T Members No
129,Mr Anthony,"No, it is not. I am",30,Governmen T Members No
130,Mr Crean,"Commonwealtli Bank acting as a central bank? To use tbe simile adopted by tbe Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony), if the Commonwealth Bank determines that certain advances shall not be made by its trading bank division on the ground that such advances will conflict with the policy of the central bank, is it right, from the point of view of the community, for persons who are refused advances in those circumstances to be able to go farther along the street to the National Bank of Australia Limited, the English, Scottish and Australian Bank Limited or the Bank of New Sonth Wales, and have implemented a policy which the Commonwealth Bank considers to be in conflict with its policy as a central bank? I suggest that we should be logical about this matter. If there can be danger of conflict in relation to the trading bank functions of the Commonwealth Bank, surely there can also be danger of conflict in respect of the trading functions of the private banks. Yet this legislation makes no attempt to regulate that kind of thing. The. Government claims that the Commonwealth Bank, as a trading bank, is to be placed on the same footing as every -other bank. That is not true. It is hypocrisy to assert that it is so. An honourable member opposite, who is a little more courageous than his colleagues, has gone so far as to circulate amendments to the effect that in his opinion this legislation does not go far enough. Honourable members on this side of the chamber feel that the legislation goes too far. The Government says that the bill will really do nothing but place the private banks and the Commonwealth Bank on an equal footing as far as competition is concerned. The members of the Opposition are suspicious of that claim and suggest that a careful reading of the words of this clause should be made. If that is done, it will be seen that the clause as they are concerned. Consistency at proposes to regulate the actions of the Commonwealth Bank in its trading division. No evidence has been adduced to indicate that, in the past, the Commonwealth Bank has suffered because it has not previously had this split personality. The Government proposes that henceforth the two sections of the bank shall think in separate terms instead of as an entity. After all, in the past the Commonitr. Crean. wealth Bank Board did not have to say, when implementing the general policy of the bank, "" I s this a central bank function, a trading bank function or a Rural Credits Department function "" ? The more the Government attempts to make this kind of dichotomy and to intrude the powers of tbe board between the various functions of the bank, the more difficult will it become to secure the essential co-ordination that is necessary in a country such as Australia. If the great words of the Commonwealth Bank Act to be implemented, banking must function in the interests of the people as a whole, not only in the interests of a few individuals. I challenge the Government to show that it is being consistent, at least in connection with this proposed new subsection (3.) It is evident that the Government proposes to be most inconsistent in that it will apply a sanction to the Commonwealth Bank, as a trading bank, which does not apply to the private trading banks. It is, therefore, hypocrisy to suggest that the separation is to be made in the interests of fair competition. I suggest that the Government should seriously consider redrafting or deleting this sub-section, because it has never been demonstrated that there has been conflict between the two sections of the bank. If it is feared that conflict may occur in the future, surely such conflict will not be restricted merely to the trading section of the bank but could also apply to the private trading banks. Perhaps another section should be added to the bill with the object of regulating the functions of the private trading banks, so that if,, in the opinion of the Commonwealth Bank Board, the policy being pursued by those banks conflicts with the policy of the Commonwealth Bank as a central bank, the statute will also be obligatory as far least would be achieved if the same set of conditions applied to the two sets of bankers.

131,Mr Wilson (Sturt) [12.30],"I supthe Labour party's policy of the nationalization of banking. The bill, and this clause, will make it more difficult for a future government to nationalize banking hy indirect means. I have always believed that the people should be free to choose where they will transact their banking business. There should be fair and free competition between the trading activities of the Commonwealth Bank arid the private trading banks. I believe in private enterprise, and I believe central bank should be to gain the comthat this country will progress just as long as private enterprise is allowed to remain active. I remind honourable members that 75 per cent, of the people who are employed in Australia are employed by private enterprise. The whole of the taxation paid in this country is paid by private enterprise, and it is out of that revenue that our great social services are maintained. Therefore, it is obvious that we should do everything possible to prevent people who have designs on xhe system of private enterprise from carrying out their socialistic and nationalistic schemes. The TEMPOBABY CHAIEMAN Order! I have already given a ruling that in this debate honourable members must adhere strictly to the clause before the committee. The clause now before the committee deals with the powers of the Commonwealth Bank Board in relation to the Commonwealth Trading Bank. for the separation of the trading functions of the Commonwealth Bank from the functions of the central bank. The Government, by separating the trading activities from the other functions of the Commonwealth Bank and placing them under a separate authority, will make it more difficult for a future government to introduce a policy of nationalization by indirect means. Therefore, the object of this clause is to ensure free competition, and to protect private enterprise from nationalization and socialization. I personally wanted to see even greater safeguards provided than are incorporated in this measure, but I do perceive that this bill will go a long way towards protecting private enterprise from those who are determined to socialize tbe industry and commerce of this country. During the last 30 years there has been a great development in the credit structure of almost every country of the world. Central banking is of fairly modern vintage, and it has developed, as have most of our-great reforms, stage by stage. I believe that the central or reserve bank should be a banker's bank, designed for the sole purpose of regulating the flow of currency and directing that currency into proper channels. The first objective of a plete confidence and trust of the people and its customers. The customers of the central bank are the trading banks, and will include the proposed Commonwealth Trading Bank, the State trading banks and the private trading banks. I do not believe that there wall be complete confidence between the central bank and the trading banks unless the Commonwealth Trading Bank is separately incorporated -and that is provided for in this measure -and unless the Commonwealth Trading Bank is controlled by a separate authority. However, I consider that we shall have to provide that the Commonwealth Trading Bank will have its own board of directors which will be entirely separate and distinct from the board of directors of the central bank. From the time that situation is brought about we shall get complete confidence and trust, and the whole system of federal and private banking will work as an integrated whole. This bill will provide many safeguards against future nationalization. It will prevent the Commonwealth Trading Bank from wiping out its competitors by entirely unfair means. I believe that the ideal banking system for Australia is one in which the Commonwealth and the State trading banks and the private trading banks will all carry on business under fair and just competition, all controlled by separate boards of directors and all separately incorporated. Under such a system the people would have a choice of going to the Commonwealth Trading Bank, a State trading bank or a private bank. We would preserve the system of private enterprise and free competition and preserve also a very important right to the individualtbe right to choose his own bank. That is the privilege that the Labour party tried to take away from the people, and",31,Governmen T Members No

The objects and policies of the Commonwealth Trading Bank must be in line with those of the Commonwealth Bank itself. It is because of this implied giving effect to Government policy. How conflict that confusion exists in the minds of Government supporters about this bill. Almost every one of them has repeatedly expressed a desire that additional provisions be inserted in the measure. The honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) circulated a proposed amendment the design of which was to separate the trading activities of the bank from its other activities and to give the Commonwealth Trading Bank a different charter and different objectives from those of the Commonwealth Bank. Upon reflection tbe honourable inember somewhat hastily decided not to submit the amendment. Hnlme), in his second-reading speech, also referred to the need for the complete separation of the trading activities from the other activities of the bank. He said that he could not see how both could exist side by side. The honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) contended that the Commonwealth Trading Bank should have its own board of directors. Obviously Government supporters realize that the legislation is bad and that it will not succeed. poorest piece of legislation that has ever been brought before the Parliament. The conception of a trading bank division of the Commonwealth Bank that is pretty clearly in the minds of Government supporters is a division devoted to profit making rather than the great objectives of a people's bank. They cannot conceive of any other objective. Our conception of the Commonwealth Bank is an institution that controls the volume and distribution of credit. It can best do that by ascertaining the volume of credit which the people require. If they require advances in certain parts of the country for certain purposes and at certain rates of interest, it is the duty of the bank to see that they get it as far as it is within the power of the Commonwealth Bank Board to provide it. The bank must be a positive instrument for carrying out negative instruments for the maintenance of our economy on a sound level, such as advances and capital issues controls; but we must also have positive instruments for can we prevent the establishment of a milk bar economy unless we have positive instruments to enable us to do so? The trading activities of the Commonwealth Bank provide the necessary positive instrument for that purpose. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member's time has expired.

I was very interested to hear the remarks made by the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) in support of the circulated amendment which he failed to move. The only sin of which the honourable member was considered guilty by the Government was that of rashness in foreshadowing an amendment at a time when the discussion of the measure had been restricted by the guillotine. This is not the first occasion on which the Government will be able to get its own way after two bites of the cherry. It is the intention of the Government to rush this bill through and, if it gets away with it, to give effect to its true concrete instance in which such unfair purposes by the introduction of a later measure. We had an example of that practice in connection with the abolition of the land tax. The Government did not abolish the land tax in one fell swoop. First, it proposed to increase the statutory exemption from the tax from £5,000 to £S,750. During the discussion that ensued, supporter after supporter of tbe Government urged that the tax be completely abolished, but no move was made by the Government to do so until later when legislation was introduced into the Parliament to that end. The Government is following a similar practice in relation to the legislation now before us. It is merely angling for the support of the people at the forthcoming Senate election and if, by some miracle, it obtains that support, it will undoubtedly introduce amendments to the legislation which will incorporate the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Macarthur wbicb by then will have become the accepted policy of the Government. The bill as it is drafted is merely an indication of tbings to come. The Government is now only taking its first bite of the cherry. If its candidates should miraculously obtain a majority of the votes at the forthcoming Senate election it will take a second bite by introducing an amending bill which will embody the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Macarthur. Many courageous Government supporters have openly stated that, in essence, they support the contentions advanced by the honourable member for Macarthur, but they have been persuaded to hold their hand by the wise old heads sitting behind the Government who realize that at this juncture sucb a move would be politically unwise. Consequently tbey are prepared to agree to clause 2 as it is printed. The provisions of clause 2'will serve no useful purpose as far as the Commonwealth Bank is concerned. Government supporters have stated that these provisions will prevent the Commonwealth Bank from competing unfairly with the private banks. Since tbe measure was introduced, I have waited anxiously to hear those honourable members cite one competition has occurred. Having regard to their spontaneous desire to abolish the present set-up, I should have thought that they would be able to support tbeir arguments by digging up at least one instance in which the Commonwealth Bank, because it is also the central bank, bas acted to the detriment of the private trading banks. So far, they have failed to do so. In view of that fact, one cannot believe that the bill has been introduced for the purpose for which Government supporters have indicated. On the contrary, this measure represents, in fact, the first nail in the coffin of the trading bank facilities of the Commonwealth Bank; and I have not the slightest doubt that if the Government parties obtain a majority at the forthcoming election for the Senate they will waste no time in driving more nails into the coffin. The honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) claimed that these provisions would make it more difficult for a future Labour government to nationalize",34,Governmen T Members No
139,Mr Bird (Batman) [2.20],"I opposethe banking industry. At present, if the people desire that the industry should be nationalized they can approve, at a referendum, a proposal to alter the Constitution to enable the government of the day to take such action. The Australian Labour party, as a democratic party, will always abide by the decisions of the people. But this measure cannot in any way be regarded as being a means of preventing the nationalization of the banking industry by a future government. It has been introduced deliberately for the purpose of commencing the destruction of the Commonwealth Bank as a trading bank. Tbe Government hopes by a gradual process to destroy the strength and prestige of the bank as a trading bank until, ultimately, it can be said that the bank is not serving any useful purpose and, consequently, should be abolished. That is the long-range plan of the Government in introducing this measure. The Australian Labour party contends that the Commonwealth Bank was established primarily in order to ensure that effect shall be given to economic policy in the interests of the community as a whole, and, as it is at present constituted, the bank possesses the requisite power to enable it to fulfil that task. The separation of the trading bank functions from the central bank will render the central bank impotent. The latter will be unable to implement central bank policy effectively if it is deprived of its trading bank activities which now provide it with a means of implementing such policy directly. We know that in the past the private banks have, in concert, adopted common practices and policies with respect to the making of advances and the release of credit through overdrafts. It could quite easily happen that at some time in the future, the common policy of the private banks could be diametrically opposed to that of the central bank. In such circumstances, the latter would be unable to give effect to its own policy if it were prohibited from engaging in trading bank activities. There can b?. no doubt that the Commonwealth Bank has proved to be fully effective under the present set-up. This measure can do nothing but impair its effectiveness in that respect. In any event, I regard with suspicion any comment that members of the Liberal party make with respect to the Commonwealth Bank. Down through the years, they have' damned it with faint praise. They have accepted the fact of its existence because they realize that the people of Australia support it wholeheartedly. Government supporters in, their heart of hearts detest the institution, and are prepared to resort to any method to destroy it short of perpetrating an act of cold-blooded assassination. The committee should reject the clauses now before the Chair and thus enable the bank to continue to operate in the public interest. It is a monument to public enterprise and is doing a first-class job for the community. The TEMPOBABY CHAIRMAN Orcier! The honourable member's time has expired. shall address myself to proposed new section 21 which is covered by clause 6. It deals with the profits of the proposed Commonwealth Trading Bank. I regret that I shall disappoint the honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird), who complained that no Government supporter had produced one instance of unfair competition on the part of the Commonwealth Bank with the private trading banks. Clause6 makes provision for the distribution of the net profits of the trading bank. Normally, the net profits of any commercial venture are generally referred to ""net profits after taxation"", and such profits are arrived at after all claims on its income have been met. Apart from costs of materials and wages, the usual manufacturing and trading costs and administrative charges, the heaviest charge against the income of an ordinary business concern is taxation. It is significant that this clause in dealing with the net profits of the trading bank does not refer to such profits as ""net profits after taxation"". Therefore, the Commonwealth Trading Bank is still to be left Completely free of tax, particularly company tax. I shall at once anticipate the argument which honourable members opposite, no doubt, will be quick to advance to the effect that a tax upon the trading",35,Governmen T Members No
140,Mr Wheeler (Mitchell) [2.31],"Ibank would be a tax upon tbe Government itself because any profit earned by tbe bank would be paid to the Government as provided for under the clause. Whilst that may be so, private trading banks, nevertheless, are obliged to pay heavy company taxation. Therefore, if the Commonwealth Trading Bank is to be exempt from company tax, it is idle for any honourable member to say that in such circumstances there can be fair competition between it and the private trading banks. Any concern that enjoys tax-free privileges must have a tremendous advantage over competitors which are obliged to pay tax. Neither this Government nor any previous administration objected to the levying of tax in respect of the Government's majority shareholding in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, or its shareholding in Commonwealth Engineering Company Limited. It is also interesting to note that Trans-Australia Airlines, which is completely owned by the Government, is obliged to pay taxation as is its main competitor, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. I accept the fact that under recent legislation Trans-Australia obliged to pay tax as a means of placing that organization on equal trading terms with private airline companies. I believe that the same principle should have been applied under this measure to the trading bank activities of the Commonwealth Bank, and insofar as the bill fails xo do that, it gives an unfair advantage to the Commonwealth Bank over its competitors. I should have thought that if the Government followed the right course in obliging Trans-Australia Airlines to pay tax, it should, in order to be consistent, make provision under this measure to tax the trading bank activities of the Commonwealth Bank and so place the bank cn the same basis as the private trading banks. Last night, the honourable membei for Grayndler ( Mr Daly), in his usual tedious and inconsistent manner, pointed to the profits of the private trading banks. Government to hamper private competiI trust that his socialistic outlook will permit him to be sufficiently logical to recognize that before those profits were arrived at the income of the private trading banks was subject to taxation, that is, even before the shareholders received Mr Wheeler. any return on their investments in those institutions. Eor example, last year, ihe Bank of New South Wales, to which the honourable member fondly referred, paid in tax the sum of £1,750,000 which was two and a half times greater than the amount that was distributed to shareholders of that bank. Tbe National Bank of Australasia paid £900,000 in taxes, or approximately double the amount of £470,000 distributed as dividends to the shareholders. If we proceed along this course, we find that tbe dividends received by shareholders are also taxable, and that the private banks and their shareholders, so far from being the villains in the piece working against the democracy, as socialist members opposite contend, contribute in no small degree to the welfare of the community. If honourable gentlemen opposite, in conformity with their true socialist feelings, believe in the welfare state, I ask them how they anticipate that they will be able to introduce their socialist order when there is no taxpayer. Surely they do not believe that Australia is another Utopia, where everybody gets something for nothing, and nobody makes any contribuAirlines was tion by way of taxes or other means towards the benefits. This Government might well ponder how it expects. private enterprise to flourish in competition -with governmentsponsored enterprises which, from the outset, have such a favorable advantage because they are not obliged to pay taxes. It remains to be seen whether it is possible to devise any conditions under which privately owned concerns can compete with government-owned institutions. Competition can be fair only when the government of the day is determined to see fair play; but fair play can never happen under a socialist administration. The socialist enterprises usually find the path of free competition too tough for them, so they are forced to use their own powers, associations and contacts with the tors, and, in time, put them out of business. In that direction, the Commonwealth Bank has certainly had a most favorable start on its private competitors. Then again, the Commonwealth Bank is not obliged to pay income tax or rates. It is true that it is the custom of the bank to make a voluntary contribution to local government authorities, but I point out that there is a marked difference between a contribution on a voluntary basis, which may be suspended at tbe will of the contributor, and a definite obligation to pay rates. Such an obligation should be placed upon the Gommonwealth Bank. It is idle to talk of free competition wben those circumstances exist. I consider that the same policy should be applied in this matter to the Commonwealth Bank as was applied to Trans-Australia Airlines under the Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952. Australia Airlines is obliged to pay not only income tax but also sales tax on its trading, in common with its private competitors. JIfr. Bryson mterjecting, Mr ""WHEELER -We are not at a football match now. I am endeavouring to state my case as clearly and fairly as I can. The Commonwealth Bank, in the computation of its net profit, does not pay taxes. I have cited the example of the Bank of New South Wales, which paid taxation amounting to £1,750,000 last year, and the National Bank of Australasia, which paid in tax double the amount that it distributed to its shareholders as dividends. In my view, this state of affairs does not approach the essence of free competition. A system of healthy competition would ensure that every bank would have its chance, on its merits, to get whatever share of business was available from the public. I believe that only the true spirit of competition can give the public their requirements, which are service and efficiency. My conception of free competition does not embrace a system whereby one concern arrives at a net profit by the easy route of not paying taxes, whilst its competitor is obliged to reach the same goal by the hard way of paying taxes. speech of the honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Wheeler) amazed me. I thought that he would endeavour to place a correct construction on Part TV. of the principal act, and would state the real intention of the legislation. However, he has chosen to tell his own story that places the whole position in an improper light. Under this amending legislation, the amount of taxation which is being paid by the Commonwealth Bank to the Government exceeds the taxes that are being paid by the trading banks. In actual fact, a greater burden is placed upon the Commonwealth Bank by this legislation than is placed upon the private trading banks with which it is engaged in competition. The Commonwealth Bank and the private banks meet their tax obligations from their profits. The tax liabilities of the private banks are between 7s. and 9s. in the £1 on the Transprofits made from their trading activities. Under this amending legislation, the Commonwealth Bank will be shackled and hamstrung in that it will be compelled to pay from its profits an impost at the rate of 10s. in the £1. We have heard a great deal in the course of this debate about fair trading and the necessity to ensure the maintenance of fair competition. We have to bear in mind that this legislation will impose considerable hardship upon an institution that is to become a small bank compared with the long established and soundly entrenched private trading banks. The latest report of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia issued on the 30th June, 1952 indicates that the capital of the bank is. £4,000,000 and its reserve fund £2,405,000. In other words, its funds for trading purposes amount to £6,400,000. Yet that bank has to compete with a number of trading banks, the combined shareholders' funds of which for the purpose of trading and competing with the Commonwealth Bank are £70,000,000. However, honourable members opposite speak of the necessity for legislation to enable a group of financial institutions with capital amounting to £70,000,000 for trading purposes to compete fairly with the Commonwealth Trading Bank with a capital of £6,400,000. In addition, a regular impost on profits of 10s. in the .£1 is to be paid to the national debt sinking fund. In those circumstances, the statement of the honourable member for Mitchell that the private trading banks will suffer unfair competition from the Commonwealth Trading Bank is a clear indication that he either does not understand",36,Governmen T Members No

144,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [2.50],"community generally, but with whether the private bankers are being treated fairly. At least that confirms an opinion that has been held and expressed by Labour members for many years. We have always believed that the anti-Labour parties represent private financial institutions in this Parliament and merely mouth phrases designed to capture votes when they speak of the welfare of the community. Throughout this debate, not one honourable member opposite has been able to show that the public will benefit as the result of the change proposed by the Government. In fact, the honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) made a remarkable statement. He said that the Government's purpose, and of course his purpose^ was to make things more difficult for a future socialist government. In effect, he intends, by the use of powers that the Government possesses, to make it more difficult in future for the will of the boards, is not important. The real issue people to be given effect to in this Parliais whether there should be a board at all ment. I thought that the Government parties believed in democracy. If this is a democracy and the people decide at the ballot-box that they want to be governed by a progressive Labour party, to which some honourable members opposite refer as the "" socialist party "", no member of the Government side has any right to put obstacles in the way of the will of the people being given effect to. Therefore, the argument advanced by the honourable member for Sturt was very peculiar indeed. Mention has been made of the need to permit people to choose their own banker, but of what real value is that choice when all the private banks are working to a common policy? My criticism of the Commonwealth Bank is that in the past, it has not taken advantage of its position to give more favorable treatment to various sections of the community. I am more interested in the benefit that the people generally could get from a progressive banking policy than with how this measure will effect the dividends of the private banks. There is no necessity for the Commonwealth Bank to earn profits because all profits merely go back to Commonwealth revenue or build up the bank's reserves. There are no private shareholders in the Commonwealth Bank, and therefore that institution does not have to worry about paying dividends as the private banks do. 1 am sure that most Australians would be interested to hear Government supporters say whether they believe that the facilities of the Commonwealth Bank should be used, for instance, to finance the construction of homes at a rate of interest sufficient only to cover the cost of issuance and administration, and certainly not exceeding 1 per cent, or l i per cent. The Commonwealth Bank could do that, but it is not permitted to do it. I am not very much concerned about whether there is to be one bank board or two bank boards. The present Commonwealth Bank Board is dominated by individuals who seek to favour and protect the interests of tbe private financial organizations. Therefore, whether we have one hostile board or two hostile to restrict the activities of the bank. Members of the Australian Oountry party are supposed to be concerned with the welfare of people who live in country districts and of rural industries generally; yet, in discussions siKih as this, their only concern seems to be that there shall be what they refer to as fair competition between the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks. What do they mean by fair competition? To-day tbe Commonwealth Bank would be able, if it were permitted, to make available cheap money, not only to home builders and home purchasers, but also to people in rural communities who want to expand their activities in orcier to increase production. The Government would regard an attempt by the Commonwealth Bank to discharge its services to the community at a rate of interest lower than that charged by the private bankers as unfair competition. The Government proposes not to have fair competition. It proposes t.o have no competition at all. It wants to sabotage the Oommonwealth Bank. If the Commonwealth Bank were permitted to develop in the way that was envisaged by the Labour Government that established it many years ago, country people, home purchasers, and home builders, who require financial accommodation to-day, could get it at a greatly reduced rate of interest. But the Commonwealth Bank has never been allowed to undertake that kind of business because, it was argued, that would be unfair competition with the private banks. Prior to the abolition of the Commonwealth Bank Board by the previous Labour Government in 1945, the board refused to permit the Commonwealth Bank to take any new business from the private banks, and the board did everything possible to sabotage the bank. The attitude of honourable members opposite towards the Commonwealth Bank is not' different from that of their predecessors many years ago, who opposed the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank. Supporters of the Government cannot claimthat the Commonwealth Bank has been a failure, or that it is an inefficient organization. Therefore they cannot advance any substantial reason why it should be completely destroyed. They have no acceptable reason to place before the Australian people wby that course ought to be pursued. The position was similar in relation to Trans-Australia Airlines, which is a successful government undertaking, however one cares to examine it. The Government has adopted a different method of attack in this instance. It proposes to sabotage the Commonwealth Bank. believe that if they can eventually get the Commonwealth Bank into such a position that it can be represented to the public as an inefficient organization, one that is not operating at a profit, they will be able to sell it-as they would readily sell Transrisk is involved the bank charges a high Australia Airlines to-morrow if they thought that the public would endorse their action-and it would be readily absorbed by the private banking structure. I believe that the Government has exposed quite freely its intention. In reply to Labour's contention that the Commonwealth Bank has not been allowed to develop the Postmaster General( Mr Anthony) cited the progress that has been made by the Bural Credits Department of the bank. But he did not tell the public and members of the committee the business handled by that depart, ment of the Commonwealth Bank is busiOrder! The honourable gentleman's time ness that the private bankers have never has expired. Sir. Ward. wanted. The Rural Credits Department has given to the community a service that was never provided by the private banks. Now the Government claims that its decision to permit a continuance of the department is a generous gesture. This exposes completely the purpose of tbe private banks. To-day the private banking institutions are not prepared to give service to the community unless they can derive a very high rate of profit for doing so. Therein lies the difference between the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks. As the Oommonwealth Bank has no shareholders, it is not worried about the payment of dividends. I invite succeeding Government speakers to pay attention to this aspect of the matter, instead of talking about alleged unfair treatment of the private banking interests in this country. Let them say a word in favour of improving the banking facilities available to the Australian public. I should like them to explain why they claim that it is not possible and practicable for the Commonwealth Bank to make funds available for home building and home purchase at a very low rate of interest. Of course it is possible! The Commonwealth Bank has been compelled in the past to charge the same, or almost the same, rate of interest as thatcharged by the private banking institutions, Honourable members opposite because the Government considered that the charging of a iower rate would constitute unfair competition. It has been said that the rate of interest charged by a bank is determined, to a degree, by the risk that the bank takes. If a great rate of interest to cover itself against any possible loss. I point out that in the construction of homes in this country there is no possible risk of loss, because the homes are constructed under the supervision of the officers of the bank. As soon as they are constructed they are occupied by tenants and begin to be revenue producing, and money goes back to the bank either for the purpose of cancelling out the debt or of making possible the provision of further credit for home purchasers and home builders. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN [3.0] -In view of the statements that have been made by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), I shall remind the committee of some of the facts of this mattei"". He implied that we should not trammel the people. I remind the honourable member that the former Labour Government tried to monopolize, centralize, and nationalize the banking system without any mandate from the people. The result of the subsequent general election proved that that aetion was in entire contravention of tbe popular will. It is because of Labour's reputation in this connection that we have to be on our guard. Although the Labour party could never again attempt to nationalize banking by legislative action it could, perhaps, if it gained office in the future, do so by administrative action. It is that kind of back-door nationalization against which we are trying to guard. Tbe honourable member for East Sydney asked why the Commonwealth Bank cannot issue unlimited credit. Of course it could, but if it did so it would cause higher prices and inflation in the community. That inflation could be held back only by checks and controls such as are dear to the hearts of honourable members opposite. But let me remind them that such checks and controls, if continued -and they must be continued, as a logical sequence of socialization-the y lead to the black market. The logical sequence of that course would be the development of the blacki market on a colossal scale, because of the severity of the controls that would have to be imposed to keep down inflation. We have seen the logical development under such conditions. The Australia Labour party would become the Doyle Labour party, which is the kind of thing that honourable members opposite perhaps desire. Whether or not they desire it, it is the inevitable consequence of the kind of policy that they espouse. Many honourable members opposite have protested against even a small degree of separation of banking functions. They fail to see that that is desirable both for the purpose of increasing the efiiciency of the central bank as a central bank, and increasing tbe efficiency of the trading bank as such. It is perhaps a little late to remind them (Mackellar) that all authorities on banking believe that the central bank should not carry out trading functions. For example, the governor of the South African Beserve Bank has written in these termsA further requisite of a real central bank is that it should not, to any great extent, perform such banking transactions as accepting deposits from the general public and accommodating regular commercial customers with discounts or advances. It is now almost generally accepted that a central bank should conduct direct dealings with the public only in such forms and to such extent as, in the circumstances of the particular country, it considers absolutely necessary for the purpose of carrying out its monetary and banking policy. If a central bank has a large commercial banking business, such operations might come into direct conflict with its functions as the banker's bank, the lender of last resort and the controller of credit. Honourable members opposite have made a great play with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems that was held in 1936 and 1937. I refer them to paragraph 581 of the report of that royal commission, which contains this passage. . . the most important powers of tlie Bank arise from its . . . ability to buy and sell government securities on the open market, and from its trading activities. The development of the money market in Australia was very narrow, and without access to open market operations the bank may not have been able to keep the requisite control over the volume of credit. That was merely temporary. It related to 1936 and is now a thing of the past. The circumstances which then might have differentiated the position of Australia's central bank from those of other central banks have disappeared as a result of the greater maturity and the growth of our entire financial structure. Honourable members opposite should read the report of the royal commission carefully before they quote from it, and they should quote the relevant parts. I have suggestions to offer to the Government in relation to two minor matters with which clause 6 deals. Proposed section 22A provides for the possible amalgamation of the Commonwealth Trading Bank with other trading banks. Such an amalgamation may become desirable in the course of time, but I believe that the procedure should be hedged around with precautions because, should the Labour party gain power in the future,",39,Governmen T Members No
145,Mr Wentwoeth,"it may t r y to cut down the private banks one by one by forcing them to amalgamate w it h the Commonwealth Trading Bank. I hope that the Government w ill consider amending this provision so as to guard against a possibility of that kind. The proposed section statesThe Trading Bank may, with the approval of tlie Treasurer, enter into an arrangement with any other bank . I suggest that it should be altered to read as follows:1 The Trading Bank may, with the approval of the Treasurer ancl the consent of both Houses of the Parliament, enter into an arrangement with any other bank . There is a danger that a future government proposed section in order to nationalize banking least the sanction of this should be obtained before any such procedure is put into effect. I hope that the Prime Minister will give to the suggestion. refers to proposed section 19 (6), which applies to certain transfers of money as additions to the capital of the Commonwealth Trading Bank. the capital of the Commonwealth Bank shall include such sums as are paid to it in pursuance of sections 15 and 47 of the present Commonwealth neither of which will be amended by this measure. that the profits to which this will apply should be paid to the Rural Credits Department, Department Department wealth Trading Bank. profits General Banking Credits Department, Department Department. logical up to the present because such profits have accrued to the wealth Bank Reserve Fund as a result, to some degree at any rate, of the operations of the General Banking This measure will eliminate the General Banking Division and will establish the Commonwealth changed circumstances, the profits might be paid, with more justice and logic, to the Rural Credits Department, tbe Mortgage Bank Department Mr Wenticorth. tria l Finance Department. I have not had an opportunity to consider the implications of the provision in detail, but I believe that my suggestion is well worthy of consideration. I repeat that authorities all over the world agree that a central bank functions best when it has no trading bank appanage to poison its relations w i th other trading banks. The trading bank functions can be more efficiently performed when the trading bank functions as a separate institution. The TEMPORARYCHAIRMAN Order!

However, the Government bas decided that the best plan is to put bobbles on the bank so that it w ill be partially destroyed. That is a dangerous policy, because the Commonwealth Bank has proved itself to be a great instrument for the good of the people. Its value to the nation has been demonstrated over and over again during two world wars and during the period when the Labour party was in power after World War II . An examinationof the annual report of the Commonwealth Bankf o r 1951-52 w ill show how it has worked in the interests of the people. The honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Wheeler) said that the Commonwealth Bank, like the private banks, should be obliged to pay taxes. That is utterly ridiculous. The, report statesThe aggregate net profit of the Commonwealth Bank, including the Note Issue Department and the Commonwealth Savings Bank, after making provision for contingencies was, in round figures, £8,465,000. This compares with £7,300,000 last year. The report goes on to explain how tbe profits of the bank have been disbursed. They have gone to the people as a whole. The profits of private banks go to a comparatively small number of people, and quite a few of these people do not even reside in Australia. If all banks in this country are to be placed upon the same level, let the private banks be placed upon the level of the Commonwealth Bank and let the people have their pronts. I am certain that the Commonwealth Bank has never been allowed to compete f a i r l y with the private banks. Tbe history of the bank shows that boards and managements have never devoted any great energy to the task of developing it so that it could compete properly with private banks. There is no branch of the Commonwealth Banki n many f a ir sized country towns in New South Wales, although there are branches of at least two private banks. In Barraba, there are branches of the Bank of New South Wales and of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited, but tbere is no branch of the-Commonwealth Bank. A similar position obtains in other towns The honourable member for such as Bingara, Boggabri, Bogangate, ( Mr Wentworth) would Boolaroo, Bombala, Bundanoon, Bangalow, Branxton, Byron Bay and Berry. outright without any ""beg The Commonwealth Bank has never been allowed to function in f a i r competition with private banks. Wheni t was controlled by a hostile board, or by a board consisting of bankers, it was prevented from paying the same rate of interest to depositors as was paid by the private banks. The object of the board was to discourage depositors from using the Commonwealth Bank so t h a t ' it would be unable to function properly as a trading bank. If this bill is passed and the trading bank and central bank functions of the Commonwealth Bank are separated, there w ill be a great clanger that a similar process of strangulation w ill be applied to the Commonwealth Trading Bank. It w i ll be permitted to pay only 3-J per cent, interest upon deposits, fixed and otherwise, but the private banks w ill be allowed to pay 4 per cent. That happened previously, to the detriment of the development of the Commonwealth Bank. Its assets remained stationary, bnt tbe private banks were able to attract more depositors and, therefore, were able to lend more money. I believe that the Government of this country should have complete control of our banking system so that money can be used in the best interests of Australia and loaned to important industries at the lowest possible rate of interest. Our economic system has had to carry the burden of our banking system for a long time. Private banks, not only in Australia but also throughout the world, have been bludgeoning industry for far too long. Wben any one wishes to establish a new industry or to increase production, he can obtain the necessary money only by paying an exorbitant rate of interest for it to private bankers. That is not in the best interests of the nation. I believe that the Commonwealth Bank should be strengthened, not weakened, as it will be by this bill. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN Order! The honprable gentleman's time has expired. [3.20] I rise only to deal with some obviously inaccurate statements that were made by the honourable member for Banks( Mr Costa). He said that any real competition between the Commonwealth Bank and private banks has been suppressed. To support his contention, he stated that there were no branches of the Commonwealth Bank in many country towns and villages. That is an interesting approach to the question, especially to myself, because the honourable gentleman referred to a number of places which are very well known to me. Some of them are in my electorate. He informed the committee that there is no branch of the Commonwealth Bank in Barraba, although there are branches of the Bank of New South Wales and of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited in tbe town. Let me say that they are very old-established branches of those banks. The honourable gentleman advanced an interesting argument, but when we analyse it we find that it will not hold water. In Barraba, there is no branch of the National Bank of Queensland, the Commercial Bank of Australia Limited, the English, Scottish and Australian Bank Limited or any Victorian bank. Probably that is true also of the other places to which he referred. If there is any substance in the honorable gentleman's contention, it could be argued reasonably that the Government has adopted a policy of suppression in relation to some private banks and has prevented them from entering into competition with the Bank of New South Wales and the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited. The truth of the matter is that the only active suppression of that kind of which I have knowledge occurred during the war, when the government of the day, a Labour government led by Mr Curtin, insisted that, as far as possible, the banks should rationalize their services and decrease their staffs by closing down much needed branches in certain places. That policy was also implemented during the regime of the Chifley Government. In a State electorate that I used to represent, it had the effect of disturbing considerably the banking operations of some of my constituents, because they discovered that the branch of a certain bank that had operated in, say, Dorrigo, for a long time had been closed and that they had to use the branch in Bellingen, which was about 20 miles away, and could be reached only by a road that was not very good. In time of war, that kind of thing was not unreasonable I do not think any one is entitled to suggest that the banks did not attempt to co-operate to the f u l l with the government of the day by releasing for war service as many of the members of their staffs as they possibly could. All that I want to do is to show the fallacy of the argument that the honourable member for Banks has advanced in support of his contention that the present Government parties have been guilty of sinister aetion in regard to the Commonwealth Bank. I do not want to prolong my contribution to this debate by referring at undue length to the subject of socialization. The contention of Opposition members that they accepted the decision of the Privy Council that the Australian Government did not have the constitutional power to bring about bank nationalization, has been adequately answered by various Government supporters including",43,Governmen T Members No
149,Mr Drummond (New England),"the Minister for Social Services( Mr board's direction. Since the intention of Townley), who quoted the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell). Other Government supporters have quoted Labour party members who have said emphatically that they would achieve by administrative means what they were prevented from achieving by the ordinary processes of legislation. As long as bank nationalization remains an integral part of the platform of the Labour party honourable members opposite are pledged to its achievement. The honourable member for Melbourne himself said that the Government should have control of all finance. If the Government gains control of all finance it will have control of the whole of the country's industry. Tbe authori ty that controls finance will be able the constitution and platform of the Ausin tbe final analysis, to turn the screw whenever it wants to. It is inevitable that the Government must bring pressure to bear in times of crisis and take certain action that would not have been advisable in time of peace. But if any government is given complete control of finance it will be in a position to squeeze any section of the community that differs from it in the way mentioned by Marx and Lenin and other Bussian Communists. Proposed new section 21 (2.) statesThe Trading Bank may, from time to time, transfer from the Gommonwealth Trading Bank of Australia Reserve Fund to the capital of tlie Trading Bank such sums as the Board determines. In every other provision the imperative is used. The words are "" The Trading Bank shall "" ; but in this case the words are "" The Trading Bank may "". I wonder whether that is a misprint. Why should the trading bank have an option under the provision I have quoted, which is not given to it elsewhere? I do not think that that was intended. There are other cases in the bill where the word "" may "" is used for obvious reasons because the exercise of discretion is desirment has insufficient existing power to able. But it seems to me that if the controllers of the reserve fund are to be able to place the Commonwealth Trading Bank on the same footing as any otlier trading bank the imperative should be used in this provision. In other words the Commonwealth Trading Bank should have no option but to comply with the the bill before the House is to place the national trading bank on tbe same basis as private trading banks I ask the Prime Minister to consider whether more complete effect could not be given to the Government's intentions by the moving of a minor amendment when the bill is before another place. Honourable members opposite continually charge the Labour party with the intention of implementing sections of its policy by stealth. It is quite true that tbe nationalization of private banks is still the policy of the Labour party, as the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) said when he quoted from tralian Labour party. But it is also true that the Labour movement has no intention of giving effect to any item of its policy against the wish of a majority of the people of Australia. The position at this stage is as I shall now announce it. In 1947, the Labour Government introduced legislation which provided for the nationalization of private banks. That legislation was challenged, first in the High Court and then before the Privy Council. When it was challenged in the High Court, even the High Court judges were not"" unanimous in their opinion that the Parliament did not possess the power to nationalize. It is interesting to note that the Chief Justice himself dissented from tbe majority viewpoint that it was not within the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to nationalize the private banks. But the majority decision was against the government of the day and an appeal was lodged with the Privy Council against that decision. The decision of the High Court was confirmed by the Privy Council. The present position is that the two authorities have declared, if only by majority decision, that the Commonwealth Parlianationalize private banks. But if on some future occasion the matter were again submitted to the people by referendum and a majority of the people, having had the matter explained to them fully by the Labour party, in their wisdom decided to support our proposal, do honourable members opposite who claim",45,Governmen T Members No
150,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [3.30],"to be democrats contend that that decision of the people sbould not be given effect to? In my opinion tbe Labour party bas no intention of proceeding in any otber way to implement its policy. I am of tbe opinion that tbe banks will eventually be nationalized because tlie majority of tbe people will realize the good sense of voting for nationalization. But that is the only way in whicb nationalization will be effected by the Labour party. The policy of the Labour party i.s known and the method by which it proposes to give effect to its policy is known. interests of their private financial backers The Labour party proposes to act by constitutional methods. Bank nationalization cannot be an issue at the forthcoming Senate election because the constitutional barrier remains. It cannot be an issue at the next federal elections because the same barrier will be there. But it is perfectly true that a Labour government of the future could resubmit the question to the people by a referendum. Those facts expose the attitude of honourable members opposite, because although they claim to be democrats they do not want the people to make the final decision. They are prepared to defend the privileged position of private financial interests and bankers, regardless of the Constitution and' the will of the people. The honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) said that his party wanted to make it as difficult as possible for any future Labour government to proceed with its policy of socialization. If the honourable member for Sturt claims to be a democrat why should he want to create difiiculties for a government which has been elected by the majority of the people? The parties opposite claim that, having been elected with a majority, they are entitled to implement the policy that they enunciated. we know that the Government parties bave one policy at election time for public consumption, so as to win support for tbeir candidates and another policy, their real policy, which they never announce to the people. They know that if they had told the people during the general election campaign what they intended to do, they would never have been able to secure a majority in this chamber. This Government represents the private finanMr Ward. cial institutions of Australia. It believes in the right to exploit the people and the right to make exorbitant profits. Whenever its supporters believe that the citadel of private capital and finance is in any real danger every one of them, no matter what contrary opinions he may have expressed during an election campaign, rushes to defend it. They all fall into line. As I said earlier to-day, they are not concerned whether any change in the banking system is in the interests of the general community. All they are concerned about is whether the are endangered, and whether they can still ensure that those backers will continue to ' enjoy their present privileged position. The attempt of honourable members to whip up again, and play on, the fears of the people, will probably not be as effective this time as it was on the last occasion, because I cannot imagine any farmer in New England being worried about whether or not the private banks have been affected by the operation of the Commonwealth Banki f he is able to get financial accommodation from the Oommonwealth Bank at a lower rate of interest than that at which he could formerly obtain it from a private bank. The same applies to people who live in working class areas. If they get financial accommodation at a lower rate of interest from the Oommonwealth Bank than they could get it from a private bank, tbey will not be worried about this question of bank nationalization to which the honourable member referred. As a matter of fact it is rather interesting to note that the great bulk of the people's savings to-day is not in private banks, but in Government Savings Banks, and the depositors have not been prejuOf course, diced in any way by having their money in such banks. Government supporters, however, attempt to create, in the minds of the public, the illusion that the people's savings could be transferred, under a Labour government, from a private bank to Government banks. The fact is that most of those savings are already in the Government bank. The general public has no direct interest in the private trading banks which would be affected by any nationalization of the banking system. The honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond) attempted to demolish the argument advanced by the honourable member for Banks( Mr Costa), and referred to a town called Barraba, in which, he said, there were some private banks, but there was no branch of the Commonwealth Bank. He said the fact that some private banks had no branch in that town indicated that there was no basis for the argument advanced by the honourable member for Banks that the Commonwealth Bank had not been permitted to expand and develop in competition with the private banks to the degree intended by the Labour party. What the honourable member for New England omitted to mention is that there is no competition between the private banks, which rationalize the banking industry by agreement, sharing out districts among themselves and deciding in which districts branches of the various private banks shall be established. The only existing competition in Australian banking is between the private banks and the Commonwealth Bank. What Government supporters have endeavoured to do by the exercise of their power in this Parliament is to restrict the Commonwealth Bank's competition witb tbe private banks. man when it was necessary to rationalize industry. He talks about the co-operation of the banks with the government of the day. All I can say is that he does not know what he is talking about, because, in actual fact, when the country was in desperate need and wanted to conserve its man-power The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired. ister) [3.40] I wish first to mention several points to which reference has been made. The honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond) raised a question in relation to the proposed new section 21 (2.) which readsThe Trading Bank may, from time to time, transfer from the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia Beserve Fund to the capital new facts of the last 25 years he is living of the Trading Bank such sums as the Board determines. I point out to him that there is no anomaly there, because the Commonwealth Trading Bank will be under the control of the board, and therefore the whole problem of what should be done with the reserves will be a problem that the board has to determine, and the result will be exactly the same whether the word ""may"" or the word ""shall"" be used, because the operative words are "" such sums as the Board determines "". It may determine none, it may determine a great deal, or it may determine all. The whole thing rests on a discretionary power. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) raised two matters. He had been good enough to discuss them with me before the committee stage had been reached, and all I want to say now is that, whilst on each of the two points I am far from being satisfied that what he has suggested is the right thing to do, each of them merits some further consideration, and I am quite agreeable to having that consideration given to them before the bill goes to another place. I turn now to the speeches that have been made during the debate, particularly by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) and, to some degree, by the honourable member for Banks( Mr Costa). I am beginning to think that the The honourable gentlehonorable member for East Sydney is referred to the war period, one of the most reactionary members of this House-and I use the word "" reactionary "" with due consideration-because he has not, in my experience, developed a fresh thought on this problem over the last 25 years. He has a few little catchwords in his mind, and he thinks they are an admirable substitute for thought, and that is, after all, characteristic of the tory and reactionary all over the world. What has he in his mind ? First of all he said that the Commonwealth Bank had been frustrated, that it had never been allowed to develop its business, and, in particular, that it had never been allowed to do all it should be doing in relation to the housing of tbe people. Those are fine mouth-filling statements to make. The only trouble about each of them is that it is utterly untrue. Because the honourable member has never troubled to catch up with any on tbe slogans of a quarter of a century ago. On Tuesday the . Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) answered a question on",46,Governmen T Members No
151,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Prime Minnotice by tbe honorahle member for Wilmot( Mr Dnthie) about the Commonwealth Bank. I do not propose to read all of his answer, because it has been in the possession of honourable members, although the honourable member for East Sydney has not read it. I merely point out that the number of accounts, including deposits bearing interest, maintained with the General Banking Division of the Commonwealth Bank rose from 257,982 in April, 1949, to 372,870 in April, 1952. So, to say the least of it, and I use the most courteous possible terms, it is a fairly bold statement to make that, in face of an expansion of that order, the General Banking Division of the Commonwealth Bank has been frustrated. The honourable member for East Sydney could hardly have selected a more unfortunate example than housing on which to base an argument that the activities of the bank have been frustrated, because the record of the Comand pushing it out at what the honourable monwealth Ba.nk in respect of housing loans is a first-class record. The bank has devoted a great deal of particular attention to the needs of the people in relation to housing, and has been encourag'ed to do so by the present Government. advances made by the General Banking Division of the Commonwealth Bank for buildings and home buildings represent 29 per cent, of its portfolio, as compared with 10 per cent, in the case of the ordinary bank. I do not say that critically, because there is a limit, in ordinary the recent economic conference in Lonbanking practice, to the amount which you should have in your portfolio in a particular form of investment. But the Commonwealth Bank, which he says has been frustrated, denied and ordered about, has 29 per cent, of its advances in the form of advances for building purposes as against 10 per cent., which is the average percentage in the case of ordinary banks. Eor the second time, the trouble with the honourable member is that he has not caught up with what may be called the facts of life. The next point that he made-and this is so old that it should have been dead and buried years ago-was to this effect : Why could not the Commonwealth Bank, as it would under a proper government, find money for housing at 1 per cent.? Mr Menzies. Well, he had eight years in which to do so. Isi t not odd how this virtue, which lay dormant for so many years, bursts into lovely flower a few years later? He did not do it. Why did he not do it? Treasurer. third time to-day I am indebted to the bonorable gentleman for a most frank statement. The Treasurer was the late Mr Chifley, who had some sense of responsibility in respect of central bank credit. As the honourable member now tells us, his late leader, on whose reputation he has climbed into Parliament time after time, was against him, and that is why it was not done. Of course, Mr Chifley knew, as every sensible person in this chamber knows, that to talk about the Commonwealth Bank merely inventing new capital for all kinds of purposes member is pleased to call "" cost of issue "", is the most fantastic notion in the world. I am amazed to find that my friend, the honourable member for Banks, to whom I usually listen with respect, seems to be a little touchedI hope not permanentlyThe fact is that the by the same illusion, this strange idea that there should never be any shortage of capital in the world, because as long as there is a central bank, capital can be produced. It is, perhaps, desirable to say to honourable members-and I wish it were known all over Australia-that at don, about which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) was good enough to put a question to me the other day, eight governments of the British Commonwealth were represented by every conceivable variety of political thought. Yet not one person at that conference was heard to say, when we were discussing the question of how we were to secure more capital for development, "" That' is quite simple. As long as you have a central bank there is no problem about capital. Just write a cheque on the central bank and get the money from it . If there is not enough in the till, the bank will print it for you."" That is a beautif u l simplification of the problems affecting the capital requirements of a country. Compared with a great many of the men present at that conference, I consider",48,Governmen T Members No
152,Mr Ward,Becaus e he was not the,49,Governmen T Members No
153,Mr Menzies,"Exactly. Eor themyself the merest apprentice in such matters. Some of the ablest minds in the world sat around that table and discussed how to obtain the capital needed in the various countries. Every one of them said, "" Let us startoff with this proposiBank. The figures that I have cited tion : Unless we are going to destroy the value of the currency, and unless we are going to produce an inflation that is completely beyond control, first we must produce capital in our own countries, from our own savings."" This is not any "" wild cat"" conception of finance. It is first necessary to produce capital from savings in one's own country. Then, if it is possible to do so, capital can be obtained from the savings of people in other countries, because that is all that overseas borrowing amounts to. Tet this old and tattered, disreputable and ruinous doctrine that as long as there is a central bank it is only necessary to say, "" How much do you want-£300,000,00 0 or £400,000,000? "" is still trotted out. I speak in such lofty figures because theycharacterize these bogus financiers on the other side of the committee. There is not to be found among them a soul who understands these matters. They then contend that, having obtained that money from the Commonwealth Bank, the Government should serve it out at 1 per cent, on what, we are now so frankly told, is the Ward formula but was never the Chifley formula. I do not need to elaborate these matters overmuch, because everything that has been said by honourable members opposite in the course of this debate has been said in the light of a complete piece of nonsense, financially and economically. However, if one goes behind all the oddities and eccentricities to which I have been referring, the really interesting thing is that there are very many people in Australia, in the ranks of the supporters of both my own party and the Australian Country party, who would like this legislation to go further. There is no mystery about that. There is great variety of opinion on these matters. On the opposite side of the committee are those wbo appear to think unanimously along these lines: "" You fellows are going so much too far with this legislation that you are setting out to destroy tbe Commonwealth Bank"". What the Govern[20] ment has been doing-and what I hope a sane government will always do-is to pursue some planned course in this matter. The last thing that we propose to do is to destroy the Commonwealth are the best evidence of the vivacity of that institution under our general political control. On the other hand, if we can help it we do not propose to allow the trading banks to be destroyed. Two or three honourable members opposite to-day made a virtue of necessity and said, almost with washings of the hands, "" Of course, we tried to nationalize the banks by statute, but that attempt was challenged in the High Court and we were beaten-bu t only by a majority "". Incidentally, I thought the latter remark was an interesting observation. They continued, "" The case then went to the Privy Council, which decided that the High Court was right. Therefore, that ends the matter. The last thing we would do would be to overrule the Privy Council "". Of course it is! Honourable members do not need to tell us that. There is no virtue in saying that they have accommodated themselves to the decision of the Privy Council, but there is great value in trying to prove that the Privy Council decision, and primarily that of the High Court, was to the effect that the thing could not be done by statute in the form that was then adopted. Nothing whatever was said about the fact that the decision does not inhibit a Commonwealth Government administratively, in the exercise of valid laws, from squeezing the banking system out of existence. And not a word has been said by honourable members opposite to indicate that they are pledging themselves not to use their administrative powers to achieve, by a different route, the goal that was barred by the High Court and the Privy Council. Of course they cannot give a pledge on that. To-day we have heard the most sickening, unctuous remarks made by the Opposition abouttrusting the people. I have been informed to-day, by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), that honourable memhers on this side of the House do not trust the people. That comes singularly well"" from a member of a party which, without a mandate, brought down a bill to nationalize banking and rejected an amendment that was moved by tbe tben opposition to tbe effect that tbe legislation sbould not operate until after tbe matter bad been determined by tbe people. Sucb are tbe democrats of tbe Labour party. assumed office, discovered a state of affairs in which, under a valid law-no t the act of 1947-, but the valid act of 1945-the trading banks had accrued liabilities of £540,000,000 to the central bank. By administrative action, any government could have put the private banks out of business in 24 hours. In view of the fact that the Government, acting on tbe Prime Minister's ( Mr Bank nationalization is still the policy Menzies) instructions, by the application of the ""guillotine"", has restricted the debate on this particular matter, I ask you, Mr Temporary Chairman, whether there is any action that can be taken under the Standing Orders to prevent the Prime Minister from stone-walling the debate and thus preventing any reply being made to his misleading statements ? The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN Order! The Prime Minister is in order. that the honourable member for East Sydney is in such hilarious form that, having treated the committee to twenty minutes of nonsense, he now resents having to listen to twenty minutes of good sense. However, I understand him wellI would not like to say that I know himbut I have seen him for many years and I know his methods of provocation. He is not unaware of the clock. This Government inherited banking legislation under which any government, by administrative action in respect of the Commonwealth Bank, which was then under' the sole control of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and in which there ""was no Commonwealth Bank Board and no statutary provision for reference of disputes to this House in relation to a matter so elementary as the special deposits lodged with the Commonwealth Bank by the trading banks, could have destroyed the trading banks. every child knows that what I have said is perfectly correct. The interesting thing to realize about this matter is that tbe honourable member for East Sydney, when confronted by that position, let the cat out of the bag. He would not content himself by saying, "" We are not going to Tbis Government, wben it try to overrule tbe Privy Council's decision without going to the people "", because he knew that it is the administrative weapon which can be most deadly. minute to say this, comrade. The honourable member for East Sydney stood up and said that bank nationalization was still the policy of the Labour party. Therefore, the cat is now out of the bag. of the Labour party. Why is the Labour party now opposing this legislation? Because it knows that unless the legislation is altered as we are proposing to alter it, Labour may some day get into office with a weapon in its hands to give effect to its policy. In that event honourable members opposite need never refer to the people, because they will be taking administrative action, and when a general election comes along in due course they will be able to say, in the phrase of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), "" Once we have scrambled the eggs you will never be able to unscramble them'"". The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has paid a tribute to the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) because instead of answering his arguments he has misrepresented them.

Tho Customs Tariff Proposals which I have just introduced cover proposed amendments to the Customs Tariff 19331.952 and the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) 1933-1952. The principal amendments to the Customs Tariff 1933-1952 relate to internal combustion engines, canvas and duck piece goods of flax or containing a mixture of fibres in which flax predominates, industrial type ironing and washing machines, micrometers and precision test indicators, leads for wooden pencils and frames and catches for ladies' and children's handbags. The proposed duties will operate as on and from 9 a.m. on the 6th March, 1953. The summary of alterations, which is already in the hands of honourable members, sets cut in concise form the proposed variations to the Customs Tariff 1933 -1952. The proposed duties are mainly consequent upon adoption by the Government of recommendations made by tbe Tariff Board. In a few instances the wording of the tariff items has been varied to more clearly express the intention of the existing item. The second proposal relates to the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) 1933-1952. designed to give effect to an alteration which the respective Governments of New Zealand and Australia have agreed to make in ArticleX . of the New Zealand Trade Agi'eement of 1933. Under the original provisions of Article X., goods manufactured in Australia, but not wholly from Australian materials, did not enjoy the benefits of the agreement when imported into New Zealandi f they contained less than 50 per cent, of Australian content in terms of Australian materials and labour costs. Several products manufactured in Australia, chiefly from imported raw materials, did not ful2).]-continued. fil these conditions. Similar conditions applied to New Zealand products imported into Australia. The proposed amendment alters the original conditions by adding alternative conditions to be applied on a reciprocal basis. They provide that a product imported into Australia which contains at least 75 per cent, of New Zealand, Australian and United Kingdom content or alternatively 75 per cent, of New Zealand and United Kingdom content shall be regarded as a product of New Zealand origin for purposes of the Trade Agreement. A 75 per cent, minimum content conforms with the normal conditions applying to imports from the United Kingdom. The New Zealand Government has already put into operation as on and from the 30th January, 1953, a similar amendment applying like conditions to Australian exports to New Zealand. It is desirable that the proposals should have effect on the same date in both countries-henc e the retrospective provision for the operation of the proposals on the 30th January, 1953. At a later date honourable members will be accorded full opportunity to discuss these proposals.

In committee: Consideration resumed (vide page 611). Clauses7 to 10-by leave-considere d together. One question that appears to me to need consideration by the committee is the provision for the appointment of university graduates to the staff of the Commonwealth Bank. Clause 10 provides(1.1 The Bank may appoint to the Service of the Bank a -person who has not passed a prescribed entrance examination but is(a) A graduate of, or qualified for admisBank service if it were possible for them sion to a degree of, a University in Australia; and (6) Not more than 25 years of age. (2.) The number of persons appointed to thc Service of the Bank under the last preceding sub-section in any yeaishall not exceed one-ninth of the number of male persons appointed' to that service during that year after having passed a prescribed entrance examination. I am not opposed personally to the entranceof outside persons to the bank staff or to the Public Service. It would be bad if. we had a completely tightsystem under which nobody could gain entrance to the service except by the ordinary entrance examination. That is a personal opinion of mine and it may not be held by some other honourable members. A t the same time, I think that we sbould safeguard the rights of public servants. Young men who have decided to make a career of banking are entitled to reasonable consideration in the filling of vacancies in the bank. I agree that £be existing method of appointment to the service of the bank is not ideal and may result in many young men who have not had a chance to qualify for appointment by passing the entrance examination being' prevented for life from entering the service of the bank. I see no reason why appointment to the service of the bank,, of. persons other than those who have passed the prescribed entrance examination should be limited to university graduates. men who have gained experience in banking in the private banks, wish to enter the service of the Commonwealth Bank but w ill be prevented from doing so because they are not university graduates. The services of such young men would be very valuable to the bank. As the Government has clearly indicated its intention to push on with the establishment and expansion of the Commonwealth Trading Banki t may well have provided that, of those whom it proposes to admit to the service of the bank other than applicants who have passed tbe prescribed entrance examination at least 10' per cent, may be experienced young men who have gained banking knowledge and experience in the private banks. I understand that many employees of the private banks would gladly transfer to the Commonwealth to do so on reasonable terms. The Government should consider widening the provision to enable persons, other than graduates or those who have qualified for admission to a degree of a university in Australia, to enter the service of the bank without examination. I assume that the limitation of the number of university graduates to one-ninth of the number of male persons appointed to the service of the bank during a year after having passed the prescribed entrance examination is in accordance w i th the practice followed in the Public Service. We should not make entrance to the Public Service or to the service of the bank so restrictive that young men may be denied for all time an opportunity to j o in either of the services. Pear has been expressed that the rights of officers already in the service of the bank are not being properly protected. Appropriate steps should be taken to ensure that the promotion rights' of officers are adequately safeguarded. Many officers of the bank have given long and f a it h f u l service. Their skill inbanking practice should give them advantages not necessarily possessed by university graduates. not to promotions w it h in the service of tha bank,, but to appointments to the Many young bank.",56,Tarif F Board Reports On Items
163,Mr Tom Btjrke (Perth) [4.14],,57,Commonwealth Bank
164,Mr Meh,"ZEBS -The provision relates,zation such as the Commonwealth Bank every incentive should be offered to the staff to train for higher posts. In addition to safeguarding the rights of the employees having regard to their special experience, the bank should institute a training scheme .to fit its young officers to fill higher positions In recent years the bank has developed a very valuable scholarship system under which selected oflicers are sent abroad to gain experience an early age because family circumstances of banking practice in other countries. The experience gained by those who are fortunate enough to be granted scholarships is valuable, not only to the bank itself, but also to the community in general. The system might very well be extended to cover the training of officers in Australia to fill higher positions in the bank. Men and women employees sbould be encouraged to study in order to fit themselves for higher positions, ahd every assistance should be afforded to enable them to do so. As I said at the outset of my remarks we must make the new Commonwealth Trading Bank as efficient as possible, and for that purpose we must secure the sea-vices of the best available men. In filling positions in the new bank preference should be given to existing employees of the Commonwealth Bank. If that is done oflicers will be given an incentive to remain in the service of the hank. If sufficient staff is not available executive officers. Failure to enable from among the oflicers of the bank the requisite additional staff sbould be recruited from outside the service of the bank but should not be restricted to university graduates to the exclusion of others who have special qualifications for appointment. support the remarks made by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke). Many officers of the Commonwealth Bank with whom I have discussed this matter have expressed fears regarding the proposal that one-tenth of the staff intake of the bank shall consist of university graduates. The Labour party has no objection to the appointment of university .students to the Public Service or to the service of the bank. Honourable members on this side of the chamber realize that those who devote a great deal of time to study play a very important part in carying on the affairs of the country. Commonwealth Bank officers are incensed at this provision because they fear that it will operate against their interests in the selection of oflicers to fill higher positions in the bank. They believe that it should be possible for the bank to establish a system of cadetship for training of young officers. Many youths enter the service of the bank at or other considerations prevent them from matriculating and taking a university course. The bank would render a great service to the community if it provided cadetships for those of its young oflicers who indicate their intention to devote the whole of their working life to its service! The fullest opportunity should be given to them to participate in all of the benefits that the bank can confer by way of promotion to higher posts. At present tbe bank recruits its staff by competitive examination. By that means it attracts many bright lads to its service. The Government might very well give an incentive for those young lads to remain in the service of the bank by providing in the bill tliat oflicers of the bank shall have prior right to fill vacant higher positions. I believe that it is also a deficiency in the organization of the bank. Any bank, in order to have the capacity to endure, should train its own officers of the bank to qualify for positions that are to be reserved for university graduates is a drastic omission from the bill. I recognize that on occasion no suitable officer may be available among the members of the bank's staff to perform work of a particular type; but such a contingency could be met by a proviso to the effect that in such circumstances the bank could engage persons from outside its service. I am not impressed by the age limitation of 25 years because many capable men over that age may be available. That limitation is unnecessary. Some members of the Oommonwealth Bank Officers' Association have expressed t.he fear that the general manager -of tbe proposed Oommonwealth Trading Bank will be actuated by the profit motive and, .consequently, will",57,Commonwealth Bank
165,Mr Tom Burke,In a big organi,58,Commonwealth Bank
166,Mr Joshua (Bamarat) [4.22],"Iendeavour to increase the bank's revenue and, at the same time, reduce its expenditure. The largest item of expenditure will be salaries. Members of the association have advised me that their scales of salaries under the 1945 act extended up to 27 years, whereas the scales of salaries of omcers of the private trading banks, which are determined by the Commonwealth Court of Oonciliation and Arbitration, extend up to only eighteen years. Members of the association fear that the general manager of the proposed Commonwealth Trading Bank, with the object of reducing expenditure, will reduce the scale of salaries. Probably, if he cannot reach agreement with the association, he will force its members into the arbitration court, and, consequently, the existing scales of salaries may be reduced. The Prime Minister has said that omcers of the Commonwealth Bank will be fully protected. Nevertheless, I believe that the general manager of the proposed Commonwealth Trading Bank will make a strong move to produce the best results by the standards which the private trading banks observe and that his efforts in that direction may result in a deterioration of the salaries and standards of employment which officers of the Commonwealth Bank now enjoy. Thus those officers, particularly senior officers, may suffer as by the bank to gain university qualificaa result of this measure. The Government should make absolutely certain that officers of the bank shall uot be forced into the arbitration court, but that the provisions of the 1945' act covering theiv salaries and their industry as a whole shall continue in force. I am somewhat perturbed about clause 10 which I regard as being unsatisfactory. Most honourable memhers will naturally agree with the statement made by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in his second-reading speecli that a university degree should not be regarded as an impediment to engagement in the service of the Commonwealth Bank. However, the clause as drafted leaves the door open to the exercise of privilege. I do not know whether the Government adverted to that point. In any event, the Government will not administer the clause. If engagement Under the clause is to be limited to university graduates up to the age of 25 years, which provision in itself is fairly restrictive, I doubt whether the appointees will have an adequate opportunity to indicate whether or not they will be outstanding in the particular field for which they are selected. The need to make provision for a greater degree of competition in the filling of such posts is obvious. I find it difficult to appreciate the necessity for making provision for the appointment of university graduates to the service of an institution of this kind. Perhaps, such persons may possess special qualifications in respect of economics, agriculture or business management. Nevertheless, competition for appointment to positions in this sphere should be broadened. At least, the management of the bank might have a look over the lists of those qualified in certain subjects. I repeat that the clause, as drafted, leaves open the door to privilege. I am reminded that on one occasion when a. Minister in Lord Melbourne's Government made the remark that if a certain appointment were to be made he would not mind appointing a person who was associated with the family "" ceteris paribus ""-al l other things being equal-Lord Melbourne replied, "" Neither would I , but ceteris paribus be damned! "" Officers of the bank should be encouraged tions. Such an institution could very well use some of its profits in making provision for the training of selected officers along lines which the bank believed would give tbem special qualifications in certain spheres. Provision should also be made to permit the appointment of officers of the private trading banks to the service of the Commonwealth Trading Bank. Many officers of the private banks might believe that they could carve out a career for themselves with the Commonwealth Bank. In addition, they would have special qualifications as a result of their experience with the private banks. Consequently, a degree of preference should be exercised in relation to such applicants. The proposed intake of one-tenth of university graduates, which is a comparatively large percentage, in circumstances in which the competitive spirit will be absent will leave open the door to the exercise of privilege.",58,Commonwealth Bank
167,Mr Andrews (Darebin) [4.28],"Whilst it is desirable that the bank should be enabled to obtain the services of officers with the highest qualifications for sons with university graduate qualiwork of special types, the clause should be redrafted in order to ensure that those with the best qualifications shall be engaged after the bank management has examined the list of university graduates who apply to join its service. Safeguards must be provided against the exercise of privilege. particularly when we remember that some years ago privilege was exercised to a scandalous degree in the making of appointments to the Public Service. ister) [4.34] I intervene at this stage ates are introduced into tbe service of because it would be unfortunate if any tbe bank, the system must involve selecmisconceptions about this matter were tion.

Tbere is no novelty about this that we need worry about privilege. There provision except in relation to the Comis not half as much privilege now as tbere monwealth Bank. A similar provision was in the days of Lord Melbourne. applies in relation to the Public Service. But I am sure that honourable members, and particularly the honourable member either. for Darebin, will appreciate that the day has gone when we can say that all the honourable member. I want tbe sort of members of the staff of a great central privilege that will enable any boy, whatbank must start in its service at the age ever his station, to get a university degree of sixteen or seventeen years when they if he is capable of doing so. That is a have passed a relatively elementary exgreat privilege. I myself have enjoyed amination. This business is becoming so it. But I also consider that the bank complex that I believe that no central should have the privilege of recruiting bank, particularly the one in this country, to its ranks this modest percentage of sbould be deprived of the services of the new officers from persons who, by reason best-trained people that it can find. That of their training, will be able.at once to is why this provision, which is entirely direct their minds to tfie problems that acceptable to the Commonwealth Bank they will be required to examine.

I am not sure whether the proposal would commend itseK to officers of the Commonwealth Bank unless the person whom the bank had in mind for selection had some special qualifications which no member of the staff of the bank possessed -I believe that the position is covered by section 161 of the principal act, which reads as follows:fl.) If at any time in any special case it appears expedient or desirable in the interests of tlie Bank to appoint to tlie Service of. the Bank a person who has not passed a prescribed entrance examination, the Bank may appoint that person without examination. I think that the officers of the Commonwealth Bank will regard the next subsection as quite proper. It reads as follows:(2.) No such appointment shall be made unless the Governor certifies that, in his opinion, there is noofficer available in the Service of the Bank who is as capable of filling ments, the staff of the Public Service' is the position to which it is proposed that the appointment sliall be made. I bave read those two sub-sections because I think that they meet the point which was raised, very properly, by the honourable member for Perth. Clearly, we cannot have a system of artificial competition among university graduates. Tbe man of parts must be chosen. Some people may be thepossessors of law degrees, yet may not have distinguished minds. They have merely passed some examinations. Other men with law degrees may have not only abUity but also training that has enriched their minds: Therefore, the matter is reduced to one of honest selection. I agree with the honourable member for Darebin that kissing should not go by favour, and that there should not be any privilege. The selection should be honest. If we require tbe honest selection of these oflicers, we aU must d'o our best to have honest men to make the selections. That is all we can do. sonal explanation. The Prime Minister has stated that I have presumed to speak on behalf of the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association. I merely wish to correct any misapprehension that may be in the. mindsof honourable members.

Withvery great respect, I point out that I do not agree entirely with the opinion expressed by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) on this matter. It is all very well for him to say that if we are to get the best kind of administration, we must engage the best brains that are offering. The Public Service of Australia and, for that matter, of the British Empire, has proved its worth because the officers have been appointed, not by a system of selection, but as the result of competitive examination. With a. few exceptions, involving special appointments to departselected on the results of competitive examinations, and, in my opinion, that remains, the better system. It certainly represents a great improvement upon the system that formerly operated in various countries. The day is not. long past when nepotism and. privilege distinguished some appointments to positions in the Public Service. The Commonwealth Bank is in the position of a public service instrumentality. I agree with the view expressed by other Opposition members that the present method of administration in the Commonwealth Bank has functioned most effectively. The system of competitive examinationsis the best means of recruiting staff. Opposition members,, when they express these views, are not throwing-brick bats at the university graduates; but they realize that graduates have had similar opportunities to those who qualify fbr appointment to the staff of the bank. I simply suggest that it has yet to be proved that the system of selection has any greater merit than the system of competitive examination.

177,Mr Cremean (Hoddle) [4.41],"countries, have given deep consideration to the problem of whether the system of competitive examination possesses greater merits than the system of selection on the basis of an applicant's alleged qualifications, academic or otherwise. A t the risk of being tedious in this matter, I inform honourable members that I have consulted those who appear to be experts on education problems, and I should like briefly to mention their views. I quote from An Evaluation of the Tests of General Educational Development by PaulL . Dressel and John Sch mid, which is issued by the American Council of Education. One of the considered opinions of the authors of the handbook is as follows:Credit by examination has the double merit of placing the student according to ability rather than academic time served (thus preventing able students from being taught what they already know) nnd advancing such students more rapidly towards their educational goals. The method should be more widely used than at present, and should be improved by making available to students advance information about the ground to be covered nnd the nature of the examination, and by broadening the nature of the examinations where this is needed. There is considerable merit in the suggestion of the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua) that encouragement should be given to existing members of the staff of the bank to study for degrees in certain subjects and so to qualify themselves for special jobs, including economic research which the Prime Minister very rightly regards as of such importance. Support for the system of public examination is not of America, but I shall cite one more authority from that country. In a book entitled The Examination Tangle and the Way Out, which embodies'a report of the International Commission on Examinations of the New Education Fellowship, the following passage appears on page 55:A recent inquiry undertaken in the United States of America into the use of the new-type tests in connection with social science teaching, reached similar conclusions. It found that new-type examinations "" are competent to test, for academic purposes, memory of facts, a partial understanding (definition) of terms used . . . and certain logical discriminatory and ossociational powers."" That goes right to the very elements that officers of the bank. If a university underlie competitive examinations. have no wish in this chamber to make allegations of nepotism, or of other malpractices in past appointments, but I believe that, in future appointments to special positions in the bank first consideration should be given to present members of the bank staff. They should be given an opportunity to qualify for the degrees that are deemed desirable qualifications for promotion. I was for merly an oflicer of the Commonwealth Public Service and I well remember the time when the selective system was used in making appointments to the T h i r d Division, or the Clerical Division as it was then known. I know from my own experience that some men who were appointed because of academic qualifications, including in some instances, university degrees, were inferior to men who had grown up in the service and acquired their knowledge and experience the hard way; The discussion on clause 10 has been constructive. I believe that, f a r from being a modest quota, the intake of university graduates provided for in proposed section 160A could render a disservice to the bank and prejudice the rights of existing members of the bank staff. In the opinion of the Opposition the public examination system is still the best method of recruiting staff. with great interest to the assurance given by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in connection with the appointment of university graduates to the staff of the Commonwealth Bank; but I still believe that confined to the ""United States the system w ill have some dangers. The right honourable gentleman pointed out that the system was already in operation in the Commonwealth Public Service, but it does not always operate f a i r l y there. It sometimes operates to the disadvantage of the man who has had vast practical experience, but has no academic qualifications. ""We all know that, at times, when a job is vacant and those in authority wish to keep a particular person out or to get a particular person in, a certain university degree is added to the list of required qualifications. I believe . that appointments to special jobs within the Commonwealth Bank should be reserved as a right to I degree is needed, present members of the",61,Commonwealth Bank
178,Mr Costa (Banks) [ 4 . 5 0 ],"I listenedstaff should he given an opportunity to acquire it. I cannot understand the need for an alteration of the law relating to deposits made on behalf of infants. The existing savings bank regulations provide that money deposited for a child by a parent may not be withdrawn until the child has reached the age of 12 years. This amending legislation makes provision for earlier withdrawals in certain circumstances. I cannot see any need for the amendment. If the present section is to be reviewed, it should be deleted altogether and the matter left entirely to the discretion of the parents. The procedure involved in opening special accounts is considerable and requires a good deal of time on the part of the bank officers. Such accounts should not be opened unnecessarily. In regard to the appointment of university students, I endorse the remark of the honourable member for Hoddle( Mr persons other than by examination. Sub-Cremean). I think the proposal has some danger. withstanding the explanation that has been given by the Prime Minister( Mr a person who has not passed a prescribed Menzies) of the proposal to admit a certain quota of university graduates to the Commonwealth Bank, I am still doubtful about the manner in which the provision will operate. The provisions of the act relating to appointments by competitive examination were inserted in 1945. The examination system was introduced because of practices that had been adopted or were alleged to have been adopted in the appointment of bank officers. It was the general view of the man in the street that unless an applicant wore the right school tie he need not apply for appointment with the Commonwealth Bank. Applicants were required to submit references of character, diligence, and so on. Prior to 1945 I made inquiries on behalf of a lad who wished to enter the Commonwealth Bank service, and I consulted a bank oflicial about the requirements of the position. He provided the information that I sought and told me that, in many instances, a reference from a member of Parliament was helpful. However, he mentioned the name of a highly respected member of the Parliament, and said, "" Tell the boy not to get a reference from that particular member, because if his name appears on the application it will be discarded and the boy will have no opportunity to enter the service of the bank "". AlthoughI do not claim that tbe inclusion of that member's name on the application would have had that result, the possibility may have been present. In 1945 we got away from the system under which preference in appointment to the service of the bank was accorded to applicants who wore the old school tie, or who were friendly with a leading officer of the bank, by the introduction of the system of entrance by competitive examination. I believe that this is the only system that is acceptable to the people. If we want to attract applicants of higher education qualifications there must be a competitive system of appointment. The Prime Minister has referred to the existing provision in relation to the appointment of section (1.) of section 161 of the principal act providesIf at any time in any special case it apjwars expedient or desirable in tbe interests of the Bank to appoint to the Service of the Bank entrance examination, the Bank may appoint that person without examination. Additional provisions ensure necessary safeguards. I know that, because of the ramifications of the bank's activities, it needs exceptionally brilliant men in its service. Sub-section (3.) of that section readsA copy of every certificate under thc last preceding sub-section shall be laid before each House of tbe Parliament within fifteen sitting days of that House after the appointment is made. The section contains a definite safeguard that persons shall not be appointed to the bank's service only because they happen to know high officials of the bank, and there is a further safeguard that if a person with special qualifications is required, and such a person does not possess the necessary entrance examination qualification, he may be appointed to the service of the bank, but it has to be proved that a man with his qualifications is required, otherwise the door would be open to appointment by preference. If the Prime Minister would give more consideration to the clause he may see, as honourable members on this side of the chamber have seen, that, as matters",62,Commonwealth Bank

Nevertheless it needs the pattern of the plan by which the Governweapons to which I have referred in ment intends to establish a Commonwealth Trading Bank divorced entirely from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. This appears to be a deliberate attempt by the Government to weaken the whole structure of the Commonwealth Bank. Clause 18 provides that the business of the General Banking Division shall be carried on in future by the Commonwealth Trading Bank. First, this will weaken the Commonwealth Bank as a. central bank.

181,Mr Joshua (Ballarat) [5.16],"Itime to amend it. Doubtless most bonorable members bave read in one of our leading daily newspapers that the present cost of a ten-square home, with the minimum finish, is about £2,690. If a man who wishes to build a modest house of that type has to pay a deposit of a quarter of that sum, he will require a loan of £2,018. Therefore, a loan of £1,75Q will not enable many people to build houses. The Commonwealth Bank has indicated quite clearly that it requires further money to enable it to make housing loans. In the report of the bank for the year ended the 30t'h June, 1952, under the heading "" General Banking Division "", the following passage appears:This Division of the Bank operates in a similar manner to the Australian private banks . . . Its eapacity to make advances is related to deposits received from its customers plus its capital and internal funds, and it does not, and has not, borrowed from the central bank for this piirpose. The funds available to the Division in 1951-52 were not sufficient to meet all demands and: restrictions on lending were necessary during the year. The bank did not have enough money to lend to people who wished to build houses, although the maximum loan is fixed at a figure that I consider to be unduly low. The ability of the bank to lend money to such people should be increased. That could be done by the insertion in the act of a provision similar to that which relates to the Industrial Finance Department. It provides that the Treasurer may make advances to the bank for certain purposes. A provision of that kind should be inserted in the act, but, as I pointed out in my second-reading speech, the purpose of the Government is to hamstring the bank, not to allow it to -expand .as it ought to expand and as the people want it to expand. The maximum housing loan permissible is too low. TJnder the waT service homes legislation, the maximum loan has been increased to £2,750. I do not propose to enter into an argument about whether in this matter returned servicemen should be treated more favourably than ordinary members of t'he community. I say that everybody should have an opportunity to purchase the kind of house that he needs. The time is approaching when there will be -a big expansion of hank advances. There will be a great release of credit, and the banks are eager to get in on it . I say that the Commonwealth Bank should be enabled to participate largely in that expansion and should be in a position to advance reasonable sums to enable people to buy their own homes. Peoplelike to deal with the Commonwealth Bank because it requires an equity of only 25 per cent., compared with the 40 per cent, required by private banks, and the rate of interest that it charges upon loans isone-quarter per cent, lower than that charged by the private banks. If the maximum permissible housing loan were increased, many people would borrow the money that they require from the Commonwealth Bank, but the Government will not amend the act to enable them to do so. I turn to the suggestion of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) that it is impossible to make cheap loans to the people. Private trading banks are prepared to make housing loans available to their officers at 2^ per cent, interest. Therefore, it is ridiculous to say that we cannot make cheap loans to the people. ; I direct the attention of the committee to clause 18 (4.), which was expressly mentioned by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in his second-reading speech on the bill. It deals with liabilities which, apparently, in the banking world, are regarded as being of a somewhat onerous nature. The sub-clause proposes that if the General Banking Division of the Commonwealth Bank is carrying liabilities of that kind, the Commonwealth Bank, in its capacity as a central bank, may continue to carry on that portion of the business of the division after what is called the proclaimed date until such time as the Commonwealth Bank Board determines, or the Treasurer certifies that he is satisfied, that it is no longer impracticable foT that portion of the business to be -carried on by the Commonwealth Trading Bank, and that thereupon the central bank shall make such arangements as are necessary for that business to be carried on by the trading bank. The point at issue is: what facilities will the public have for access to the Commonwealth Bank, in its -central banking capacity, to negotiate loans of that kind ?",65,Bowden
182,Mr Cbe An (Melbourne Ports) [5.22].,"Tlie ordinary public does not come into direct contact witb tbe Commonwealtb Bank. It comes into contact witb tbe General Banking Division, tbe Commonwealth Savings Bank and other special agencies. Yet it is proposed that business of a certain type shall be segregated from the Commonwealth Trading Bank, which itself is to be segregated from the central bank. The Prime Minister has not given much information about how the kind of business to which the subclause refers will be undertaken in the future. It must be borne in mind that, in the past, the General Banking Division of the Commonwealth Bank has not been obsessed, as have the private banks, by profit considerations. I presume that this kind of onerous liability is the long-term type of overdraft which private banks tend to eschew. They like to clear overdrafts as quickly as possible and are not primarily interested in whether a person who seeks accommodation wants to build a house or a dog kennel. The social implications are not important to them. Sometimes local government bodies want a certain amount of accommodation for street building, for example, and apply for accommodation from the General Banking Division of the Oommonwealth Bank. Is it that kind of activity which it is intended to separate under the provision of clause 18 sub-clause (4.) of the bill? If it is, how is the private individual who can no longer secure accommodation from the local branch of the Commonwealth Bank to secure accommodation of that kind which may be very necessary to him ? This clause is vague in its definitions, surprised at the complete apathy of Goas are many other parts of this bill. The Opposition suggests that the essential unity of the Commonwealth Bank will be destroyed by this measure. .The bank will have to think what its right hand is doing in a place apart from its left hand. Not only is the General Banking Division to lose its old unity but certain classes of business are to be taken away from it and vested in the bigger body, the central bank. At least the Prime Minister or the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) might inform the committee of the type of business that is referred to in the Mr Crean. clause. Tbe Prime Minister suggested that it would be unfair from the point of view of equality of competition between private banks and the Commonwealth Bank that this onerous type of obligation should continue to be shouldered by the Commonwealth Trading Bank and he said that in tbe interests of fair competition he proposed that it should be handled by the other section of the bank. The Prime Minister's idea of fair and unfair competition seems to be very vague. I would like him to give us instances of unfair competition in which the Commonwealth Bank has engaged. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council has any further information on sub-clause (4.) of clause 18 he might enlighten the committee as to the sort of business which is considered to be onerous. If it is highly necessary business how does he propose that members of the public who seek that sort of accommodation shall be able to get it from the central bank, sheered off from the Commonwealth Trading Bank? ber really think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will be able to answer his question? case. When the committee was considering another bill it was informed that the Minister at the table had notes on various clauses and could amplify them. Consequently, I asked the Vice-President of tbe Executive Council to be so courteous as to tell one who is a little in doubt on this matter what the clause means. vernment supporters in relation to this measure. None of them seems to be interested in the working of the Commonwealth Bank. They do not appear to want it to progress. It should not be necessary for Opposition members to inform the committee of facts concerning the Commonwealth Bank which frequently seemed to have been overlooked by the Government.

It is not indebted to the central bank w it h whom its borrowing powers, like those of the Mortgage Bank Department, are limited to £1,000,000. During the year there has been a heavy demand on the facilities of the department. On the other hand, new funds were available to it in very limited amounts because of the other demands on the Savings Bank's funds. Accordingly it has been necessary to confine advances to projects of first importance. In the latter portion of the year emphasis has been laid on financing agricultural tractors and implements under hire-purchase terms.

I have the information that he requires, contained in a report that is associated with this clause. I take it that the honourable member is sincere in his desire to have this information, because he is not one of those ragtag and bobtail speakers who gets up on the other side of the chamber just for the sake of talking. I shall give him, therefore, in terms supplied by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) himself, the meaning of the clause.

186,Mr Eric J. Harrison (Wentworth,"I think that the honourable member will concede that obvious point.

In these cases the Commonwealtli Bank will, with the approval of the Treasurer, after receiving a report from the board, continue to carry on business of this kind until it is practicable for it to be taken oyer b.y the trading bank. clear, does it not ? make the position clear to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, but not to the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward). refer to the Rural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank, which was established specifically to help primary producers and others. Credits Department established the Rural Credits Development Fund to make money available for development, particularly of primary production. That is an excellent idea. I am appalled, however, at the small amount of money that tbe report shows to have been made for this specific purpose. The Commonwealth Bank's report dated the 30th June, 1951, makes the following statement in relation to rura l credits : During the year the Bank made grants from this Fund totalling £43,160, of which Australian Universities received £27,000 fbr research into such matters as cereal diseases, soil fertility and animal health, and for carrying out farm management surveys. That leaves only £16,160 for actual r u r a l development. States the average amount was only about £2,500. Last year's report makes a similar statement. It says, at page 29Grants totalling. £45,000 were made during the year from the Eural Credits Development Fund to assist various organizations in the promotion of primaryproduction. Of this amount £31,000 was made available to Australian Universities for research projects associated with rural industry. That leaves only £14,000 granted for development in rural areas. I cannot help feeling that the Commonwealth Bank Board, which tlie Government established to control the bank, has in some respects been a restrictive influence on that institution, as it was between 1924 and 1945. I shall instance one ease to show why I hold that opinion. A contractor in Hobart, whose only wovk was the clearing of new land, ditching, draining and so on, on contract, applied to the Commonwealth Bank in Hobart for a loan of £1,000 to help him to buy a second bulldozer. He has assets worth £8,000 under the R u r al Credits Department. referring to the Rural Credits Development Fund, which is designed to assist in the promotion of primary production. I saw a record of that man's assets. He could not obtain a loan of £1,000 from [5.40] I the Commonwealth Bank to enable him tc buy another bulldozer. He had so many orders from farmers in the south of Tasmaniaf o r the work of ditching, The Rural clearing, and so on that he could not carry it out with only one bulldozer. Yet he could not obtain the loan he required. That man has told many of his friends about his experience. It seems to me that by methods such as those the volume of business transacted by the bank can be restricted. I urge the bank to give more mature consideration to requests such as that to which I have referred. A f t e r all, the purpose of the Rural Credits Department of the bank is to assist primary producers, which it did not do in that instance. As long as I can remember, I have been an advocate of the Commonwealth Bank. I have tremendous respect for it because I think that it is one of the greatest institutions that this country has produced. It s story is one Divided among the six of the most thrilling in Australian history. It grieves me to think that instances of the kind to which I . have referred should be allowed to occur. If the man had been asking for £100,000 it would have been a different matter, but he required only £1,000 and possessed assets of approximately £8,000. A refusal in such circumstancesis fantastic. During the last two years,, approxir mately £88,000 has been advanced for rural development over the whole of Australia. That is not nearly sufficient.",68,Bowden

191,Mr Dtjthie,"Yes, it does. I amMany farmers wish, to expand their properties and to clear areas which have been overrun by scrub. The Rural Credits Department of the bank is designed, to assist primary producers to carry out such work. I bring this matter forward not in any carping, critical way, because, as I have said, I am a supporter of the bank and try to secure business for it whenever I can, but because it is discouragingHo rne and to otber people if the banlt conducts its affairs in the way that I have mentioned. of the most significant features' of this debate is the silence of those who are selling out. the Commonwealth Bank by means of the legislation we are now discussing. That silence indicates the complete contempt in which the Government, holds this matter. Only a short time agp the Minister who was. then in charge of the bill was obliged to read an answer which was unintelligible to most honourable members. Uow he has left the chamber, presumably to find out what the answer meant.. At the moment, the Minister for Social Services, ( Mr Apparently it is proposed to dispense Townley). is in charge of the measure, and I suggest that, although the honourable gentleman may know all about social services, bis knowledge of the clauses of this bill is strictly limited. It is important that the Minister at the table should know what is being discussed, because I have some pertinent questions t© ask concerning clause 11 and several otherclauses. If answers: of the kind to which I have already referred are to be given to my -questions', they may as well not be answered. I should like to see in tlie chamber the honourable member for Maearthur ( Mr Jeff Bate), the rebel who to-day. withdrew an amendment he had circulated which sought to remove the Commonwealth Bank completely. should also like, to hear the honourable member forMackellar( Mr Wentworth) discussing clause 11, and the views of the honourable member for Mitchell( Mr appointments. Wheeler) on clause 13. In addition, I should like to hear what the honourable member for St. George( Mr Graham) has' to say about clause 15 of the hill. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable gentleman will tell, us what he thinks. in this bill, Mr Temporary Chairman, but the Opposition is here to present its ease, in a constructive way. So far, not one back-bencher on the Government side of the. committee has supported the proposals that have been put forward. Is it not right that. I should criticize the supporters of the Government who sit as silent as rabbits suffering from myxomatosis? Clause 11 provides, thatiSection one hundred and! seventy-five, of the. Principal Act is amended by omitting subsection (,3.). SuVsection (3'.)of the principal' aet provides thatThe Chairman of the Disciplinary. Appeal: Board shall be. a person who is or has. been a Police, Sti.pcndary or Special Magistrate ot a State, or Territory of the Commonwealth. Why should, that provision be removed from the legislation? It seems to me that that is a fair question to address to the Minister at the table, or to any member of the Government.. withl independent chairmen.' Although that appears to be so, honoraible members opposite refuse to rise^ and defend the proposal. What is the explanation of the Minister for Social Services regarding this proposed important change in the strwsturei of the bank? I challenge all. members of the Governmenit to explain why it is intended to dispense with the services of such reputable citizens as magistrates. The refusal of the Government to explain or defend that proposal is in keeping with its policy to pack the administration with"" yes-men "" who support only the Liberal party or the Australian Oountry party: This is the pattern feat is being followed with I appointments all over the country. That comment applies to appointments' to the Commonwealth Court of ConciKation and Arbitration, as well as to other Clause 12 of the bill providesSection one-, hundred and. seventy-eight of the Principal Act is. amended by omitting, from sub-section (1..) tlie word's "" , as soon as practicable after the thirtieth day of June in each year, prepare a list of all officers' in the Service of tiie Bank on that date"" and; indenting in their stead the words "" from time to",69,Bowden

193,Mr Daly,"I appseciate your interesttime, and whenever the Treasurer so directs, prepare a list of all officers in the Service of the bank."" WLat is the reason behind this proposed sinister change in the administration of the bank? Does the Government wish these lists to be kept up to date so that it may see which members of the staff are supporters of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party? Does it want to pack the bank staff with persons recruited only from the wealthy and influential sections of the community? Does it intend to keep a dossier on every jnember of the staff, so that it may check up on-him? Does it require such a list to check the political views of members of the bank staff, or does it wish to have staff members who will go out and fight for government policy, irrespective of their personal qualifications? my own interpretation on the proposed change and conclude that the Government wishes to build up a bank with a staff of administrators, and rank and file employees, who are prepared to do anything the Government wishes, irrespective of whether it is in the interests of the bank or not. If that is not the correct interpretation, Social Services( Mr Townley), who is now present, explain what it is. Or let some intelligent member of the Government, if one can be found, tell honourable members the meaning of the changes. Not one honourable member on the Government side knows anything about this measure. It' was presented to the Parliament before the supporters of the Government had even considered it in their caucus room. They sit here to-day like a collection of puppets, giving lip-service to the policy laid down in the measure which has been condemned by amendments that have been placed before the committee and which is opposed behind the scenes by the vast majority of Government supporters. You, Mr Temporary Chairman, are an intelligent man who occupies an important position in this chamber. Surely you must realize how unanswerable are the questions that I have asked to-day. But they are the same questions as are being asked all over the country. allotment of time does not permit me to Immediately before the sitting was susconsider separately all the clauses under pended, the committee was treated to a Mr Daly. review, and to ask pertinent' questions on each one. I could ask the Minister for Social Services certain questions, but perhaps he would only smile, as he is doing now, and suggest that he will answer the questions later. The Minister for External Territories ( Mr Hasluck), who is also present, would not know anything about a bank. Therefore, the Government representation here has not improved since the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) left the chamber. Now let me consider the second row of honourable members on the Government benches. First there is the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Lawrence). Then there is the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer). What answer has that honourable member, I place who is a militant member of the Government parties, to the questions that I have asked? The next' honourable member is the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Freeth). He comes from far-off Western Australia, but he could not answer me because he is not even interested in the problems that I am discussing. That is because he is merely a yes-man. Now let the Minister for we could look farther back) along the Government benches ' The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order!

He is a mathematical expert, and perhaps he is able to tell us something about clause 14 of the bill. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member's time has expired.

197,"Unfortunately, My Mr Cramer (Bennelong) [8.0]","speecli by the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) who obviously was trying to talk out time. He charged honourable menibers on this side of the committee with knowing nothing about the clauses of the bill, but it was obvious that he himself was ignorant of their meaning. The debate has been extremely interesting up to this point. The only apparent weakness has been the floundering of the Opposition in its search for something to say. Honourable members on the Opposition side have repeated the same story like parrots As a matter of fact, I believe that the debate has been used by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) as a. testing ground in his search for a Treasurer to fill that post in any prospective government that he hopes to lead. He has been trying out many of his supporters. First a trial was given to the honestablished. That is a very important orable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr function because without it there would Crean), but he appeared to fail miserably. The right honourable gentleman gave Several trials to the honourable memher for Ballarat( Mr Joshua) because he was at oue time a banker, but he also failed to make the grade. Tbe Leader of the Opposition then gave the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) a chance, but his display last night showed porary Chairman. Could the honourable inember for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer) be directed to give his attention to the bill? The TEMPOBABY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Bowden) -Order! I shall watch that. debate as the battle for budding Treasurers. The honourable meniber for Melbourne appears to have fallen down on his task completely. Last night he displayed much bitterness in his speech. Finally, it appears that the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) has been chosen to lead the Opposition attack. No doubt it is very difficult for the Leader of the Opposition to find a prospective Treasurer and at the same time cure the differences between himself and his deputy, the honourable member for Melbourne. This afternoon the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr banks. That is utter nonsense. The GoWard) let the cat out of the bag. He, too, is an aspirant for the treasurership and completes the team of possibilities for the office that the Labour party has had on display in this debate. I shall now revert to the bill because honourable members on the Opposition side have indicated that they would like to hear something from me on the matter. The committee is now considering clauses 11 to 18 of the bill. Almost all those clauses relate to minor details of the measure and are consequential upon the main principles that have already been decided, apart from the schedules which are very important to the measure. Clause 18 is a vital part of the bill because itrelates to the handing over of the physical assets and liabilities from the general, division of the Commonwealth Bank to the Commonwealth Trading Bank which is to be not be a trading bank. Through this clause, an opportunity is presented for the new Gommonwealth Trading Bank actually to get into action. At the date of the proclamation, it will be legally entitled to, and will, in fact, carry out all the functions of a trading bank. Through clause 18, the Government will bring to fruition a promise that it made to the electors. Moreover, I rise to orcier, Mr Temthat promise was approved by the electors though the Opposition would not admit it in any shape or form. This is the physical culmination of the Government's proposals. By banding over the assets of the General Division of the Commonwealth Bank to the new Commonwealth Trading Bank, the Government will be establishing the basis of fair competition between tbe Commonwealth Trading Bank and the private trading banks. I know that there is some difference of opinion upon this matter, but all the controls and directions that are to be used by the Central Bank apply equally to the new Commonwealth Trading Bank and to the private trading banks. In future, the people will be afforded an opportunity for fair trading and banking practice in every branch of banking service. This Government has been charged with acting at the dictation of the private vernment has acted in the best interests",71,Bowden
198,Mr Dalv,,72,Bowden
199,Mr Cramer,"I would describe theof the people -of Australia without fear or favour. The private banks have said that the -Government has not gone far enough. They, like many people in Australia, are suffering from the fear of what might happen to the banking structure if , by any chance, the Australian Labour party should gain control of the tneasmry bench. If the private banks and the people were quite sure that the Labour party would not be returned to office as a government, nobody would be worried. The Government has gone as -far as it .can go at this stage to provide for fair competition between the two types of banks. That is fair and proper. So far as the people are concerned, the Commonwealth Bank will still be a government trading bank and the property of the people of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition endeavoured to prove that the Government was carrying out some scheme to dispose of the .people's assets. The Commonwealth Trading Bank will still be a government bank, and the Labour party's view on the matter is inconsistent and ridiculous. The honourable member for Melbourne has suggested that the Government is trying to undermine the Commonwealth Bank. That is nonsense. As the honourable member for Melbourne knows, the bill contains a clause which states that the Commonwealth Trading Bank must develop and expand its business. The Leader of the Opposition placed emphasis upon the change of name of the bank as though it was of some great importance. The name that the Government proposes to give to the bank is clear to the people. It will be a trading bank and it will be called the Commonwealth Trading Bank. If I am any judge of business and commerce, that name will be an asset to the bank and helpful to the people. The Opposition's criticism on that point is paltry. The truth is that the people cannot trust the Labour party with the banks. The Labour party's record in that regard is indelibly printed upon the minds of the people. If it gets a chance, the Labour party will nationalize the banking structure of the nation. It tried to do so in 1945 and only failed because of the findings of the High Court of Australia, first in relation to the direction Ur. Cramer. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer) is one of the disappointed aspirants for ministerial oflice in the Menzies Government He thought he was in on one occasion, but the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) could not see any virtues in him-and for once the right honourable gentleman was right. The honourable member, who is a reject in his own party for ministerial advancement, tried to satirize my colleagues, the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean). They may be treasurers of Australia one day, that is more than he will be, and they will make very good treasurers if they are ever given that office. This bill is intended to erode the Commonwealth Bank. The tories of other days did not want the bank, and they voted against its establishment in 1911. The bank, in all its departments and by its control of the note issue, has made £1,000,000 in profits which, if there had been no Commonwealth Bank, would have gone to the shareholders of the private banks, many of whom live overseas. Their only interest in Australia is the interest of a person who is exploiting another countiy for his own benefit. The honourable member for Bennelong directed particular attention to clause 18 which provides the machinery by which hobbles are to be placed on the bank and the separation of the Commonwealth Trading Bank from the central bank is to be achieved. The purpose of the Government in establishing the Commonwealth Trading Bank is to make it more diflicult for the Commonwealth Bank to trade. The Commonwealth Trading Bank will be relegated to the back portion of every Oommonwealth Bank premises in Australia. We are reverting to the bad old days from 1911 t'o 1945 when the Commonwealth Bank was not allowed to compete with the private trading banks. A gentleman's agreement was made between Sir Denison Miller and the private banks and after the Commonwealth Bank Board.",72,Bowden

The 1945 act, which honourable members opposite did not want and which some of them very vehemently criticized, was intended to make the Commonwealth Bank an active competitor with the private banking institutions. Government supporters are not prepared to stand up and say that they want to destroy the competitive power of the Commonwealth Bank. Now they are converts. They say that they want to support the Commonwealth Bank inits competition with the private trading banks, but they have only allowed nineteen branches of the bank to beestablished since the Government came intooffice three years ago.. Erom the hypocritical pretence contained in all the speeches made by honourable members opposite it is obvious that their real desire is not tp protect the people's bank but to advance the cause of the private banks. I should like to hear the honourable member for St. George( Mr Graham) repeat verbatim the article that he contributed to the Sydney Daily Mirror in June of last year, in which he went much further than did the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) in the proposed amendment he circulated but failed to move to-day. I should like to that it had to mutilate the Audit Act, the hear the honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Wheeler) speak his piece again, if be is not afraid of the party whip.

The depredations of the money power in Australia over the years are too terrible to contemplate. Chairman, are old enough to remember what thc private banks did in my State and yours in 1S93. You will recall how they turned the people out into tbe streets; how they closed their doors and thousands of people were ruined; how many good people were driven to suicide; and how old-established families, whose forebears turned the first soil in tliis country, were driven off their lands. that the Parliament cannot nationalize These things can happen again if there is no Commonwealth Bank in existence. Because we believe in safeguarding the people's bank we are opposing the passage of all these clauses. The ineffectual and fatuous speech of the honourable member for Bennelong did not impress even his own electors! After having heard his remarks, they will be benighted if they again elect bim as their representative in the Parliament. The schedules to the bill make very interesting reading. One would need the assistance of a panel of Queen's Counsel to help one to search the various acts which this bill seeks to amend. The Government has not been fair to the committee, because it has failed to set out clearly the meaning of the amendments proposed to be made under the measure. Tbe TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) has just repeated a speech wbich he has made over and over again in this chamber. It gave me the impression that I was listening to an old gramophone record. His speech to-night varied only insofar as the honourable member addressed certain of his remarks directly to the people of South Australia and Queensland where State elections will be held next Saturday. He merely indulged in party political propaganda. He invited Government supporters to speak their minds on this issue and to say what they really thought about it. We certainly know what tbe honourable member liimself thinks about it. He is a dyed-in-the-wool socialist and his only aim as a member of the Parliament is to work for the introduction of socialism in Australia. In that aim he is supYou, Mr Temporary ported by nine-tenths of the members of the Opposition. This afternoon, the honourable inember for East Sydney( Mr Ward) declared that it was still the definite aim of the Australian Labour party to nationalize the private trading banks. On tbe otber hand, some of his colleagues have said that the people need not be afraid of the Australian Labour party on that score because the High Court and the Privy Council have ruled the private banks because they are prevented by the Constitution from so doing. That is on a par with the attitude of a man who would say, "" I would rob that bank if only the bars were not too strong to allow me to break into it and the caretaker were not watching "". What opinion could one hold of a citizen who would adopt that atitude and what kind of a political force can a party be which says that it will not nationalize tbe private trading banks simply because it cannot do so under the Constitution? Members of the Australian Labour party, if they had their way, would nationalize the private banks to-morrow. The honourable member for Melbourne is the leader of those honourable members who think along such lines. Therefore, I say to the people who may be listening to the broadcast of these proceedings that if they desire to avoid such a catastrophe they must be careful at any election to vote for candidates of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party. TJnder this measure the proposed Commonwealth Trading Bank will enjoy the same trading opportunities as are now enjoyed by the private banks. Government supporters stand for fair competition in banking as tbey do in",74,Bowden
205,Mr Calwell,i l shall say some,75,Bowden
206,Mr Tuenbull (Mallee) [8.20],"respect of airlines or any otlier trading activities in -which governmental and semi-governmental bodies engage. But the members of the Australian Labour party desire to build up the Commonwealth Bank so that when the time is opportune a Labour government can by legislation within the ambit of the Constitution establish socialism in this country. I have heard the honourable member for Melbourne say on at least four previous occasions in this chamber that if a party obtains control of the banks it will be enabled to obtain control of every activity in the country. Therefore, nationalization of the private banks is one of the main objectives of the Australian Labour party which advocates as a plank in its platform tbe socialization of industry, production, distribution and exchange. At present, within the organization of the Commonwealth Bank the General Banking Division is linked with the central bank and that arrangement gives to it the opportunity to enagage in all kinds of business in which very often the private trading banks are unable to participate. Tbe purpose of this bill is to place the Commonwealth Bank on the same footing as the private trading banks, and that is why the Labour Opposition is vigorously opposing it. However', fair-minded people will agree that the bill is a step in the right direction. The Government has introduced it in order to honour the pledge which the present Government parties gave to the people during the last general election campaign. tunately, many people have short memories, and require to be reminded that, but for the limitations imposed upon the Parliament by the Constitution, the Chifley Labour Government would have succeeded in nationalizing the private banks. Therefore, right thinking people will see in this measure a means of combating the Australian Labour party in its endeavour to establish socialism in Australia. Members of the Opposition never cease to advocate the doctrines of socialism. However, the fact remains that in every country in which socialism has been tried, even partially, it has proved to be a failure and has resulted in the reduction of standards of living. Australia would suffer a similar calamity if our people permitted the Australian Labour party to establish socialism in this country. ""Without exception, members of the Opposition who have made visits overseas during the last few years have declared on their return that Australia is the greatest country in the world. Although this is a young country, it has attained economic strength mainly on the basis of private enterprise. That fact alone should convince everybody that our future welfare will depend upon the encouragement of private enterprise. honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) had much to say about socialism and described members of the Opposition as socialists. He and his colleagues are monopolists, because this measure aims to give to the private banks a monopoly in banking. In reply to the statements that he made about Labour's desire to nationalize the banks, I need make only two points which are as clear as crystal for the world to see and understand. The first of them is that both the High Court and the Privy Council have decided that this Parliament, under the Constitution, cannot nationalize the private banks. Those decisions of those tribunals are binding upon this Parliament. No government can nationalize the banks until the people at a referendum approve of an alteration of the Constitution to give such power to the Parliament. Secondly, the only mandate Unforwhich the present Government parties can claim to have received from the people with respect to banking relates to the provisions of the Banking Act 1945 which were the cause of the recent double dissolution. The issue in that instance was the proposal of the present Government parties to re-establish the Commonwealth Bank Board. I take this opportunity to protest against the application of the ""guillotine"". The Government is making a farce of proceedings in the Parliament. Mr Deputy Chairman. I submit that the honourable member is not in order in discussing the application of the "" guillotine "", which was the subject of a decision by the House earlier to-day.",75,Bowden

208,Mr Eric J. Harrison,"I rise to order,The TEMPOEAEY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr ing Act, the Hide and Leather Industries Clarey) will not be in order in proceeding along those lines. out is that the committee is required to complete by 11 p.m. its consideration of clauses .11 to 18 and the five schedules to the hill. The first schedule covers five and a half pages of the bill, contains transact their banking business with the amendments to 85 sections of the principal act, and makes no fewer than 101 amendments in all. The second schedule covers one and a half pages, deals with proposed re-numberings, and relates to 198 amendments. The third schedule deals with sixteen additional amendments of the principal act consequential on the re-numbering, and the fourth and fifth schedules' amend five other acts which are quite distinct from the Commonwealth Bank Aet. The amendments to the other acts contain a most extraordinary provision about which I shall make some comment later. The point that I emphasize now is that honourable members are called upon to deal in an extremely limited period with all those matters, as well as with clause 18, which establishes the machinery for the transfer of assets and liabilities from the wealth Bank. That proposal does not General Division of the Commonwealth Bank to tbe proposed Commonwealth Trading Bank. The Government is not fair to ihonorable members when it expects them to' give such hasty consideration to all those amendments to a most important act. during this debate, we have been told that the Government honestly and sincerely intends to encourage the expansion of the business of the Commonwealth Bank. I should like to direct the attention of honourable members to amendments incorporated in the fourth and fifth schedules to the bill, which amend acts of Parliament apart from the Commonwealth Bank Act. It is clearly shown that the Government's policy is to take business from the Commonwealth Bank. I refer specifically to the amendments contained in the fourth schedule. As the result of the amendments to the Commonwealth Bank Act, amendments must be made to the Audit Act, the BroadcastAct, the Re-establishment and Employment Act, and the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act. The Broadcasting Act, the Hide and Leather Industries Act, and the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act now provide that the authorities concerned shall Commonwealth Bank. Those acts are to be amended so as to provide that those authorities may bank with the Commonwealth Bank or open an account or accounts with any other prescribed bank. This Government professes to desire to expand the activities of the Commonwealth Bank, yet provision is made to enable .certain public authorities to bank with private financial institutions. In other words, those public authorities are to be encouraged to transfer tbeir business from the Commonwealth Bank to the private banking institutions. The Government has assured us that it intends to expand the operations of the Commonwealth Bank, and place it in a position .to compete, fairly with the private banks, yet statutory power is given to certain public authorities to take their business away from the Oommonsatisfy me that Government supporters are as sincere as they have professed in this debate. Clause 11 of this bill reads as follows::Seotion one hundred :and sevienty-five of the Principal Act is amended by omitting subsection (3.). Section 175 of the principal act establishes the Disciplinary Appeal Board. Machinery is provided to enable appeals of bank officers to be heard against their dismissal, or reduction of status. The chairman of the board shall be a stipendiary or special magistrate of a State or territory of tlie Commonwealth. I protest against the decision of the Government to repeal section 175. At no stage of the proceedings has any Minister attempted to explain the reason for it.

The Disciplinary Appeal Board was established for obvious reasons. It is essential to the maintenance of industrial harmony that the chairman of sue' 1 a board shall be accepted as impartial. Hitherto the appointment of a magistrate has been deemed by the respective parties to meet the position. The Minister in charge of the bill has not informed us whether the Governor of the Bank, the Bank Board or the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association has been consulted in this matter. I hope that he will rectify that omission. -Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [8.38],-The extraordinary remarks of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr opposite for a specific purpose. It is Clarey) compel me to intervene at this stage. I always listen with great respect to his speeches, because I believe that he is always sincere. I do not say that he is insincere this evening, but I consider that he is completely ill-informed. That is most unfortunate. The honourable gentleman has complained about the limited time that is available to him to discuss various provisions of the bill. The fact is that the debate nearly collapsed on several occasions this afternoon because members of the Labour party were not in their places. The honourable gentleman, who was not in the chamber earlier, now complains that he has not sufficient time to enable him to discuss the provisions of the bill adequately. I shall examine some of his statements. He has said that the Government seeks to -establish a monopoly in banking, and to hand over the whole of the trading bank activities of the Commonwealth Bank to the private banks. He has sought to produce facts and figures in support of his argument. Let us examine his submissions, because the proof of the pudding is in the eating. That cliche is old, but it is still effective when one can produce the exact figures. The Government is not establishing a monopoly for the trading banks. Deposits in the General Banking Division of the Commonwealth Bank increased from £80,200,000 in 1949 to £120,700,000 in December, 1952. That is the test. Do those figures indicate that the expansion of the Commonwealth Bank is being restricted? Do they indicate that we are directing business'away from the General Banking Division to the private trading banks? In December, 1949, the total deposits of the General Banking Division and of the major private banks amounted to £995,000,000. By December of last year, the total had reached £1,268,000,000. The increase of the General Banking Division's share of the overall deposits from 8.1 per cent, to 9.5 per cent., represented a relative increase in the division's deposits of 18 per cent. Those facts speak for themselves and require no elaboration by me. They prove conclusively that these ready statements. and charges are made by honourable members quite true that the Government expected this bill to be opposed. It is equally true thai, by means of the 1945 legislation, the then Labour Government sought to strangle the private banks. In 1947, honourable members opposite decided that the objective could be obtained more quickly by nationalizing the private banks. Unfortunately for them, the nationalization legislation was rejected by the High Court and ultimately by the Privy Council. But that was not the end of Labour's endeavours. The Chifley Government again resorted to the slow strangulation process. But foT this Government's amending legislation, the special accounts of the trading banks with the Commonwealth Bank which represents approximately £545,000,000 or more than half the deposits of the trading banks, could, under a Labour government, be called up by the Commonwealth Bank, thus forcing the private banks out of business. According to the statement of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) to-day, Labour is still pledged to the nationalization of banking. We must not let ourselves be hoodwinked.",77,Bowden
212,Mr Eric J. Harrison Xwentworth,"I come now to the other matter raised by the honourable"" member for Bendigo. He claimed that, according to the Fourth Schedule, steps were being taken to prevent government instrumentalities from dealing with the Commonwealth Trading Bank. said that government instrumentalities were being given the right to go to a private bank. virtually the same thing. I remind the honourable member that there is a. principle associated with this matter. In areas where there is no Oommonwealth Bank, government instrumentalities will have the right to deal with a private bank. Take for instance the Hide and Leather Industries Board. The amendment of the Hide and Leather Industries Act set out in the Fourth Schedule is as follows:Section 28 -Omit from sub-section (1.) "" a n account at .the Commonwealth Bank of Aust r a l i a "" , insert "" a t the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and may open and maintain at any other prescribed bank, an account or accounts."" I emphasize the words "" any other prescribed bank"". What did honourable members opposite do when they were in power? I shall give one illustration. I could duplicate it or triplicate it if necessary, but my one example should be enough to show how completely insincere is the approach of the Opposition to this matter. PerhapsI should not say that about tbe honourable member for Bendigo. I shall say instead that he is ill informed. Take, for instance, the Whaling Industry Act of 1949-on e of the Labour party's babies. Section 22 of that act providesThe Commission shall open and maintain an account or accounts with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and may open and maintain an account or accounts w it h such other bank or banks as the Treasurer approves. We say "" prescribed bank "" ; the Labour party's view was "" Let us put it in the hands of the Treasurer. Let him say whether an instrumentality can go to this bank or to that bank."" Labour's provision is as wide as the sea. Yet honourable members opposite have the temerity to come here and criticize tbe reference in this measure to a "" prescribed bank"". I do not question the sincerity of tbe honourable member for Bendigo, but I say again that he is ill-informed, and surely it is a heinous offence for an. honourable member of his calibrea member of the Labour party executive-to be ill-informed ahout a matter that he bas to debate with honourable members on this side of the chamber. The impassioned appeals of I the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) to the electors would fall on very deaf ears if the people knew the lengths to which the Opposition is prepared to go in an endeavour to create misunderstandings in the community. Time after time the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has failed in his attempts to represent himself as a financial genius. Time after time, he has pulled in his deputy, the honourable member for Melbourne, to get him out of his financial difiiculties; and what a horrible crash that honourable member bas come! The people of Australia are very concerned indeed at the prospect of having the honourable member for Melbourne as Treasurer, should a Labour government bfc returned to office. Ranging farther afield, the Leader of the Opposition dragged in the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser), who is not present to-night. His crash was as horrible as that of the honourable member for Melbourne. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) was then called upon for assistance. He, too, failed to make the grade. We all know, of course, that the honourable member for Melbourne offended his leader recently and was disciplined. The result was that a mere tyro, the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke), has led the Opposition during the committee stages of the bill. He has sought by his ponderous declarations to convince us that he may be the next financial genius to control the Treasury of the Commonwealth. We have pledged ourselves to bring about fair competition between the Commonwealth Trading Bank and the private trading banks. We shall do everything possible to prevent the dead hand of socialism from touching the financial resources of this nation. The greedy fingers of the socialist must never again be allowed to dig into the coffers of our Treasury because in socialism there lies only stagnation.",78,Bowden

221,Mr Peters,"There is nothing-amount of advances, so does the business of the bank expand. A person who obtains an advance from the central banking organization and deposits the amount in a private banking institution will lessen the power of the Commonwealth Bank and give to the private banking institution the power to grant advances of probably ten times the amount of his deposit. The Government is endeavouring by unfair means to destroy the competition that is offered by the Commonwealth Bank to the private banking institutions of this country. There is not the -slightest doubt about that. Last night the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) quoted evidence that was given before the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems in this country in 1936 and 1937, which showed that, under anti-Labor administrations, the Commonwealth Bank did not seek to undertake advance business at the expense of other banking institutions. In other words, it did not enter into competition to obtain trade that was being carried on, or might be carried on by other banking institutions, but waited for the trade to come to it. As a result of the provisions of the clauses that we are now considering, the Government will induce the present customers of the Commonwealth Bank to transfer their business to the private banking institutions. Ultimately, perhaps not next week, but in years to come, if the anti-Labour parties continue to govern this country, the Commonwealth Bank must become merely an instrument to buttress the private banking institutions. The Commonweatlh Bank will not then be, as it should be, a bank working in competition with other banks to serve industrialists, manufacturers, primary producers, and the general: public, but merely an instrument to enable the private banking institutions to utilize not only the money that goes into the banking institutions of this country, but also the community credit and community capital in order to carry on their"" financial business, which, after all, is nationalization by prominent members of the exploitation of the people of this country. The TEMPOEAEY Order!. The honourable member's time has expired. Mr Peters. Honourable members opposite have been hard put to it to find an argument against the bill, because they are practically forbidden to disclose their own policy, or the fact that they have no policy at the moment. They have been forced to resort to the implication that this Government has some undisclosed or secret intention. But they have very little evidence in that connection to fal] back on. It is very easy for them to suggest that there are improper motives behind this measure. Although a man may go tp church every Sunday, make large contributions to charity, and do everything that he should do, a section of the people may still decry him and say that he has some ulterior motive. The Opposition has contended that we would destroy the Commonwealth Bank, despite the fact that under this Government the deposits and advances of that bank have increased, and that it has been our stated policy to strengthen the bank by allowing it to trade side by side with, and in fair competition,, with the trading banks. All the actions of this Government since it has been in office show that it has tried to carry out that policy. Honourable members opposite have had to go back to the early years of this century in their efforts to find some basis for their vague allegations of improper motives. This bill would not have been needed, in view of the report of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems in 1936, had it not been for the stated policy of the Labour party to nationalize t.he banking system. Honourable members opposite still support that policy. member deny that nationalization of banking is a part of the Labour party's poliey? I acknowledge that there is some confusion amongst honourable members at the moment, because during these discussions we have heard three different pronouncements on the subject of the Opposition..

Furthermore, not to-night to say that the Labour party honourable member for Melbourne, who of the Opposition, has stated exactly what the private banks if it secures another opportunity to put its plans into effect. Clause 18, which is the vital clause of of guarding against .the intention of the Labour party to drive the private banks Mr W. M . BOURKE (Fawkner) the bank as a general banking organization. Secondly, it will weaken it as a central bank. Tbe bill will not effect a complete separation of the trading activican have widespread home-ownership in ties of the bank from the remainder of its activities, but various supporters of the Government have declared that the measure does not go far enough. They have clearly shown that they regard it only as a step towards the complete separation of trading activities from the Oommonwealth Bank proper. vigorously oppose the measure because we are convinced that a complete separation would seriously weaken the whole structure of the Commonwealth Bank. I direct my remarks now to clause 13 as it applies to the sections of the prinquate sum of £1,750 should be amended, cipal act which relate to the issue of housing loans by the Commonwealth Bank. The report of the Commonwealth Bank for 1951-52 pointed out that, through its various departments, the bank had advanced a total of £19,000,000 for housing purposes during year. though, in view of the dimculty that people experience when they try to obtain finance for housing purposes, I hope that the bank will not be complacent about the matter but will make every effort to increase the volume of its advances for housing purposes. The sections of the principal act whicb deal witb bousing loans urgently require amendment. They limit Credit Foncier advances by tbe Commonwealth Bank to a maximum amount of £1,750. It is common knowledge that it. is almost impossible to buy a new house in Australia to-day for less than £3,000. The act provides that the bank shall give preference, in its lending policy, to the financing of new houses. That means that a buyer, who must pay at least £3,000 for a house, can obtain only £1,750 from the Commonwealth Bank and must provide a balance of not less than £1,250. It is virtually impossible for the average man to save such an amount to-day. We should encourage home ownership throughout the community. own home. I do not like all these housing commission settlements in the various States where tenants are required to pay rentals of about £3 10s. a week: Those housing settlements are necessary Mr W. M. Bourke. to a certain degree, but I would prefer the people in them to be paying £3 10s. a week on their own houses. Before we this community, two nnanciai requirements must be satisfied. First, finance should be made available on a very moderate deposit. It is virtually impossible for the average family man to save enough money to pay a substantial deposit upon a house. I believe that the average We decent young Australian should be given an opportunity to buy his own house if he can pay a deposit of £100. I suggest to the committee that the section of the act that limits advances by the Commonwealth Bank-which , after all, is the people's bank-to the totally inadeand that tbe Commonwealth Bank should be empowered to make advances of up to £3,000 to people who are able to pay a. deposit of £100. If that were done, the advantages and benefits of home-ownership would be brought within the reach of that every young family man in Australia. That is a creditable record, The second requirement is that money advanced to people to buy their own houses should be subject to a very low rate of interest. It is especially necessary that the interest rate should be lower when the sum advanced is fairly substantialand it is necessary to make substantial advances to-day owing to high building costs. At the present time, the Commonwealth Bank charges interest at the rate of 4£ per cent, upon money advanced through its Credit Foncier Department, and also upon money advanced to cooperative housing societies, which are doing magnificent work by bringing the means of home-ownership to thousands of people. I suggest to the committee that 4^ per cent, is too high an interest rate to charge people who are buying their own houses through either Credit Foncier loans or co-operative housing societies. The Oommonwealth Bank recognizes that there is a difference between a person Every family should own its who borrows money to buy his own house and one who borrows money for commercial purposes. It charges interest at the rate of 4£ per cent, upon money advanced through its General Banking Division upon an ordinary overdraft basis, and at the rate of 4^ per cent, upon money advanced to purcliase houses. I say that the difference between the two rates is not than the private banking interests, has large enough, that the bank should recognize the principle of differential interest rates, and that the rate charged upon money advanced on an ordinary overdraft basis should not be used as a criterion for the determination of the rate charged upon Joans made for the purchase of houses. There is a considerable difference between the two types of borrowing, and that difference should be recognized by a substantial difference between the rates of interest. When a businessman borrows, say, £5,000, upon wbich he is charged 4f per cent, or 5 per cent, interest, the money that he pays in interest is a deductable item for income tax purposes. It is one of the normal and legitimate expenses of his business. In reality, the loan costs him very little, because his interest payments are entered upon the expenditure side of his business accounts. For him, such a loan is a cheap way of getting the use of capital resources. But a young man who borrows money to buy his house is not entitled to treat his interest payments upon the loan as a deductable item for income tax purposes. He has to pay that interest from his own pocket without receiving any benefit by way of deduction. It is the duty of governments in this country and of the people's bank, tbe Commonwealth Bank, to recognize the necessity to encourage and assist people to buy their own houses. One way to do that is to make money available to home-seekers at a rate of interest which, in my opinion, should be 2 per cent. The Commonwealth Bank makes housing loans to its own employees at, I understand, 2\ per cent, interest. If the bank is able to do that for its own employees, why should it not do the same for the general public? The TEMPOBABY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. bill proposes certain amendments of the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945. I have not heard one member of the Government parties give a satisfactory explanation of why those amendments should be made. What section of the community, other asked for any alteration of the act? I have not heard any honourable gentleman opposite say that they have received such requests from primary producers, industrialists or any other section of the people. It has been said that the purpose of the bill is to ensure that the Commonwealth Bank will compete fairly with the private trading banks. I believe it to be vitally important that the people of this country, through their Government, should control the finances of the country. I feel that to-night we are going back 30 years. After tbe Commonwealth Bank had been established, it flourished and rendered great services to the primary producers of Australia, but in 1924 a Country party Treasurer crippled that great institution. The intentions of the Government parties at the present time are perhaps better disguised than they were in 1924, and the attack upon the Commonwealth Bank is perhaps a little more subtle than it was then. In those days, the Government parties were a little more outspoken. They said openly that they intended to make the Commonwealth Bank a prop for the private banks, so that primary producers and industrialists could no longer get financial accommodation from it. That will be the effect of this bill. After the Commonwealth Bank Act of 1945 came into operation, thousands of people availed themselves of the services of the Commonwealth Bank. I do not think that any primary producer in the Mallee was averse to accepting a loan from the bank to enable him to buy a tractor or a bulldozer. Finance for purchases of that kind was made available by the Commonwealth Bank at a low rate of interest, but primary producers could not get similar accommodation at all from the private banks. Nevertheless, to-night the members of the Australian Country party are supporting a measure that will take primary producers back to the bad old days. I understand what people in the country areas think about the Commonwealth Bank. I know that they have great confidence in it, and I warn the Government that they will not tolerate any interference with it. Honourable",81,Chaieman Have Us Believe That He Wants The Labour
225,Mr Mcleod (Wannon) [9.15],"Thisgentlemen opposite may have scared the people by saying that the Labour party would take their savings if it nationalized the banks, bat the people have been scared much more by this attempt,, on. behalf of the private banks, to cripple the Commonwealth Bank. Primary producers know that bad seasons may come and that the prices of primary products may fall. Therefore, they want the CommonwealthBank to remain strong and active, because they know that in bad times they will be able to obtain from it, on reasonable terms-, financial accommodation to enable them to carry on. They know also that in bad times the private banks would call in tbeir mortgages, as tbey did before. The existence of the Commonwealth Bank gives them a feeling of security, because tbey know that its objective is, not to crush them, but to help them to carry on. I am amazed that members of the Australian Country party are supporting, this measure, which will help to place control of the finances of tliis country in the hands nothing to do with nationalization. That of private money manipulators. The honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) said that private enterprise built the nation. In 1892 many farmers lost their land in the bank crash. That was how private enterprisesafeguarded the economy of the country at that time. The Government had to come to the rescue. Why has the Australian Country party supported a measure such as this? The reason is obvious. Its election campaigns have been financed by banking interests. If people are able to obtain money from the Commonwealth Bank at an interest rate of 4 per cent, they will not seek to borrow from the private banks at the rate of 5 per cent. In other words, the Commonwealth Bank prevents the private banks from exploiting the people. Many farmers will oppose this bill although they are not Labour supporters because tbey know that it would be foolish to place themselves in the position of having to pay a higher rate of interest than they need pay for their overdrafts. TJnder this clause of the bill the rate of interest on overdrafts will be controlled by the private banks. The day is coming when, because of drought, farmers will be in Urgent need of accommodation. They will need assistance to carry on from one year to another. I think that the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) bais had personal experience of such circumstances. I am sure that he will only support this bill because he has been compelled to support it. As I have said, his party is financed by the banks. Buti f the Government would make this measure an election issue it would be thoroughly defeated. The Government has enough nails in itscoffin and there is no need for it to put in this one. The people will not tolerate any interference with the Commonwealth Bank. Therefore, I oppose this measurewhieh will cripple ancl destroy a great institution, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. [9.22]. I am not surprised to learn that the honourable member for Wannon( Mr McLeod) and the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr W. M . Bourke) are opposing this measure. The honourable member for Fawkner said that this bill had is why he is opposing it. Ever since a Labour government interfered with the Commonwealth Bank these honourable members have supported nationalization not only of banks but of everything that the people own. It has been said that a government that controls banking controls the people. The 1945 legislation which this bill will amend was introduced by the Labour Government which wished to get its claws into the banking institution. It decided to nationalize private banks, a step which a Communist candidate in Queensland said recently was a stepping-stone to Communism. That is part of the Labour party's scheme. This bill will not ruin the people's bank. It will enable the bank to compete fairly with private banking institutions, which hold about six-sevenths of people's savings. It will give those banks the opportunity to compete fairly with a branch of the Commonwealth Bank which Was opened in order to destroy them. The Commonwealth Bank has compulsorily taken the savings lodged with the private banks and accumulated them, to the extent of hundreds of millions of pounds in special deposits. Why should these banks have been required to pay 2£ per cent, or 3 per cent, for their Own",84,Chaieman Have Us Believe That He Wants The Labour

The private banking institutions in which the people have placed six-sevenths of their savings would be ruined by the Labour party which is determined to take from those who have and give to those who have not. The Labour party desires to create a monopoly which will extend to the home, the farm and the cheque book and it is at present dealing with the cheque book. One honourable member complained that if he put £1,000 into a bank the bank would lend it and make money out of it. How would it be possible for a bank to build up assets without lending? Isi t a crime for a bank to lend a portion of the deposits that are lodged with it? credit. exactly what the Commonwealth Bank also does,, it creates that which has to be. backed by guarantee. I thank the honorahle member for his. interjection. They create, credit, for which they are responsible up to a certain amount. That is a function of banking. The honourable member cannot expect banks to take care of the deposits of their customers in expensive buildings, and employ large numbers of employees and great amounts of material in doing so, without gettingsomething in return. The banking system of this country is the same as in every other country of the world, except Russia, and nobody knows what happens there. It is the same as the banking system of the greatest, country in the world, the TJnited States of America, where the people are the wealthiest and happiest the world has ever known. It has more wealth than, the world has ever dreamed of, and it has shown the greatest sympathy and charity ever shown towards the weaker peoples of the world. Private banks in America are allowed to carry on without government interference. In the final analysis, private banking and private interests have been responsible for the saving of the world. If honourable gentlemen opposite know something that no one else outside the Iron Curtain knows, they will be able to tell us how banking is conducted in Russia. The Opposition really wants to achieve a political economy like the Russian political economy. The Communists are behind the Opposition's policy in relation to banking and the Conimunistsmunists are the force behind the policy, of many trade unions and the Australian Council of Trades Unions. The Communists are behind the Labour party's agitation to nationalize the banks. This bill is designed to cut some of the strings with which the private banks have been tied.

The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN Order! The honourable gentleman's time bas expired. ford-Smith) [9.34] -In its early stages the debate pleased me because of the large proportion of Government supporters who appeared to be friends of the Commonwealth Bank. That is rather a change, when one remembers the history of the Commonwealth Bank, and tbe attitude to it of the anti-Labour predecessors of the present Government. Some of us are old enough to recall the very bitter opposition that the establishment of the bank aroused among the interests that this Government represents. They resented the intrusion of the Commonwealth Bank into the banking field. Early in tbe debate to-day it seemed that Government supporters wished only to do the Commonwealth Bank a good turn. However, as their arguments evolved, they showed themselves as being entirely contrary in intent to the impression that I had received earlier. They concentrated on pointing out the necessity for supporting the private banking institutions. The honourable member for ""Wide Bay( Mr Corser) let a whole litter of kittens out of the bag by admitting that the attitude of the conservatives in this country was that the Oommonwealth Bank was not necessary, had been brought into existence to injure the private banks, job during the last war, and did an even and therefore had the support of Communists and socialists throughout Australia. Some honourable members may recall that during World WarI . , when this country was in a bad spot for finance, the then Government approached the private banking institutions, which our friends opposite champion so eagerly, for financial accommodation, but found it impossible to obtain it from them. Had it not been for the Commonwealth Bank, founded by a Labour government, it is hard to say how the war would have been financed. Later, we had the economic depression. Honourable members know how the Commonwealth Bank, which was then controlled by a board appointed by an anti-Labour government, hampered thc policy of the Scullin Labour Government which was designed to alleviate the effects of the depression. That board was constituted of men who knew nothing of banking, as such, and who were not concerned with the welfare of the people, but were concerned only with commercial interests. That was, in fact, the reason for their appointment to tbe board. Wc can remember how they refused to allow the elected representatives of the people to obtain sufficient finance to save the country and to save hundreds of thousands of people from unemployment ancl degradation. It was only because the Commonwealth Bank at that time was labouring under a handicap imposed upon it by the anti-Labour predecessors of the present Government that the Scullin Government could not carry out its policy to combat the depression. We know how much the Commonwealtb Bank, under its present form of control as established by a Labour government, was able to do to assist Australia's war effort during the last war. What is actually behind the desire of the Government to tear down, or, at the least, hobble the bank? It is proposing a large number of amendments all of which are aimed in some way at curtailing the power and prestige of the Commonwealth Bank. The various sections of the Commonwealth Bank, including the General Banking Division, the Commonwealth Savings Bank, the Rural Credits Department, and the Industrial Finance Department did a great better job during the post-war period. In what way has the bank failed that it should now be mutilated by the Government? I am forced to the conclusion that this legislation is not aimed at doing anything for tbe people's bank, but is aimed at restricting it so that the private banking institutions will be able to make greater profits with less expenditure. We have heard a lot from honourable members opposite about socialism and communism, and I do not know how many other "" isms "". To members of a democratic party wbo believe in the right of the elected representatives of the people to amend legislation, not only on banking but also on anything else, it",86,Chaieman Have Us Believe That He Wants The Labour
236,Mr Gordon Anderson (Kings,"seems strange that the Government should adopt the peculiar attitude of attempting to justify this legislation, not tions. Some of those honourable gentlebecause it is necessary or may do somegood, but on the negative ground that it will stop some future government, in different circumstances, from doing something that it considers to be in the best interests of the people it represents. For democratic reasons alone, we sbould not give our support to this bill. A great deal has been said during this debate to the effect that tbe legislation will bring about fair competition between the private trading banks and the trading section of the Commonwealth Bank. This small bank is to be cut adrift from the reserve bank and given a different name from that which it has had for the last 40 years. It is to be thrown out into the world to compete against 6 or 7 amalgamated private banking institutions which have been in the habit of getting together to determine -rates of interest and such matters. We know what may well happen to this one small government trading bank once it is cut off from its sheet anchor, the Commonwealth Bank. It is unnecessary for the trading section of' the bank to be separated from the reserve bank. Most honourable members remember the opinion that was expressed by the experts who were appointed by an anti-Labour government to constitute the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems. Commonwealth Bank, as it was then constituted, was the ideal kind of institution to carry out the reserve banking functions of Australia. Against that opinion, some young hopefuls on the other side of the chamber have pitted their views. I do not put myself up as an expert on banking; I am prepared to abide by the findings of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, which had not previously been challenged-unti l they were questioned by several young honourable members oppo 1 site who have been in the Parliament only a few years. Some of them are very actively interested in commercial and financial institutions outside the Parliament, and I have no doubt that during the last few years they have obtained a great deal of real support in their political campaigns from such institumen became so active in this matter that they circulated amendments of the legislation. Those amendments have now disappeared for reasons best known to themselves. I suggest that their disappearance indicates that tbe honourable members know very little about banking and are not so much concerned with the people's bank as they are witb tbe interests of those who have supported them in the past. So far, the debate has not in any way demonstrated that the Commonwealth Bank has not done, and is not doing, an excellent job. The TEMPOBABY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. -This weak and anaemic legislation will not disturb the Opposition, nor will it cheer those who sit behind the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), because they obviously expected much more from the bill than its clauses contain. The clauses which the committee is at present considering are meaningless and worthless. They are as futile as a stream which rises in the mountains, dashes down a hillside, and proceeds to waste itself in the desert. The Government parties themselves are in a desert of despair at thc present time.

239,Mr Luchetti,"If I have disleader, I ara sorry for kim. This measure is not' likely to win a cheer from a single executive member of the private trading -banks wbo, in other days, were able to determine matters concerning the finance of tbe nation. If bonorable members turn back the pages of tbe Sydney Morning Herald to tbe issues following -the death of Mr A. 0. Davidson, who was head of the Bank of New South Wales, they will learn how he defied the nation and, with the heads of other private trading banks, determined the financial policy of Australia. Tliis Government is now endeavouring to curry favour with its masters. It pretends that it is still serving the people menting it upon its handling of the of the country instead of Mammon. An amazing feature of this debate, and particularly in relation to the clauses with which the committee is now dealing, has been the avowal by bonorable members opposite that they stand by the private trading banks and against socialism and monopolies. But not one word has been expressed by them to the effect that they also stand by the people; nor have they said that they wish to do something worthwhile for the community and for tbe justifiable aims and aspirations of its citizens. Because tbey have failed in that direction, the people will judge this Goverament at the first available opportunity, which will be on the occasion of the forthcoming Senate election. I wish to know whether this legislation has been introduced at the request of Dr. -Coombs, of the Commonwealth Bank, or of any representative gathering in the community. request of the trade unionists, or any other worthwhile section of the people? Did the farmers seek these clauses? Did any section of the business community ask for them? The Government is not sufficiently courageous to go the whole way and to interpret fully the will of the private trading banks. It is not prepared to do all the things that they want done. Instead, it has gone half way. As a result, the people of Australia will be left in two minds whether the Commonwealth Bank is to be a people's bank, to serve the people of Australia and to do those things which are necessary whether it will shackle them. I regret Mr Ludhetti. to say that to-day we have heard melancholy anti-democratic (expressions time ancl time again from supporters of the Government to the effect that if this measure is approved the people of another generation will not be able to determine what shall be done in their best interests, but will remain shackled by this Government which is going to its doom. The Government, knowing that it is certainly going to its doom, approaches this matter in an atmosphere of decay and defeat. However, the Government has been fortified to fome extent by articles that have appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald and other newspapers complibanking legislation, just as tbey complimented it upon its shackling legislation in regard to Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and other important matters. This Government has introduced a number of measures, including the one at .present before the committee, which will .not help the people to-day and which will prevent some future government from helping the people of its day. When I made my maiden speech in this Parliament, I said that the .government of the day w.a3 entitled to govern, and, indeed, had a responsibility to govern. But this Government not only wants to govern in its day, it also wants to govern in tbree, six or nine years time. It wants to tie the hands of those who will soon attainthe age of 21 and thus become Was it introduced at the eligible to vote, and it wants to tie the hands of those who may in the future have to fight for their country. It is trying to shackle the banking system so that the credit resources of Australia will be denied to the people of the future, and so that theii* elected representatives will not be .able to do what is necessary for their welfare and the healthy development of the nation. Finance is required in many directions. It is required to build up a greater and better Australia, and it is necessary for the individual needs of the people; yet this Government, by these clauses now under consideration intends to divide the activities of the Comfor their welfare, or monwealth Bank and prevent it from functioning in the best interests of the nation. The Postmaster-General( Mr gence to understand what has previously Anthony) said to-day that banks were like corner shops. He said that if there were a number of butcher shops available, people should be entitled to deal at whichever one they chose, and that banks should be in the same category. However, here is a Commonwealth Bank The TEMPOBABY CHAIEMAN Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Commonwealth Bank in which all the people are entitled to share because they are members of the co-operative organization of the bank. But this Governmentwants to prevent them from dealing with the bank. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN Order! The honorable member must learn to obey the Chair or he will be dealt with. regrettable that during this debate so few honourable members from the Government side have participated in the discussion of the clauses of the measure before us. Certain apologists have spoken for the Government but instead of giving the chamber a reasonable explanation why this measure has been brought before it, they have endeavoured completely to misrepresent the real issues. They have adopted the attitude that it is necessary for them to oppose the Opposition, and that they will use every argument possible against the Labour party in order to cloud tbe issue before the committee. The honourable jnember for Forrest( Mr Bay( Mr Bernard Corser) made a stateFreeth) informed us that this measure was an attempt by the Government to prevent the nationalization of banking. I cannot find any reference to the nationalization of banking in this measure, nor can I find anything which will prevent tbe Parliament from nationalizing the banking services of Australia. of banking is just one of the smokescreens that have been thrown around the reasons for introducing this bill. The High Court has given its verdict on the issue of bank nationalization. I take it that when an honourable member is elected to this Parliament he has sufficient intellitry, and we know from sad experience happened in the world, and therefore all honourable members must know that the High Court has made a declaration on the nationalization of banking. Because of that declaration there is only one way of introducingthis form of nationalization. That is by an alteration of the Constitution. The Constitution can be altered in two ways-by an agreement among the six State governments', or by amajority of the people of Australia and a majority of voters in a majority of States approving an alteration at a referendum. If ) at some future time, the people indicate that they desirethat banking should be nationalized, they will be entitled to vote for it at a. referendum, and it is most unfair that the Government apologists should be endeavouring to show that this measure will prevent thenationalizationof banking. Let us seek the real reasons for tke. introduction of the measure. The Government prefers to talk of socialism and communism, and to draw other red herrings across the trail, but the people will refuse to be scared by the same old bogeys that are dragged out time and time again by this Government. Unless the Government can change its policy of continually opposing the Labour party, it will not last much longer. The Government is. proposing to make vital changes in the organization of the Commonwealth Bank. It is doing that for one purpose onlythat is to strengthen the control of the private banks over the people, of Australia.. The honourable member for Wide ment to-day with which I agree, despite his muddled thinking and muddled arguments, and his suggestions about, communism. He said that the people who control the hanking of a country completely control the country. I believe that this measure isi another step, by the Government towards once again placing the Talk of the nationalization financial destiny of this great country in the hand's of a few private financiers wlio are responsible only to themselves. Inthat connection, it is well that we should think back to the depression days of the 1930's. In those times the Government did not control the finances of the coun-",88,Chaieman Have Us Believe That He Wants The Labour

241,Mr Bryson (Wills) [9.54],"-It iswhat happened then. The financiers decided the policy that the then government had to follow, and although Australia had a government elected by the great majority of the people, a handful of private financiers dictated its policy. That state of affairs would suit this Government, because it is the mouthpiece of the few strong financiers in this community. Honourable members on the Government side are attempting, to the best of their limited ability, to carry out the dictates of the small' financial oligarchy in Australia. Honourable members on this side of the House will do their best to prevent them from doing so. If Australia is to be plunged into conGovernment members away from their ditions similar to those of the 1930's, the people will be in a sorry state. At present we have control of the financial situation. In a democracy, it is essential that the Government that is elected by the majority of the people shall have control of the national finances. Without that control, any government is impotent to carry out its policy. We must make sure that the financial interests do not gain control. This is the second bite at the Commonwealth Bank that has been taken by this Government in the three years since it has been in office. If the Governbanks in 1947, but they will be even more ment can get away with this measure, honourable members know what its next step will be. A foretaste of the future was contained in the proposed amendments that were circulated by the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate). He intended to move those amendments, but because of pressure from his masters, he humbly withdrew them. He has come to heel. He went off halfcocked. But the proposed amendments have shown the next step that the Government might take towards the destruction of the people's bank. Despite the actions of anti-Labour governments over the years, the Commonwealth Bank has progressed and it will continue to do so when this anti-Labour Government is thrown out of office. It will not be long before an indignant electorate throws it out with the intention to keep it out of office permanently. This Government is paying back to the private banks the debt that it incurred when it accepted financial support from them to enable it to gain the treasury bench. The people of Australia believe in the Commonwealth Bank. The majority of them believe that the government of the nation should control its finances and they will not accept a measure of this kind which is deliberately designed to destroy the Commonwealth Bank. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member's time has expired. [Quorum formed.] a pity that the Opposition has had to get cups of tea to listen to the final stages of this measure, but the circumstances are indicative of the general attitude of honourable members on the Government side towards this important matter. If the Opposition had not studied some of the clauses of the bill closely, many of the hidden changes that are concealed in it would not have been revealed. According to honourable members on the Government side, the people of Australia were critical of the Labour Government because it attempted to nationalize the indignant at the continuous whittling down by the Government of the autonomy of the Commonwealth Bank since they attained office. When the Labour Government went out of office, the Commonwealth Bank was a proud institution. It was free of a Commonwealth Bank Board and operated under a Governor with an advisory council, subject to the Treasurer of the day. But since then it has been strangled by the superimposition of the Commonwealth Bank Board. Now the Government, through this measure, is attempting to whittle down further the authority and autonomy of the Commonwealtli Bank. The people of Australia are afraid of the future. Honourable members who have talked with, farmers and small businessmen, in particular, in their electorates know that that is so. In Australia to-day 80,000 people are unemployed and any attempt to make the circulation of credit through thf Australian economy more difficult will he viewed with grave suspicion by",90,Chaieman Have Us Believe That He Wants The Labour

244,Mr Dtjthie (Wilmot) [10.5],"It is the people and particularly by those Australians and immigrants who are out of work. We have not yet discovered the true reason why the Government has introduced this bill. Several reasons have been given but honourable members still are not sure. One suggestion is that the bill is purely a gesture to the private banking institutions of Australia for assistance that they rendered to the Government during the election campaigns in 1949 and 1951. It is only a gesture because when the bill is analysed, there is really no distinct separation of the Commonwealth Trading Bank from the central bank functions. That was indicated by the proposed amendments that were circulated by the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr wealth Bank has a far larger business Jeff Bate). The private banks will not be happy until the trading bank section of the Oommonwealth Bank is put out of existence. It is also suggested that the Government has introduced the measure to weaken the Commonwealth Bank's impact upon the community as a financial organization owned and controlled by the people through the Government. That is the method of dividing and conquering, which is the most effective method of weakening any organization. The plan is to divide the bank and conquer each section at will. The third reason is that the competition and growth of the Commonwealth Bank have been so phenomenal in recent years that it has become a danger to private banks. I am not talking of nationalization, but of pure clean competition between the private banks and the Commonwealth Bank. The bank has operated so successfully that the Government has introduced this bill in order to weaken the bank's ability opposite have frequently complained of to compete against the private banks. Statistics furnished to me by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) in answers to questions on this subject prove that that could be one of the reasons for thfbook the Commonwealth Trading Bank introduction of tbe bill. In 1939, there were 142,808 depositors in the trading bank section of the bank. By 1949, the number had increased to 257,982, and by 1952, only three years later, the number had grown to 372,870 creased by more than present Government's the Government will claim credit for the increase. If the honourable member for Bass( Mr Kekwick) contends that it cau do so he tacitly admits that the Government controls the policy of the Commonwealth Bank. I am sure that he would not want to make such an admission. ber was endeavouring to prove that the Government is trying to hold back the progress of the bank. and the Savings Bank Department there are 4,720,000 depositors, compared with only 1,500,000 depositors in the whole of the private trading banks. The Commonnumerically than have the trading banks, but in value of transactions the business conducted by the private banks probably exceeds by far that of the Commonwealth Bank. Probably more than three-quarters of bank depositors in Australia do business with the Commonwealth Bank. If the bank is doing so well, why should the Government interfere with the existing organization of the bank unless it desires to weaken the bank's trading activities? It is ridiculous for the Government to interfere with a growing concern. we thought when the Labour Government tried to nationalize the private banks. ment proposed to nationalize banking because of its experience of the evil effect; of 50 years of private bank control of the credit of Australia.

The Government has yet to do something really worthwhile in facilitating the provision of loans to families for the purpose of building houses. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in the joint policy speech of the present Government parties during the last general election campaign, promised that if returned to power his Government would ensure that sufficient finance was made available to every family for that purpose. However, over 400,000 families are still Avithout homes. At present, the Commonwealth Bank can make loans available for the building of houses up to an amount of only £1,750. Having regard to the degree to which costs have arisen since the Government assumed office, that amount is totally inadequate. During the last general election campaign, the Australian Labour party promised that if Labour were returned to office at would enable the bank -to make loans available for that purpose up to a maximum of £3,000 at a maximum rate of interest of 3 per cent. To-day, however, persons who obtain a loan from the Commonwealtli Bank for that purpose, although such loans are limited to an amount of £1,750, are obliged to pay interest at the rate of 4£ per cent.

They have been indulging in tedious repetition. Tbey have claimed that under this measure the structure of the Commonwealth Bank will be seriously weakened. Nothing could be farther from the truth. On the contrary, the bank's organization will be strengthened, because it will be converted into a full-blooded trading bank which will be empowered to engage in direct and effective competition with the private trading banks. The proposed 'Commonwealth Trading Bank will have its own general manager and will be enabled to determine its own policy. It will thus be placed, on all fours with the private banks.

262,Mr Ceamee,"It was at that timethe private banks voluntarily agreed to lodge a substantial proportion of their deposits with the Commonwealth Bank in order to assist the nation's war effort. That fact cannot be denied. However, when Labour assumed office it immediately passed regulations under the National Security Act to make it mandatory upon the private banks to lodge such deposits. The people recall the crash of the State savings banks in New South Wales in the early 'thirties when Labour was in office in that State. Incidentally, the Commonwealth Savings Bank benefited to a great degree at that time because, as a result of that crash, tbe people of New South Wales transferred their business to it. After World War IL , a Labour Government, acting in conformity with Labour's policy, precipitately attempted to destroy the private banks by endeavouring to nationalize the banking structure, knowing full well that the banking institutions are the life-blood of the country. Our only bulwark against socialization is an economy with a free banking system. The Chifley Labour Government depended upon its banking legislation of 1945 to empower it to introduce socialization into Australia. One of the principal features of that legislation was the issuing of a direction to all semi-governmental bodies and local authorities to conduct their banking business with the Commonwealth Bank, despite the fact that many of tbem had banked with the trading banks for 50 years. That direction, arbitrarily given, was to be enforced. to office again, it will try to nationalize Only a legal challenge by the Melbourne City Council thwarted the Labour Government. Another of the principal features of the banking legislation of 1945, upon which the Labour Government depended, was the right to take the whole of the increased assets of the trading banks into special accounts held by the Commonwealth Bank. By those means, the Labour Government tried to nationalize the banking system. The socialists were frustrated by the ization of banking. It is imposdecision of tbe High Court of Australia, sible for him to hide the truth and realized that time was running from the people. Let us face the issue, against them. The people were ""waking and understand the real position. The up "" to them. Accordingly, the Labour Labour party wants the nationalization Government introduced the banking of banking so that it can control the legislation of 1947, the specific purpose lives of the people, and place them under Mr Cramer. of which was to nationalize the banks. Yet members of the Labour party, in a mealy-mouthed manner, try to convince the people that tbey are not in favour of the nationalization of banking. The people know them, and what they intend to do, and will not be deceived by mealymouthed assurances on this issue. This bill will preserve democracy for the people in Australia. That is why the Government has introduced this legislation. We desire to be fair. Let us have a proper banking system in which the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks will engage in business in fair competition with one another. During the debate this evening, we have been compelled to listen to all sorts of stuff and nonsense, and stupid utterances, and submit to pin pricking, as members of the Opposition have tried to deceive the people. This Government is not attempting to destroy the Commonwealth Bank. I pledge my word to everybody who knows me that I shall fight for all I am worth to maintain a strong and vigorous Commonwealth Bank and Commonwealth Trading Bank. It is about time that we got down to tintacks on this matter, and exposed Opposition members to the people for what they are. Every memher of the Labour party has believed throughout his political life, that the key to the whole situation is complete control of the banking system. If the people are foolish enough to return the Labour party tbe banking system at tbe earliest possible moment. Many Opposition speakers liave given proof of that intention to-day. We heard it from the lips of the honprable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) and tbe honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell). Tbat cannot be denied. It is futile for tbo Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) to tell the people that he does not want nationala socialist' dictatorship. This Government is in favour of democracy, and in preserving the rights of the people. Opposition) [""10.34] -Some Government supporters have raised the issue quite clearly. Bennelong ( Mr Cramer), who has just completed his second speech on this clause, is perfectly right when he says that it provides the machinery by which the essential objective of this bill is to be achieved. The marginal note to clause 18 reads as follows:Business of the General Banking Division to be carried on by Trading Bank. The clause proceeds to state how the assets and liabilities are to be transferred. I pointed out in my second-reading speech that it is doubtful, to say the least, whether there is constitutional power to make such a' wholesale transfer of accounts from one bank to another without the consent of each customer concerned. . It is perfectly true that the Commonwealth accepts the liabilities. That provision is not new. It has always applied to the Commonwealth Savings Bank. However, I think that it is impossible legally to give effect to this provision, and I gather that the legal advisers of the Government hold a similar opinion, because the transfer of the business may not be effected unti l a proclaimed date. ""When that date w ill be I do not know. Utter confusion must occur in the actual conduct of the General Banking Division of the Commonwealth Bank unti l the proclaimed date. After the proclaimed date a new bank will begin to function. The honourable member for Bennelong is really in favour of the Commonwealth Bank and its trading division. He wants it to progress. The Vice-President of the Executive Harrison), in one of his melodramatic monologues earlier in the evening, pointed out that the trading section of the Commonwealth Bank has been conducted successfully. The honourable member fov Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) has pointed out that the increase of the number of branches of the bank has been small during the three years this Government has been in office, but I shall let that matter pass. Thc **3t remains that business oi the bank has increased during that period. In view of those circumstances, why does the Government desire to alter the structure of the bank? If the institution is functioning effectively, why does the Government propose to change it? a Labour government w ill nationalize banking under the legislation of 1945. now been in office for three years. For the last two years it has had a majority in the Senate and in this chamber, yet it' has made no effort unti l now to introduce this legislation. W h y has it been introduced at this stage? If the Government is eager to preserve keen competition between the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks now, it should have been equally keen two years ago. we were busy dealing with the Communists. the people on a specific banking issue in 1951. It wished to reconstitute tbe Commonwealth Bank Board. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), in his policy speech, did not indicate that the Government had any other intention regarding the bank. A f t e r the general election, the Government appointed the bank board. Buti t had no authority from the people to take any other action in respect to the bank. In 1949, the present Prime Minister said in his policy speech that the trading functions of the Commonwealth Bank would be continued. The whole essence of that promise was that the trading division of the bank would not be liquidated, as it w ill be by this bill. It is proved beyond doubt that the bank has been conducted successfully. The Government has not assisted it , and Council( MrE r ic J. has not insisted that new branches be opened, but nevertheless, the institution is doing well. The number of customers is increasing. The Government professes that it wishes to expand the Commonwealth Bank. I emphasize that the Government, with the introduction of this legislation, repudiates its pre-election promise given to the people in 1951, which was limited to the re-establishment of the bank board. The Government also repudiates its pre-election promises given",94,Chaieman Have Us Believe That He Wants The Labour

He said that it meant nothing and would achieve nothing. We must try to get those contradictory statements sorted Out some time: Some honourable members opposite who, I believe, speak with the true voice of the Labour movementI include the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) and the honourable member that they stand to-day where they stood in 1947. In other words, they stand for the nationalization Of banking. That, of course, puts the Leader of the Opposition in an uncomfortable position. He asks us now why we need this legislation. He has the effrontery to say, "" Where is your mandate for this bill?'"". That mandate was given in 1949 when the Labour Government, which had been returned with an overwhelming majority in 1946) was thrown out of office ignoniinoiisly because of its attempt to nationalize the private banks. The people of Australia elected a Liberal government to ensure, not merely that the private banking structure of this country would remain substantially as it was at that time, but also that some safeguards would be provided against any attempt at arbitrary change in the future: The Leader of the Opposition has asked why We need this legislation nOWj two years after our election tooffice with a majority iii both Houses of the Parliament. If the' right honourable gentleman's colleagues share his view that the nationalization' of banking is no longer an issue, why do they retain that proposal not only as am integral part of the Labour party's objective, but alsoas aspecific item of policy ih the party's platform-? The Leader of the Opposition hasaccused usof attempting to twist! Labour's views' by picking out sentences' and giving them a distorted^ interpretation..

CanI be a'ceused o-f distorting the view of Labour? Is the nationalization proposal not still part of the Labour party's platform? If it is part of the platform, why are not honourable members Opposite honest enough to tell the people of Australia that is where Labour still stands? We can have some respect for honourable members who make no mystery of their views on this matter. As opportunities have presented themselves, the Labour party has pursued the Course on which it set itself, apparently irrevocably, back in 1921. There has been no alteration of the substance of the Labour party's objective as it was laid down at that time and I believe that as legislative opportunities present themselves again in the future, honourable members Opposite will go forward towards that objective so long as it remains a part of their platform. The Leader of the Opposition has sought to give us a lecture about mandates. He wants to know whether we have a mandate for this legislation. Where was his mandate for the nationalization measures of 1947? We heard not one word about that in Labour's 1946 policyspeech. The proposal was sprung upon the country suddenly after a Saturday morning Cabinet discussion. The announcement was made in. a bald 42-word 1 statement by the then Prime Minister Mr OMfi'ey. Nationalization was to be thrust upon the Australian: people whethei"" they wanted it or not. I recall most vividly how we pleaded with the then government to withhold its legislation until the people had been given the opportunity to express their views upon it.

273,For Melbourne ( Mr Calweu),"hav e saidwaited patiently to see the Labour party's socialization objective amended as tbe result of the democratically expressed will clearly. of the Australian people on the bank nationalization issue; but Lahour stands as strongly for the nationalization of the banks to-day as it stood in 1947. Although we know that we cannot deprive any future Labour government that may be elected of its opportunity to seek again by means of amending legislation to work its will on the private banks-to number their days as the honourable member for Melbourne has said-w e shall be able at least to take whatever steps are available to us when the time comes, to force such a government into the open so that the Australian people may know exactly what it proposes to do. The legislation now before us will make it much more necessary for honourable members opposite to say frankly where they stand. I am sure that this legislation will be accepted gladly by the people of this country. The more that members of the Government say about this measure the more mystified one becomes about the Government's policy. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) has given the committee an entirely new reason why the Government has introduced this legislation. Apparently the pressure that was brought to bear by the Government back-benchers nothing to do with the matter! It would appear from the Minister's speech that the Government has a most tender regard for the constitution and platform of the Australian Labour party, but the truth is that the Minister decided to unburden himself by giving to the committee entirely new reasons which came suddenly into his mind only a few minutes ago. I remind honourable members that this measure will not prevent the nationalization of banking when the people want it. On the other hand, nationalization of the banks would not necessarily follow the repeal of this legislation in the future. ""We have heard little more than such an implication from supporters of the Government to-night, which has not added to the value of the debate. Had honourable members opposite explained the true purpose of the bill, instead of discussing matters not associated with it, we should all by now understand the measure more During the 1949 general election campaign the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) told the people that if the anti-Labour parties were returned to oflice the trading functions of the Commonwealth Bank would not be altered. On neither of the two occasions between 1949 and 1951, when legislation was brought down to provide for the re-introduction of the Commonwealth Bank Board, did the right honourable gentleman indicate that legislation would be introduced to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act. The rejection of the legislation to reconstitute the Commonwealth Bank Board was followed by a double dissolution of the Parliament, and the subsequent general election was fought only on the basis of the necessity to re-introduce the Commonwealth Bank Board. At no time during the last three years has the Government indicated that further amending legislation would be introduced. This measure has been brought down as a result of the pressure of Government back-benchers for amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act and the Banking Act. Some of the statements of honourable members opposite in relation to the "" fair go"" that the Commonwealth Bank has had received from the Government have not helped the committee to any appreciable degree to understand the Government's policy in relation to banking. In an endeavour to prove that the Commonwealth Bank has been well treated by the Government, the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) cited figures to show that advances by the bank rose from £80,000,000 in 1949 to £120,000,000 in 1952. On their face value those figures indicated that there was a considerable improvement of the affairs of the bank, as far as advances are concerned. The Minister also cited figures of the combined advances that had been made by the trading banks and the Commonwealth Bank, which revealed a considerable improvement. However,, he did not state the aggregate amount of advances by the trading banks alone. I assure the",98,Chaieman Have Us Believe That He Wants The Labour
274,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [10.50],"Vice-President of the Executive Council industry and the economy generally that if the amount of combined advances during the 'thirties when the people lost that he mentioned had not been granted, confidence in the financial structure of the people of this country would be in a the country.

276,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [11.7 J,"in touch with modern standards for the flying of aircraft. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, having made inquiries ahout the practice adopted by Trans-Australia Airlines, discovered that it cost approximately £50,000 a year. So Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited decided that it would not give its pilots refresher courses, because it would be too costly to do so. We can see what will happen if Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is able to succeed, with the assistNational Airways Proprietary Limited, ance of this private enterprise Government, in forcing Trans-Australia Airlines out of business. Honourable members know of the plan that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited has proposed to exclude Trans-Australia Airlines from AdelaidePerth flights, to take over the Tasmanian traffic, and to leave the Queensland traffic as from a government airline, because to Trans-Australia Airlines. It is well known that Trans-Australia Airlines is losing a considerable sum of money on its Queensland services, but it maintains them because it wants to provide the Australian public with adequate air services. The Tasmanian service is one of the most profitable air services, but Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited wants to take it over and to exclude the Government airline from it. It is obvious that if Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited were allotted the Adelaide-Perth services, people who wanted to go to Perth from Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne would uot make bookings with two companies. They would notfly to Adelaide by Trans-Australia Airlines, and then transfer to an aircraft operated by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. If the proposal of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited were accepted, it would force into the lap oi that company all the people who wanted to .eo to Perth from Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne. At any rate, a large proportion of them would book the whole way with Australian .National Airways Proprietary Limited. As time passes, we see more clearly the real intention of the Government when it forced an agreement upon Trans-Australia Airlines recently. The intention of 'the Government is to destroy Trans-Australia Airlines, and to establish a private monopoly of interstate air travel for Australian National Airways Proprietary Liniited. Honourable gentlemen opposi te have talked about letting the people have a choice. Trans-Australia Airlines has shown that a government airline can operate more successfully and efficiently than can a private airline, and the public are entitled to have the services of the government airline preserved for them. I do not want to fly by Australian and the majority of honourable members opposite use the services of Trans-Australia Airlines. I have given the House some illustrations of the way in which safety is disregarded by private operators, or does not receive the same consideration from them they are more concerned about making profits. Whatever the Minister may say, the facts are that since Trans-Austr.alia Airlines has been in operation it has had one mishap to a freight aircraft but not one of its passengers has been killed, whilst in the same period Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited has suffered five major crashes. As the safety of the public should be a major consideration, I suggest that the Minister give an undertaking to the House and the people that Trans-Australia Airlines will not be forced out of the air, but will be permitted to continue to operate tbe services that it has been operating so far. I direct the attention of the YicePresident of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) to protests that have been made by a number of citizens against the flood of -so-called literature that is eoniing into this country, and for which the Government is providing dollars. I have been given by Mr W. B. Burke of Bockhampton, Queensland, some-examples of what are supposed to be detective novels. I am amazed that officers of the ; Department of Trade and Customs have let such printed matter come into the conntry, and I am appalled to think that dollars are being used to finance its importation.

Each novel is composed of a series of incidents, each a little more gruesome company and that for the reasons he than the preceding one, until he reaches his previously written culmination-usuall y a smash surprise ending of horror and butchery. If we in this Parliament have any sense of responsibility, and if we think of the children of to-day who will be the citizens of to-morrow, we will not make dollars available for matter of that kind to come into this country. If we have any sense of fitness, and if we believe that there should be censorship of pornographic and dangerous trash, the censors of the Customs service ought to be told not to allow that kind of stuff to be brought in copies of his so-called novels in five years. are on sale on bookstalls throughout Australia. bave produced to-night were sold in Rockhampton. The citizens of that city are so incensed about the matter that, at the reauest of the Rockhampton Trades and Labour Council, the mayor is calling Mr Calwell. a public protest meeting. I hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will have an investigation made and have this type of literature kept out of the country. [11.20] I do not wish to detain the House at this hour, but I do wish to reply to the remarks of. the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) in regard to the losses that have been sustained by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. I remind the honourable member that it was Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited which pioneered air services and made it easier for those who followed. The losses to which he referred were sustained by that company in the course of its pioneering work. master-General and Minister for Civil Aviation) [11.21] I do not know whether one should give serious attention to the charges of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) because they were so obviously intended to damage the traffic business of a private airline. They were intended to instil into people the fear that it would not be safe to travel with a private enterprise alleged their lives might be in jeopardy. The honourable member even said that the oflicers of the Department of Civil Aviation, who are non-political so far as I am aware, would be privy to a scheme which would endanger the lives of the public by permitting aircraft to -be used which were not airworthy. That charge is not worth answering. The honourable member suggested that he would not travel on certain planes because he would fear for his life. I do not think that many others would share that fear. In answer to a question which Spillane has sold 13,000,000 was asked in this House to-day, I supplied figures relating to the record of I am told that they Australian commercial aviation. In the last fifteen months not a single life has The so-called books that I been lost in the air. I think that that record is suflicient testimony to the efficacy of inspection and other controls that are exercised by the Department of Civil Aviation in order to ensure the safety of those who travel by air.",102,Abjotjjenment Result Of The Refusal Of The Air Pilots Civil Aviation Importe D Litebatube

279,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"PostI think that the insinuations that were made by the honourable member for East Sydney are beyond contempt. I think that the community has agreed that a very genuine effort has been made by the Government .to preserve the two competitive airlines Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. If this had been a government of the political complexion of the honourable member for East Sydney as soon as we had attained oflice in 1949 we would have destroyed Trans-Australia Airlines completely. We have preserved it because we believe that it is a good institution. Whether it is a government-controlled company or a private enterprise did not concern us so much as the fact that both Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited havo given an excellent service to the public. We were convinced that the public wanted both. We have tried to preserve both. To suggest that Trans-Australia Airlines is being forced ont of certain air routes is to ignore the .provisions of the airlines legislation which was passed by this Parliament two or three months ago and which provides that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines should put their case for the rationalization of services before an arbitrator who is to be agreed upon by both of them. thc event of their failure to agree. have agreed to the extent of saving about £200,000 each a year without any lessening of the efficiency of their services to Mr Speaker the public. But it is natural that in certain instances both companies should have a preference for the same air route putand it may be very difficult to achieve agreement in every case. It is possible, therefore, that certain matters may have to bo settled by arbitration. The airlines legislation provided that the arbitration should take place outside the political arena. arbitrator? announced in due course when authority is given by _ both, companies. It will be the companies who will select him. He will not be chosen by me. The honourable member for East Sydney referred to the opinion of tiie Air Pilots Association. That does not concern me. That association is not governed, as the Department of Civil Aviation is governed, by rules which have heen formulated by air authorities of the world through the body known as the International Civil Aviation Organization. A meeting was held recently in Melbourne of air experts from fifteen nations who determine what is adequate for thc safety of the air-travelling public. It is not the function of the Air Pilots Association any more than it is the function of some job controller .in a workshop to take matters out of the hands of the appointed authority. Of course, it suits the honourable member for East Sydney to try to start industrial trouble in tiie airlines as he has started it in so many other industries. I have not heard anything on this subject from the Air Pilots Association but I should be very surprised if this body of men for whom. I have the highest degree of respect selected the honourable member for East Sydney to be their spokesman in this House. I completely repudiate all the allegations and insinuations of the honourable member that the conscientious officers of my department would have no consideration for the lives tlieir behalf, therefore, I say that it is Motion (by Mr .ERTC J.
