The starting point in this debate is about My electorate of Corio, in my view, is the whole question of climate change. It very much on the front line of this debate. In amazes me that there is still a debate in this what is the most carbon intensive economy country about whether or not climate change in the developed world, Geelong is perhaps is real, yet we very much see comments from the most carbon intensive city within the other side of this parliament which time Australia. We have an aluminium smelter. and again make it clear that there are people We have an oil refinery. We have a car plant. on the other side of the parliament-indeed, We have cement works.

There are a change in our atmosphere, that it will give number of scientists who ask, 'If there is such rise to climate change and all the a fundamental change in our atmosphere catastrophic consequences which are going on, what will this mean?' so many, predicted to arise from that for our children many scientists have attempted to model the and our grandchildren? fact of the high levels of CO2 within our Clearly, the answer to that question is: the atmosphere. The vast preponderance of risk is sufficient and we should be acting as scientists who have modelled this have come public policy makers. In truth, we have been up with the conclusion that it will result in a able to answer that fundamental question change to our climate which will see with certainty for more than a decade.

We are starting to issue here. The Shell company said, 'Shell see, right now, results in our climate which shares the widespread concern that the are consistent with the vast preponderance of emission of greenhouse gases such as CO2 those models.

The reason I have to say economy grows strongly, with average 'says' is that nothing about the coalition's growth in gross national income per capita of conduct and nothing about the way the 1.1 per cent a year, down from 1.2 per cent a coalition has approached the carbon price year. The Treasury modelling shows that suggests that in any way the opposition takes average incomes continue to grow strongly, this seriously. Instead what we have had, rising by about $9,000 per person by 2020 in today and yesterday and for many months real terms. The Treasury modelling shows now, is mindless negativity. Those opposite that jobs will continue to grow strongly, with have effectively been talking down our 1.6 million additional jobs by 2020.

In my this government there is support for every electorate we have waited a long time for one of those industries. I have been this legislation and we have been preparing astounded by this government's willingness for it. I hear so many members on the other to listen and to respond to the needs of side spread fear through scaremongering current industries and the jobs that they about the loss of jobs and the threat to the create. economy. This defies the realities of a place like Newcastle, the city I represent. It is a The other side have been really concerned friends and colleagues the members for because they have seen, not only in action Riverina and for Wannon, I had just 20 but also at the tax forum and the jobs forum seconds per bill to outline the concerns of last week, a willingness from all stakeholders my constituents in Higgins. to step into the future and face with realism Why is the gagging of debate so the challenges that confront our industries significant to the consideration in detail? It is and our economy. A Prime Minister's task significant because we learn tonight that the force has been set up to look at sustaining government is proposing to move 48 industry, just as a Prime Minister's task force amendments. This means that 48 problems was set up when BHP closed in Newcastle.

The parliament had less than one good in this legislation. minute per bill to consider one of the most It is always disappointing when the voices complex changes to our economy. That is of those who should know a lot better spread why the Leader of the Opposition has fear and untruths, misrepresenting the brought forward an amendment to defer the realities of our economy. For example, the commencement of a carbon tax until after an Premier of New South Wales, Barry election-until after the Australian people O'Farrell, repeated fallacious claims that up have had the opportunity to have their say to 13,000 people in the Hunter would lose and to restore their faith in government, a their jobs. That is not true. All the modelling faith that has been so cruelly and wantonly says job growth in the Hunter is real. Mr broken by this Prime Minister. As we all Baldwin, the member for Paterson, said the know, there was no mandate from the coal industry in Newcastle is doomed. What Australian people for these bills for a carbon rubbish-there is billions of dollars in tax-in fact, from it, as the Prime Minister forward investment and new terminals are gave a categorical assurance only five days being created by three different entities. out from the election that there would be no Finally we have the legislation to boost our carbon tax under the government that she investment in clean energy and the future led. The Treasurer also reinforced the economy.

That is what the life. I rise to speak in this consideration in Treasurer of this country said. Again, I say detail stage, in particular, to highlight the there has been a cruel breach of faith with amendment brought forward by the Leader the Australian people. of the Opposition. I do so having been In my speech in the second reading debate gagged in the second reading debate and I spoke about the fact that in bringing prevented from delivering my speech in full forward these bills we would be going it on the government's 19 carbon tax bills alone. We will be going it alone in a because the debate in this chamber was situation where we have a very parlous guillotined by this government. I was not the global economic condition. only one who was gagged. Along with my I want to now turn to why it is that we bills and the proclamation of these bills until need to support the amendment by the after an election. (Time expired) commencement by first looking at the interesting listening to members opposite. In government figures, the government's particular I refer to those members who have modelling. We all know that the government spoken about the impact of this legislation on have problems with their figures. We know industry around Australia. I want to respond that they are pretty good at turning a $20 to a couple of comments made firstly by the billion surplus into an almost $50 billion member for Moncrieff, who earlier on was deficit. They are good at changing no net referring to the 1½ per cent that Australia debt to almost $107 billion of net debt. We contributes to total global emissions and the know that they can increase the gross debt five per cent reduction target on the year ceiling to $250 billion. This government are 2000 levels by the year 2020. The member not great with their figures and that is why I for Moncrieff criticised that target of a five want to talk about their modelling. Their per cent reduction on the year 2000 levels by modelling is very deficient when you 2020 saying that it was only five per cent. He consider the amendments that they had to conveniently neglected to say that it bring forward. When they first announced represents about 23 per cent on business as their $9 billion a year tax they forgot to usual levels if we did nothing. It is in fact mention the fact that there was $4.3 billion quite a significant decrease in emissions by over the forward estimates that the the year 2020. Here is the irony of his government had simply left off their model. comments: he also neglected to point out that Embarrassingly, the Treasurer tried to his own party have set an equivalent target. explain this away as a rounding error-some If you are going to come in here and criticise rounding error! the target of five per cent reduction by the Earlier this year the House of year 2020 and your own party has adopted it, Representatives Standing Committee on what does that say about your own Economics, of which I am a member, were credibility? told by the government that due to the floods Quite frankly, the member for Moncrieff and Cyclone Yasi the devastation in also omitted to talk about the impact of the Queensland and Victoria was such that the policies that his leader has put to this House government needed a new tax to raise just as an alternative to achieving those targets. If $1.8 billion because the impact was going to you believe that we ought to achieve those be so significant on the budget bottom line. targets then you must have a strategy to do They said that the money could not come so. We have heard about their strategy, and from appropriations like any other disaster their strategy will cost households about because the impact was so great and yet in $1,300 a year as opposed to $9.90, or around their own modelling they left off $4.3 billion. $500, which is the cost of this legislation-in Question No. 1: if the government cannot get other words, more than twice as much. What this simple fact right with their own impact will that have on the industries and modelling, what confidence can we possibly the businesses that he claims and purports to have that something as complex as a carbon be concerned about? tax can be got right? This is again another I want to talk about another aspect which reason that we need to defer these carbon tax the member for Moncrieff also conveniently",168,Bills Steel Transformation Plan Bill 2011

What that demonstrates to all these ecosystems are at risk if we as part of of us in this chamber is that the government the global world do nothing in respect of got it wrong again on its figures and then, of climate change.

In respect of the other point made by both But this is not where the government's the member for Moncrieff and the member rubbery figures end. The government also for Wannon about the impact on businesses, forgot to factor in the $10 billion in the slush again they pretend that we are working in fund for the leader of the Greens, to fund his isolation here. They conveniently ignore the pet causes and projects. Again, we were led fact that other countries with whom we to believe that this perhaps was not real compete have had a cost on their businesses money. We know that the Treasurer has had since 1990.

I have news for the Treasurer: the money is It is fair to say that if they cannot answer real, and it comes from ordinary Australians. these fairly basic questions and if they We know that the cost of the carbon tax cannot get basic programs like a pink batts will be around $1.63 billion between now program, or a solar homes program of only and 2020.

We know that they are very good at wasting taxpayer money, Now we come to the modelling. Only last but we will all be paying for that. sitting period, the Treasurer was forced to release new modelling to factor in those I would also like to talk about another things that had not been factored in. Who can thing that the government says is close to its forget that the government modelling in the heart and is very important, and that is jobs. compensation arrangements they put forward The government is very good at talking was based on $20 a tonne when in fact they about jobs and yet not very good at were bringing in a carbon tax with a starting defending them. Let us analyse some of the price of $23 a tonne? In his most current numbers. Verso Economics recently found press release on the modelling, the Treasurer that, for every supposed green job created, acknowledged that the updated modelling 3.7 jobs were lost in other areas of the covers the main impacts on the Australian economy. Spain's Universidad Rey Juan economy of the Clean Energy Future Carlos found that, for every green job, 2.2 package. However, including all elements of jobs were lost. Study after study the plan was not feasible. So he is demonstrates what we know to be correct, acknowledging in his own words that they which is that with a carbon tax jobs will go, cannot really properly fully model the jobs will be lost. This government says that it impact. They either do not know or do not is a matter of pride that it defends jobs, yet want us to know what the impact is going to when the Prime Minister was asked to be. guarantee that not one job would be lost she would not give that guarantee. Why would We keep being reminded by the she not give that guarantee? She would not government that this is a wonderfully vital give that guarantee because she knows the economic reform, yet by their own admission truth. The truth is the carbon tax will lead to they cannot say what the impact is going to a destruction of jobs. be and, more to the point, they cannot tell us who the 500 big polluters are. We know that Ms SAFFIN (Page) (19:50): I have the supposed 500 big polluters dipped down listened to the honourable member for to around 400 and then went back up to 500.

That is what the happening. This again betrays his inability to government is doing.

Foreign Affairs and Trade: Language Fluency (Question No. 332) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 24 March 2011: (1) How many ambassadors/high commissioners are fluent in the official language of the country in which they are currently posted. (2) How many departmental officials are considered fluent in (a) Bahasa Indonesia or other Indonesian dialects, (b) Japanese, (c) Mandarin, (d) Hindi, (e) Korean, (f) Arabic, (g) French, and (h) German. Mr Rudd: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 31 ambassadors/high commissioners are fluent in the official language of the country to which they are currently posted where English is not the official language. (2) The following table shows the number of departmental officials fluent in the particular language: Language Number Indonesian 79 Japanese 45 Mandarin 75 Hindi3 Korean 13 Arabic 21 French 134 German 50 Visits by Overseas Delegations (Question No. 334) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 24 March 2011: (1) How many overseas delegations were sponsored by the Government in each calendar year from 2005 to 2010. (2) From what countries were these delegations, and what were the names and positions of each delegation member. (3) What was the total cost to the Government of these delegations in each calendar year from 2005 to 2010. Mr Rudd: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: To provide the detailed information sought on overseas delegation visits would entail a significant diversion of resources requiring input from all departments and agencies and all overseas posts. I do not consider the additional work can be justified. Papua New Guinea: Corruption Cases (Question No. 343) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 24 March 2011: (1) How many cases of alleged corruption in Papua New Guinea (a) are currently being investigated, and (b) were investigated in each calendar year from 2005 to 2010. (2) In each calendar year from 2005 to 2010, how many of the cases in part (1)(b) resulted in (a) dismissal, (b) fine, (c) demotion, or (d) other penalty being handed down. (3) What sum of money was lost to corruption in Papua New Guinea in each calendar year from 2005 to 2010. Mr Rudd: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It is not possible to provide authoritative and reliable information in response to these questions. I am advised that PNG authorities do not aggregate data on cases of alleged corruption. Therefore, there is no accurate information available from PNG to answer these questions. International organisations and their affiliates, such as Transparency International and Transparency International PNG Inc, provide general assessments of corruption related activity in PNG. However, detailed case information is not available. In March 2010, the PNG Government tabled an 800-page Commission of Inquiry report on the management of public monies by the PNG Department of Finance. The Commission of Inquiry concluded that statutory processes had been grossly abused allowing improper claims for payment to be made on the State, and excessive payouts to be legitimised, over the investigation period of 2000 to 2006. However, corruption covers a range of offences wider than the misuse of public money covered in the Commission of Inquiry report. Australian Defence Force: Health Records (Question No. 449) Mr Robert Asked the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 4 July 2011: Can health records of members of the Australian Defence Force, including (a) medical assessments, (b) psychological assessments, and (c) counselling interviews and records, be subpoenaed by either civilian or military prosecutors or other legal authorities; if so, can he say whether any such records were seized or subpoenaed as part of the general court martial proceedings brought against SergeantJ and Lance CorporalD in relation to the 12 February 2009 Civilian Casualty Incident in Afghanistan. Mr Stephen Smith: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Documents in the possession of the Department of Defence, including personnel records, in relation to Australian Defence Force members and Defence employees can be sought under subpoena or summons issued by a Court or Tribunal or under a statutory Notice to Produce. The type of documents that can be sought under subpoena, summons or statutory notice to produce in respect of Australian Defence Force members include health records such as a member's medical assessments, psychological assessments and counselling interviews and records. Subsection 138(2) of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 (Cth) allows the Registrar of Military Justice to issue a summons ordering production of documents held by the Department of Defence for the purposes of a proceeding before a service tribunal. Summonses under subsection 138(2) can be issued at the request of either a defending officer or a prosecutor in the particular proceeding. However, no medical assessments, psychological assessments, or counselling interviews and records, were subpoenaed or seized by either civilian or military prosecutors or other legal authorities as part of the general court martial proceedings brought against SergeantJ and Lance CorporalD in relation to the 12 February 2009 Civilian Casualty Incident in Afghanistan. (2) Consistent with the Privacy Act 1988, access to information from health records of Australian Defence Force members may also be given to Service police engaged in the investigation of a service offence under the Defence Force Discipline Act. There is a Defence Instruction (General) which addresses the privacy of health information in Defence and, among other things, sets out the process for the Service Police to request access to health information of Defence members. This process includes criteria which are to be taken into account by an investigator in deciding to make request and a process to make the request. This process does not allow Service Police unlimited access to health information, such as psychological records, of members of the Defence Force. In effect the only information accessible by Service Police is information that serves a legitimate forensic purpose in respect of a particular Defence Force Discipline Act investigation. During the investigation of possible service offences arising from 12 February 2009 Civilian Casualty Incident in Afghanistan, the Australian Defence Force Investigative Service (ADFIS) requested access to the psychological records of SergeantJ and Lance CorporalD in accordance with the guidance contained in the Defence Instruction. In requesting these records, ADFIS determined they were pertinent to the pursuit of an authorised Defence Force Discipline Act investigation and limited their request to documents concerning the deployment of these members to Afghanistan and to any subsequent treatment that could be related to their deployment. Relevant psychological records of both members were subsequently included in the ADFIS Brief of Evidence provided to military prosecutors. Treasury: Advisory Committee Membership (Question No. 462) Mr Hockey asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 16 August 2011: Who are the members of the advisory committee that advised the Treasurer and the Treasury to increase the gross debt limit of Commonwealth Government Securities. Mr Swan: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As noted in Statement 7 of Budget Paper1 the panel included representatives of the Treasury, the AOFM, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the State Treasury Corporations of NSW and Victoria. Private sector market participants in the panel included representatives of major retail banks, fund managers and investment banks. Dawson Electorate: Bucasia Post Office (Question No. 468) Mr Christensen asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 16 August 2011: (1) Is he aware of the announced closure of the Post Office in Bucasia, Mackay, by Australia Post? (2) Is he able to intervene to stop the closure of the Bucasia Post Office; if not, what measures can Australia Post implement to ensure that there is easy access to postal and other services currently provided to Bucasia residents, particularly elderly residents, by the existing Bucasia Post Office. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Australia Post has advised that the Licensee at Bucasia is seeking to relocate the Licensed Post Office (LPO) to a new shopping centre in the neighbouring suburb of Eimeo in March 2012. Australia Post is supporting the relocation of the LPO for the following reasons:  the lease on the current LPO premises expires in March 2012 and there is no option to extend;  the current LPO premises are cramped and unable to cater for storage of carded articles and parcels;  customer numbers in Bucasia are declining and relocating the LPO to alternative premises in Bucasia would not provide sufficient opportunity for growth;  the Licensee wants to address declining customer numbers and to make postal services available to more residents in the Mackay area; and  the proposed location for the LPO is the focal point for the Northern Beaches area of Mackay and will allow a strong postal business to develop. (2) No. As a Government Business Enterprise, Australia Post is responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation, which includes making decisions about the opening, closing and relocating of postal outlets. Australia Post has advised that it invited more than 350 local residents to a community meeting on 29 June 2011 to discuss the proposed relocation of the LPO and seek feedback. The 13 residents who attended the meeting were advised a large proportion of Bucasia residents already travel to other areas for work and shopping and, consequently, use the postal services in those areas. The street posting boxes will be retained in Bucasia so local residents can continue to post their mail. The proposed location for the LPO is easily accessible by bus and will have dedicated parking for LPO customers. Resources, Energy and Tourism: Tourism Division Leased Offices (Question No. 475) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister for Tourism, in writing, on 16 August 2011: In respect of the Tourism division of his department, what are the details of all: (a) leased offices, including the (i) address, (ii) size, (iii) total sum of annual rent (in Australian dollars), and (iv) sum of annual rent per square metre (in Australian dollars); and (b) offices owned by his department, including the (i) address, (ii) size, and (iii) annual depreciation expense. Mr Martin Ferguson: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Tourism Division does not lease or rent offices. (b) The Department of Resources, Energy& Tourism does not own any offices. Tourism Australia: Staffing (Question No. 477) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister for Tourism, in writing, on 16 August 2011: In respect of Tourism Australia: (1) As at 1 July 2011, what total number of staff were employed by this agency.

Mr Martin Ferguson: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 216 (including 8 staff on maternity leave) (2) Tourism Australia does not employ staff under the APS classification framework and instead uses a 7 Band system. Bands1 to 4 inclusive closely approximate APS and EL classifications.

Investment Policies (Question No. 480) Mr Oakeshott asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 16 August 2011: Do investment guidelines exist for ethical investment of public money, including the Future Fund; if so, are they publicly available; if not, what steps are being taken to introduce ethical investing guidelines throughout the Commonwealth public sector. Mr Swan: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The broad framework for the management of public money and property is contained within the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 which includes the requirement that agency Chief Executives manage agencies' affairs in a way that promotes the efficient, effective and ethical use of Commonwealth resources. Investment policies are the responsibility of the relevant investment bodies, subject to the legislation applying to these bodies. For example, the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, which is the consolidated trustee board for Commonwealth superannuation schemes, details its environmental, social and governance practices on its website (http://www.aria.gov.au/about/governance/esg.html). The Future Fund Act 2006 sets out the main objective of the Fund, which is to enhance the Commonwealth's ability to discharge unfunded superannuation liabilities. The Government expresses its broad expectations for the investments and management of the Future Fund through the issuance of Investment Mandate Directions (the Investment Mandate). The Investment Mandate was issued by the previous government in 2006. The Government is committed to ensuring that the investment activities of the Future Fund Board of Guardians (the Board) remain independent of Government and for this reason does not interfere in its investment decisions. This is in the best interest of the tax payer. The Board has a Statement of Investment Policies for the governance and management of the Future Fund. This is a public document and the current version is available on the Future Fund website (www.futurefund.gov.au) under 'Investment'. Among other matters included in its Statement of Investment Policies, the Future Fund has made it clear that it expects to consider investments across a wide variety of economic activities, provided they are legal in Australia and do not contravene international conventions to which Australia is a signatory. Beef Imports (Question No. 484) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Trade, in writing, on 16 August 2011: (1) Is he aware that data on the United States Department of Agriculture's website indicates that substantial quantities of beef and beef products have been exported to Australia since 2003. (2) Is it a fact that beef or beef products have been imported into Australia from the United States of America (USA) since 2003. (3) What is the Government's position on the threat of Bovine Spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) contaminated beef and beef products emanating from the USA, and how is the Government disseminating information to Australian consumers about the potential health threat this poses. (4) What steps is the Government taking to curtail the importation of beef and beef products from the USA to protect consumers and encourage greater consumption of Australian grown, BSE-free beef. Dr Emerson: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Notwithstanding the US Department of Agriculture export statistics, the United States (US) Government has publicly confirmed that no US-sourced cattle, or fresh, chilled or frozen US beef has been exported to Australia since December 2003. Australian official import statistics are the source of information on beef imports on which the Australian Government relies. These are based on documentation accompanying product cleared at the border. This is supported by import permit information held by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. (2) Australia has not imported beef from cattle slaughtered in the US after December 2003. There are valid import permits for beef that is processed in the US, but only where the beef is sourced from the following approved countries: Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. Australia's import permits for these beef products set stringent conditions to ensure that beef from approved countries does not co-mingle in the production process with beef from the US. (3) The Government will not permit the importation of BSE contaminated beef from any country. (4) Australia has not imported beef from cattle slaughtered in the US after December 2003. Under Australia's new BSE policy for imported beef, countries that have had one or more cases of BSE in their cattle herd (such as the US) can apply to be assessed for access to Australia's beef market. Applications to import beef will be assessed by Australian authorities under two procedures – a food safety risk assessment by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) and an import risk analysis (IRA) by Biosecurity Australia for animal health issues. Biosecurity Australia commenced a regulated IRA of all animal health issues (not just BSE) for beef and beef products from the US on 8 April 2010. Work on the IRA for beef and beef products from the US was paused on 4 February 2011 pending the US providing complete information on its cattle health status, beef production, inspection and certification systems. As at August 2011, this information has still not been provided. assessment is on hold pending an in-country inspection of US beef production systems at a date yet to be agreed with the US authorities. Australian Red Cross (Question No. 488) Mr Oakeshott asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 16 August 2011: Is the Government aware that the Australian Red Cross has approved a proposal to undertake a leading role within the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, to publicly support an international convention rendering the use of nuclear weapons clearly illegal under international law; if so, will the Government consider supporting the development of such a convention and undertake to become a signatory to such an instrument. The Australian Government is aware of the Australian Red Cross' proposal to publicly support and advocate for an international convention to prohibit the use of nuclear weapons. Australia is a steadfast supporter of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, including through support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the multilateral United Nations disarmament machinery. The Government is firmly committed to the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. The international community may need to explore possible legal frameworks for the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons, such as the convention proposed by the Australian Red Cross, as prospects for multilateral disarmament improve. The Government places priority on promoting: an immediate start to negotiation of a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty; entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty; stronger international nuclear safeguards, particularly through universalisation of the International Atomic Energy Agency Additional Protocol; and greater transparency in nuclear disarmament reporting. The Government sees these measures as collectively contributing to nuclear non-proliferation and to achieving the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. Digital Switchover Household Assistance Scheme (Question No. 500) Mr Fletcher asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 16 August 2011: In respect of the Deeds of Agreement that the Commonwealth has entered into 'for the provision of services related to the Digital Switchover Household Assistance Scheme' in different geographic locations around Australia, what are the: (1) parties to each Deed of Agreement, by geographical location, and (2) service charges that each contractor with the Commonwealth will be paid per item/service pursuant to the respective agreement, in a form similar to that set out in Schedule 3, clause 1.1 of the standard Deed of Agreement that his department has made publicly available. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The following Deeds of Agreement, parties, by geographical location, have been entered into for the provision of services related to the Digital Switchover Scheme:",218,Gnccl Said We Have Actively Investigated Across The Board There Is Particular Anxiety

Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: NBN Co Limited (NBN Co) has reporting obligations defined in the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, the Governance Arrangements for Commonwealth Government Business Enterprises June 1997 and the Corporations Act 2001. The NBN Co Annual Report will include details of progress towards meeting its coverage objectives and expenditure in doing so. NBN Co is required to submit its Annual Report to Shareholder Ministers for tabling at least 4 months after the end of the financial year. NBN Co will be including updated information in its Corporate Plan in line with the timetable established by Government. The Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network (NBN) has been appointed to inquire into the NBN rollout and report every six months to the Parliament and its Shareholder Ministers. Information on progress with the NBN rollout will be provided for the Committee’s six-monthly reports.

Mr Stephen Smith: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Neither a restricted nor an open tender for the DECO replacement IT system were conducted. A feasibility study has been conducted by the Defence Chief Information Officer Group and it is intended that the Request for Tender will proceed in the upcoming weeks. (b) Neither a restricted nor an open tender for the DECO replacement IT system were conducted. IBM Australia Limited were approached to submit a quote for the DECO replacement IT which was not accepted. The Defence Chief Information Officer Group will be proceeding to Request for Tender in the upcoming weeks. (2) Neither a restricted nor an open tender for the DECO replacement IT system were conducted. IBM Australia Limited were approached to submit a quote for the DECO replacement IT which was not accepted. The Defence Chief Information Officer Group will be proceeding to Request for Tender in the upcoming weeks. (3) DECO has not begun transition to the DECO replacement IT system as it has not yet been developed. It is estimated that the new system should be operational in the first half of 2012. (4) (a) The cost per annum of delivering the DECO replacement IT system will be determined as part of the Request for Tender process. (b) The cost per annum of running the DECO replacement IT system will be determined as part of the Request for Tender process. (5) Defence decided to replace the DECO IT system because the DECO IT system: Is now obsolete having been introduced in 1992. Is very difficult to support with little effective back up available. Has not kept pace with changes to legislation, including the introduction of the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Act 1995. Does not support an optimal staffing structure and provides an ineffective paper-based and labour intensive system. Is a 'stand-alone' system that runs on separate hardware and networking infrastructure, independent from all Defence Chief Information Officer Group governance and sustainment arrangements. The DECO replacement IT system offers the following advantages over the DECO IT system: It will be supported by the Defence Chief Information Officer Group on existing Defence Restricted Network and Defence Secret Network infrastructure, hence supporting the ICT savings stream of the Defence Strategic Reform Program. It will offer an approved assessment process which will allow DECO staff to more easily focus on analysing the policy issues in export cases and to assess them more thoroughly, consistently and quickly. This would allow existing DECO staff levels to accommodate a rising volume of export applications, and would accommodate expected additional work under legislative amendments currently being proposed. It will deliver an e-business approach for Exporters who will be able to submit applications and other required documentation online. It will better facilitate coordination of complex cases which, require classified input from other government departments and specialist areas within Defence. It will offer an updated modern database which will improve reporting and analysis for DECO and other specialist areas within Defence. (6) The DECO replacement IT system has not yet been developed, however it will be built to meet the requirements of the DECO which include the requirements of the Defence Trade Controls Bill 2011. It is also planned to ensure that the DECO replacement IT system will be flexible enough to cope with evolving United States requirements and Australian legislation.
