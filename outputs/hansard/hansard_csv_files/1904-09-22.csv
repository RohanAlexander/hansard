He, a professing freeaddition to the Tariff protection, as much as 15 per cent, preference to local manufacturers ; but in charging me with want of courage in the matter he was evidently in ignorance of a question which I answered in this House as far back as the 13th July.

Whether, other things being equal, or nearly equal, the Postmaster-General will be prepared I find also a very sarcastic referto give a preference to the Australian-made insulator ? If he will also be prepared to give a preference under similar conditions to Australian made insulator fittings? The Department prepared a reply giving an affirmative answer to all three questions; but when the paper came into my possession, I changed the answers, and I replied to No. 1 ""Yes,"" while in reply to Nos. 2 and 3 I saidThe quality and price being equal, I should be prepared 10 give preference to any article produced in Australia.",12,Setup

I would point out further that, when I declined to deal with those tenders, the Government were on the point of going out of office, and I had no opportunity to bring the matter before the Cabinet.

In giving the answer which I did, I acted entirely upon my own initiatenders.

53,Mr Johnson (Lang),"I also desireWANT OF CONFIDENCE Debate resumed from 21st September (vide page 4822), on motion by Mr on the government of the country without That the present Administration does not possess the confidence of this House. When I closed my remarks last evening, I had decided not to deal further with the financial matters to which I had directed attention. I wish, however, to recapitulate the position which I then took up in regard to the Prime Minister's financial administration in New South Wales. As honourable members are aware, a charge of maladministration has been levelled against the right honourable gentleman by those newspapers which are opposed to the present coalition Government, and .has been repeated in this House. Briefly, I wish to state that, prior to his assumption of the office of Treasurer in New South Wales, Sir John See had declared in his financial statement that there was a deficiency of £1,200,000, which he intended to cover by the issue of Treasury bills. Shortly afterwards the Dibbs Government went to the country and was defeated, and in consequence of that defeat the present Prime Minister came into power. In his Budget speech the right honourable gentleman also reported that there was a deficiency of £1,200,000, which he intended ; -lik e his predecessors-to cover by the issue of Treasury-bills. That operation was carried out by the present Prime Minister, and as a result these charges of maladministration have been made. Formerly it was possible to deceive Parliament and the country as to the actual financial position. The right honourable gentleman, however, initiated a cash system of keeping the public accounts; but, of course, the amounts which had been voted for. works in previous years had to be paid. In order that his cash system should receive a fair start, the right honourable gentleman resolved to cover all the pavments for previous years by the issue of Treasury-bills Effect was given to that proposal by the New South Wales Parliament, the members of which knew perfectly well what they were doing. Out of that operation, which was supported by the Labour Party, these charges of maladministration have originated, notwithstanding that everything was done openly and above' board. of the right honourable gentleman's administration having been a failure, it was exactly the reverse. As a matter of fact he reduced the taxation of New South Wales by £800,000, and succeeded in carrying creating a deficiency such as had been the case in previous years. If we look at the revenue derived during his tenure of office we shall see that it was lower than that which had been collected in New South Wales for many years. After the right honourable gentleman vacated office, New South Wales collected a much larger revenue through the Customs, owing to the increased duties imposed by this Parliament. Last year the Government of that State received £2,000,000 more than was collected when the present Prime Minister held office there, and yet it was unable to carry on without a deficit. The right honourable gentleman also very considerably reduced the loan expenditure of New South Wales, which, however, since his retirement from State politics, has again increased. If there is any man to whom New South Wales should feel grateful for having reduced its expenditure and conducted all its operations upon aneconomical scale, it is the Prime Minister. that the honourable member should threaten it in this way ? I have said anything about Tasmania; if so, I apologise to that State. I was referring to the charges which have been levelled against the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Wide Bay may be a little facetious if he chooses, but that will not prevent me from saying what I desire to say. ber think that it is possible to get away from old political squabbles in New South Wales? members opposite who wish to revive those squabbles. Certain charges have been made against the Piime Minister, and I have P perfect right to make clear the character of his administration whilst occupying Ministerial office in New South Wales. Those charges have been made merely for the purpose of damaging the Government. MT.

As a free-trader I insist that no preference should be given to any manufacturer. No administrative act should be in the direction of altering the policy of the country.' That should be altered by Parliament alone. The position taken up by the honourable member for Coolgardie is the correct one, and I am fair enough to commend him for it. the statement the policy of the present Government is a colourless one. From what we have been told it appears that honourable members opposite are the men to save the country. They are going to uplift the masses, better their conditions, and give them larger opportunities for improving themselves. But when we come to analyse their proposals we find that these claims cannot be sustained. They declare that the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill in its present form is a fraud, and should not have been passed by this House. Yet they were prepared to forward that measure to the Senate despite all its alleged blemishes. They were ready to transmit it to the other Chamber without making it what they wished that it should be. What is the difference between the B ill in its present form and that in which honourable members opposite desired it ? They were anxious that clause 48 should provide that if any union substantially represented those engaged in a particular industry it should be competent for the President of the Arbitration Court to grant a preference to unionists, whereas the B ill provides that such a preference shall be extended only when a union contains a majority of the workers engaged in the industry directly concerned. The distinction really lies between what constituted a "" majority "" and "" substantial representation."" all. quoted the exact provision in the clause,but what I have stated constitutes the sole difference between us. I claim that that difference is a very slight one. The honourable member for Bland admitted I s the honourable member that the Court would expect a substantial representation to include a majority, and if that be so, there was no difference in the I am as good a finanBUI as sentup to the Senate by the present Ministerial party, and as it would have been sent up by the party which has reConcerning the explanation which cently retired from office. honourable members opposite vote against the proposal of the late Ministry? determined that the reference to a majorityshould remain in the Bill. In order that the Court might not have any difference of opinion or difficulty in the matter, we proposed to declare in the B ill that there must be a majority in order to secure preference. During the course of this debate I say that we'were justified in determining has been made that that the provision should remain in that form. We are told that honourable members opposite now represent a Liberal Protectionist Alliance. I do not know how they define ""Liberalism""; but it sounds strange to me to call men "" Liberals"" who are prepared to put restrictions upon people in every direction. If honourable members opposite, instead of calling themselves "" Liberal Protectionists,"" were to call themselves ""Liberal Restrictionists,"" I could understand it. orable members on the Government side.' it hits; I stand here in support of the principles I have advocated. If I support the present Ministerial party, it is because I think there is less danger to what I believe to be right to be expected from this side than from honourable members opposite, and because I-think we are more likely to get good legislation in the interests of the whole of the people from this side, than from honourable members opposite. I am here to defend my own personal views, and I shall not allow any one to control me in that direction. I should not be surprised if honourable members opposite called themselves ""Libera l Restrictionists,"" although I cannot understand how a "" restrictionist"" can in any circumstances be called a "" Liberal.""

If a Federal system cost £1,500,000 per annum, it would be necessary, under our Constitution, to raise £6,000,000 in order to pay for it, so that we must make some arrangement with the States to utilize Customs revenue in that direction. If the Labour Party are so strongly in favour of old age pensions, how is it that the Queensland Labour Government has not introduced the system there? include such a proposal. bour Government in Western Australia do the same thing? I am opposed to the position taken up by the Labour Party, but I do not wish it to be understood for one moment that I am hostile to the cause of labour. Labour has my deepest sympathy, and I am prepared to assist in passing any legislation in its interests. But to attempt by means of a Conciliation and Arbitration Act to help the masses, is just as useless as it is to seek to quench a fire by spitting on it. No good would result from the passing of such a measure. keep up the standard of wages in a falling market? I have been opposed to conciliation and arbitration legislation, because at best it can be only a palliative. It cannot prevent the recurrence of such disputes and difficulties as have arisen in the past. I shall certainly do all I can in opposition to the passing of any restrictive legislation. I believe in developing the freedom of every individual, and in giving every man the fullest opportunity to use the powers with which he is endowed. By working in that direction alone shall, we secure the salvation of the people. We cannot hope to help them by restricting the use of individual power. We have seen the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of New South Wales working in such a way that, as the result of the section dealing with the limitation of apprentices, many lads have been prevented from obtaining work, and have been sent out into the streets. Instead of giving every man the fullest opportunity to do the best he can for himself, it is having the opmember for West Sydney. I wish to say, posite effect. I am not one of those who believe that every worker should be paid the same wage. All men differ. Their capacity varies, and each man ought to receive only that which he himself earns. I feel that no man, whether engaged in manufacturing or other pursuits, should by law receive any special privilege over the rest of the people. If our States were to adopt a different system-if we were to make use of our unoccupied lands, under an intelligent land policy-the trouble' and difficulty which exist to-day in the Commonwealth would soon disappear, and instead of the poverty and misery which we see about us, we should have happy homes and much brighter conditions. But these attempts to establish a tobacco monopoly, and other proposals of that nature, tp help the community, are silly and absurd, and so far as I am concerned will receive no assistance. for Parramatta yesterday made a number of statements which may be left to look after themselves; but there is one thing that he said which I shall take this opportunity to correct.

Subsequently the honourable and learned member for Ballarat stated that one thing which must be considered in .the matter of an agreement between two parties was that the members of those parties must not be found flying at each other's throats at the next election. We heard quite a different expression of opinion from the .right honourable member for East Sydney, He stated that to make compacts with another party when an election was imminent was legitimate, but that a compact made now as to what was to happen at the next election merited the strongest condemnation. Consequently, the actions of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat at that time, in the opinion of the light honourable gentleman at the head of the Government, merited the strongest condemnation. to deal for a brief time with a few of the opinions which members of the two groups on the Government side of the House have held concerning one another at different periods during their political career.

We find, however, that, despite those serious differences of opinionI am safe, I think, in thus referring to the position-the present Government, and their supporters have agreed on one point, viz., that the Labour Party of this country must be checked and "" downed."" One of the first reasons which honourable members opposite advance for their present stand is that we on this side obtain our political positions by the assistance of a machine which they intend to remove. I should like for a moment to refer to this so-called political machine, which honourable members on the other side take a particular delight in denouncing. The mode in which all honourable members on this side enter this Chamber may not be altogether the same, but is very nearly the same in all portions of Australia. Before a man is permitted to be a candidate under our flag he. must be a member of a trade union or a labour league; and in that matter there are no restrictions. There is no member in this House who, if he desires to join the leagues, may not do so. There is no clique; the party is not reserved for a few, but is open to all who desire to enter. When it is agreed that a labour man shall be nominated for a certain constituency, the candidate must possess the goodwill of a majority of those who know him best, and he must subscribe to the platform. But what is the course adopted by the Free-trade Party? As an illustration, I might point to my interjecting friend the honourable member for Wentworth. If he had not had the good grace of the honourable and learned member for East Sydney, and had not been placed on the free-trade ticket, what chance would he have had of being a member of this Parliament ? If the honourable member had not had behind him the influence of the great Sydney newspapers and learned member for East Sydney before I announced myself as a candidate. ent matter. What chance would the honourable member have had had his name not appeared on the free-trade ticket? As I say, our candidates have to submit themselves to the goodwill of those who know them best. On the other side, the partiI wonder if cular gentleman who is at the head of the free-trade organization obtains the assistance of the great daily newspapers, in Sydney, for instance, for certain candidates, with the result that these gentlemen are entirely at his mercy. As an illustration of the method adopted by the Labour Party, I may take the case' of Senator de Largie in Western Australia. That gentleman was nominated by the Labour Party for the Senate, and a plebiscite was taken of trade unionists and members of labour organizations generally in Western Australia, with the result that at the preliminary poll Senator de Largie was selected as the candidate by about 8,500 votes.

The object of the Labour Party is to make that Bill apply to the industries of the country as a whole, and we are met with the cry, ""Oh, save the poor farmer and the poor fruit-grower!"" The other day we had from the Minister of Trade and Customs a statement that the policy of the Labour Party is to tax the progentleman's word, I can only say that he ducer off the land. AmI correctly representing what the Minister said? quite right.

The policy that the party with which I am associated intend to adopt is one of the utmost consideration for the men who are producing wealth from the soil. want to tax is he who is not producing, but is keeping the land locked up from those who want to produce. A few months ago it was Stated in the Tocsin, and the statement has not been disputed, because it is innote-and I should like his understudy in disputable, that there are 2,560,000 acres of the most fertile land in Victoria which are locked up by great landlords, and which support only 7869 persons.

Tiade and Customs was the first, as a State Minister, to encourage settlement on a large scale in Victoria. that the honourable gentleman, at that time, allowed his gaze to miss this awful exhibition of a few people holding millions of which I was the head, resumed and distributed amongst the people nearly all the estates that have been resumed for settlement in Victoria. have no reason to doubt the honourable was on the right track, and that it is a pity he was not allowed to stay in the State Parliament and continue the good work. T should like to lay before honourable members the opinions which were expressed by the present head of the Government in regard to the farmers at a particular time. The right honourable gentleman, at Warragul and Kyneton, delivered brilliant addresses and aroused his audiences to a high pitch of enthusiasm. It would appear that of late his one mission in life is to remove any illThe man we feeling which may have existed between the residents of Victoria and the residents of New South Wales, and to that end he is going to clasp the farmers to his bosom, At the present juncture, it is interesting to the House to listen to this-wha t he said in the Melbourne Town Hall in December, 1899. On that occasion he saidThat door which was open in the mother colony always was going to be open in all Australia. How does that suit the Minister of Trade and Customs? With all these barriers down, the stock f atteners and wheat farmers would feel the cold southerly wind of a world's competition. gentleman is of the same opinion still. honourable gentleman is disguising or keeping that opinion in the background. When addressing them of late, he has not promised them "" cold, southerly winds,"" but the warmth of his own bosom.

They intend to go to extremes in their endeavour to defeat the Labour Party at the next election ; and, peculiarly enough, they are calling in the assistance of the ladies. At the Masonic Hall, Collins-street, Melbourne, the other night, at a fullypacked meeting ready to cheer the Prime Minister when he cracked some of his familiar jokes, that gentleman when he had delivered his vigorous denunciation of the Labour Party, said :"" In this hall, there must be no society distinctions. The' missus ' must grasp toher bosom the ' Mary' that works the gridiron."" To the women of the Commonwealth he looked to save the country from the extremes of labour legislation. But if the right honourable gentleman had so much consideration for the interests of the females of this country, if he was so anxious that they should exercise the franchise, and should make their influence felt upon the policv of the Commonwealth, how it is that, during the five years that he was in office in New South Wales, he refused to give the women of that State the right to vote ? reflection upon the party by which he was kept in power? member for Swan, who is another of those who are foremost now in addressing meetings of females, was at the head of a Ministry for ten years without giving them a vote.

It has been in the platform of the Labour Party as long as I remember, arid if it had not been continually advocated by that party, the ladies of Australia would never have obtained the right to vote. When honourable members opposite are addressing meetings of ladies, their auditors know that it is the Labour Party whom they have to thank for their right to vote, and I believe that their gratitude will cause them not to forget us when the time to vote comes. Another statement of the Prime Minister of which notice must be taken, because of the high position which he occupies, though it may be only temporarily, was that the Labour Party wish for the creation of an Arbitration Court in order to starve the wives and children of non-unionists. That is one of the greatest misrepresentations of our desires that has been put before the people of Australia. existing arbitration legislation has enabled us to gauge pretty accurately what is required to make a Commonwealth arbitration measure successful. Arbitration Acts are in force in two of the States, but it has been found in Western Australia that a provision giving preference to unionists is necessary, and the Government of that State propose to amend the Act by the insertion of such a provision. We have always maintained that for the successful administration of an Arbitration Act, and to secure the industrial peace of Australia, it is necessary that those who are banded together in organizations should have some interest in supporting that legislation; that some return should be made to them for their action in foregoing the right to strike when dissatisfied with their conditions, and for undertaking the expense of conducting cases before the Arbitration Courts. We say that I advocated woman's sufthose who belong to unions should be placed in as good a position as those who ,are not members of unions, who are put to no expense, who do not give evidence before the Arbitration Courts, and yet who benefit by all their awards. To speak of "" preference v to unionists "" is a misnomer. What we desire should be termed "" security to unionists."" It is the bitter experience of unionists in all parts of Australia that those who have taken a prominent part in conducting the affairs of It was one of the prinunions, either by appearing before Courts of Arbitration, or in other ways, have often Then the honourable afterwards found that their positions have been filled by others, although they had hitherto done their work with entire satisfaction to their employers.

Our experience ofand it is therefore necessary that there should be some legislation -which will give security to those who are responsible for the conduct of the affairs of the Labour organizations. we wish to starve the wives and children of non-unionists. Labour Party has, from its inception to the present time, consistently tried to bring about better conditions for the people of Australia. such that we need not fear such slanders. Incidentally, I would point out that during the present debate we have had the expression of the views of only one-half of the head of the Goveinment. Apparently, the Ministry are reserving themselves for a final rush before the division bell rings; but probably the result will be like what is happening to the Japanese at Port Arthur, that when they make it, they will suffer very severely. The final objection of the Prime Minister to the Labour Party is that we are a pack of extremists. Honourable members opposite refer to themselves as a combination of moderates, and I am very pleased to obtain from their own lips a name by which I mav refer to them. They are certainly very moderate in their attendance in this Chamber at the present time. their moderation will carry them. Is tlie moderation of the honourable member for Gippsland the same thing as that of the honotrable member for Kooyong, of the honourable member for New England, and of the honourable member for Lang? Are the other members of the party prepared to go as far as the Prime Minister wishes to go, and to remove from the Immigration Restriction Act the provision relating to are quite prepared to ignore! the inclusion of contract labour, and from the Post and Telegraph Act the provision relating to the employment of black labour on mail boats ? I think that their moderation is likely to carry them backwards in more senses than one. Not only will they be retrogressive in their legislation, but their policy will carry them back to this side of the Chamber with which they are more familiar. The Prime Minister was elected as a free trader, but he declared, when speaking on the Address-in-Reply, that, so far as the fiscal situation was concerned, there was an armed truce. How long is that armed truce to last? W ill it continue as long as the presentcoalition remains in office ? Is it not rather a truce for the burial of the dead? Has not the right honourable member now got rid of the obstacle which for so long prevented him from obtaining office? There is nothing very contentious in the programme of the Government. Their chief plank is to get into recess as It is a slander to say that soon as possible. On the contrary, the member blame them ? only hope of remaining in office. I would blame honourable members' on this side, Our reputation, however, is however, if they did not take the first opportunity to toss them out of office. A l though honourable members opposite differ on many things; but they are in absolute agreement upon the first plank of their platform. member's party are in agreement upon a second plank-that the Ministry shall not get into recess. why they should not get into recess, I will refer to a few remarks which we have heard from them on other occasions, and to the methods which they adopted for obtaining office. Both the' Prime Minister and his better-half declared that it would be unconstitutional to bring the public servants of the States and of the Commonwealth under the Arbitration B ill . I should like to know how far If it were not unconstitutional, they declared that it was inexpedient that it would cause considerable dissatisfaction amongst the State's, and that it involved a veiy serious encroachment upon State rights. Indeed, the'honourable and learned member for Ballarat affirmed that it was the first step towards wrecking the Federation. But the present Government, since their advent to office, practically say, ""We the public servants of the States within the scope of the B ill , and to disregard the injury which will be done to State rights if we can only get into recess ."" 1 bers go back upon their votes? have declared, as d i d the honourable member for Bland, that they were prepared to adopt the B ill in a certain form, and that if the House declined to allow them to do so, they would relinquish office.

It is a very significant circumstance that, in making his declaration of policy, the Prime Minister entirely forgot to mention the matter of old-age pensions. The desire to alleviate the sufferings of our aged poor was of such vital concern to him that he completely overlooked the question. From a second instalment of the Ministerial policy, delivered at a subsequent sitting, we. learned that he proposes to consult the States Governments in regard to it. I admit that it is desirable that the Commonwealth should work amicably with the States, but when the Prime Minister proposes ' to make the comfort of the declining years of the aged poor dependent upon the decision of the States Governments, I must cross swords with him. A vast majority of honourable members are pledged to old-age pensions, and must accept responsibility fot imposing any extra taxation which the carrying out of such a scheme may render necessary. So far as the electors represented by the Labour Party are concerned, we are prepared to pledge them to that additional taxation, in order to bring about an improvement in the condition of our aged poor. I, for one, will never sanction the welfare of these persons being intrusted, say, to the decision of the Premier of Victoria-to give a specific instance. say upon that question ? troduce a measure providing for old-age pensions, as soon as possible. that, but it might mean it. don. following plank:-""Old-ag e pensions, on a basis fair and equitable to the States.""

There are specific reasons why we can have no trust in him. The right honourable gentleman has said, "" When I get into a position to do so I shall remove from the Immigration Restriction Act that obnoxious clause which prevents the introduction of contract labour to Australia."" The alliance does not say Sir JOHN FORREST I s it not much better that a man should say straightforwardly I beg the Minister's parwhat he will do? tely better that a man should say what he proposes to do when he gets into a position of power, but in the case of the Prime Minister we find that, instead of endeavouring to do what he has pledged himself to do, he is careful to say nothing about it at the present time.",29,Watson

Sir JOHN members have interjected again and again, that I desired to oust the Labour Government from office from the very first day that they met the House. The suggestion, apparently, is that I had some personal objection to the honourable member for Bland assuming office. That was not the case. The honourable member is just as good a man to hold office as is any other member of the House. My sole objection to his Government was based upon constitutional grounds, but if my contention in that respect be erroneous, then my argument, of course, falls to the ground. able member and his party remain in office when they were in a minority ? ready explained the difference between the position of the Barton and Deakin Governments and thar occupied by the Watson Government. We were there, and had to be displaced. there. ing office contrary to constitutional usage. they had the same argument in support of their position as the right honourable gentleman's party had. and learned member is too keen a lawyer not to see my point, and it is, therefore, useless for him to inteirupt me in this way. We were in office before the first general election took place, and we remained in office until we were defeated on what we had made a vital question. That is altogether different from the position of a Government which assumes office without having a majoriry at its back. I will state a case to explain my contention. A Government is defeated, and an honourable member, who, perhaps, may be the weakest man in the House, is sent for by the Governor General; he undertakes to form a Government, but gives no assurance to His Excellency that he has a majority; he comes down to the House and asks for an adjournment of three or four weeks in order to formulate his policy, occupies the Government benches and controls the affairs of this country for a couple of months, and never had any chance whatever of commanding a majority. NowI am sure that honourable members do not desire to see such a state of things. I admit that the honourable member for Bland nearly had a majority, but he could not have comif a no-confidence motion had been moved. a majority in case a no-confidence motion was moved. orable member assured of that? that by honourable members whose word I accepted, and whom I have never reproached for taking their own course. not that the honourable member might not have gained strength as he went along, but that at the time he undertook the formation of his Government he had not that assurance which was essential. orable member know that? whole point.

Sir JOHN FORREST as I say, was intended to show that the honourable member for Perth was independent, and that he would let his party know that they could not bind him to support the new alliance. He made it clear that he thought that those who had formerly called the members of his party by opprobrious names-wh o had said that the Labour Party was a sham and a fraud -ough t not to be accepted in alliance until -they had apologized.

I should say that if was a capital piece of acting, intended to show how independent he was, although it really showed that he did not intend to exercise his independence, even in respect to an alliance with persons who had called his party a sham and a fraud. I want to ask the honourable member this questionSuppose that the motion of the honourable member for Bland is successful, and that honourable members opposite form a coalition Government, including some of the persons who have called his party a fraud, and a sham ? Where will he be then ? orable member recollect that the present Prime Minister called him and .his party, plunderers, thieves, and brigands? Sir JOHN FORREST I have never seen or heard that he has done so. The honourable member for Perth has said that those honourable members who have attacked his party ought to apologize. I ask him again-if this motion is successful, what will be his position in sitting behind a new Government, and voting with those whom he denounced last night? It might have pledges, and that is all. The object of it was, I suppose, to pledges mean everything. The honourable member will do exactly what the party does. He will do what the unions tell him to do. It cannot bind any one.

In Western Australia, for instance, the conditions of candidature of the Labour Party as regards the State Parliament, and the conditions of candidature of the Labour Party as regards the Federal Parliament may, or may not, be different; but it seems to me that the objects in each case are the same. Therefore, I do not think much of the argument that the conditions 1 of the Federal Labour Party are less stringent than the conditions of the States Labour Party.

Further on, he saidWe are willing to wait and trust to experience, to show our confidence in the working of the protectionist part of this Tariff. That was the pith of the policy upon which we went to the country, and I believe that every member of the party adopted it. But what has been the action of the honourable and learned members for Indi, and Darling Downs, of the honourable members for Hume and Bourke, and others? This alliance with the Labour Party is founded on the repudiation of their public pledges to their constituents and to the people of Australia. ber should justify the statement that I gave anv such pledge to my constituents. honourable and learned member who was a leading member of the Protectionist Party, by his silence, assented to the programme put forward by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. He was returned as a supporter of the Deakin Administration, and it is idle for him to say now that he did not in the main support the policy of his leader in regard to fiscal peace. That policy was very clearly enunciated, and the Age newspaper, which supported the Deakin Government, declared in no uncertain terms for it. In its leading columns, of the 30th October, I find the following: The first and foremost necessity of the times is a truce on the fiscal question. As long as that struggle goes on, it bars the way to any progressive legislation on other national or social questions. There is a time to draw the sword and a time to sheath it. All the interests of trade and industrial development demand for the present a cessation of fiscal hostilities. Therefore I ask why this falling off on the The verdict of Australia was in accord part of the honourable and learned member with those views. for Indi, and on the part of the honourable and all who belonged to the Protectionist member for Bourke, and others, all of whom Party at that time.

The policy of fiscal peace, announced by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, was universally accepted by the Protectionist Party. to say that every individual protectionist accepted it; but it was accepted by the party throughout Australia. I do not know what was said in Queensland and Tasmania, but in Victoria and in New South Wales, "" fiscal peace "" was the election cry of the Protectionist Party. for in Western Australia was labour. now with the fiscal issue. What did the honourable member for Barker say upon this matter? He as a protectionist, and was a member of the Protectionist Party. He saidThe Tariff was not by any means perfect, but he was for fiscal, peace during the next Parliament. Surely that is a very clear pronouncement. What was my own position in Western Australia? .My pledge to the electors of Western Australia, which was printed in the press, readsI am in favour of the existing Tariff being given a fair trial. It was arrived at after much labour and controversy, and I recognise it would be unwise to disturb it, and to do so at the presenT time would be detrimental to trade and injurious all round.

523,Mr Mclean,"He referred to me, andtralia to introduce and pass through Parliament a measure founded on the Natal Act, which is practically the same legislation as we have in existence in the. Commonwealth at the present time. I was in England at the Diamond Jubilee of her late Majesty in 1897,. when the other Australian Premiers were there. . We all agreed to do our best to pass through our respective Legislatures Bills based upon the Natal Act, rather than a measure embodying prohibition. a measure involving prohibition was passed by the Parliament of New South Wales, but the Royal Assent was withheld. I carried out the promise which I made in England. I believe that my right honourable f riend the Prime. Minister also carried out his promise, and that a similar measure was passed by the Legislature of New South Wales. In Victoria a similar Bill was introduced by my right honourable friend the Treasurer, but he was not able to pass it. In South. Australia it was introduced, I think, but afterwards withdrawn. refused to accept the Natal principle which: I wish to make is that I was the first Australian Premier to carry such a measure, through. the Legislature. If honourable members like to read my speeches: in the Western Australian ParliamentI have quoted from them before in this Housethey will see. that there was no lack of sympathy on my part concerning the White Australia policy. But while. I am in accord with the idea that we must do our utmost to keep Australia for the white race, I am altogether opposed to section 16 of the Post and Telegraph Act, and for many reasons. when I passed the Act to which I refer, and also when I passed the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, there was no payment of members and no Labour Party in Western Australia. Therefore, although there was plenty of pressure, and the conditions were difficult-as I suppose they are in all Parliaments-a t the same time we had not a concrete body of members banded together to support their own platform such as we have in the Parliaments of Australia at the present time have turned out the right honourable, member if he had not passed those Bills, i Sir.""

The only way in wh'ich I could have been turned out was by the secession of some of my own supporters; and any honourable member who has .had experience of party government is aware that very often a Minister experiences more difficulty from within, than from without.

Nevertheless, the fact remains that there was no Labour Party and no. payment of members at that time in Western Australia. Of course, the absence of payment of members restricted the. representation to some extent. There is no doubt, as every one will admit, that where there is no payment of members, many persons, who would otherwise be able to enter Parliament, cannot do so. My' honourable friend, the member for Coolgardie, seems to be alert just now. Perhaps, I have made some point at his expense. But he must expect that.

Post and Telegraph Act will cause us to be regarded as Quixotic, unpractical, and unbusinesslike. There is no doubt that this legislation will cost the Commonwealth a lot of money. I know that honourable members opposite say that the Orient Company have stated not the main reason for the increase in the amount of their tender. years ago, both the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient CompaniesI do not know whether this has been made public;, but it happened so long ago that I think I may state the fact to honourable membersthrough the Secretary of State for the Colonies, expressed their willingness to extend the present contract for two years, on the same terms In the opinion of the Government, though not in my opinion, it was thought better to have a new contract under different conditions. the question the right honourable member is discussing. Sir JOHN FORREST But the fact that the companies were willing to extend the contract on the same terms a couple of years ago, indicates that to a large extent the increased prices may be attributed to the new conditions, among which are the restrictions under section 16 of the Post and Telegraph Act. Sir JOHN FORREST regard to the Orient Company; but the Peninsular and Oriental Company has refused to tender at all. As I have said, this section will cost us a great deal of money, and that is a consideration we should not altogether disregard. In my opinion,"" the provision will retard our progress, seeing that it will interfere to some extent with our means of communication, and, altogether, the mea.sure, so far from being practical, seems to be very foolish. If we have passed legislation which is found to be adverse to our interests, financially and generally, the onlyI have previously tried to course for us is to repeal' it. The words used in the Act are ""no contract or arrangement shall be made."" I appeal to honourable members who are accustomed toread plain English, to say what the meaning of those words is. The lawyers have been at work in order to find some way out of the difficulty, and their conclusion is that if we send our mails, and pay by poundage, we do not enter into an ""arrangement ""-that it is In my opinion this section in the not an arrangement to send by the pound and pay by the pound. If that be so, it is very fortunate, because otherwise the section would prove much more injurious. To my mind, however, a "" contract or arrangement "" means any contract or arrangement under which we pay for the carrying of our that this provision is mails; and that I believe would be the definition arrived at by any ordinary man. A couple of Such a construction, however, would never suit us, because it would debar our sending mails by the Peninsular and Oriental' steamers, and by the steamers running to Japan, China, Singapore, and elsewhere. There would be no communication by post with those places, and we should be in a very difficult position. However, as I say, the legal mind has come to our rescue, and we are told that "" arrangement"" does not include paying for the carriage of our mails by the pound. The Peninsular and Oriental Company, under arrangement with the British Government, will bring the English letters out in ships, probably to some extent manned by coloured crews, and will carry our letters back to Europe, the latter, however, under the poundage system. Under such a method there would be no arrangement as to time-table, as to where the vessel should call, or how quickly they should travel, or where! they would land the mails. We should simply put our mails on board, and allow the companies to carry them over the ocean when and how they liked. Money would be paid out of The company say not. the Treasury for the carriage of the mails in T h a t is so in ships manned by coloured crews. If we are to send letters, let us send them in the most expeditious way. To take the step to which it appears we may be forced, appears to be hypocritical, and not honest. If we were to say that we would not use any steamers with coloured crews for the carriage of mails, either under contract or by poundage, we might be acting foolishly, or Quixotically ; but we should, at any rate, be acting like honest people, who were determined to adhere to their principles. The other plan means to deny an arrangement when, in my",49,Forrest Honorabl E Manded An Absolute Majority Of The House

I wonder that, farmers use the sacks, or squatters use the wool bales, which the people of India make, and for which we have to pay with the produce of. the country. In desiring that the British, or,, at any rate, the white race shall, as far as is possible, inhabit Australia, we. are. on safe ground. But when we say that we will not use the coloured man to make particular articles, or to assist in conveying our mails under an arrangement, ground, and become hypocrites. know why we should tilt at windmills in this way, and act differently from any other communitv in the world. can afford to say that its mails shall not be carried out under a "" contract or arrangement,"" of people. there is not much difference between the Government paying for the service and a private person paying for it. The. Government, in the first place, get the money from the people, and then pay it, while in the other case, the people, pay for themselves. should we not also say that no ship carrying a coloured crew shall convey our produce and general merchandize? not prohibit every one from making a contract under which cargo may be carried in ships manned by coloured crews ? Whether the Government or private persons pay, the money has to come out of the soil-Australia has to pay. What we desire is to have our mails carried expeditiously and safely. If we were to say that we would clear the ocean, and the world, of all coloured people, that would be consistent, impracticable.. that we are not so large in number as are the coloured races, and therefore such an idea is not We subsidize the Pacific Cable, but I feel sure that .the board hpa good many coloured people in its employment at Fanning Island and other places in the tropics. Similarly we subsidize mail services for the encouragement of trade with places like tlie New Hebrides and New Guinea, which are inhabited, by people of coloured races. Why is this done? Because we have to do it. It is a matter, not of inclination, but of necessity. . I think that we have acted very foolishly, therefore, in saying that we will not make a "" contract or arrangement"" with the English mail lines which 'employ Sir John Forrest. I coloured crews on their steamers. But although we say that we will not enter into contracts or arrangements with such companies, we have had to twist the Act in order to allow the service of carrying our mails to be performed, and we have, had to decide that, to pay poundage is not an evasion of the law. If we have no contract with the companies, and simply pay so much per lb. for the carriage of our mails backwards and forwards, their vessels will not be compelled to call at Fremantle or at Adelaide; and will probably come on direct to Melbourne and Sydney. That would be a. great injury to we are on unsafe WesternAustralia, and to South Australia. mail contract binds the vessels of the Peninsular and Oriental Company to call No other country at Fremantle. Sir JOHN FORREST S o much the better for us. But are they bound to call except by a certain class at Fremantle on their way home? My We must remember that point is that we shall be better off if we have definite contracts with the mail companies, stipulating where and when their steamers shall call, than if we have no contract and pay a poundage, which, in my opinion, is an unbusinesslike and foolish Why arrangement. we get the same, service as before, but at Why should we a lower rate. Sir JOHN FORREST We cannot obtain a regular service unless we have contracts with the companies concerned. Without contracts, their boats will not be bound to call regularly, according to a time-table, and might even be taken off for a week, or two. Of course, if we can getas good a service for less money-by paying poundage than by paying a subsidy, the former though arrangement is the better one; but I do not We remember, however, think\ve can. I do not think that the companies will give us as good a service without a contract. If I were a direcentertained. tor .of one of these companies, I would take good care that I did not give as much for lower rates as I gave when I was being paid a reasonable sum.

At any rate, the Ministry should receive a fair trial, and be treated with some measure of generosity. No one can say that the present Government is not composed of experienced men. There is not a member of it who has not had long experience. experience ? ception, the members of the present Government have had many years experience of office. It is said that a man should serve his .time to every trade, and I should be inclined to say, except for that of a Minister of the Crown-Ministers are all ready-made. I have now only to express a hope that those honourable members who have been so unwise as to desert, or to leave-perhap s that would be a more moderate word to use fhe Protectionist Party and their leader opposite who have done that. Sir JO HN FORREST I hope that those honourable members who have seen fit to leave the Protectionist, Party and their leader, and who' have thrown themselves into the arms of the Labour Party, will soon see the error of their ways. Personally, T feel convinced that if the Government is given a fair trial they will be able to do those things which will be found to be in the interests of Federation, and calculated to cement the various States more closelv together. I believe, too, that they will bring forward measures which will be of permanent advantage to the people of Australia. that the members of the Labour Party have listened with a great deal of interest to the right honourable member for Swan. I have no doubt that they will take into their careful consideration the hints which he has given them, so that they may be able to make their organization so perfect that the right honourable gentleman will himself be prepared to join it. Judging by his address I can see that he is uncomfortable in his present company, and already feels that the Labour Party is the party he ought to join. He has told us of a number of democratic measures which he has passed in the great State of the west, and I always like to give the right honourable gentleman credit for what he has done. If the measures he has carried are not as perfect as they might be, he shouild not be censured or blamed fOT that. I am very hopeful that he will shortly see his way to join the Labour Part)'. He has been studying the pledge and rules of the party, and all we ask of honourable members generally is that they should study them a little.more. We have been glad to hear that some of them have commenced to read the Tocsin and the Worker. I suppose that until quite recently they knew nothing of those intelligently-conducted literary organs. Their education, political and social, has in consequence been very much neglected. Now that they have started to read that literature, they have no doubt learnt a great many things they were not aware of previously, and a continuance of the study will dissipate some of the foolish notions and prejudices that are, at all times, associated! with a lack of knowledge. The speech of the right honourable member for Swan was the usual straightforward, manly, breezy utterance which we all admire. There was some evidence in it of the influence of his present environment, because there was a good deal of "" yes-no ' about it. In criticising our J methods, the right honourable gentleman found fauk with them as being too stringent, and expressed the opinion that they would break down. He does not believe in the Labour Party, and he hopes that its organization will break down. We were not aware that the right honourable gentleman was a prophet, but he said tonight that he was going to prophesy, and he did prophesy that the organization of the Labour Party would break down inevitably.

Why should there be a gathering together of organizations outside, and a great fight put up, if within the Labour Party itself there, is such a condition of, affairs existing that it must break down of its own weight, owing to lack of efficiency ? From the attention which he gave to the subject, I think that the right honourable gentleman realizes, on the contrary, that there is a very great probability of labour politics and the Labour Party very shortly dominating Federal and State politics together. The methods which they have adopted, and which they understand,, and. which, the right: honourable gentletook place came to be submitted to the man, and those whospeak in opposition to them do not yet understand, have hitherto proved successful. I do not quarrel' with the right honourable gentleman's criticism, or with the statement he makes with regard to the changed conditions which the control of parliamentary affairs brings with it. It is self-evident that some changes will be made in the methods of working in the L a bour Party, and labour organizations. I have said that there seemed to be a good deal of "" yes-no "" about the right honourable gentleman's address. He found fault with the constitutional position. He said that a Government ought to be able to give the representatives of the Sovereign an assurance that they had a working majority. It was interjected that the Government of which the right honourable gentleman was a member had no such majority. He replied by saying, "" But we were there, and remained there until we were shifted,"" as if that was a reply. If a Government is constitutionally bound to have a working majority, and otherwise should not continue to hold office, the right honourable gentleman stands selfcondemned, because he was a member of a Government that continued to hold office without a majority. He said, in reply to an interjection, that the Government of which he was a member were there, and remained there until they were shifted, but that might be said of any Government, and was no answer. Then the right honourable gentleman admitted that it was the support of the -Labour Party which, because of its policy, gave the. Government of which he was a member, a working majority. That statement was quite correct, and exactly described the'position. upon the changeof Government; we' have heard of it sufficiently often to be familiar, with the-f acts.. But. there was an assumption 8f> 7 on. the part of the right honourable member be alarmed for Swan that the Watson Government did not have a majority. Honourable members need only look at the division list on the question on which they took office, to see that they had every reasonable assurance from the division and from the speeches of honourable members who took part in it, that they had a very substantial majority a much bigger majority than the present Government secured by a catch vote. The honourable member for Bland, therefore, had ample authority for assuring the representative of the Sovereign, that he had a working, majority.. It was only when the measure on which the division House, in Committee that the steady pressure of the conservative elements outside and inside this House whittled away the majority. It was then fourid that our party had been deceived. Those, who professed to be in. favour of the Arbitration B ill , failed to carry out their pledges and promises, when an opportunity was given them to place the measure, on the statute book. They doas all conservatives do when they do not desire that it should appear to the people that they are opposed to a measure-the y give something which is ineffective and worse than useless. In this case certain honourable members adopted that policy exactly. Speaking of the constitutional aspect, the Watson Goveihment was really the only constitutional Government that this Federal Parliament has vet had.. It has yet. to be decided whether the present Government have a majority. . The right honourable member for Swan asserted that the Watson Government had not a majority, but we all know quite well that if the present Prime Minister considered that there was a majority against the Watson Government he would at once have moved the motion of censure, which he contented himself with talking about every day, in order to keep interest in the matter alive, and to find an excuse for asking honourable members to come with him. As leader of the Opposition the present. Prime Minister gave the Governor General his personal assurance that he had a working majority, but we know that the very moment this eager office-seeker got his opportunity he would take it. If he. had had a majority behind I shall not dwell him he would have taken advantage of the opportunity before he did. seekers'on the honourable member's side -",55,Forrest Honorabl E Manded An Absolute Majority Of The House
578,Mr Wilson,"-Are there' noeager officeI do not know of one office-seeker on this side of the House. Let me say here that a most unfair remark was made to-night insinuating that one member of the alliance on this side is there for self-seeking reasons. tion for that statement. no indication of anything of the kind. The right honourable member for Swan has put this matter very fairly. He does not tell honourable members that it would be unreasonable for any of them to desire to acquire office. There can be no blame attaching to any one who secures office fairly. But when office is secured unfairly and by peculiar tactics, as it has been secured by the head of the present Government, the action taken is open to criticism. A good deal has been said about our methods and the labour pledges. I do not propose to deal extensively with those matters tonight. A short time ago I delivered a speech in which I made some very emphatic statements of my views regarding the Ministerial programme, and the reasons why, in my opinion, the present Government should be put out. I do not propose to repeat those statements. them as read, and to assume that I still stand by them, only more so. Some reference, however, may be made to the way in which the Labour Party is pledged, as the matter is always being brought up. I remind honourable members that any man who desires to join the Conservative Party in England, must sign the platform of that party. new thing, and there is nothing uncommon and nothing wrong about it. The pledge of the Labour Party is complained of because our platform is so good and our aims so high and noble that the only objections which can be brought forward are in respect of little matters which will not bear consideration. I cannot refrain from saying a word or two in reply to the criticism of the alliance by the right honourable member for Swan. The alliance is a perfectly natural and fair one. When the Watson Government took office, certain honourable members who do not belong to the Labour Party, but hold liberal and democratic views, and have no other object to serve than that of securing the passing of good measures, openly announced, without any request from the Ministry, that they intended to support it. There was no scheming on the part of the Government to secure) that support. During the course of this debate, not many honourable members have spoken, but the insinuation has been made more than once that there is a secret understanding among members of the alliance. These insinuations sugge'st that honourable members opposite are famiThere is absolutely no foundaliar with such practices, but the Opposition There has been do not know of anything of the kind. would not mention it. ance was put in black and white; but we cannot obtain any information as to the terms of the coalition. As soon as the Watson Government took office, they openly declared the relations between the Labour Party and those members of the Liberal Party who were supporting them, and, as the basis of the alliance, we have simply' placed in black and white the agreement which was then publicly announced. The suggestion that there is some secret understanding between us, comes only from men who are naturally suspicious. We have sufficient common-sense . to know that the alliance could not succeed by crooked methods. It must succeed on its merits, I ask the House to take or it will fail. If the Labour Party had been so foolish as to adopt the tactics attributed to us by our opponents, we should not have made that progress which has characterized the labour movement. Everyday we are gaining ground. The right honourable member for Swan has twitted honourable members of the Liberal Party with having deserted their leader, and while A party pledge is, therefore, no I know that they are well able to take care of themselves, I feel disposed, as one of those associated with them, to reply to his taunts. The right honourable member spoke of the lack of loyalty shown by these honourable members to their former leader. I confess that I have an admiration for loyalty, but it is not so much a question of loyalty to a leader as it is loyalty to the principles which bind a party. Nothing 'can be said against the man who stands by his principles. The right honourable member for Swan has charged honourable members of the Opposition corner with deserting their leader. What is his position? Who is his leader? Has he not deserted his true leader, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, T5y placing himself under the leadership of the Prime Minister? If he has not accepted the Prime Minister as his leader, what is his position?

Perhaps, after all, I am mistaken in supposing that the Cabinet are considering the wisdom of retiring It maybe'that the leader of'the Government has imposed silence on his colleagues, lest they should, tell too much. One or two secrets have already been disclosed.. We have learned something about the way in which nominations are made by the Conservative Party; we have learned that it indulges in practices for which He is too modest; but the the Labour Party has been denounced. We have heard something about the Sydney Morning Herald fixing up the free trade bunch. We have also heard that in Western Australia the light honourable member for Swan, together with a newspaper editor, fixed up a bunch for election purposes. The lack of wisdom of those who fixed up those bundles was shown by the fact that the persons selected did not stand true to their parties. The right honourable member for Swan is evidently not a good hand at choosing candidates. I interjected while he was speaking that those he selected did not stand true, and the right honourable member admitted that he could not keep them true. We have only to look at the present situation in this Parliament, in regard to the 'Free trade Party, to see that their method of selection does not keep honourable members opposite to their pledges. Many of them, it is true, tried to be loyal, but when they could not get enough of their own way they gave, up the fight. That is not the way to win The way to win in politics is the House are beaten in connection with our social reform and trade union movements we come again.

If they decline to do anything in relation to the High Commissionership, the Government will do nothing. Those unfortunate pioneers of Australia, whose hardihood and whose grand work the Prime Minister and his followers praise so highly who have .been enterprising enough to live in more .than one State, may continue to starve, simply because we have not a Government with the necessary courage, ability, and energy, to pass the necessary legislation.

632,Mr Spence,"The Labour Governmentnot establish old-age pensions when they put the proposal before us, and the Prime Minister is guilty of the same sham and humbug with which he charged the Barton Government. Although arbitration admittedly affects only a limited number of industries at present, no one can foresee how many may eventually come under the Federal Act; and any legislation is desirable which will prevent strikes, with their disturbance of industrial life, and conditions. The fact that we cannot at present say how many industries may be affected, makes it all the more imperative that the measure should be an efficient and workable one. This Bill has wrecked Government after Government; and we now have a Government in power, who, if they have a 1 chance, will impose on the people of Australia, a measure which will be productive of much evil, suffering, and injusticewhich will make the conditions of industry worse than they would be without a measure of the kind. I make that remarkadvisedly, and am convinced of its truth. One particular clause will, in my opinion, not only do a great injustice to unions, but will prevent many registering under the Bill. member says that, does he mean that unions will be prevented from registering, by reason of the difference between the two amendments ? cause of the clause which has been adopted,' unions which were waiting for the Bill will not register. gister, but it will not be because of the difference between the two amendments. when in charge of this measure in Committee, were in many instances forced, by the influence of those now on the Treasury bench, to accept certain amendments which rendered the Bill less efficient, and were not in the interest of those concerned. The clause on which the late Government were defeated, was not the only one to which, we objected, and it was not fair to twit the members of that Government, because they had to accept some amendments in which they did not fully believe. It was the duty of the Government to pass as good a measure as possible; and it was only when an amendment was reached, which rendered the measure unworkable, that the Government took their final stand."" One point is overlooked by those who have had no experience of the trade union movement, and who, like the Minister of Defence and his colleagues, regard that movement from a theoretical point of view. Because certain things are possible under the measure, they suppose that those things are going to be done. We who are connected with trade unions, have practical experience of men as they are, and with us it is not a question of what men of adifferent stamp might do, but what the men whom we know are likely to do. The great difference between the two amendments is particularly felt in the union of which I have been president for eighteen years, and about which I claim to know more than any other honourable member in the House. It would be impossible for that union to prove to a Judge that a majority of those affected were in favour of preference being given. The members of. the union are not working in the industry except at a certain period of the year, and no living soul could say where the members were, or who were affected by the award, and there is no machinery to secure the opinion of those affected. We could not give any evidence that would be accepted, and any lawyer, or even a layman, could break us down and prevent our getting an award which would give a preference. In some other industries, I admit that the whole position would be different; but we are legislating for specific industries. The organization to which I refer is the largest in Australia, and is connected with the greatest industry and biggest export trade of the Commonwealth. The union has had a long reexistence, and the opinions of its representatives ought to have some weight. Let us suppose, for a moment, that a matter involving only legal questions was before the House, and let us further suppose a most unlikely thing, namely, that all the lawyers in the House were unanimous. What wouldthose lawyers say if a layman like myself were to deny the correctness of their assumptions and opinions? Such a denial would not have any weight. Those who have had experience of the trade union movement are, by reason of their practical knowledge, unanimously of opinion that the measure, as passed by this House, is unworkable, and I can only interpret our being ignored as showing a desire to make the Bill ineffective. I speak authoritatively on this matter, after consultation with those controlling the affairs of the union of which I am president, and I may say that I used no influence whatever in order to secure the opinion I express, namely, that the union",61,Joseph Cook I Am Not Referring To Keep On Fighting If We On This Side Of

665,"Imaginings, Mr Spence","The so-called antiGovernment for a grant of ,£1,000 to enable the producers to buy compressed fodder and to find a market for their produce. These are the people who denounce Socialism. A similar gathering, which was held at Hay, wound up by adopting resolutions urging the Government to pass anIrrigation Bill. At Adelaide, too, a meeting was recently held to form an organization to combat Socialism. Every other consideration is to be sunk in order to defeat the Labour Party. The extraordinary feature is that those who most violently denounce Socialism themselves practise it. In New South Wales, the followers of the Government, led by Mr Carruthers, have asked for nearly £8,000,000 from the Public Works Department and, strange to say, the gentleman who requested the biggest sum, namely, jQi,700,000, was the honorable member for New England who is a strong individualist. He desired that a railway should be constructed from Guyra to Grafton. As the brunt of the attack upon the Government has hitherto fallen upon the Prime Minister, I think it is about time that a little Victorian history was introduced into the debate. In this connection, it is very singular that the Minister of Trade and Customs-wh o is ""equal in all things"" with the Prime Minister-was , when Premier of Victoria, a most astounding Socialist. In his address at Bairnsdale he submitted a very socialistic programme. He proposed to find money for housing the industrial classes, and advocated the granting of loans to the extent of 60 per cent, upon the value of the securities offered, at 6 per cent, inteiest, with a fifteen years' currency. He also proposed to establish old-age pensions, and a system of State-aided insurance. He wished to go one better than the Labour Party. He further advocated technical education for all branches of industry. Does he still believe in those principles? He favoured the establishment of dairy farms, at which instruction could be imparted in the best methods of making butter. He also promised to provide the people with inferior land at 5s. per acre, and proposed to compulsorily resume it. He assured his 90 acres within a two-penny tram section, and established a settlement. ment it is. that we are advocating, and yet the honourable gentleman has now decided that his special mission in life is to keep the Labour Party out of power, in order to prevent these good things being brought about. If not,, why did honourable members opposite put us out of power ? orable member wish to put the honourable member for Gippsland out of power when he is so pronounced a Socialist? gentleman does not propose to do those things now. proaching decency and honesty in politics, and not sham, humbug, and hypocrisy. I object to men speaking in one way and acting in another. I object to their saying that these things are not socialistic, while some proposal which may never be introduced is Socialism. The co-operative Commonwealth and such things are not before us now, but the other measures to which I have referred are before us, and they are distinctly socialistic. The Minister of Trade and Customs nowhas as his colleague the "" star "" of the company opposite, whose anti-socialistic proclivities lead him to support private enterprise pure and simple. But I have not yet exhausted the honourable gentleman's programme He was also prepared to support grain elevators for loading the farmers' grain, and water conservation for their benefit. All these excellent ideas are distinctly socialistic. I wish to know, and I think we are entitled to know, where honourable gentlemen opposite draw the line. The right honourable member for Swan has carried out an excellent socialistic scheme in Western Australia. It was a very big project indeed, and the right honourable gentleman deserves very great credit for having the courage .to enter upon it. But he says that that is not Socialism. It is time these honourable gentlemen had some teaching to enable them to know what Socialism is, and what it is not. We say that where the general community takes up an enterprise, or in a certain degree gives assistance to an enterprise, that is State Socialism. It may be limited according to circumstances, but it is all a form of State Socialism. The Minister of Trade and Customs was consistent with hearers that he had resumed his advocacy of Socialism when he went in for protection, because the object of protection is to enable people to carry on industries here by giving them the assistance of protective duties. That is distinctly socialistic. member a protectionist or a free-trader? We are coming to it now.",65,Joseph Cook I Am Not Referring To Keep On Fighting If We On This Side Of

I hope I am something better than either. to t'he matter in the speech to which I have referred, but I have been told that the present Minister of Trade and Customs, although a federalist now, was in the past somewhat opposed to Federation, on the ground that it would probably do away with the Victorian Stock Tax. The honourable gentleman, it appears, would rather sacrifice Federation than d[o away with the Stock Tax. I hope that his association at the present time with the right honourable gentleman, who is going to bring about harmonious relations between the Federal and States Governments, has induced him to abandon his opposition to (Federation, and even to forget all about the Stock Tax. However, the honourable gentleman is, I think, in duty bound to tell the House exactly how far he is going, and how far the consent of his partner in this business, as the head of this peculiar Government, will be given to bring about complete Socialism. 1 will support the Government, I shall be prepared to go as far as I said on the occasion to which he has referred. honourable gentleman and the! Government of which he is a member, when he has declared that he will knock the Labour Party out of existence if he can, and when I know that that is the only partywhich honestly and openly advocates these things? The members of the honourable gentleman's party say one thing and do another, and they are being backed up by a party outside that wants everything socialistic for itself, whilst it denies the! advantages of Socialism to everybody else. The honourable gentleman speaks of the Labour Party as representing a section, of a class. I presume' that the honourable gentleman means that the wage-earning class, the artizans who work for an employer, are not to have their share of Socialism. They are not to have any share in socialistic enterprises, which are only to be proposed for the benefit of the men on the land. I shall presently have something to say about the attitude of the Government to the men on the land. I have just a word or two to say about another anti-Socialist who stood for the Victorian State! Parliament at the same time as the honourable member for Gippsland, and who was a supporter of that honourable member. I refer ' to the"" honourable and learned member for Wannon. I am sorry the honourable and learned member is not here, but I shall say I do not find any reference nothing concerning him that is not perfectly fair. I desire merely to show how much deception there is about some of these honourable gentlemen. In a speech delivered at Hamilton, when the honourable and learned member for Wannon stood for the Victorian State Parliament, after Federation had been accomplished, he was able to tell the electors that the fiscal issue had been transferred to Federal politics. As he dealt with the matter at the beginning of his address, I suppose I may conclude that it represented his first plank, and I find that the honourable and learned member complained that the retiring member had altogether neglected local requirements. He had not h i d enough Government money spent in the district. The honourable and learned member for Wannon was going to see that more was spent in futuie. The other man had done nothing, and he knew that he would be able to do a great deal more. The position which he then took up was that it was justifiable to grab Government money for the constituency; but the honourable and learned member is now an anti-socialist, and he believes only in private enteiprise. I need not refer to some other statements which must have been jocular, because the honourable and learned member claimed that he was a liberal, and a follower of ""the Liberal Party. He told the electors that he had the support of Major Reay, with whose politics residents of Victoiia are well acquainted. T find that he favoured a number of things which were advocated by the honourable member for Gippsland. For instance, the honourable and learned member for Wannon on that occasion favoured the establishment of State dairies in agricultural districts as educational institutions ih which fhe people might be taught to make good butterequal to the Dutch butter, and so on. That is, no doubt, a very good idea, but it is distinctly and entirely socialistic. There can be no denying that. denying it? Would the honourable member accept a denial if he got it? learned member for Wannon is now denouncing Socialism. He said, further, that he would support closer settlement, and advocated the resumption of the large estates around Hamilton.

Having nothing else to urge against the Labour Party, our opponents must raise this bogey. Other persons have raised the cry of "" reform,"" knowing that it is a good word and time The statement has also been made by our opponents that we are going to rob the farmers of their land. They expect to create such an antagonism ""against the Labour Party that they will be bound to win when a dissolution takes place. That is the plain object coalition. We rejoice that they have adopted these tactics. It is the best thing that could happen for our movement. The stronger the reactionary, parties outside Parliament fight, the more successful will the Labour Party be. We are on solid ground, and put forward measures which we contend are practical. It is not denied by the Government that they are practical. They have offered some criticism on the only proposal which we have put forward that seems to be debatable in a socialistic sense-the tobacco monopoly proposal. With this exception, they advocate every one of our measures and adopt them as their own. Therefore, their present tactics are merely an attempt to appeal to the prejudice and the ignorance of the people. We are not afraid of that. When we can get the people to understand our proposals we have no fear that we shall secure their support. If, as honourable members opposite contend, they wish to prevent Socialism and promote private enterprise, let them advocate the selling of the Government railways and the putting of all enterprise of that description in the hands of private persons. As we have now reached the usual hour for adjournment, will the Government consent to my continuing my speech to-morrow? Debate adjourned. House adjourned at 10.32 p.m. It that many people have no to study socialistic questions. of the",70,Joseph Cook I Am Not Referring To Keep On Fighting If We On This Side Of
