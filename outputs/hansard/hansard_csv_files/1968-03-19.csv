Petition received and read. have noticed that the Minister for Primary Cockburn on the border between South Industry gave details of the pending scheme Australia and New South Wales. It is anticifor reconstructing the dairy industry to a able meeting at Ipswich last Friday. This meeting year. Construction of the part between had been postponed from an earlier date Cockburn and Broken Hill, which I am 2 or 3. weeks beforehand. I ask the right advised is about 30 miles long, is principally honourable gentleman whether he is aware the responsibility of the South Australian of the principle frequently enunciated by a Government. While some design work former Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies has been undertaken on this part of the -the last occasion, I believe, being on 11 th line, as yet construction has not commenced. November 1965-in these terms: 1 think it is a very sound and proper rule that will be completed by the scheduled date when statements are to be made in a period of of April 1969. time when the House is sitting they should be made here, in the House. I have endeavoured, myself, to adhere to that rule very closely. Does the Prime Minister intend to follow this principle and to ensure his Ministers' the Treasurer. I ask: Does the Government compliance with it as far as possible? enunciated is an extremely good principle If so, how much gold produced or acquired but I find it difficult to see why the Leader in Australia has been shipped overseas in of the Opposition thinks it was departed the current year? Is any gold other than for from in this instance. I remember, for use in manufacture sold in Australia by the example, that in the Governor General's Australia allowed to hold gold other than Speech it was made clear fhat there would for use in manufacture? be a grant of up to $25m-so the amount of money was presented there-ove r a period of 4 years if required-so the time questions for me to answer specifically, but was presented there-for the purpose of I think the substance of the honourable helping those who wished to leave the dairy gentleman's question is whether the Austraindustry to do so, or for diversification.

8,Mr Mcmahon,"There are too manythe Reserve Bank of Australia at the price of $US35 per oz or $A31.25 per oz. Arrangements were made in 1951 that if the Gold Producers Association of Australia, which comprised all of the producers, wished to sell gold on the premium markets of the world it could repurchase the gold at the price of $US35 per oz and sell it in the premium markets. The surplus received was then distributed by the Association to the producers according to the amount of gold that the producers had delivered to the Reserve Bank. It is to be remembered that we have subsidy arrangements and that if gold is sold on the premium markets then there is a reduction in the subsidy. So many cables have arrived in recent days about what the communique issued by the gold pool countries in fact means that instructions have been given that until we can clarify the communique precisely there will be no change in the arrangements that I have mentioned. In other words, the Association can repurchase the gold if it wishes to sell it on the international exchanges. notice is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the recent appointment of electoral redistribution commissioners and ask whether any significant departures were made from previous methods of choosing these commissioners. for the Interior answered a somewhat similar question on this matter in the House last week. believed him so I am glad of the opportunity to reinforce the truth of what he said. Governor of the Reserve Bank, and ProfesThere has been nothing unusual in the present circumstances. The Commonwealth Electoral Act requires that there should be a commissioner who is the Chief Electoral Officer of the State-to my recollection; secondly, that the second commissioner should be a surveyor-general of a State or some person holding similar qualifications. The Act is silent as to the third commissioner. It has been the constant practice for the third commissioner to be selected from a list of names submitted by the Chief Electoral Officer. As this has been done in the past, so it was done in the present. I might add that neither has there been anything unusual on this occasion in the selection of people from particular departments as the third commissioner. In previous redistributions this has been the case-someon e representing the Postmaster-General's Department, someone representing some other department-and as that has been done in the past, so again it has been done in the present and there is no significant difference. question I ask the Prime Minister: How many names were on the list given to him by the Chief Electoral Officer? number of names on the list for each State but there were some names and that is all that I can tell. I will seek the information. for Social Services in hfs capacity as Minister in Charge of Aboriginal Affairs whether he will say what has been done following upon the passing last May of the referendum conferring new powers on the Commonwealth in relation to Aboriginal affairs. Will the Minister indicate any proposals the Government may have in this sphere for the near future? remind the House that the late Prime Minister was making this matter his own personal concern and that his untimsly death interrupted the normal course of policy development. However, he made provision for the establishment of the Council and the Office, of Aboriginal Affairs, which are at present in existence. The Council consists of Dr Coombs, who will be well known to honourable members as the sor Stanner, Professor of Anthropology at the Australian National University, who is himself very familiar with Aboriginal affairs, especially in the Northern Territory and will have a great and valuable insight into the background of this whole matter. The development of policy will depend very largely upon what the Aboriginal people themselves want. It is not easy to ascertain this; different groups want different things and the circumstances of Aboriginals are not by any means uniform throughout the Commonwealth.",15,Standardisation Of Rail Gauges

At the present moment policies are under consideration. I hope to be able to submit them to Cabinet and when Cabinet has seen them. I shall make these public. I should hope, myself, that this would not be over long. May I remind the House, as it probably knows, that sometime during the early part of July a conference of State Ministers concerned and the Federal Minister will b: convened. May I say in conclusion that the present Prime Minister has indicated a continuance of the interest in this matter at the highest level, by himself retaining the primary authority, witb myself acting as Minister in Charge of Aboriginal Affairs directly under the authority of the Prime Minister. GOLD Treasurer is supplementary to the one asked by the honourable member for Darling. Why has the Government delayed making an announcement on its attitude to sales of Australian produced gold on the free market? Is it a fact that United States gold prothe information that the Reserve Bank still ducers are to be allowed to sell at the new free price? Is the Government aware that restrictions by Australia on the sale of gold by the Gold Producers Association could be justly interpreted as reflecting lack of support for the two tier price system? Will the Reserve Bank of Australia, which presumably intends to restrict the export of Australian gold, pay gold producers the new free price or the old fixed price for their output? Does the Treasurer still believe that there should be an increase in the official price of gold as he claimed at the last two meetings of the International Monetary Fund? "" last part of the honourable gentleman's never received any mail at all. Pretty upsetting as question, I did not claim at the last two the blokes needed their mail particularly at that meetings of the International Monetary time. Fund that there should be an increase in The soldier's mother is concerned that since the price of gold. WhatI did argue strongly the postal workers are indulging again in was that it was high time that the IMF regulation and other strikes this situation had a good look at gold as the basis of could come about once more. I ask the Postinternational foreign exchanges. I said that master-General whether, by appealing to the it should quickly make up its mind one way instincts of the postal workers and by or the other whether it intended to improve the status of gold in the market. As to the remainder of the question, if the honourable gentleman had carefully read the communique which has been issued he would have realised that there was one sentence in it which was very difficult to interpret. That sentence said that any gold that was sold by the monetary authorities-thi s includes our Reserve Bank-o n the free market would not be replaced by official sales of gold from the gold pool monetary authorities. On the face of it, it appeared that we were to carry out the arrangement that I mentioned a few moments ago and that the possibility was that we would not be able to purchase gold from the gold pool monetary authorities to replace it. Consequently we are taking the maximum precaution to ensure that what we do is consistent with the rules which have been established at the meeting in Washington. We have already made representations to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and we are hopeful that in the course of a few days we will be able to announce our decisions. Already we have conveyed to the Gold Producers Association is ready to purchase gold at the price of SUS35 per oz and that if members of the Association want to sell gold on the international market it will be resold to them at that price and they will be able to get the going price on the international market for the amount they sell.

45,Mr Lynchi Am Certainly Aware Of,"GOLD question. Is it a fact that the external liabilities of the United States of America exceed $30,000m, against gold holdings by that country of only $ 11,000m, that the very recent run on gold by international speculators has exposed this serious weakness in the United States economy, that the two-tier gold price policy is a very shaky stop gap action which may be quickly undermined by a central bank breaking from the arrangement, and that in any event the extent of the weaknesses in the United States economy, which have been underlined in the past few days, is such as to force that country to undertake fairly stringent domestic economic measures? In view of the tightening up of the United States foreign investment which then must follow, and also the contraction of British foreign investment, will the Treasurer make a statement on the steps that the Government cqnsiders necessary to support the Australian economy and to prevent any follow-on recessionary tendencies in this country? be critical of what may be regarded as adverse factors involved in the decisions made in Washington on Saturday and Sunday, but I remind the honourable member that very many things have been done which I think will be of great assistance in international trade and particularly in international monetary exchanges. For example, the United States Congress has removed the gold backing from the United States dollar and has thus released more than muter operators are providing air services $ 10,000m worth of gold that can be used by the United States in the international exchanges. Secondly, under what are called 'swap agreements' the amounts available to the various central banks have been built up to $9,300m-oddI cannot remember the exact figure. Thirdly, the reserve banks and the International Monetary Fund always have made available to the United Kingdom Government something of the order of $4,000m in credits to permit the United Kingdom Government to participate effectively in these exchanges. Much has been done, therefore, to prevent or to lessen Queensland at the present time two comany continued run on sterling and the United States dollar. There are, of course, certain other measures that the world knows, and the relevant authorities know, are essential, and there are certain relevant items of information which it would be desirable to obtain. The first is the nature and extent of the United Kingdom budget to be presented today, and of which we will have details tomorrow. Secondly there is the proposal now before the United States Congress to increase the surcharges by 10% on corporate income and also by 10% on private income. These measures are essential. There is also one other proposal that is now being considered. That is the creation of reserve drawing rights for the International Monetary Fund. What has been done, in the opinion of many world authorities, does give the opportunity to meet the situation until these new reserve drawing rights are created. I express no opinion about these matters, but people more informed than I, such as the Governor of the Bank of England, the central reserve bank of the United Kingdom, are now expressing a hope that the special drawing rights may and probably will come into existence at an early date. addressed to the Minister for Civil Aviation.

Has the Minister any up-to-date news as to the intentions of President Nasser in regard to reopening the Canal? member for Wilmot says is news to me. I was not aware that the German insurance companies had accepted liability for the fruit which they had insured and which was held up in the Suez Canal. As the honourable member is aware, a few months ago the exporters of Australian fruit declared it abandoned and the insurance companies rejected it. Up until this point of time the British insurance companies have not issued any writs; each was waiting to see what the other insurance companies had done. My latest information is that the British companies were waiting to see what the German insurance companies were doing, because the German insurance companies seemed to be moving more than the British or other insurance companies involved. I am pleased to hear this information. I will check to see whether it is correct; if it is, it certainly will have a bearing on the attitude of other insurance companies. whether the Minister has anything further to add to his Press report? Chowilla Dam was discussed, as the River Murray Commission had before it a report from its technical committee. The report was discussed, but no decision on the future of either Chowilla Dam or another storage on the River Murray was made at Ihat meeting because we realised that we would require some additional information about Another meeting of the River Murray Commission has been called for 24th April, but the problem that we have before us is that we desire to see that South Australia should receive its entitlement, which is 1,254,000 acre feet in any year, whether there is a restriction or not. In addition, we desire to see that additional water is made available to the two up-river States which at the present moment are over-committed.

Address-in-Reply Debate resumed from 14 March (vide page 154), on motion by Mr Fox: That the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed to: MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY: We, the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. We are presendy engaged in debate on the Address-in-Reply to the Speech with which the Governor General opened this session of the Parliament. This is the second time in the life of this Parliament that we have had such a debate. Of course, the reason for this is the advent of a new Prime Minister. I take this opportunity of congratulating the right honourable member for Higgins( Mr farms will be consolidated into economic Gorton)-a n ex-senator-o n his attaining that high office. I hope that he will have many years in which to enjoy it and that the people of Australia will be happy with the success it brings to them. At the same time we are all greatly saddened by the tragic happening which made it possible for this event to take place. However, we have a new government-the Gorton-McEwen Government. Naturally it is anxious to start its term with a clean sheet. It should have the opportunity to develop its own policies and to determine its own priorities. We all hope that its priorities will assume a dynamic form and we look forward with small dairy farms might be used for other great interest to the remainder of this purposes for which they are suitable, such session. Four new Ministers are familiarising themselves with their departments. Of course, several of the other Ministers have been transferred to other departments. This debate gives them an opportunity to get their affairs in order. It allows them some breathing space in which to formulate vital legislation that we hope to see soon. This will be a short session for a variety of reasons, and I hope that this debate, so called, will not drag on. During question time the Leader of the House( Mr Snedden) said that it may extend to Tuesday of next week. I hope that ir will finish this week, because there is an urgent need to get on with the business of the country rather than to listen to the bleatings of back bench members who use this debate as a means of airing some of their pet subjects and most of whose suggestions are not likely to be put into effect. Despite this 1 would like to make some suggestions, even though they may not receive the consideration that they might receive if we were discussing definite legislation at the moment. The dairying industry was given special mention in the Governor General's Speech. His Excellency stated that the Government will introduce legislation to provide up to $25m over the next 4 years to be used towards the reconstruction of the dairying industry. It is proposed that the Commonwealth will make the money available and that the States will carry out the plan. The general purpose of the legislation is to enable those dairy farmers on small farms who are experiencing economic hardship and who wish to leave the industry to do so. The idea seems to be that the small dairying units. We have been told in some of the discussions on this subject that the smaller farms that are purchased will be made available to neighbouring farms. This would not cut down on the quantity of butter that is produced, which is the real problem in the dairying industry. If a farmer acquires the farm next door and is able to consolidate the two farms, the likelihood is that because of better methods of operating and lower unit costs he will be able to produce more butter from the two farms combined. The Governor General indicated that as grazing and cropping. More importantly,",22,River Murray Commission
55,Mr Mcmahon,There were consider,23,Governor General S Speech
56,Mr Buchanan (Mcmillan) [2.17],"be also indicated that they might be used for forestry. Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd has shown that tree farming is a most profitable venture on the marginal lands of Gippsland, mostly in awkward spots on the tops of hills in the poorer soils. This is a new industry which is badly needed in Australia. Perhaps this same firm will be able to apply these principles on the north west coast. However, I hope this is not contemplated for our good dairying country in Gippsland, although it might be mentioned in passing that many dairy farmers would be well advised to devote an area to tree farming as a long term investment because its profitability is well known. I do not like the present proposal for the reconstruction of the dairying industry. I do not think that it will work. The intenbe financed out of the industry. TheseI tion is to cut down the production of butter, take it to be the hard core of the industry which is now being produced in excess in practically every country in the world. The countries in the European Common Market are meeting at present to try to overcome this very problem of over production. The present scheme was foreshadowed by the former Minister for Primary Industry in a debate on the butter subsidy in the middle of last year. Honourable members will also recall that reconstruction of the dairying industry was recommended by a committee of inquiry which reported, to this House in 1960. If honourable members examine the two recommendations they will find that they are very similar. The whole purpose of the scheme seems to be the provision of finance in order to enable the less profitable dairy farms to be used for another purpose, but mainly to enable the people who are working on those farms to get out of the dairying industry. Most of these unprofitable areas are on the north west coast, in the Richmond district, in Queensland and in special areas of Western Australia which have their own problems. This icheme does not appeal to me. It is of very little interest to the dairy farmers in Viction of trying to nibble away at this subsidy toria. I should like to point out that there is a rather large discrepancy between the figures that are used now and those quoted in 1960. The Minister, in a Press release, mentioned the 62,000 commercial dairy farmers in Australia and said that more than half-55%-ha d net farm incomes of less than $2,000 a year. I noticed that in another statement made at a meeting he pointed out that there were 2,500 subsistence dairy farms on the north west coast where they had specific and particular problems. He mentioned also last year that people had been leaving the industry in that area at a rate of 3% per annum for the past 5 years. In 1960 the Dairy Industry Committee of Inquiry referred to a figure of 70,000. Some movement and some reconstruction are taking place. At least a figure of 8,000 has disappeared from the statistics. In 1960 the 70,000 dairy farmers mentioned were made up of 30,000 in the prosperous section, 11,000 in the poorer section with a potential of 8,000 lb of butter fat if given financial assistance while 3,000 were not capable of producing 8,000 lb of butter fat and it has been stated that these should which we shall deal with in the relevant legislation when it is introduced. There are also 26,000 farmers who claim recognition but who should not be given any assistance as dairying is a sideline for them and brings in less than one-third of their income. I believe that no assistance should be given to these people who contribute to our export surplus purely as a sideline and for their own convenience. They should get export values only for the cream they take along to the butter factories. I referred to the figure of 8,000 lb which was used in 1960 in determining whether operations were profitable. Today it would be necessary to increase that figure to 10,000 lb of butter fat. Australian wage rates have increased by about 16% since 1960; the consumer price index has increased by about 15%; but the retail price of butter has increased by only 6 i % . Conditions in Australia are set on an Australian pattern which includes a subsidy as well as the normal costs and I point out here and now that there must be no intenwhich has become such an integral part of the industry. In spite of all that is said about the inefficiency or poor state of the dairy industry, I should like to remind my city friends that in only two countries is butter cheaper than in Australia. These are the United Kingdom and New Zealand. In only two countries is the return to producers lower; those are Argentina and New Zealand. The return to the producer in the United Kingdom is a good 66% higher than it is to the producer in Australia. Yet for years we have been supplying Great Britain with a cheap product. One can see the tremendous assistance that must be given to dairy farmers in the United Kingdom. What most people overlook is that this is a very complex industry. Some people in it are having a pretty bad time. This applies to every industry. Hotels may be looked upon as profitable but many of them are working only for the tax collectors. The motor car industry is mentioned as doing very well in Australia but many motor car firms are pretty unprofitable at the present time. Many small businesses find it unprofitable to operate in the face of competition, and they have to meet the situation and adjust their investment according to the profitability that they can enjoy. I find that I must come to the conclusion that if it is reconstruction at which we are aimingthat is the word used in the Governor General's Speech-and if it is rationalisation that we want, any plan must be applicable to the whole range of products and affect the whole range of industry. I have two suggestions which I submit to the House for consideration. I put these suggestions forward purely in the form of theories. I believe that the principles contained in them are sound enough, but the suggestions would need some tailoring to turn them into plans. I would not have time to put forward fully as a planned operation the ideas that I am about to mention. However, I am convinced that the Bureau of Agricultural Economics could do so if the Minister so directed. Firstly, let us consider the real problem, that is, over-production of butter. In 1966-67 Australia produced 218,000 tons of butter of which 114,000 tons were sold in Australia at a reasonable price and 104,000 tons were sold overseas at a depressed price or, if one prefers the expression, at a loss. So the problem is to discourage the production of that surplus. A few years ago the distribution was 60% sold locally and 40% exported. In the first 5 months of this year we returned to that basis because of the drop in total production and the consequent drop in export surplus. The figures for the first 5 months showed that 102,000 tons were produced. Of that amount, 61,000 tons were sold in Australia for local consumption and 41,000 tons were exported. Again a break up shows that the distribution was about 60% local and 40% for export. For the purpose of my argument I proposed to use this proportion, although the argument is the same even if the figures are 55% as against 45%. I have made several calculations using those figures and the answer comes out very nearly the same. The proposal that I advance is not original. Several authors claim to have thought of it first and no-one knows from whom it did originate. But that does not alter the fact that here is a definite proposal which 1 believe should be given considerable thought. Each butter producer would have an annual domestic market quota fixed in terms of butter fat. There would be no restriction on total production and of course there would be no compulsion; it would be up to the individual farmer to decide what he would do, according to the economics of his own situation. New areas which are opened up put a great strain on the present system. Dairying is the only farming process from which one can receive quick returns. In this industry money comes in each month, whereas in other primary industries farmers have to wait for a year to get a return. I suggest that anyone coming into the dairying industry would not be entitled to a quota on the basis I have suggested until it was obvious that we needed to enlarge our production. Farmers of perhaps 3 years standing would be allotted a quota based on their average returns for the last 3 years of the period and the quota would be paid for at the Australian market price, including subsidy. Any production over and above that would be paid for at the equivalent of its export value. It is important to note that at the introduction of such a scheme farmers would receive the same return as they had received for their previous year's production. This is so whether we use the existing method of payment of one amount or divide it into a statement of two columns and base the payment on prices received on the Australian market and for the export surplus. To put it into figures as a practical example, a producer with 10,000 lb of butter fat would be paid at the Australian market price for 6,000 lb of butter fat, which at about 48c per lb would yield $2,880. He would have 4,000 lb of butter fat surplus which would be worth only about 30c per lb and this would return, in round figures, $1,200. His total return would be $4,080. Factory prices vary a little, but at the present time the average price is about 41c per lb, so for the 10,000 Ib of butter fat he would now receive $4,100. There is a difference of only $20 in the two methods of calculation. Any farmer who studied the progress he was making would decide whether it was worth his while lo put his energy into producing the surplus 4,000 lb for the very low return of $1,200 if he could use his land or his cows for some better purpose. The present equalisation committee could handle the scheme, paying for milk and cream up to the quota limit as a first payment with interim payments based on returns from overseas. That, I believe, would be a very easily adopted scheme which would produce very much better results in the long run than the present proposal to buy out. the poorer or less profitable producers and to incorporate their lands with somebody else's. This problem should be solved by a natural process and under this quota scheme this result would be achieved. But I should like to go a little further with my suggestion. My second proposal is a little more controversial, being based On the disparity between the profitability of whole milk supplies as against butter fat supplies. Again, if it is reconstruction that we are talking about, the whole milk section should also be brought within the equalisation scheme. I noted thc following statement by Sir Earle Page some years ago. His remarks interested me at the time and 1 have kept a report of them by me ever since. He said: Stabilisation and equalisation should cover all dairy products including whole milk. Why should dairying differ from every other form of primary production which enjoys a stabilisation scheme? In what way does it differ from wheat? ln fact, milk is a more uniform product. My first proposal involves no more than a transposing of the figures into two columns instead of one, with some extra supervision needed perhaps in the handling of the quotas. But buying whole milk on an Australian wide basis would require a thorough reorganisation of the present milk boards which would be made subordinate to an overall central marketing authority. For the sake of discussion I shall name that body the Commonwealth milk marketing board. This body would be set up and would be required to arrange distribution and marketing of liquid milk and all milk products, including condensed milk products as well as butter and cheese. The basis on which it would work would provide for equalised rates to be paid to all producers for milk in its raw state as delivered to the factory door. Payment at the equalised rate would be made to all producers operating a genuine dairying business, and I emphasise that they would have to be genuine dairy farmers engaged in true commercial ventures. Those people who like to keep a few cows just to give themselves milk for the house would be debarred from taking part in the properly run commercial business of dairying. The billy can operators who are in the dairying business as a sideline could receive export parity for the butter fat content: there would be no harm in that. In 1960 the Dairy Industry Committee of Inquiry saw the possibility of an equalisation scheme being required by the industry. I hope that I have time to read the relative items which bear on this point. At page 115 of the report the Committee said: The liquid milk sections of the industry are generally on a price basis entirely unrelated toand considerably higher than-the bases adopted for butter and cheese. The high prices have detrimentally affected consumption and have nurtured a cost growth of disturbing proportions. The Committee also said: If producers of milk for butter could be assured of a price equivalent to a retail price of 70 pence a Ib for butter there would bc no need for any inquiry. In other words, if we could be assured of a price equivalent to the price obtained in the whole milk sector there would be no need for an inquiry. My proposal is for some evening up of this unequal distribution of return for the production of the same product-milk . I can almost hear the screams of rage from milk producers with large-ofte n quite excessive-mil k contracts. Many of these people arc my friends. They refer to the money they have invested, to the high price they have paid for their property, to their huge investment in improved stock, to the cost of maintaining pastures and, above all, to the high cost of providing winter milk. I submit that with refrigerated vats and containers it is not necessary today to build up the business of winter milk to thc bogy that it is. If the scheme were given proper consideration and put into plan form I am sure that we could arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. If we want to reconstruct the dairying industry it is essential to treat it as an indusGovernor-General's Speech consumes a try with a great future but one which is required to conduct itself along modern lines of supply and demand. Those people who are best able to produce the product we so badly need as a health food for the nation should be encouraged to do so. Those not able to to produce because of cost disabilities would of their own accord turn to some other avenue. are debating the Governor General's Speech. Nothing is more certain than that the Australian public is wondering why the Government felt that it was necessary to delay the normal proceedings of Parliament in this manner. I thought that the honourable member for McMillan( Mr Buchanan) was very generous in apologising to the House for the Government's action. The Governor General's Speech to assembled members of the Senate and House of Representatives is normally delivered at the opening of a new Parliament following a general election and is nothing more than a speech prepared by the Prime Minister. Such a speech has always been accepted as an outline to members of Parliament and to the general public of the Government's policy and its intentions with regard to legislation. But this year the situation was different. We had a speech by the Governor General, not following a general election and at the opening of a new Parliament, but simply as a result of an election by the Liberal Party of a new Prime Minister. That election proved conclusively the bitterness that exists between the Australian Country Party and the Liberal Party. It proved also that on the Government side in this House not one man was capable of carrying out the responsibilities of Prime Ministership. When it became known that the Governor General would make a speech and that a debate would ensue on that speech-thi s is what we had only last year -the people of Australia were entitled to believe that the Government had something new to propose. Surely we all were entitled to expect to hear from the Governor General an indication that the Government intended to introduce legislation different from that proposed early last year or that since last year the Government had found it necessary to place before the Parliament and the people something of significant importance. After all, the debate on the considerable amount of time. Unless the debate centres on something which was not placed before the Parliament last year it is a consumption of time which could be better used in dealing with important legislation. I am sure that all honourable members and the people of Australia will agree with me that plenty of material exists which could be brought before the Parliament and dealt with as quickly as possible in the best interests of Australia and its people. This is particularly so in respect of certain sections of the community and certain areas of the country. There could be no good reason for delaying the introduction of such legislation by debating the Governor General's Speech unless that Speech contained something significantly different to what was announced early last year. What did the Speech contain? It contained absolutely nothing that we had not heard before. There was nothing new in the Speech-nothin g of fresh importance. I suggest that those who listened to it and who have since read it must have been very disturbed, surprised and disillusioned -eve n disgusted-wit h its vagueness and with the Government's failure to grapple with the many problems that face Australia at home and abroad. The Speech was mainly a rehash of old problems and proposals. The same old things were dished up. The only bright spots were the indications that the Labor Party's policy was to be implemented in certain respects. It was a Speech from which only one conclusion could be drawn-that the Government under its new Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) and with the reshuffle in the Ministry is still barren of ideas for handling Australia's problems and will simply muddle along as it has in the past. This second session of this Parliament commenced 3 weeks later than would normally have been the case. I offer no criticism of that. The delay in resuming was largely outside the control of the Government and, in the circumstances, was something which we all could expect. But1 think we are entitled to criticise the Governinent for aggravating the position",23,Governor General S Speech
57,Mr Collard (Kalgoorlie) [3.42],"W ewith an unnecessary Speech by the Governor General and an ensuing debate. We are also entitled to attack the Government, not only for having delayed the introduction of vital legislation, but also for North Vietnamese and others fighting on having prevented the Opposition from introducing into this Parliament during the first 2 weeks of the session measures which would be of far greater importance than the Governor General's Speech. The first subject of any importance dealt with by the Governor General was the situation in Vietnam. Notwithstanding its importance, it was dealt with in a mere sixteen lines of rather large print. It is disturbing that no suggestion is made for halting the conflict and the useless loss of life and destruction of property on both sides. The Government simply says that it seeks a just and lasting peace. These are exactly the words used by President Johnson. The Government states that it will support every effort to negotiate for peace. But it offers no suggestion as to how peace may be obtained. It must be disturbing and frightening to the people of Australia to see the situation in Vietnam becoming more serious every day. There is the possibility that Australia will be asked to send more troops there. This Government, which is prepared to conscript lads for Vietnam, should be exploring every possible avenue for peace and should not simply rely on the views, suggestions or actions of some other country. It is not good enough to say that we will support every effort for peace. The Government should be making its own efforts. Recently we received details issued by the war. Nor are they likely to come from the United States Information Service of those governments that are indirectly casualties in Vietnam. That information making some profit or gain from the present shows that between lst January and 2nd situation. March this year 3,229 United States soldiers were killed in action, 9,275 were wounded for instance, and see how many countries and required hospitalisation-it does not say are depending on it for trade. I refer to an how serious their wounds were-and 8,297 article dated 27th February 1968 which is were wounded but did not require hospitalheaded 'Japan Profits Most From Vietnam isation. But it must be remembered that no War'. The article states: matter whether or not the wounds were serious, those people could just as easily which have been killed. The number of the enemy out of the war in Vietnam. listed in the report as killed is 3,847, which is some 600 more than the number of the present financial year, which will end in April, Americans killed over that period of 2 is likely to exceed $446m. By the end of the halfmonths. The report does not stateapparently it is not known-ho w many of received the enemy were wounded. It does not give 6 months of 1966-67. Australian, New Zealand or South Vietnamese casualties. Nor does it give civilian casualties. But it does show that over the short period of 2 months 7,078 Americans, the side of the North Vietnamese were killed and 17,562 Americans and God knows how many on the other side were wounded. However, I have no doubt that we can safely say that 50,000 to 55,000 persons were either killed or wounded in that short time of 2 months in this rotten and useless situation in Vietnam. It is not a very nice situation to dwell upon. I admit this. The reason I have given these figures is to make it clear-and it must be clear-that unless something is done in the near future to bring about peace in South Vietnam, it is pounds to peanuts that under the present Government's policy Australia will become more and more deeply involved. If this is permitted to come to pass, we shall find Australian parents and other relatives facing Australian casualty lists similar to those of the Americans or of the North Vietnamese to which I have just referred. Notwithstanding this obvious possibility, we find from the Governor General's Speech that all that this Government intends to do about solving the problem is to support negotiations for peace initiated by someone else. If we in Australia continue to sit back and do nothing about initiating peace proposals, on whom do we rely to initiate them? Almost certainly they will not come from countries that are directly improving their own financial position as a result of Let us examine the position of Japan, Japan easily heads the list of Asian countries continue to make increasing sums of money United States military spending in Japan during year which ended in September, Japan had already a record $216.9m from military expenditure, an increase of 6% on the corresponding Japanese officials say it is impossible to deterwool and so on.

However, the Japanese stock market is very sensitive to any possibility of the in which Japan, both directly and indirectly, war being suddenly settled as a result of secret is reaping a considerable profit from the sale negotiations. The general feeling is that Japan is not only from raw material that she buys from us. profiting from the procurement orders directly While all this is going on, the Australian related to the war, but also indirectly from increased exports to countries in South East Asia Government apparently is content to sit and the US.

It is a rather disgraceful state of non-ferrous metal industries in Japan would be affairs when we find that the best statement badly hit. The article then deals with Singapore. It states: In Singapore, official figures show that exports to South Vietnam in the first half of 1967 totalled more than $44m, an increase of more than 160% in the past 2 years. US and South Vietnamese purchases for civil and military projects have made South Vietnam Singapore's biggest overseas market after Malaysia. Political observers believe that this fact must have weighed heavily on the mind of Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew when he recently opposed any sudden American military withdrawal from Vietnam. Singapore's exports to South Vietnam are mainly building materials, steel plates and rods, metal containers, petroleum products, photographic supplies, lighters and beverages. Shipping schedules show that sailings to ports in South Vietnam have nearly doubled since 196S to cope with the additional cargoes. Hong Kong's big increase in trade with South Vietnam since 1965, when the US began its massive buildup of troops, consists mainly of exports of textiles and clothing. Exports totalled about $2,357,000 in 1965, and the 1966 figure showed a three-fold increase at $7,129,000. The article then goes on to refer to the trade situation in Malaysia and the way in which it has developed. It also refers to Formosa. If that article is anywhere near correct it gives room for a lot of thought. For instance, what would be the actual effect on Japan if the war in Vietnam were to fold up? What would be the effect in turn on those countries that export in a big way to Japan? Are they likely to take any serious steps towards bringing about success for peace proposals that this Government says it will support? The trade situation leaves a rather nasty taste in the mouth, I suggest, when one thinks of our own position in this regard. We have a fairly large trade with Japan and we rely to a very large extent on her to buy our iron ore, of materials and goods that she manufactures back and wait for peace moves to come than can be made by the Government of Australia is that it will support any peace proposal that comes from some other country. Last Friday, I had the opportunity to attend the opening of the iron ore pelletising plant at Dampier in the north of Western Australia. Apparently some people have very short memories or are more concerned about putting lucre before lives. It made me feel ill to listen to people like the Liberal Premier of Western Australia referring to our very good friends, our very dear friends, from Japan. Anyone would think that Japan was doing us a very great service by buying iron ore or catching our crayfish or prawns, when in actual fact it is receiving a much better deal than it deserves at the expense of this country. No-one is more pleased than I am to see the progress and development in the north. But this, as we all know, would have taken place and continued irrespective of which Government was in office. The only difference is that under a Labor government the people of Australia would receive much more benefit from northern development than they receive at the present time. I was authoritatively informed while I was at Dampier that some 450 houses are to be built there, and some 500 at Mount Tom Price, by the middle of next year. But these are company houses. They are not to be built by the Government. As we all know, if we were to wait for the Liberal Government to build houses in the north, progress there would be seriously restricted unless people employed there were prepared to camp under mulga trees until they could get houses.

His contribution to the cementing of good relations with our neighbours, particularly to our north, will be remembered for many years to come. He took office at a very difficult time. The situation in South East Asia, especially in South Vietnam, was not good. It can be said that the world is divided on the Vietnam issue, with the Communists on one side and the anti-Communists on the other. Many people claim that they do not believe in the principle of Communism or in war. It is fair to say that no-one wants war. Like thousands of others, I fought in the Second World War and thought that I was fighting for peace and democracy. 1 am not very happy at the way in which events are shaping in South Vietnam at the present time. 1 believe that our cause is showing some weaknesses.

Those primary producers who have tried to retain their stock because of its high qualityI refer to breeding stock, stud ewes and the likefind the cost of purchasing fodder almost prohibitive. I know of one graziera member of this House, I may add-wh o is trying to hold on to his valuable stock and is paying $750 a week for stock feed. It would be fair to say that the necessity to purchase this feed will continue for quite some time. If it went on for another 10 weeks a simple calculation shows that such a person could spend $7,500 simply to keep his stock. Of course he would also have the added costs involved in the extra work entailed in feeding. The Commonwealth has agreed to assist financially, but the information I have received from the Prime Minister's Department is that Victoria will get $7.5m this financial year. It. will be made up in this way: Loans $2.3m, freight rebates $2m, employment $3m, other expenses $.2m. Most of this grant money, as far as I can ascertain, is being used very satisfactorily. Men are being employed doing all kinds of work throughout the drought area. I think practically every shire council in the drought stricken area has taken advantage of this assistance even to the extent of carrying out works which could possibly be classified as capital works. I understand that the Commonwealth in these circumstances contributes towards the cost of labour and the State provides for the materials. This is most satisfactory, provided it continues until things become normal. Reduced freight charges on stock and fodder are very much appreciated, because this provides an opportunity for stock to be shifted over comparatively large distances, and fodder can be brought from areas a long way away where conditions are much better. I notice that we are even importing oats from Western Australia. The assistance given by the Commonwealth has enabled this to be done. However, it is in the loan field that I take issue with the questions and in making general statements he has said that sympathetic consideration can be expected from the banks. I quote from an article published over the name of the Treasurer and dated 9th November. The article states: by the members for Corangamite and Wimmera, he had obtained an assurance from the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation that the Commonwealth Development Bank adopts a most sympathetic attitude towards requests from farmers affected by drought for deferment of payments due or falling due on loans in respect of either interest or principal. In most of these instances primary producers are receiving every consideration, but not always. Interest rates vary from 51% to 6 i % for virtually the same type of loan. To my mind this situation should be corrected. I had one complaint from a fellow who purchased a piece of machinery for which, naturally, he could not pay. It was essential for him to obtain this piece of machinery to carry on his farming duties. The only way in which he could purchase it was through a hire purchase company, controlled by a bank, and the interest rate was something like 13%. This fellow approached the bank manager and informed the bank manager that he would not be able to fulfil his commitments for this financial year. He was told: 'That will be quite OK. You will be able to carry this on for the following year and you will have no worries.' This was very kind of the bank manager, but then the bombshell fell. The fellow was informed that the interest rate would rise. I believe that the new rate was to be in the vicinity of 17%. This is not an exaggerated statement; it is a statement of fact. The cost of the drought in western Victoria is almost incalculable. I turn to another statement, issued some time ago, in relation to loans and drought relief. It reads: (a) Loans by the States for carry-on and restocking purposes. The States are making these loans available to farmers (including share farmers) who cannot obtain credit through normal commercial channels. The terms of the loans vary according to individual circumstances. However, generally they carry an interest rate of about 3% and are repayable over 7 years. In theory this is good, but in actual practice there is a breakdown somewhere; the scheme does not work. I have met dozens of primary producers interested in securing some of this $2.3m. Up to date only one of these has had any success at all and this was not a case of receiving money at 3%. His classification was such",31,Governor General S Speech
61,Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon). In Answering,,33,Governor General S Speech
62,"Mr Mcmahon Also Said That, Following Inquiries","that the loan was a continuation of his present soldier settlement loan and the interest rate was somewhere in the vicinity of 5%. classification? State Rural Finance Commission has the say as to whether or not a man will qualify. Another case, which is of great interest to me, is that of a young share farmer who owns plant worth approximately $7,000. He owes approximately $1,500 on it; in other words he has an equity of $5,500. On top of this he has 500 acres of fallow ready for seed. Anyone who has had experience of wheat farming will appreciate the true value of this. He applied for a carry-on loan of $3,500 for fuel, super, and that sort of thing. His property was inspected by an officer of the Rural Finance Minister made reference to the fact that Commission. After his case was looked into he was told that he had little or no equity in his assets and it would be difficult for the Commission to make a loan unless he could secure a suitable guarantor to cover all of the $3,500, plus allowing the Commission to take out a lien over the entire crop. This is absurd. The first condition in to come in and contribute along the lines these loans is that a person cannot obtain finance from normal sources. Here the person concerned cannot obtain money from his bank or stock agent. He goes along to the Commission and is then told he cannot have the loan until he can get someone to give him a guarantee. This particular case is rather interesting. The farm that he is operating has returned an average of 39 bushels per acre over the last 7 or 8 years, including last year's drought when his figures were something like 7 bushels per acre. What must this man do? He is told that if he cannot get money from the bank he should go to the Commission, but his application is refused. To sum up, if he has assets and can mortgage them, naturally he will not get a loan. If he has any family backing, irrespective of the connection of the family, he still receives no loan. I want to know who is entitled to a loan. Another case is that of a landowner with an irrigation right. Because he has an irrigation right automatically he is refused a loan. He was informed that because he has a water right he is not going through a drought period. WhatI want to point out in this particular instance is that because of lack of water in the area he had no purchasing right for a start and his normal water right was cut to two-thirds makes the of the original amount. I understand that since that time it has been cut out entirely. On top of all this, this particular fellow, who is a dairy farmer, relies on purchasing, fodder from his neighbours and relies also on agistment. At the present time he is not permitted a loan to buy sufficient fodder to carry on. These are some of the things that should be looked at very closely. I was rather amazed to read in the Melbourne Press this morning an article in relation to drought assistance, stating that the State Government has decided to give a subsidy to drought stricken Victorian farmers to buy wheat and oats. In answer to a question this afternoon the Prime wheat can be purchased from the Australian Wheat Board on terms at a low rate of interest. If the State authorities were to fulfil the requirements as they were set out to be, that is, to assist farmers in drought stricken areas through rural finance, there would be absolutely no need for the State we are led to believe that it will contribute, according to the article that I have in front of me. I certainly will be very interested to see what the legislation will bring forth, because on numerous occasions we have heard that the Victorian Government is short of funds. We have heard about the special tax that has been introduced because it is short of funds. One of the newspapers made some reference to the provision of $lmI may have misunderstood this-to subsidise the purchase of fodder. Representations have been made by a number of people, including the State Government, in relation to a subsidy for fodder. This was refused. WhilstI have not been able to obtain the real reason why the representations have been rejected, I am led to believe that the cases presented were not presented in such a way as to prove that the purchase of fodder could be carried out most efficiently. 1 believe we have reached a stage when there must be a showdown in relation to drought relief in Victoria.

It is time we determined whose responsibility it is to sec the implementation of relief the way the Commonwealth Government would like it implemented. Last year the Commonwealth said that ample funds for drought relief would be available where the State and the Commonwealth could agree on the distribution of such funds. It is a question of deciding who is entitled to relief. Literally hundreds position in the Australian sugar industry of primary producers want assistance but because of the conditions laid down in respect of assistance they are not entitled to it. That is fair enough; however, there are numbers of primary producers, particularly young ones, who have been in the game for a short period only and are not able to carry on. 1 made representations on behalf of one primary producer and was told by the officer to whom I spoke that a great risk was involved in providing assistance to that primary producer. The officer asked me what would happen if we had another bad season next year. All1 can say to that is: What woulcl happen if we did have a bad year next year? ff because of commitments a man cannot carry on this year and we have another bad season next year, what will be the position? I can see dozens, hundreds, possibly thousands, having to reconsider their position in relation of money is causing problems not only tion to their future in primary industry.

South Austraup to a total amount not exceeding SISm. lians, too, are revealing a keener interest. For anyone listening to that speech there It is only a few weeks since the present was only one interpretation, namely, that Minister for the Navy( Mr Kelly) delivered the Federal Government was providing a rather trenchant criticism of irrigation $10m for the sugar industry for the 1967 plans in the north. This criticism was in direct contrast to the views of Cabinet which, in good faith, examined the northern situation and endorsed proposals for the Ord River and the Nogoa Dam and which will honour its obligation to examine closely other projects such as water storages on the Burdekin, Dawson, Burnett and Kolan Rivers that have been or will be submitted through the State Government to the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton). However, I am not here to debate the propriety of the remarks of the Minister for the Navy; that can be done later. I shall speak primarily of the present because it would seem that 1968 will be one of the most critical years in the history of that industry in respect of both international and Federal policies. In the last 3 years we have been confronted with promises and incorrect prophecies and as a result the rank and file cane grower is extremely bewildered about the market prospects of his product and the position of the industry. As an example of the seriousness of the position, I instance my own area, the Mackay district, which is the most intensive sugar growing area in Australia. In thc last 3 years about $600,000 has been paid by the Federal Government in unemployment benefit in the Mackay district. Certainly, in a seasonal industry there will always be unemployment, but the present situation is like a festering sore. Unemployment is growing and its effect through the circulain tbe sugar industry but also in other When presenting the last Budget, the We have decided to provide further assistance to the State to enable it to provide assistance to the industry in respect of the 1967 sugar crop.",34,Governor General S Speech
65,Think That Anyone Would Disagree With What Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon) Referred To,"crop and that in certain circumstances the assistance could total $15m. This was, in fact, reported throughout the sugar areas of Australia. On the day following the introduction of the Budget an article in the 'Courier-Mail' stated: The Queensland sugar industry will receive assistance of between SlOm and $15m for the 1967 crop, to help it meet interest and repayment delicate elasticity of demand and supply obligations. This was announced by the Treasurer The cane growers could be forgiven for believing that they would get a minimum of $10m and perhaps SI5m if world prices declined further. But the true position is that they will receive only about $4m because of factors that were not stated in the Treasurer's speech. The average price for No. 1 pool sugar was $86 a ton. The industry has made it clear, as has the State Government, that a price of $86 a ton is completely unsatisfactory. If that price is unsatisfactory, why is it that at least an additional $6m, which would make the amount up to that which was provided for in the last Budget, cannot be distributed to the industry? This would certainly help many of the smaller growers and new growers. The Government, in fact, made provision for $10m in the last Budget. At the most it will provide about $4m. This means that at least $6m will not be distributed to the industry. In recent months there has been mounting criticism of the Government within the industry. This has been due principally to those people who are financially affected trying to galvanise either the Government or their own organisations into an accelerated rate of action in at least putting forward some concrete proposals to the industry. It would seem that anybody who dares to criticise the industry or any cane farmer who dares to criticise his organisation or the Government is immediately branded as disloyal or is said to be doing a disservice to the industry. I remind honourable members that the Queensland Cane Growers Council is in fact a breakaway organisation. The sugar industry has changed in the last 3 years. I suppose that it would be fair to say that never in ite whole history has its structure changed so much as it has since the expansion. It is dependent today to a very large degree and to a very dangerous degree on the notoriously unstable free market. Fifty per cent of the total production and 70% of total exports have to be sold on the free market. This free market is not like a wool market or a beef market. Because of the very small quantity of sugar it handles compared with world production -approximatel y 6 million metric tons out of about 65 million metric tons-ther e is a with respect to price. Recent years have shown that all that is needed is, say, a 1% increase or decrease in quantity and there may be a very marked increase or decrease in price. In the last 2 years I have been somewhat critical of the Government and at times of some of the leaders of the Queensland Cane Growers Council because of what I believe to be pussyfooting around. I could be wrong, but that is my belief. It must be made very clear that the present Federal and Queensland Governments must share full responsibility for endorsing the expansion witnout first making firm provision for a guaranteed price. Probably the best arrangement that could have been made is a bilateral agreement with Japan, but we went ahead and expanded-admittedl y on the best advice that we could find-without safeguarding our surplus production by having such a bilateral agreement with Japan based on a fixed guaranteed price. It seems to me therefore that until world prices rise it is the unqualified responsibility of the Federal and Queensland Governments to guarantee the economic livelihood of the great bulk of growers who are in a serious financial position today. Honourable members will recall the speech made by the Leader of the Aushe stated quite categorically that expansion of the sugar industry was made possible only-and he used the word 'only'-by the great market in Japan, and nobody will argue about the quantity of sugar that is required by Japan. But we do not have the benefit of a guaranteed price as we did when the Government encouraged expansion of the beef industry in 1949-50 in association with the 15-year meat agreement with the United Kingdom. This proved of tremendous benefit in 1958 when deficiency payments had to be met. Because of the expansion without a guaranteed price or a bilateral agreement, Japan has had a bonanza. Because Japan has been able to buy",35,Governor General S Speech
66,( Mr Mcmahon) In His Budget Speech Last Night.,,36,Governor General S Speech
67,Tralian Country Party ( Mr Mcewen) When,"at the world parity price, which has been fluctuating around £Stg20, it has been able to tax its own consumers of sugar at a very high figure. In the last 3 years the actual revenue to the Japanese Government bas been in the vicinity of $60m. It is obvious, of course, that Japan can afford to pay and should pay more for Australian sugar. It is to be hoped that if the Government is not successful in securing a new international sugar agreement it will be able to encourage Japan to pay a higher price for Australian sugar. As I said previously, Japan has reaped a bonanza in the last 3 years. There is no point in talking about the past any more in regard to the sugar industry. I have always admitted that the Government acted on the best advice that it could find and that the expansion in the long term will be good. My criticism has always been directed to the fact that it has been shown time and time again that encouragement to expand a primary industry should be given only when a long term and satisfactory price has been teed up. But the time for talking is over. As1 said before, 1968 is an action year. If negotiations for a new international sugar agreement towards the end of this financial year are not successful what will happen then? Let us get one thing straight, there is a lot of woolly thinking about the International Sugar Agreement. It does not guarantee a minimum price. It is more or less a 'hoped for' price. It is simply an agreement between countries which will control stocks and this in turn provides a large measure of control over the floor price. Under the last two agreements the floor price was reached only a little more than 50% of the time. Even if there is an international sugar agreement there is not the same security in the sugar industry as is obtained from a firm pricing arrangement, such as our own domestic price, our price under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement or the position which applies with the sale of sugar to the United States of America. What happens if the International Sugar Agreement fails? It is obvious that the Government and the industry cannot afford to monkey around any further with interest bearing loans. It is obvious that some permanent system of price stabilisation must come into effect in this industry. This may be full price stabiliMinister for Primary Industry( Mr Anthony) sation of the industry embracing all markets and giving a guaranteed average price to the whole industry or there may be a partial system of stabilising the export side of the industry. Whatever happens, something has to be done in 1968 to put t\ is industry on a secure footing. If the industry expanded on the advice of the Federal and Queensland Governments then surely the rank and file cane grower is entitled to be able to go to bed at night and wake up in the morning knowing that he will get at least a reasonable price for his crop. He has not been able to do this in the last 3 years. I feel that the greatest opposition to an approach to the Government by the sugar industry will come not from the growers but from milling interests. The quicker the canegrowers of Queensland realise that it is about time that they spoke with one voice-as growers-and refused to ba influenced to a large degree, as they now are, by the millers or those who have a vested interest in the milling side of the industry, the better it will be for cane farmers. The growers and the millers have a definite conflict of objectives. The cane grower and the miller have conflicting interests just as the meat operator and the meat producers have conflicting interests. In economic terms, both parties seek to maximise their profit and both cannot maximise their profit if, in fact, they speak with one voice. It is quite clear that there needs to be co-operation and advice. As I said before, the quicker the Queensland Cane Growers Council speaks with one voice-the voice of the growers-and listens to millers only for sound advice, the better it will be for the cane farmer. This is, in fact, why the growers broke away from the Australian Sugar Producers Association, as they did many years ago. For example, could anyone imagine the Vestey and Swift meat organisations being in agreement with the policy of cattle producers? The same principle must apply to any conflicting policies of the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd and those of the cane growers. It would seem, also, that any current moves to approach the Federal Government by cane growers for assistance is to be met with opposition from the Government. I noticed the statement made by the last week in Brisbane on this point in which he said that the extent of community assistance to the sugar industry and other industries is being questioned. Of course it is being questioned. We shall always have knockers who will question financial assistance to industries. We shall always have people who will question the provision of funds for water conservation, for the dairy industry or for research, for example. There is nothing new about this but provided that proposals are based on sound arguments there is nothing to be afraid of. The Minister said: While you are being helped, you will attract attention. You will attract criticism. People will jected to the tremendous influence of want to look at your private accounts. The bigger your problem is, and the more it requires the alloprivate sugar millers and the Colonial cation of public funds, the more critical you must expect the community to be, and the more your freedom of action may be inhibited. I think this is a type of blackmail. In other words, the Government is saying: 'We do not want you to come to us at this point of time'. As far as I am concerned the industry should ignore this type of advice. It has to fight for everything it gets and if it thinks it has a good case it should present it to the Government. Certainly there are valid arguments why we should wait to see what happens with respect to a possible international sugar agreement, but the most important thing at the present time is for the Queensland Cane Growers Council to speak with one voice-the voice of the growersand present its case for assistance, fully documented, to the Government. On the question of growers versus sugar millers I point out that I have noticed in my own electorate and the far north a growing discontent at the tremendous influence that sugar millers and the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd have on the industry. I refer the House to the policy of the Australian Labor Party on this point. A Labor government would arrange for a referendum amongst bona fide cane growers to establish once and for all whether cane growers wanted the dominant say in determining policy with respect to the production and marketing of sugar on the export market. In effect this would weaken the say of millers such as the CSR. This would be effected by means of the establishment of an Australian sugar board, the main representation on which would be from cane growers. This certainly does not mean that millers would be excluded but the main representatives on such an Australian sugar board would be cane growers. This would give the cane growers the same effective say in their own industry as cattle producers through the operations of the Australian Meat Board have in the beef industry. The cattle producers have the dominant say in the Australian Meat Board but the Board has the advantage of the sound advice of operators. Policy is always determined by growers rather than operators. The same thing should happen in the sugar industry. The cane growers should determine policy and should not be subSugar Refining Co. Ltd. I say this because the structure of the industry has changed drastically and 70% of total exports today have to be disposed of on the free market. Because of this, cane growers must face the stark fact, so apparent now, that they themselves must look closely at their own organisation to see if constructive changes are necessary. This must be the guiding force in the future because the industry today is facing a serious crisis. Let nobody refuse to believe that. Any industry that has to sell 70% of its total export on the notoriously unstable free market is in a most dangerous position unless there are guaranteed prices. This is a most important point. As I see it, in the future the sugar industry will have to re-organise its own ranks and speak with greater determination as growers rather than be dominated by CSR and the proprietary millers. Millers and growers have different objectives. The Queensland Cane Growers Council can speak as growers only. Order!

Su:h techniques of clandestine warfare, of covert aggression leading to the overt aggression and ultimate defeat of the victim nations if they were to prove successful, would lead to the development of the 'Vietnam technique' against the independent peoples throughout the world in the undeveloped areas of Asia, Africa and Latin America. From North Vietnam the military commander-in-chief, General Giap, is on the record as saying that the war in South Vietnarn is the very model of the national liberation movements of our time. Also from North Vietnam its Prime Minister is on record as saying: The experience of our compatriots in South Vietnam attracts the attention of the world, especially the peoples of Latin America. Only a few years ago the 'Peking People's Governor General's Speech which deals Daily' carried an editorial which stated: It is advantageous from the point of view of withdraw from Malaysia and Singapore. tactics to refer to the desire for peaceful transition Reference is made to those ground forces from capitalism to Communism, but it would be which for so long have contributed to the inappropriate to emphasise that possibility. The editorial continued: The Communist Party must never entertain the members of the Cabinet may feel that I am illusion that the transition to Communism can critical of Australian statements designed be achieved through the parliamentary road. Violent revolution is the universal law of proletarian to indicate that Australia has no intention revolution. To realise the transition to Communism, of taking over Great Britain's responsibithe proletariat must wage armed struggle. Finally there is the now world famous comments are singularly unfortunate statement of Mao Tse-tung: Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. People like this have only contempt for responsibilities of 'emergency' in South adversaries who use words like 'merely'. For East Asia. This is wrong. No matter what my part I should have preferred to see thc Australian Government says about not the phrase 'in a total sense' used in the accepting responsibilities that are being Speech instead of the adverb 'merely'.

First, there was the Second in a total sense the cessation of aggression against World War. From the late 1920s, the the people of South Vietnam. . . In my view this would have been a more appropriate expression in these circumstances. I turn now to another aspect of this matter which is exciting the attention of Australia's people in view of recent events. It is my view that the time has now arrived for a limited form of Press censorship ia relation to matters concerned with the war in Vietnam. Troop movements and shipping movements are referred to in our Press in a manner which I regard as militarily irresponsible. The enemy is watching and listening for 24 hours of every day to collect and collate all information which would be of interest to the intelligence officers of the North Vietnamese headquarters and the Vietcong. I have watched detailed television reports on particular areas of South Vietnam which I know would be of real interest to the enemy and I cannot help feeling that there are in this country people who have ways and means of passing information to the enemy. I wish now to turn to that section of the with the British Government's decision to stability of the region. I have some comments to make on this matter and some lity in South East Asia. In my view those because they create in the minds of the Australian people a false concept. They create the idea that it may be possible for Australia in some way to avoid the dire Singapore and Kuala Lumpur by the The threats to stability which have been United Kingdom Government provided a plan which was described as the 'Main Fleet to Singapore' in the event of a conflagration in South East Asia. It will be recalled that in the early 1930s the Japanese conquest of Manchuria had begun. It was at this time that the Main Fleet to Singapore concept was announced by the United Kingdom Government as being the main plan to protect the interests of the British Empire in the Far East. We now know from experience, which to many honourable gentlemen has been of a very personal nature, that this was a policy based upon a complete misunderstanding of circumstances and without a proper appreciation of equipment needed to implement that policy. It is true to say that the efforts of the United Kingdom to protect Singapore, particularly when it was necessary in 1942, were fearfully unfortunate having regard to those policies which were being carried out by the United Kingdom Government in the early 1930s at the precise time when it was talking about a 'Main Fleet to Singapore' concept. This was a time when the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom was conducting political campaigns on the basis that the United Kingdom would take no part in war and would not re-arm. The people who lost their lives or who went into captivity in South East Asia in 1942 found themselves on the receiving end of these policies of appeasement-policie s which failed to face realities in the 1930s and left Polaris submarine in the area to which I the armed forces ill-equipped in every sense of the term for 1942 when the first great threat to the stability of this area arose. When the threat from the Japanese mobile amphibious force. I suppose this is developed in 1942 it was the Europeans a reference to the special commando force, in the area who at least fought to stop the escorted by aircraft carriers and protected area from being conquered. I know of nofrom submarine attack, to be based in close body who can speak at great length on the proximity to Malaysia so that it would be efforts made by those people indigenous to possible for the government attacked to the area. The second attempt to create call upon the United Kingdom Governinstability-to destroy prosperity, peace and ment to send the force to its assistance. I good government in the area-wa s the think it is clear that if such a force were Communist attempt to subvert and conquer to exist it could be based only in Australia. Malaya in the post-war period. It was here, It would be childish to suggest that it could culminating in the success of Field Marshal be based in India and absurdto suggest Templer, that the British Army carried out that it could be based in South Africa. It a series of policies which resulted in the is quite apparent that the port facilities for failure of the Communist campaign. That maintenance of the vast vessels involved campaign was part of a concerted effort in such an amphibious force would need which was developed side by side with the to be in the Commonwealth of Australia. It efforts being made in Indo-China and in the is my view that as future defence commitPhilippines by the Hukbalahaps, as well ments develop within this country it will be as in Burma and Thailand in those days. It was the soldiers from the United Kingdom, supported by considerable forces from Australia, who protected Malaya on that occasion. So on the second occasion when the threat and the emergency developed, Australians, whether they liked it or not, were involved. The third threat to stability has been Indonesia's confrontation. On this occasion also, like it or not, Australians were involved. The truth is that Australia's front line is in Malaya and whenever our front line is threatened we will participate. I therefore find unacceptable statements indicating that the people of the United Kingdom are ignoring their real responsibilities and retiring from the area and that we, for a variety of reasons which are purely selfish, propose to do nothing to replace the defensive power that is being removed. After all, that power is 'people'. There has been no suggestion from the Government of the United Kingdom or from the Australian Government that naval power and air power would not be available to protect Malaysia or Singapore, because it is apparent to most people that naval power in 1968 refers to such ships as HMS. 'Revenge', which was launched recently and which carries sufficient power to destroy an enemy that may launch an armed attack upon the city of Singapore. Naval power of the future will be seen in the form of the have referred. Reference is made in the Governor General's Speech to the absence of the clear to all that such a powerful naval base will be needed somewhere on the northern sbores of Australia. As I said earlier, Australian participation Speech as expressing the policy of the Prime in the circumstances of the first two threats and the third threat is now an established fact of history. If there is to be a fourth threat to Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines, we must ask ourselves what form it will take. We have the evidence of the Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who states that if the West withdraws from the area, his nation will go into the Communist mincing machine within a couple of years. I assume Mr Lee Kuan Yew knows what he is talking about. I understand that he has many friends on the other side of this chamber. He ought to be taking steps to prepare some of his own citiness and pointlessness of the policy that has zens so that they will be able to prevent this to be explained. It was merely stated by process from taking place. I am confident that if Singapore and Malaysia look like being swept into the Communist mincing machine-and there is justification in what Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Tunku Abdul Rahman have said about that possibilityAustralia will be represented in efforts to defend them. It is of no help to the people of Australia to let them imagine an absolutely false set of circumstances. It is far more valuable to the welfare of this country to tell the Australian people the truth. They are interested in the facts and are prepared to stand up and face them when the need to do so is shown to them. 1 want to make two or three comments about recent events in Papua and New Guinea. I am delighted to observe in the Governor General's Speech mention once more of the view that the Commonwealth sees the destiny of Papua and New Guinea as a self governing country, and regards it now as developing towards the attainment of independence at a time when it is clearly demonstrated by the majority of the indigenous people that this is what they wish. I hope we shall adhere to this policy. We shall have to provide great sums of money to assist the indigenous people along the road to education and economic viability. honourabte member for North Sydney( Mr branch of weaponry, conventional as well as Graham) made a fairly fundamental critisense nuclear, and by inculcating in the people a new cism of the Government's foreign policy when he spoke about-thes e are my words clusions from the fact that while the big nucleai not his-the immunity from invasion given to the Government of Ho Chi Minh. This is referred to in the Governor General's Minister( Mr Gorton). There is not any question that if one side has a fundamental aim to drive out an enemy and the other side has no such fundamental aim and virtually guarantees immunity for the bases of its opponent, the war can last for 15 years. The point about this war is that it has just grown. It grew from the overthrow of Diem. Before that, only a few advisers were needed for an operation that was apparently unplanned. What are we now doing? There are now 600,000 or more foreign troops in South Vietnam. The aim is solely to exclude an invading force without pursuing it. It is this seeming endlessthe Prime Minister. There is in the Governor General's Speech no reference to any Government thinking on the non-proliferation treaty in relation to nuclear weapons. It was instructive for me recently to be in India and to have sensed, at least in some political circles, the idea that this treaty would leave India utterly dependent on someone else. If China possesses nuclear weapons and India binds herself not to possess them, India will depend for her defence on the good offices of either the Soviet Union or the United States of America. There is no guarantee that these good offices would be forthcoming. I think there has been a marked tendency in Australia to discuss this subject in the terms of possession or non-possession of nuclear weapons. In fact, the non-proliferation treaty would prove to be a major diplomatic victory to the Soviet Union in that it would rivet firmly her control of the eastern European Communist countries and might drive a wedge between the United States and West Germany. It would make India subordinate to the Soviet Union. Tbis is why it is surprising to find, even in Indian circles, where one would not expect it, the Socialist Party issuing statements such as the following: Against such a contingency India must provide of urgency, discipline and nationalism . . .

This was a statement on behalf of the Praja Socialist Party of India. This question needs looking at closely. I am despondent at not seeing in the Governor General's Speech any revelation on the Government's thinking on this problem. I would like to commend some aspects of the Government's policy in relation to India which I saw when I was there. India has received 590.000 tons of wheat from Australia as a gift over the last 2 k years. This is worth $A35m. I believe that the famine situation which was in mind when this gift was made has disappeared. I would like to see the equivalent of that gift of $35m invested in the development of fertiliser plants in India. I was left in no doubt, as 1 travelled through areas which are normally of secure rainfall, of the beautiin absolute power. Having for years seen ful and surprisingly empty country, and my impression was that it was far richer than Australia. A man whose friend I became and his father took up 60 acres of what was classified as waste Iand 40 miles north-east of Delhi. This man was rather derided by the Indian agricultural experts. After very few years, that waste land produced the world's record production of wheat-16 0 bushels to the acre, compared with our 18 bushels to the acre. This was due largely to the applying of trace elements. If the Government can show generosity to the extent of a gift of wheat worth $3 5m, it may be the path of wisdom also to invest an equivalent sum in the production of trace elements and in the establishment of plants to produce fertilisers in India. The Minister for External Territories 'have put a lot of talent into the effort to ( Mr Barnes) has remained wedded to what build motive-for development, welfare, he calls the Westminster system of governeducation, health, independence and the ment.

But an inbuilt accelerator of the swift centralisation of power that took demand has also beaten some of the indeplace in African states after independence. pendent governments of Africa. The newly Yet this was a reflection of most of their colonial history. Whatever last minute changes were made before independence, there was no separation of power and no distinction between administration and policy making in the powers vested in the Governor and his subordinate officials. Since 1884 the Governor or Administrator in the Territory has exercised a concentration of political and administrative power. Elected legislatures are very recent. If some figure of the future reverts to the exercise of all administrative and political power in Papua and New Guinea, let us face the fact that this is the result of 80 years of our training and of British training since annexation. I honestly believe we will get more secure separation of powers if we have a president separate from the legislature, and independently elected, choosing his cabinet and men having to work out a modus vivendi with the legislature. In all the African states the fusion of the Cabinet with the Parliament has led to the one party state. It has led, therefore, to the executive and the legislature supporting one another the Governors and their entourages exercising such power, we can understand that this is the vision of power that they have. I frankly believe that the vision of power that thinking people in Papua and New Guinea have is the power now exercised by the Administrator and not the power, or the absence of power, at the moment vested in the House of Assembly. The references to the Territory made in the Governor General's Speech are perhaps not intended to reveal the depths of Government thinking. However, as the Territory moves towards independence, what problems will face Australia and what problems will face the people of the Territory? A recent commentator said that we emerging countries emerge into a world chronically difncult for them, because of the expectations of their people. The newly emerging countries have accepted the determination and even fanaticism of European nationalism. But to it has been grafted 20th Century welfare state ideology. People not only expect independence; they expect a standard of living. Economic goals can be derived from easily imported ideas. The attainment of these goals, however, may depend on physical resources and human resources-the skills, technology and discipline of the population. The idea of welfare may move with quick-silver mobility. The capacity to attain it may move on leaden feet, The process of transforming a simple rural village agricultural economy to a diversified export economy can be very arduous. Ordered and steady development cannot take place without a highly efficient educational, administrative and technical structure in the country, and the discipline which will eschew reaching for guns on the Nigerian model when the going is difficult. Emerging nations find a terrible gap between their aspirations, which are often derived from the standards of the former colonial governments, nations and nationals, and their own resources. No doubt this is what underlies the decision of the Australian Government to cut the salaries paid to indigenous civil servants-a n independent New Guinea would not be able to afford such salaries. What worries me, however, is the breach of trust. I think a continuing trust that we stood for race equality is more important than the savings effected by the reduced salary scales, more important than the discrepancy between civil service salaries and plantation labour wages, and more important than the increased difficulties of adjustment New Guinea would find arising from a high salary structure on independence. I do not want to labour the point. I believe we must be committed to generous economic assistance to Papua and New Guinea for at least 30 years and that political independence leaves this unaffected. New Guinea, as an emerging country, must attract its people to acquire high skill, and if the resources of the country cannot at first afford this attractive policy we must assist to bridge the gap. Coffee, cocoa, tea and rubber are at the mercy of the world market, and at the mercy of powerful buying nations which can manipulate that market. In a decade Ghana and Nigeria trebled or quadrupled 19 th Century cocoa production and got either no more or less for it. They had to run very hard to stand still. New Guinea will face the same hard facts and we may well be wise to guarantee a paying market in Australia and regard the cost as part of ideological defence. I believe, realistically, we must campaign massively for English as a unifying language. I do not ignore pidgin as a lingua franca, but English must be the unifying language of government and education. The relatively radical Pangu Pati recognises this. I believe this means a trebling of our present educational expenditure. I believe the Government is wise to want to attract private investment to New Guinea, but ports, roads, communications, power, irrigation, agricultural training and investment, fisheries and the whole economic infrastructure which must be the physical basis of independence seems to me to involve a deliberately and realistically planned capital grant of something more than $50m a year for 30 years. Australia is respected^ in the field of foreign aid because its gifts are gifts, and not loans, and are not with strings attached. Similarly we need a policy over a generous period of time of generous capital assistance in Papua and New Guinea. The World Bank report projects an increasing demand for primary and secondary education and makes recommendations which would increase educational costs. It estimates a primary school age population of 400,000 in 1969 with 250,000 of them in primary schools. It estimates about 25,000 in secondary schools at the same time. The report of the mission of the Bank for International Reconstruction and Development comments: In a society that is moving so rapidly from a primitive economy into a cash economy with the consequent need for all types of skilled manpower, it has not been possible to estimate with any degree of accuracy what numbers and skills are needed. The Administration will have to keep the question under continuous study. . . . It is reasonable to assume, however, that an increased enrolment by 1969 of 3..000 pupils or more in the technical stream would be required. I agree with the policy of the Government of which, by the way, having regard to in not naming a definite date of indepenthe state of the telephone system in Papua dence but I believe that our grant, our and New Guinea, are urgently required. educational policy, our economic and developmental policies should all be framed with the clear objective of creating an independent nation, and trust is a vital Ward: factor. Everything that makes for stability in the that when men or governments work intelligently Territory, including our own trustworthiness, plays a part in Australian defence. Out of their poverty and out of scarce skills, scarce it as a good stroke of business. It was a moral materials, scarce resources and desperately scarce capital the low income emerging nations have to try to allocate a proportion for development. To accumulate capital they must force down any increases in consumption by the majority. This creates the tensions which threaten society. Tn the case of New Guinea we can do much to prevent this. Is generosity wise? I believe it is. It is tainties and incoherences, of the system as we wise because there is no alternative. When we talk of foreign private investment we in fact talk of the extractive industriesespecially the oil industry, the refineries associated with it and the extraction of metals. These become focal points of dissatisfaction as foreigners appear to cart away resources. Foreign firms engaged in service industries and manufacturers do not attract similar hostility, but New Guinea, I am afraid, offers better prospects to the extractive industries, and in Bougainville we are already seeing the resistance. I do not think that we should be wedded to the Westminster system for New Guinea. A President and Congress may better suit their need for unity. I believe the expatriate Civil Service should become part of the Commonwealth Civil Service and be treated as a force on loan, paid directly from Canberra, not through the Territories grant. This would be a clear step towards independence and away from dissatisfaction. It would also, incidentally, increase the skills available to New Guinea without the accommodation charges of permanent residence of expatriates if short-term services of technicians in the Commonwealth Service became available to do jobs and return to Australia. I mean by this that experts from the Post Office, for instance, could go there for a few months to do particular jobs-som e Where does all this lead to? May I conclude by quoting the economist Barbara To me, one of the most vivid proofs that there is a moral governance in the universe is the fact and far-sightedly for the good of others, they achieve their own prosperity too. Take our Western experience with the welfare state. We did not plan decision with ancient antecedents. Yet one of the consequences has been to reduce business risks. Mass consumption, secured by social security, enables the economy to avoid the boom and collapses of the old economy. I believe we should see the same outcome if in the world economy we could determine to build up the purchasing power of the poorer nations. We should find that, once again, our own prosperity had been helped by underpinning of world consumption and by the creation of a world economy free from the ups and downs, the uncerknow it today. 'Honesty is the best policy' used to be said in Victorian times. I would go further. I would say that generosity is the best policy, and that expansion of opportunity sought for the sake of others ends by bringing well being and expansion to oneself. The dice are not hopelessly loaded against us. Our morals and our interests-see n in true perspective-d o not pull apart. I share with the honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Graham) a view which I believed him to be expressing. The Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) has said clearly enough that we cannot replace the United Kingdom if the United Kingdom withdraws from east of Suez. But, after all, in the White Paper that was issued there were many statements about the availability of naval and other forces to come back in the event of an emergency. Lee Kuan Yew has disputed the idea that the British would actually come back into a land operation and live again in Singapore or Malaysia, but in any event there is an undertaking given by the United Kingdom. I think it would be wise for us, instead of dwelling upon what we cannot do, to state what we can do. I think there is a very great deal that we can do. Lee Kuan Yew, who believed that the British withdrawal would take place over 8 years, has suddenly been confronted with British withdrawal over 3 i years. If he wants to build the patrol boats or acquire the aircraft to replace the ones that have been provided up to now by the British, then he faces a telescoping time period and a multiplying defence expenditure. He must complete his replacements in 31 years instead of 8 years. He will face a very heavy economic burden. I would have been pleased to hear the Prime Minister state this clearly and to say also that our assistance was directed towards helping him to make these changes. I believe that the diplomatic efforts of Australia should be bent in another direction also. When I recently came into Singapore I was impressed by the honesty of the Government. One was also impressed by the magnificent quality of the Chinese children in Singapore, and one was oppressed by the sense that one of the matters weighting the minds of the people in Singapore was the extermination of the 300,000 Chinese in neighbouring Indonesia. We are friendly towards Indonesia, but I still say that genocide is a crime, and I hope the whole weight of Australian influence is directed against this extermination. We are never going to escape the price of these crimes. They have a cost. They must mean something in the minds of IS million Chinese in South East Asia, who make up a very important community. This was not a pogrom directed against Chinese Communists-althoug h I am not, indeed, interested in a pogrom directed against anybody. It was a pogrom directed against the Chinese business community, and if we have an atom of intelligence we must realise that it does add very greatly to the feeling of insecurity nesia was our sworn enemy. That is all in Singapore. I do not expect the Government to blather representations on these matters all around the world, but I hope that the direction of Australian diplomacy will always be towards making representations designed to check the insanity of actions such as the one that now greatly disturbs me. If we do show without any doubt that we stand as a force for sanity in this part of the world then I think we will also be making a contribution to our own security. T would not expect a comment on -this to appear in the Prime Minister's speech. I am a member of the Opposition and have been a member of the Opposition for a great many years, and I personally feel free to speak on this matter. I have not an atom of hostility towards Indonesia or an atom of bitterness towards the Government of that country which has taken over with a military coup after all the confusion. But the killing of 300,000 people merely because they are Chinese is a crime, and 1 hope we will never see a repetition of it. listen with a great deal of interest to what the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) has to say. I think that other members on this side of the House, as well as I , share his feelings about Indonesia. None of us has an atom of hostility towards Indonesia. But my mind goes back to the days when this Government came under severe criticism, not from the honourable member for Fremantle but from some of the leading members of his Party, over our attitude lowards Indonesia and its policy with respect to West New Guinea. At one stage I believe the then Leader of the Opposition proclaimed that we should, on our own, attack Indonesia for its moving into West New Guinea when this, of course, was something that the whole world would have revolted against. The policies we pursued in those days have slowly borne fruit. Indonesia's policy of confrontation of Malaysia has been ended, and indeed we look forward to Indonesia doing what we hoped she would do-joinin g us in some kind of regional aid in this part of the world. I do not think that any one of successive Ministers for External Affairs or successive governments has at any stage of our political thinking wanted to declare that IndoI have to say on that matter. I repeat that I pay close attention to what the honourable member for Fremantle says, and I only hope that some members of his own Party listen as closely as I do when the honourable member puts forward his theories on subjects like that of Papua and New Guinea. In rising to speak in this debate on the motion for the adoption of the Address-inReplyI feel that I must make some reference to the sad event that occurred in December last. I join with other members in paying a tribute to the late Prime Minister. These tributes have been offered at various sittings of this Parliament and I believe they adequately express the thoughts of us all. But I want to make a comment about one aspect of that tragedy which disturbed me at the time. I refer to the suggestions that appeared in many of our",42,Governor General S Speech
71,Mr Chaney (Perth) [5.47],"I alwaysnewspapers that we should at all times mount an almost impenetrable guard around the Prime Minister. 1 am pleased to see that the new Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) does not think that in this country such action is necessary. 1 hope the time will never come when it is necessary to surround an Australian Prime Minister, even in his most relaxed moments, by people in a position to see that no harm comes to him. We have become accustomed to Royal visits to this country; we are conscious of the fact that the Queen is under some protection but that protection is something that goes unnoticed. It is there but it is difficult to detect, which is the sort of protection we want in this country, without bowing to some television idea of gunslinging men standing in close proximity to those who accept public office. The Australian people expect not that sort of situation but a situation where the Prime Minister can walk freely among us and can spend his relaxed moments the way he wants to spend them. If his relaxation consists of something that has an element of danger in it, then this tends to make him an ordinary Australian, which is how, I am quite certain, any Prime Minister of this country would want to be regarded. I agree witb honourable members on both sides of the House that the Governor General's Speech does not cover the whole field of Government activity. NeitherI nor any of my colleagues would expect it to do that. Nevertheless its contents caused some of us deep thought on many of the subjects that were raised. I intended, in this particular debate, to speak on some of the matters of social welfare, but last Thursday1 listened with a great deal of interest to the honourable member for St George( Mr mentioned because it does not have what Bosman) when he made a speech touching on these particular points. He is one member of this House who is very ably qualified to speak on such matters because of his long association, in an official capacity, with an association which has taken upon itself to look after the civilian widows in the community. I refer of course to the Apex movement, of which the honourable member has been a most prominent member in New South Wales. I ask the Government and the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth) to pay close attention to what the honourable 1258-3/68-R-[10 ] member for St George said because I firmly believe that the field of social services is one area in which a lot could be done to assist the needy section of the community, that section which covers the civilian widows. If something can be done to lighten their burden then the gratitude of the whole community will be bestowed on the Government. We have to move away from the philosophy that a civilian widow shall be allowed to earn. My own feeling is that they should be put in a position where they can devote their time to bringing up a family, if they have one, without thinking in terms of how hard they work and what limit will be put on their earnings, ln this country when we speak of our affluence, our position in the world and our capacity to withstand the economic shocks that are taken by other nations, the least we can do is look after the least fortunate section of our people. I noted with some interest that, as usual, the Governor General's Speech, following suggestions made by his advisers, mentioned some of the primary industries. Year after year 1 hear mention made of the sugar industry and the dairying industry and sometimes the wheat industry or the wool industry, ail of which are very important to our economy and all of which help to sustain our economic trends and to maintain the stability of Australia. It has struck me always as rather strange that the only indigenous primary industry in Australia, which is fishing, never gets a mention. I sometimes wonder why. I know that the numbers engaged in fishing are only approximately .9% of the total workforce or about 1.3% of the workforce engaged in primary industry. I supposefishingis not one would call a direct representative. I know that if someone spoke about something that was to happen to the sugar farmers one would have the sort of situation that arose this afternoon when the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) devoted 25 minutes to discussing sugar farmers. One has only to mention Mrs Jones and four or five speakers rise to extol the virtues of the dairying industry as against margarine. Of course, wheat has its champions. Fishing is the only indigenous primary industry in the nation and it rarely gets anyone to speak for it. I have the feeling that the fishermen themselves, a very small band of people, have the idea that not enough is done for them both by the State governments, which have in the main the responsibility for inshore fishing, and by the the Address-in-Reply. By tradition the Federal Government, through the Department of Primary Industry, which is responsible for offshore fishing between the 3-mile and the 12-mile limits. It is rather alarming when one looks at the industry to realise that from one nation alone, Japan, we are importing the bulk of our fish and to it we export such a small amount. We are paying something for the product of an industry which we could develop ourselves thereby saving a lot of overseas currency. I have taken, from the Australian 'Year Book', some figures in respect of fishing. In 1965-66-the latest year for which figures are available-w e imported some 91 million lb of fish valued at some $29m and in the same period we exported some 22 million Ib of fish valued at some $24m. When one realises that most of the exports were of crayfish tails, in the main from my own State, it is seen that the rest is not a very great amount from a country which has some of the best edible fish in the world. Out of this total of $29m spent on imports some $7m was spent on imports obtained from Japan, yet we send there only some $1.2m worth of fish out of a total of $24m of our exports. I know that thefishermen-I speak not for the fishermen on the east coast of Australia but for those who are earning a great amount of our export income around the west coast and up towards the Gulf of Carpentaria-ar e very disturbed about the fact that the Commonwealth Government now allows the Japanese fishermen to come in on an experimental basis to test the capacity of the fishing grounds. Numerous Australians with this knowledge at theirfingertipscould develop the fishing industry and earn money for us, provided they are given assistance of the general pattern of that which is given to any other primary industry. I mention only those two points because I want to devote some portion of my speech to what was, to me, the other disturbing item in the Governor General's Speech, namely, the British withdrawal from east of Suez. Sirring suspended from 5.58 p.m. to 8 p.m. effect of a presence. If hostilities broke out tbe sitting I omitted the customary practice of congratulating the mover and seconder of the motion for the adoption of mover and seconder of the motion are usually new members. However the only new member we now have is the Prime Minister and it might have been somewhat difficult for us to get him to move this motion. I congratulate the honourable member for Henty( Mr Fox). The tribute that was paid to him in asking him to move this motion was some reward for the hard work that he has done as a member of this House. Of all the members on this side who could have been chosen to move this motion, none was more deserving than he. 1 had referred to a couple of aspects of social welfare and to the fishing industry, and had indicated that I intended to speak of the proposed withdrawal of British forces from east of Suez. I do not know whether I can link the British withdrawal of forces with social welfare, and there may be some doubt about whether I can tie it to the fishing industry, but I hope to show some relation between the two matters. The section of the Governor General's Speech which concerns me and, I know, a number of honourable members, and probably people in my own State more than Australians elsewhere, was where His Excellency said: In our near north, in lhe areas of Malaysia and Singapore, the situaiion bas altered since the close of the last Session. Since that time, the British Government has decided to speed up the withdrawal of those ground forces which has for so long contributed to the stability of the region, ln the result, a withdrawal which was scheduled to be completed by the end of 1975 will now be completed by the end of 1971. This is, of course, a significant acceleration of the rate of withdrawal on which previous thinking and planning was based. But even more significant is the apparent abandonment of the previous intention that there would be a British mobile amphibious force available at all times for use in the area, of significant capability, and able rapidly to reach the region. My friend, the honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Graham), when speaking earlier this afternoon seemed to cast some doubts on the value of a British presence in the area east of Suez and he referred to what happened in 1940-41. I do not think that we should look at this in terms of the",46,Governor General S Speech
72,Mr Chaney,"Before the suspension ofor a conflagration started, the great value of the presence would be as a deterrent rather than as an offensive presence. The value of the presence lies in the fact that it might continue to give us peace in this region rather than the use that might come of it if some country decided to commence overt aggression. I deeply regret the British decision. 1 realise that the United Kingdom Prime Minister, Mr Wilson, stated in the House of Commons that it was useless for Britain to build up military power in other parts of the world unless she had economic stability at home, and that Britain's first consideration must be economic stability. This is the sort of argument that one could engage in at length: Which should come first? It is almost the argument about the chicken and the egg. I do not think that we have to consider the possibility of Australia taking over the British role east of Suez when Britain withdraws her forces, because we are east of Suez and live in the area. We are not 10,000 miles away. We should be aiming at developing our own independent capacity. We have a responsibility to do this, but it might hurt a little when we set about doing this. It is no good standing idle and thinking that Britain ought to be here and that America should fill the vacuum. This is a task for Australia and we must meet it from our own resources. On 16th January, discussing the Royal Navy, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, said: The aircraft carrier force will be phased out as the Hercules aircraft. It seems to me that soon as our withdrawal from Malaysia, Singapore and the Gulf has been completed. As honourable members know, Britain a mobile force that will be able to go decided to scrap two of her carriers and to quickly to the assistance of Commonwealth keep two m service for a further period. As countries, a decision to cut down the transMr Wilson said on 16th January, this would port force cuts across that objective. coincide with fhe British withdrawal from east of Suez. He continued: There will also be reductions in the rate of new tish White Paper on defence was debated. naval construction, for example! And1 emphasise the words 'for example'in the nuclear powered hunter-killer submarines. I suppose that most honourable members Government's decision by Mr Heath, the know enough about politics to realise that Leader of the Opposition. On 4lh March when it is said in the Parliament that some1968 Mr Healey said: thing is to be done and the words 'for example' are used, one can conjecture about But once our withdrawal from the Gulf and what will follow. I think we can see in Singapore this decision by the British Government that Atlantic area-whethe r under United Nations naval construction not only of the hunterkiller submarine type but also perhaps of other types will be curtailed. This, of course, will have grave implications for Australia. In the same statement the United Kingdom Prime Minister said that Britain had decided to scrap her F ill programme, not because the aircraft was not operationally sound but on purely economic grounds. Britain's previous decision to close down her own aircraft industry, abandon the manufacture of the TSR2 aircraft and adopt an American aircraft would now, in effect, be reversed. Even worse, Britain will not have an aircraft at all. So we get a situation in which Great Britain, one of the players in the big league of thc past, has now decided to join the little league and not be equipped with the sort of forces that could be used as a deterrent in various parts of the world. In the same speech the British Prime Minister said: We have told both Governments-Malaysi a and Singapore-that we do not thereafter plan to retain a special military capability for use in the urea. But ive have assured them both and our other Commonwealth partners This includes Australia, of courseand allies concerned that we shall retain a general capability based in Europe, including tbe United Kingdom, which can be deployed overseas as, in our judgment, circumstances demand, including support for United Nations operations. The next matter to which I direct attention is his reference to the Royal Air Force. He said: The reduction in our overseas commitments will make it possible to cut down the Transport Force. He was speaking of heavy lift aircraft like if it is decided to withdraw troops from east of Suez, and a promise is made to develop It is interesting to study copies of the British 'Hansard' of this month when a BriBearing in mind Mr Wilson's January statement, 1 should like to refer honourable members to what Mr Healey, the Minister of Defence, said in reply to an attack on the and Malaysia is complete any forces we provide for operations outside Europe nnd the auspices or otherwise-wil l have to be drawn from the capability which we maintain for the defence of Europe subject, where necessary, to the agreement of our NATO allies. We shall not maintain a special capability for operations outby the British withdrawal. I think therefore Side Europe. The only comment I make on that is that if Britain is going to build up a force to meet any NATO demand, or for her own defence in the area of Europe, and if we then say that we need some sort of assistance and the matter has to be referred to a NATO power to get agreement, then, as I said earlier, it is time we looked to our own capabilities. It appears that as much as Britain would like to assist in maintaining stability in this part of the world it is in fact not in a position to do so. We will have to undertake a greater acceptance of our responsibilities. As I said earlier, my idea of continuing forces in this part of the world is for their deterrent capacity rather than their offensive capacity. Ever since its foundation this country has been-excep t for a short period during World War II-unde r the shelter of the umbrella of the Royal Navy. This situation has changed, as honourable members will realise from the quotations that I have read from the British debates on defence. I believe that we should realise how Russia is increasing her influence in the Indian Ocean area of the world. I do not see this statement as dragging up the old Communist bogey. The facts are before us. Russia's influence is continuing and growing in areas such as the Suez Canal, the Gulf of Aden and the Yemen and there is ample evidence of an increasing interest and influence in the Indian Ocean area. More Russian ships are daily using this seaway for various purposes. I think that the presence of Russia in this part of the world can have a profound effect on the policies of certain African countries. As I said earlier, we live east of Suez. I live in Western Australia. The British withdrawal of forces from east of Suez has probably made a far greater impact on the people in my own State than it has in other parts of Australia. This area is of vital importance to Australia. It is the most important section of the trade route to Europe as some 45% of all our trade passes through the Indian Ocean. Trade between Australia and Japan is increasing and most of it originates on the west coast of Australia. AlthoughI read in the Press today that some day we will be self sufficient in oil, it is well to remember that 70% of our supplies come from the area above us, which is directly affected that we have to give earnest consideration to a lot of matters affecting our defence in the near future. We can discount any quick movement of Army and Air Force personnel from Great Britain. We cannot help but realise that there is no quick method of moving naval forces from Britain to a distant area like the Indian Ocean. This will take some weeks as they must go around the Cape or through the Panama Canal. I am assuming that the Suez Canal could not be used in that situation. We have only to look over the past 3 years to see how quickly that waterway can be put out of commission. I think that our naval planning must soon look for a replacement for the aircraft carrier HMAS 'Melbourne', which is being refitted at present, because with the complete phasing out of the British aircraft carriers we will need to have a mobile airstrip in the Indian Ocean. The only effective mobile airstrip is an aircraft carrier which can be at sea for most of the time and act as a deterrent to the countries that border us. member's time has expired. Suspension of Standing Orders agreed to: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking without limitation of time. th3 Opposition) [8.15]-Sinc e I became a member of this Parliament I have heard seven speeches by the Governor General. The Speech we heard on Tuesday was incomparably the least substantial, the least significant, of all those speeches. Never has a Speech contained so few proposals; seldom has a regular session of a Parliament been asked to examine so little legislation. The new Prime Minister declared his intention to 'rule off the book'. He has written nothing on the new page. Briefly, lei me itemise the most obvious and in some cases quite astonishing omissions from the Speech. In his speech opening the Senate election campaign, the late Prime Minister said that the present Prime Minister( Mr Gorton), who was then Minister for Education and",48,Governor General S Speech
73,Mr Speaker,Order! The honourable,50,Governor General S Speech
74,Motion (By Mr Barnes),by leave;,50,Governor General S Speech
75,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa,"Leader ofScience, was examining proposals for Commonwealth aid for school libraries and preschool training centres. No such proposals are contained in the Governor General's Speech. If Mr Holt had uot disappeared, the Parliament would presumably have met weeks ago and the Minister for Education and Science would bave been obliged to produce legislation to honour Mr Holt's election promise. On the same occasion, Mr Holt foreshadowed proposals for dealing with the problem of the chronically ill. We could fairly expect that this election promise, too, would have been presented to the Parliament in the form of legislation if Mr Holt had lived. But now, more than 4 months after the late Prime Miinster's promise, the Speech merely refers vaguely to 'proposals to remove from the minds of Australians the fear of economic consequences of long continued illness'. Shortly after the new Prime Minister was sworn in, the postal workers went on strike. The Prime Minister said on 17th January that there was 'an underlying malaise in the Post Office'. But there is not one word about the strike or, more importantly, the need to establish a contemporary framework for Australia's greatest business undertaking and to simplify Australia's most cumbersome arbitration procedures. For the past 3 months the Arbitration Commission has been subject to a series of frontal attacks by the Minister who is responsible for industrial relations at the national level, the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Bury). The Speech was silent on the implications of this Minister's statements. At a time when eastern Australia faces the severest water restrictions in history, the Speech mentions ine drought only to note its existence. No mention is made of plans for further allocation of the $50m for water conservation projects over a 5-year period promised by the late Prime Minister 16 months ago. The late Prime Minister subsequently inserted prohibitions against any of this money being spent on urban water or hydro-electricity projects. These prohibitions presumably still apply. Elsewhere the Prime Minister has referred to his interest in national development, yet in the Speech he gave no justification for continuing the Commonwealth's plans for the winding up of the Snowy Mountains Authority or its suspension of work on the Chowilla dam. New oil and gas discoveries in Bass Strait received perfunctory mention. There is still no suggestion of the need for the development of a national fuel policy to dovetail and distribute our sources of power. The Prime Minister has admitted that the problems of urban development are part of national development problems, but again the Speech is silent on the matter. The financial relations between the Commonwealth and States have reached an impasse. Tn his correspondence with the Premier of Victoria, the Prime Minister said on the one hand that the States would not be permitted to enter the income tax field, but on the other hand he has encouraged the States to proceed with the State receipt taxes already imposed by Victoria and Western Australia. gested at the last Premiers Conference by the Queensland Premier, Mr Nicklin, has publicly stated. Yet on a question involving the whole matter of Commonwealth control over national economic policy, the Speech says nothing. Last October, the late Prime Minister gave an undertaking for an early meeting of Commonwealth and State leaders of the Parliamentary Liberal Parties for talks on Commonwealth-State financial relations. This undertaking has been ignored. While detailing the overseas purchase of defence equipment, nothing is said about the final cost of the F ill , despite the promises by the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairhall) during the Senate campaign that the final cost would be given in January of this year. There is no reference to the new 3-year defence programme which should have been ready to go into operation next July. The Speech performs the remarkable feat of dealing with foreign affairs without mentioning Japan or China. Vietnam is discussed as if the disastrous events of the past 7 weeks had never happened. No reasons were given for the Prime Minister's expressed belief that the present Australian commitment has reached its 'permanent' limit, or for what appears to be his new position that it has not. The Government's response to the accelerated British withdrawal from our region was couched in negatives; we cannot fill Britain's role;",50,Governor General S Speech

Nor does the Speech present any positive proposals to meet the changed situation. The meetings of ANZUS and SEATO in Wellington next month, the meeting of ECAFE at Canberra, are ignored. Perhaps the most striking omission is the utter silence of the Speech on the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. There is not even the broadest indication of the Government's attitude towards it. This catalogue of omissions applies only to matters which have arisen since last session of the Parliament. It would be an interminable list if extended to all the important matters which should engage the attention of this Parliament over the rest of its life. One of the most notable aspects of the Speech is its lack of any originality. Its proposals, sparse as they are, are all left-overs from the previous Administration. This is demonstrated in a striking way if we examine the matters of legal significance which will be dealt with this session-hal f the ascertainable proposals for legislation in forced the States to raise new taxes and the Governor General's Speech. The Commonwealth Superior Court was authorised by Cabinet in December 1962. The Tokyo Convention on Crimes on Aircraft was drawn up in September 1963. Mr Holt, when Treasurer, appointed a committee to recommend a new Cheques Act in April 1962 and received its report in May 1964. Amendments to the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act were promised by Mr Holt as Treasurer in November 1964. Still, however, no steps have been taken to co-ordinate the score of workers' compensation Acts in this country-State, Territorial and Federal. The new law on copyright was promised in the Governor General's Speech of August 1954. A committee was appointed in September 1958. In December 1959 the committee recommended a Bill which would at last enable Australia to become a party to conventions drawn up in 1948 and 1952. The Bill was introduced in May last. It was already out of date, for it was not wide enough to permit Australia to become a party to a further copyright convention which had been drawn up in the meantime in 1961. That Bill was further outdated when yet another convention was drawn up last July. Australian authors and artists and scriptwriters are now denied the benefits of four international conventions concluded over the past 20 years. The plain fact is that, while the Ministry has a new name, a new Prime Minister, it remains unchanged in its essential parts. We have neither new men nor new measures. For all the earlier talk about upheaval, the changes made in the new Ministry are marginal. If the Prime Minister had really intended significant changes and reforms, he had by far his best and probably his last opportunity to make them at the very outset of his Prime Ministership. The great offices remain unchanged. The Treasurer, unacceptable to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade an' 1 vernment but acceptable presumably as Treasurer, remains at his post. He is the architect of the policy which has compelled the States to raise new forms of taxation. By pegging all pensions, he has placed the burden of the defence build-up and the war in Vietnam upon those dependant on the Commonwealth for their income. He has increase charges. By his refusal to review the taxation schedules, he has placed an increasingly inequitable burden on the lower and middle income groups. He has conducted a running public argument with the Minister for Labour and National Service on the true state of the economy. He remains Treasurer. The Minister for Labour and National Service has launched a sustained and deliberate campaign of abuse upon the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and on trade union leadership. He has encouraged employers in their resistance against the application of longargued, long-deliberated and long-delayed judgments of the Commission. He remains to repudiate what he refuses to reform. He remains Minister for Labour and National Service. The Postmaster-Genera] ( Mr Hulme) has presided over two years' turbulence, discontent and decline in the Post Office. He has failed to take the postal unions into his confidence over the crucial question of automation. He remains Postmaster-General. The Minister for National Development ( Mr Fairbairn) held the Ord scheme in doubt and indecision for 3 years. He unceremoniously suspended the Chowilla",51,Governor General S Speech

He is winding up the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority at the time of one of the worse droughts in our history. He will not or cannot devise and develop a national fuel policy. He remains Minister for National Development. The survival of the Minister for External Territories ( Mr It should have dealt with the initiatives Barnes) is a remarkable illustration of the Country Party's power to maintain its influence at the expense of the national interest. Under his administration, industrial conditions in New Guinea have deteriorated, have been reduced and independence has been retarded. Only yesterday, the ViceChancellor of the University of Papua-New Guinea, Dr John Gunther, said that in 3 years New Guinea would be 'less equipped with tertiary manpower' than any country in the world-bu t the Minister remains. The Minister for the Interior( Mr done, or done well, by private individuals Nixon) has remained in his post to promote an electoral gerrymander on behalf of the Country Party. The Minister for Repatriation (Senator McKellar), under whom repatriation benefits have sunk to their lowest real value for 50 years, is retained. The Minister for Health (Dr Forbes), bravery insisting that Australia's health scheme is the best in the world, is retained. The Minister for Social Service is changed. To bear out the Prime Minister's professed interest in social welfare, the Ministry goes from the Cabinet to twentyfifth, second last place, in the outer Ministry. The real point of difference between this achieve immeasurably better results even Ministry and its predecessor is that its internal tensions have become, spectacularly, public property. Three months ago, we could only have guessed at the depth of antagonism, personal and political, between the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Now we have seen the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party branded by the Leader of the Country Party as unfit and unacceptable as Prime Minister. Three months ago, we could only have guessed at the differences between the Treasurer and the Minister for Labour and National Service. Now we have had the demonstration evidenced not merely by their dispute on the state of the economy, but by the very deliberate and public manner in which the Treasurer has been at pains to contradict the Minister. Perhaps, then, it is not surprising that the Governor General's Speech was such a disappointing document. A government which cannot agree even on its propaganda can hardly be expected to produce policies. What should the Speech have contained? which a national government could take to ensure that our resources, particularly our human resources, are used in the best possible way to raise the quality of life in this nation, and to increase our ability to educational opportunities influence events in this region. It should have shown how the National Government proposes to do better those things which k alone can do; how it proposes to do those things which it can do better than State or local governments; how it proposes to make arrangements with those other authorities to do better those things which cannot be or groups; and how it proposes to marshal, use and develop Australia's available resources so that our standards can equal and surpass those achieved in comparable countries. The Government is clearly inhibited by its refusal to admit that our performance is falling behind that of overseas countries with the same standards and systems as our own. The Prime Minister has consistently emphasised the difficulties in the way of advance. In fact, in important areas such as health, social welfare, education, water conservation, transport and urban development, better arrangements for spending the vast amounts which governments already find would without increasing expenditure. This is made very clear in the field of health. The Government's sole action, as indicated by the Speech, is to inquire into the sole contribution it makes to health costs in Australia, namely Commonwealth benefits paid through the health funds. This is the least relevant way of approaching the problem of personal and governmental costs in health. It is fundamentally irrelevant to the nature or quality of health services available to the public. It is entirely irrelevant to the health services available to people not covered by the voluntary schemes. The Prime Minister said at the opening of the by-election campaign in Higgins on 13th February: We have here in Australia a health scheme hospitals, Australian governments pay for which is good; it is amongst the best in tbe world at least 85% of the drugs prescribed in which permits choice by the patient of a doctor, which does not ration hospital or other Australia. In these circumstances, it is accommodation. As a picture of the aotual operation of the Serum Laboratories to supplying no more health scheme, this is pure fantasy.

Contribution tables are fixed without regard to the contributors' ability to pay.

The Commonwealth spends as much on December 1.963. The Speech continues the pharmaceutical benefits as on medical and silence he has consistently maintained ever hospital benefits combined.

Any plans of this nature have been shelved. Instead, we If little can be expected on those matters which the Speech does mention, how much on matters on which the Speech is silent? The present Prime Minister was virtually Minister for Education and Science from fees doubled and in some cases tripled. At tbe University of Western Australia, as a direct result of the Menzies Government's insistence that fees should be charged, the cost of a degree rose eightfold and in some cases tenfold. University quotas have been introduced and have been defended by the present Prime Minister, not merely as a necessary evil, but as a positive good in ensuring that only the most able students can go to university. He rejected the teacher training proposals of the Martin Committee on the Future of Tertiary Education in Australia, the most vital part of that report, since teachers form the whole basis of any educational system. He rejected the proposals of the Weeden Advisory Committee on Educational Television Services on the grounds that educational television was a matter for the States. The education policy of the Government when the Prime Minister was Minister in charge of education was to slash or shelve the recommendations of its own expert committees. We now have it on the authority of Sir primary and secondary schools and Robert Menzies himself that Melbourne technical and teachers' colleges. University had been obliged to redu:e its allocations for research, thus 'severely limiting the vital provisions for post-graduate students and gravely handicapping the Government has shown in the treatment university's future service to the comof our human resources is apparent in the munity'.

He retrenched half the staff of new Minister for the Navy( Mr Kelly), the Commonwealth Office of Education.

He said it to other authorities for educational purwas 'sloppy and sentimental' to view the poses. But he was interested in universities, Snowy Mountains Authority in this role, and for the ablest students at least, even il not went on to describe the Authority as 'a for all qualified students. Australia is one of wonderful mob'. The Prime Minister himthe few countries where most of those who self said last Wednesday: qualify for matriculation are prevented from matriculating-du e to doubled fees and tougher quotas. The real significance of idle. My information is, for example, that the Sir Robert Menzies' dispute with the nresent Authority has been retained by the New South Prime Minister and the new Minister for Wales Government to provide engineering assistEducation is that Sir Robert knows that of Australian universities desperately need staffs, and that staffs of Australian universities must now be produced by Australian universities. It is now clear that, under its new leadership, the Government will still not draw up a long term and consistent plan for education, the whole basis of which must he that the Commonwealth should accept increasing responsibility for education at all levels. Between the First and Second World Wars, Australia accepted the principle that education up to the age of 14 or IS should be available to all and free to all. It is now essential that this principle should be accepted for tertiary education. It would cost less than SlOm a year to abolish university fees altogether. In short, we must extend the principle of free education already accepted in primary and secondary education to university level, and we must extend the principle of Commonwealth participation already accepted at the university level to all other levels of education, The same prodigal attitude which the It should not be thought that the Authority is ance and advice in connection with the building thc Eastern Suburbs Railway. The Snowy Mountains Authority is the greatest planning and construction body this country has ever seen. It is uniquely equipped to handle problems of water conservation. The members of the Snowy teams, both Australian and those brought from overseas, possess together an unparallelled amount of skill and experience in the problems of investigation, design and construction involved in any worthwhile developmental project. The retention of these teams and the retention of the Authority itself as the nucleus of a national water conservation authority is essential if we are to reduce the losses from drought and the waste of our rarest and most precious asset, water, and the salting up of our greatest river system, the Murray-Darling. The Government does not even follow through the planning for projects it has already started. Although the Minister for National Development announced on lst November last that the Commonwealth would assist Western Australia to proceed with stage 2 of the . Ord irrigation project, the Government bas still held no negotiations and made no arrangements with Western Australia concerning inundation and irrigation in the Northern Territory, where at least one-third of the additional Ord water must be used, if it is to be used at all. Australians live in a great continent with by rail with the capital of another State. large concentrations of population hundreds of miles apart. We are an urban and industrial country living by the export of primary and mineral produots. In the Australian economy today, cheap, fast and flexible transport is the key to efficiency in State has refused to give it the consent almost every field. Equally, it is essential for civilised living in our crowded cities. Perhaps the most significant change in the Perth and 'Sydney. In 1949 the Chifley Ministry will prove to be the appointment of the former Minister for Social Services( Mr Sinclair) to the Ministry for Shipping and Transport. While this confirms the Country Party hegemony on all trade matters, it does permit the Ministry to escape from the Liberal Party's prohibition, contained in its platform, against Australian participation in her own overseas trade. But if so desirable a result follows, it will be the arrangements, if any, which the Comfortuitous. It will not be the result of a monwealth has secured for the acquisition forward policy for transport. Under existing Administrative Arrangements Orders, 8 Federal Ministers share responsibility for Australia's transport facilities with 6 State and 900 municipal authorities. Our 90 ports are administered by more than 30 different authorities under arrangements which have remained essentially unchanged since early settlement. The key to Australia's transport needs is an integrated transport system. We should make a start ait developing such a system by integrating federal responsibilities under a single Minister for Transport. The Commonwealth'sfinancialgrants should be made with a view to co-ordinating the activities of State and municipal authorities which have responsibility for some aspects of transport. In particular, our aim should be to bring together the mainland railways under Commonwealth management. To compare other federal systems, the railways of West Germany are run by the Federal Government; the railways of Canada consist of one Federal Governmeni corporation and one nation-wide company; and the railways of the United States, which have for generations been co-ordinated by the Interstate Commerce Commission, are now rapidly merging. Our railways should bind the continent, and bring its resources efficiently together. No State acting alone can link its capital No State can tap resources or supply markets in another State by rail. It is 80 years since neighbouring States last built railways to meet at their border. The Commonwealth alone can now finance such railways. No required by section 51 (xxxiv) of the Constitution. The Commonwealth has now built standard gauge railways to link Brisbane and Sydney, Melbourne and Sydney and Labor Government passed an Act to link Adelaide by standard gauge with Brisbane and Sydney and the west. The Menzies, Holt and Gorton Governments have not implemented the Act. Adelaide is still out on a limb, still separated from its markets, east and west. The Parliament has still not been told of the Silverton tramway pursuant to the 1949 legislation; it has not yet considered the legislation promised in the 1966 Budget for the up-grading of the Parkes to Broken Hill railway. Transport is one of the keys to the kind of cities we are to have in the Australia of the future. Opening his Higgins campaign, the Prime Minister said on 13th February: We have here developing in Australia, cities which are going to be at least twice as large as they are now, and cities in wbich the congestion of traffic is going to pose really vast economic problems in the future and the beginning of studies by the Commonwealth and State Governments which I would hope would take place, which I would seek to see did take place, into this matter and how it could be overcome, must take its place with development, alongside the development of areas outside the cities. Yet again, the Governor General's Speech is silent. Vague generalisations about the existence of the problems of urban development are not enough. Clearly the activity and the responsibilities of the Department of Housing should be greatly expanded to include urban affairs. The Commonwealth regulates almost all the funds for the acquisition of residential land and houses. It takes no responsibility for the cost of land or housing. The Commonwealth takes a great interest in the number of housing units constructed. It takes no responsibility for the quality or siting of houses. Directly or indirectly, the Commonwealth is in a position to regulate 90% of housing finance. This gives the Commonwealth a very great opportunity to enforce proper town planning principles. Where there is the opportunity, there is the responsibility. In accepting increased responsibility for town planning, the Commonwealth should simultaneously pay more attention to the plight of local government authorities throughout Australia. We hear a great deal about the difliculties of the States, but in fact the indebtedness of local government and semi-governmental authorities has risen over the past IS years at a markedly higher rate than that of the States, while the Commonwealth indebtedness has fallen. In these circumstances, it is not at all surprising that essential urban services provided by local government or statutory authorities such as the Melbourne Board of Works are lagging. Between 1946 and 1966, the number of homes served by sewerage authorities fell in Melbourne from 95.3% to 76.8%, and in Perth from 76.4% to 43.4%. Over the same period, Sydney was able to lift its proportion of sewered homes by only 1.4% and Brisbane by only 0.3%. No wonder migrants are appalled. Forty-one years have gone by since the signing of the first Commonwealth-State Financial Agreement. The Commonwealth should convene a conference of interested parties with a view to amending the Agreement and clearing the way for tripartite financial agreements between the Commonwealth, the States and local government. Overall, there must be a total reappraisal of the role of the Commonwealth and the States in planning and co-ordinating the conduct of governmental activities and the development of national resources by both Commonwealth and State governments. The present balance of finances and functions is unsatisfactory. If State governments are not to be forced to adopt regressive and unjust taxation measures, then Commonwealth-State fiscal relations must be more flexible. In Australia the balance between Federal and State finances is weighted much more heavily in favour of the Federal Government than in the federal systems of the United States, Canada and West Germany. In Australia the balance between Federal and State functions is still weighted more heavily in favour of the States than in those other federal systems. The Australian Constitution provides two methods of redressing the balance of finances and functions. Under paragraph (xxxvii) of section 51, the Parliament or Parliaments of any State or States can refer functions to the Commonwealth Parliament. Under section 96, the Commonwealth Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on sucb terms and conditions as the Commonwealth Parliament thinks fit. The important issue is not whether the Commonwealth or a State should discharge a particular governmental function, but that the governmental function should be well discharged. Australians will continue to suffer in the quality, availability and equity of services which governments alone can provide, or which governments provide better than anybody else, so long as they allow themselves to be fobbed off with the ruling philosophy of the Liberal and Country parties that the basic matters with which I have dealteducation, health, housing, urban planning and transport-ar e solely or primarily matters for the States; they are no longer regarded as solely or primarily State or iocal matters in any country with which Australia compares herself. The Federal-State wrangle between the Premiers and the Treasurer is applauded by those who wish to minimise or discredit comparable government activity, intervention or initiative in Australia. This Government is tn the rut of inherited attitudes, inherited philosophies, inherited policies and inherited personnel. Its inability and refusal to take initiatives at home is paralleled by its inability and refusal to take initiatives abroad, ln particular, in Vietnam it refuses to take any initiative whatsoever to change the course of this disastrous conflict. It denies that it has any influence. Even at this stage of the war, it has nothing to substitute for the policy enunciated 3 years ago by Sir Robert Menzies: 'Just keep banging away'. In the last debate on Vietnam in this House, on 26th October last, the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck) said: I am able to report to the House on the imoriginal proved military outlook in Vietnam. . . a careful obscured even to the point of disappearing. assessment of the facts leads to the clear conIncreasingly, it becomes a war not about clusion that the military situation in South Vietnam is moving steadily in our favour . . .

Could anyone accepting the Minister's remarks last October have expected that a mere 4 months )a£r the United States of America would be contemplating a 40% buildup upon the enormous buildup which, as the Minister correctly, said, had been brought to completion last year? The events of the last few weeks prove redrawn or its objectives must be redefined. once more what has been repeatedly made The current course of the war cannot clear throughout the course of this war: achieve the present avowed objectives of Every escalation brings its counter escalathe allies. The strategy is inherently destruction. The Vietcong are stronger now than tive of the objectives. Perhaps the most when Australians first went to Vietnam. revealing comment of the whole war was When the bombing of the North began in made by an American officer after the February 1965, tbere was one battalion of recapture of one of the thirty-six provincial North Vietnamese regulars confirmed by centres overrun during the Tet offensive American intelligence as fighting in South when he said: 'It was necessary to destroy Vietnam. As America enlarged the number the town in order to save it'. Is the epitaph of her ground combat forces, the North of this war to be: It was necessary to destroy Vietnamese increased their commitment. Vietnam in order to save Vietnam? The intensification of the bombing of North Vietnam has resulted in the development in North Vietnam, with increasing Russian assistance, of the most formidable air defence system yet used in war. It has resulted in increased losses of American planes and pilots. As the Americans have introduced more and more fire power, so have the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese become better and better equipped. Five years ago, the Vietcong relied largely on obsolete homemade or captured weapons. Today they are equipped with the very latest and best Russian, Chinese, Czechoslovakian and German weapons. The very steps which the allies have taken to end the war by military means and to win the war by military means have guaranteed its prolongation and its intensification. The escalation and intensification have happened, not despite the allies' strategy, but because of it. Prolongation is inherent and inevitable with the present method of conducting the war. The most significant result of the present mode of conducting the war is that its objectives automatically are If this process continues, all the declared objectives of the Manilla Conferencea viable South Vietnamese Government, free elections, withdrawal of all allied forces within 6 months of pacification-becom e absolutely meaningless and unattainable. Either the conduct of the war must by One of the declared objectives of the Manila Conference was that the war would be ended on the basis of a negotiated setdement as soon as North Vietnam would negotiate. It is time that the Australian Government-on e of the signatoriesinsisted on a return to the objectives of the Manila Conference. Tbe history of the attitude of both sides to the negotiations is a tragic one. Both sides have claimed that their objective is to negotiate at some time-bu t never now. A temporary advantage for one side has been used by both sides as a reason to postpone negotiations. A temporary setback has equally been used as a reason against negotiations. When one side appears to be making ground, the argument advanced is that if it holds out a little longer, it can win complete victory. Conversely, if it loses ground, the argument is that it cannot negotiate from a weakened position. Thus, the relatively promising appearance of the war early in 1967 and the darker appearance of the war in 1968 are used equally as arguments against the possibility and desirability of trying to negotiate now. This is a recipe for perpetual war. It is in this context that the absolute necessity of ending the bombing of North Vietnam becomes apparent. The truth of the statements last year by the former United States Defence Secretary, Mr matters, it exaggerates our current perMcNamara, has now become very clear. He said that the bombing had not substantially hampered the flow of men and materials to the South, and it would not bring Hanoi to the conference table. Cessation of the bombing is the most fruitful act of de-escalation now open to the ai'Iies. It could not guarantee that negotiations would begin, although Hanoi states that it could, the French Government asserts that it would, and U Thant believes that it would. In the perspective of world wide diplomacy, the continuation of the bombing represents a grave and continuing source of weakness in America's international stance. Stopping the bombing would overnight change this situation. It would change the nature and direction of the pressure being put upon the combatants by their respective allies and friends. While the bombing continues, North Vietnam is encouraged to resist; America is pressured to desist. If the bombing stopped, the pressure would be on North Vietnam to negotiate. More than anything else, America's European allies and Asian friends object io the bombing of North Vietnam. Russia, Hanoi's chief backer, will put no pressure on North Vietnam to negotiate while the bombing continues. Russia cannot afford to see America humiliated in this war; it is a blind mistake to believe that Russia wants to see an end to American influence and the American presence in South East Asia. To believe otherwise is to have total disregard for every signincant development in the Communist world for the last decade. But equally, Russia cannot afford to allow North Vietnam to be defeated in this war. There is no contradiction in this Russian attitude. The reason is the same in both cases-he r relations with China. But Russia will not, and cannot', put pressure on Hanoi to negotiate unless the bombing is stopped. In the case of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the two great super-powers have clearly shown how well and how effectively they can co-operate when they believe their vital interests are involved. But there will be no co-operation to end the war in Vietnam until the bombing stops, and no government is so well placed to insist that it should be stopped as the Australian Government. There is a curious contradiction in the Government's approach. In domestic formances; in international matters, it downgrades our significance. The present Prime Minister always emphasises the limitations imposed by our own demands and desires. The former Prime Minister used to assert: 'We are not a major power'. The fact' is that in our region we are a very significant nation indeed by any standard. Even in terms of population, we are in the middle range of the South East Asian nations. We are the most industrialised of these nations. We are the most highly skilled of these nations. Except possibly for Indonesia, we have the greatest known resources. We have by far the highest gross national product. Not the facts of geography alone compel us to play an increasing role in the affairs of this region; our strengths demand it. The Prime Minister said on television on 21st January: If all our resources were directed towards assistance in these countries, they would not make a significant amount of difference there. This is a totally fallacious view. It underrates the value of what could be done; it under-rates the power of Australia to help do it. It is necessary to see both the need and our own resources in perspective. In the current financial year, the Commonwealth has granted to Western Australia an amount exceeding 85% of all the international aid received by Indonesia from the eight donor countries last year. Is it suggested that this aid does not make a 'significant amount of difference'? But, of course, we are not acting alone. The Pacific area is bordered by the richest power in the world, the United States, the third richest, Japan, and two of the leading developed nations, Canada and Australia. With each of those three, we have special relationships, and Australia, Japan and Canada each stand in special relationship to the United States.

History judges a man, but whatever it may say of our late Prime Minister he will be known as the Australian who made us aware of Asia and Asia aware of us. I should also like to mention our new Prime Minister( Mr Gorton). He is a practical, down to earth Australian who has gained what he has by hard work. He is an academic with practical knowledge, and practical knowledge is not a quality possessed by every academic. The oration we have just heard from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) would lead listeners to believe that Australia is in dire straits. However, by, other countries.

The position as it is put to me is that we would have been very fortunate if any of our men had escaped. Only the superb fire discipline, tbe high standard of training and the courage displayed by the men on that day enabled any of them to get out. They acted in the best traditions of the Australian Army. I want to speak particularly about water conservation. The honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) said today that no honourable member from Victoria had mentioned water conservation before the present drought. Dr PattersonI did not say that at all. Be fair. member did not say that, I apologise to him, but that is the impression he conveyed to me. If he did say that, it is not correct. If he did not say it, we will leave the matter as it is. It is nothing new for honourable members on this side of the House to talk about water conservation. I mentioned in my maiden speech that it is vitally important and we must conserve every drop of water that we can. I heartily endorse the remarks made the other day by the right honourable member for Fisher( Mr Adermann). The $50m which has been granted to the States for expenditure over the next 5 years is only just the beginning of what we will have to provide. Tonight the Leader of the Opposition mentioned the Snowy Mountains Authority. The Government Members National Development Committee, of which I acted as chairman for a few months in the absence of the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Whittorn), considered in very great detail the future of this undertaking. We are indebted to the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Connor) for giving us a degree of publicity and importance that we could not have achieved by ourselves. The basis on which we suggested the Snowy Mountains Authority should be retained in any case was not new; it was simply co-ordinated and condensed. The honourable member for Bennelong ( Sir John Cramer) and the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Ian Allan)I am not quite certain who was first in chronological order-put forward the concept of a national body able to advise the government on various national development matters including water conservation schemes. The decision made by the Government to retain the research, investigation, design and major contracts sections of the Snowy Mountains Authority, together with suflicient administrative staff to constitute a viable entity in the context of Australia's requirements for national development, is a very wise one. The creation of a national development organisation would be of immense value to all aspects of our progress. The possibility of the establishment of a national organisation is governed by the degree to which the States will cooperate in its use. A concrete example of the way in which a national body could be used to great advantage is the River Murray. My colleague and friend, the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull), has spoken in the House about river valley authorities. These are the only bodies by means of which we can make full and proper use and take full advantage of our water resources and deal adequately with the conservation of water, its utilisation, soil erosion, salinity, forestry and other associated matters. Mention was made of the fact that the constructing section of the Snowy Mountains Authority was only very small. I personally would like to see some construction activity still carried out by the Snowy Mountains Authority. One matter that was not mentioned directly in His Excellency's Speech is the situation that exists in the wool industry. Approximately 30% of Australia's wool, the percentage varying with the seasons, is produced in areas of a semi-arid or arid nature and on country that has a very low carrying capacity, running perhaps one sheep to anything from 4 to 15 acres. The country is not suitable for any other activity. Because of its low carrying capacity, it is not suitable for fattening. Because of a lack of water facilities over a large part of the country, it is not adaptable for cattle raising. So it is confined to the production of wool. With the state of the wool industry today these areas are in very great difficulties. The wool industry, as a whole, is going through a bad period, which is worse in these dry areas than it is in the areas that can diversify and adapt themselves to some",60,Governor General S Speech
81,Mr Armstrong,"If the honourableother form of economy. The continued survival of our wool industry and its prosperity are matters of very great concern. Australia has excelled as a producer of wool, because we are the one continent in the world with a temperate climate and with a vast amount of our area at low altitudes. These conditions make Australia particularly suitable for growing fine wools. Added to that we have been fortunate, over genera 7 tions, to have had stud masters who have had the energy, ability and foresight-and there have been comparatively few of them -to produce high class sheep. I want to say this about stud breeders: Thc idea that is conjured up in people's minds is that stud breeders make a tremendous amount of money out of breeding animals. Most stud breeders put nearly all their resources back into the improvement of their flocks or herds and make a very real contribution to the welfare of this country. They build up an asset but do not build up large sums of nioney. Many things could be clone to case the lot of people in the outback areas to which 1 have referred. Finance, as I have mentioned many times in the House, must be made available on longer terms if these people ttrc going to continue to prosper. There is another problem which is hot large in itself, but which contributes to their difficulties. A revision of the Postal Departexported. The number should be limited ment's Extended Local Services Area telephone system, which would allow local telephone calls to be made to outlying centres, is urgently needed. 1 have one particularly good example of this in the Balranald district in my electorate. In addition to the major exchange, the Balranald telephone district has three minor telephone exchanges, all of which are obliged to pay trunk line charges for calls to the only centre of commerce and culture with which they can communicate. The local call zone, which is about 20 to 30 miles in the outer environs of metropolitan areas, should be increased to a much greater extent in inland areas to assist those people with their only means of communication. Another matter of vital importance to country areas is the provision in the Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement that 40% of the money made available be used on rural roads. These are important matters for the wool industry. The International Wool Secretariat plays a very important part in the wool industry. The cost of advertising and promotion costs may be high, but in commerce today one simply cannot do without these activities. The Managing Director of the International Wool Secretariat, Mr Vines, is an extremely able and dedicated man. His oflieers, whom I met in several parts of the world, reflect his ability and energy in their operations. We must endeavour to produce wool on a much wider basis because its statistical position in relation to other fibres is declining. Australia could well have another look at the merino sheep export ban. I spent some time in South Africa just after the export ban was placed on merino sheep. I have no hesitation in saying that the South African sheep had reached a standard where the ban thut was placed on the export of our sheep made very little difference to the advancement of the South African industry. If the object of the ban was to retard other countries producing fine wool and threatening to rival us, the object of the ban was not fully attained. I do not suggest that the ban should be lifted completely, because I do not think this would serve any good purpose. We want to export only those sheep of reasonable quality. I suggest that an export tax be placed on such sheep, which would ensure that only those of a certain reasonable standard would be proportionately to the sheep population in the country supplied, in order that Australian breeders should have equal opportunity to obtain top sheep it might be wise to limit sheep for export to those obtained at auction. Sheep should bc exported only to countries that are prepared to make a contribution to the International Wool Secretariat. This would be a gesture to these countriesI refer particularly to South American countries-whic h would encourage them to come in as members of the International Wool Secretariat, make a contribution and take an interest in the promotion and the betterment of wool. Another point is that if we are to export merino fine wool sheep to the United States of America it is a reasonable thing in the cold hard world of commerce that the United States should do something about modifying the tariff that it applies to our wool. America itself does not buy a large proportion of our wool but its competition is extremely important. I should like to mention one matter in relation to the promotion of wool. It would bc very presumptious of me to stand here in our Parliament and talk about what the International Wool Secretariat has not done, but I think that more time and energy could be spent in promoting the idea of thc use of wool by younger people, in children's clothing and that sort of thing, because if the younger people form the habit of wearing wool they will carry this habit into their adulthood. Wool is the only fibre that will readily blend with any other fibre. Every other fibre has its limitations in relation to blending. We are approaching the era of blends. This is an aspect that I hope will be promoted to a greater extent. Many people are inclined to say that wool is finished as a fibre. This is very dangerous thinking. Wool will always be a big factor in the earning of our export income. There will always be a demand and a place for wool. The question is: At what price? To suggest that it has become unimportant because we have made such big mineral finds is not in the best interest of our community. Undoubtedly, minerals will increase in importance but wool will always be an important commodity that is worth promoting. There is a human element as well as an economic element in maintaining the people in the industry. I should like lo refer briefly lo the speech opposite. The Government insists on mainmade in this debate on the subject of New taining its support for the great overseas Guinea by the honourable member for shipping combine which I am sure mu.st be Deakin( Mr Jarman) and to congratulate a lavish contributor to the Liberal Party him upon it.

There has been mention of the great need that these people have for tertiary education. Nobody denies this but there is a much greater need for a large number of New Guineans to have secondary, technical and sub-technical education to fit them for the task that is ahead of them. Rather than condemn our MinisterI congratulate him particularly. In my opinion he has done a very remarkable job since he has held his present portfolio. Year in, year out since my election to this honourable HouseI have urged the Government lo consider the establishment of a Commonwealth overseas shipping line, which I am sure would be of great benefit to the community generally and to the economy. It is a source of great wonderment lo me why ihis Government which boasts to all and sundry that it comprises men of great business acumen does not set about the establishment of an oversea* shipping line as quickly as possible so as to ensure the transport of the produce of our great continent to overseas markets by the cheapest possible route. But we find just exactly the",61,Governor General S Speech

Speaker, that 'humbug' is a very modest description indeed. gest that the honourable member withdraw the remark. ence to you. The average man on the land is hoodwinked by the Minister's pretending to be their champion while he is actually just the opposite. As the records will show, all he is concerned about is the exploiters of the man on the land, the big city business interests and the overseas shipping combine which increases its freight charges at will, while he, a senior Minister, remains silent. Of course, we have in the Government ranks the Minister for Air( Mr Freeth), who was previously Minister for Shipping and Transport. After a long period of silence on this question he reported to Cabinet the result of negotiations with the Japanese Government for the establishment of a Japanese Australian overseas shipping company, which led to the amazing decision that two cargo vessels be built, one. to be manned by an Australian crew and one to be manned by a Japanese crew. More remarkable still is the fact that that MinisGovernment and prevents it from establishter agreed that both vessels be built in Japanese shipyards. Advance Australia fair! This caused consternation, of course, amongst the members of the various shipbuilding and engineering unions and it clearly shows a lack of interest by this Government in shipbuilding generally. An overseas shipping line is vital to all Australians who are interested in the future development of our country as a nation. We need our own overseas shipping line to reduce crushing freight burdens, to increase cheques to farmers and other exporters, to open vital new markets for Australian produce and to provide extensive employment in shipbuilding, metal industries marine industries and related occupations. Need one ask why Australia needs an then Mr Stanley Bruce, who belonged to a overseas shipping line? Australia is an island party that was a forerunner of the Liberal continent with 12,000 miles of coastline, Party of Australia. He betrayed the people many rivers and bays and beautiful of Australia and sold the Commonwealth harbours with deep anchorages. It is situLine to its rivals, the members of the ated in the southern hemisphere, of which foreign shipping combine, at a small fraction area 90% is ocean, and it depends mainly of its value. At that time a prominent hison markets in the northern hemisphere, 50% of the area of which is land and which has a resultant larger population. Australia ranks in the top eight exporting nations. It is not generally known that Australia has an annual export income of more than $l,000m, and that she pays approximately 25% of that to foreign shipping companies and insurance companies. We have our own Australian National Line of over forty ships. But these are restricted, by this anti-Labor Government, to the least profitable cargoes and almost entirely to the coastal, shipping trade. Indonesia, a so called backward nation which is actually receiving monetary aid from Australia, is now developing its own overseas fleet. Switzerland, which has no coastline, has a large fleet of vessels. Norway, with a population of 3 million, has a vast fleet, as has Sweden. New Zealand, with a population of a little over 2 million, has more than twenty-five overseas ships manned by New Zealand seamen. Australian seamen walk the streets in search of work. This is the price that Australia pays for being the only country that has not a suitable ship trading overseas. I must remark here that India refused to submit to the demands of foreign interests; so she now has her own fleet. The situation makes one wonder what evil influence has control of the Australian ing our own overseas shipping line. I wonder whether it is generally known that after World WarI we had a fleet of over sixty vessels sailing overseas. It kept freight charges down to a reasonable level and still showed a profit in its own right. Many of the ships were built here. The 'Fordsdale' and 'Ferndale', refrigerated ships of 12,000 tons, were fine examples of the Australian shipbuilders art. This fleet of ships of the Commonwealth Government Line of steamers was so successful in keeping freights down that extreme pressure was applied by foreign interests on a gentleman -and I hope you will pardon my pun, Mr Speaker-the Prime Minister of the day,",63,Governor General S Speech

We built 16 merchant ships, 3 destroyers, 11 frigates, 60 corvettes, territory on the Baltic, the nation's ship2 boom defence vessels and I floating dock. Sixteen other ships of various designs have been built since or are being built as replacements for the coastal fleet. During the war years 11,987 ships, totalling 51 million tons, were repaired or overhauled in Australia. All this has been achieved despite the comparatively small number of men engaged in our shipbuilding industry. We employ 15,700 men compared with 243,100 in the United States of America, 228,000 in Britain, 140,000 in Japan, 94,000 in Germany, 57,000 in Holland and 55,000 in France.

But what do we find? We find that even Poland, which has been long accustomed to the souds of guns and marching armies, is getting used to a newer and happier sound against the bows of new ships, usually follower by a lusty shout in praise of Polish shipbuilding. This seems unreal in a country that was landlocked for more than a century and whose meagre Nazi controlled shipbuilding industry was turned to rubble by Allied bombing during World War II . But since the post-war boundary settlements, when Poland's vengeful Communist leaders snatched a large chunk of German building has boomed. Now only Japan, Sweden and West Germany lead Poland in the export of ocean going vessels. Polish built ships fly the flags of Britain, France, Norway, Brazil and China. Only recently it was reported that a sleek 23,000 ton bulk carrier was delivered to Poland's largest customer, the Soviet Union. Poland can look back on her biggest shipbuilding year ever.

On looking around the House one observes the number of Liberal-Country Party members, approximately eighty in all, who were given great publicity at a period prior to the last election as men of high academic and intellectual standard and one wonders why it was necessary, on the death of the late Prime Minister, for the Liberal Party to be forced to consider an aspirant from the other place who, on his selection, wbich could not have been due to his ability ant! administrative powers, and 1 quote Sir Robert Menzies: . . . quickly divested himself of his Senate robes and sought election to the House of Representatives, :in election in which he was successful. The new Prime Minister voiced his support for the general development of the Australian nation. CouldI suggest to him that the basis of such development relies on the quick, cheap transport of our products to all markets of the world? CouldI also humbly suggest that it is obviously most essential that a Commonwealth shipping line be constructed without delay? This is most essential to our development. Otherwise the mcmbers on this side of the House who represent the great Australian Labor Party may see the pathetic figure of our Prime Minisler-despit e his utterances, which are given full weight in the daily Press in an effort to build up a very ordinary Prime Minister into a publicfigure-crushed under the weighty influence of the powerful overseas shipping conferences, which no doubt will put him in bis place. My information indicates that the Federal Government, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, and the New South Wales Government', under the leadership of the very negative Premier, Rob Askin, have already instructed the New South Wales Maritime Services Board to make a general survey of Botany Bay for the purpose of a secondary harbour in which shipping combines will be generously assisted at the expense of the Australian taxpayer and the inconvenience of residents of the La Perouse-Yarra Bay area in my electorate of Kingsford-Smith. The New South Wales Government suggested to the Commonwealth Government that it should seriously water at La Perouse with the ultimate intention of using the foreshores of Botany Bay adjacent to the water frontage of the Australian Paper Mills, Bunnerong Power Station, Yarra Bay and Frenchman's Bay for wharves, factories and other industrial development purposes. A committ'ee known as the Botany Bay Port Development Committee was set up. The Chairman of that Committee was the Honourable A. D. Bridges, MLC, who is not an elected member of Parliament but' an appointed member of the Upper House. The proposed development is causing great concern to the inhabitants of the area that I have mentioned as it is rumoured that the work proposed by this anti-Labor State Government will encroach along the foreshores and take full advantage of lhe protection offered by the breakwater. The State Government also favours the Banksmeadow site which was proposed by the Committee, lt is proposed there to dredge the Bay as a deep harbour and construct 3 miles of wharves for a container port, lt is also proposed to construct a huge breakwater system at the heads of Botany Bay. The cost of such a scheme is conservatively estimated at $90m. It appears that Wallingford Laboratories, a top United Kingdom hydraulics firm, was preparing a report on this proposal. The provisional proposal was to reclaim 2,000 acres of Botany Bay for the port from the north-south airport runway extension to Bare Island at La Perouse. A wharf 3 miles long would be established on this frontage and a wool market would be established behind the wharves. This would cut down the handling of wool from 47 to 6 operations. It is interesting to note that this site was selected for its proximity to railway transport and the inner city area of Sydney. It is also interesting to note that some time ago the Maritime Services Board commissioned a team of overseas experts, Sir Alexander Gibb and Associates, to report on the potential of Botany Bay for port development. That firm reported that it favoured the Banksmeadow site. In view of the proposed development of this second seaport close to Sydney, I think that it would be appropriate and good organisation for the Government, under this so called dynamic leader, to begin the construction of ships for an overseas line which for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Sinclair) could be ready to operate by the time the Botany Bay facilities were established. Perhaps the Government proposes to continue supporting the unbreakable grip that the overseas shipping conferences have and so leave the Australian manufacturer and farmers at the mercy of this combine, which wiil be able in the foreseeable future to dictate economic policy in regard to world trade. 1 challenge the Prime Minister to carry out his proposals for the development of Australia generally by the construction of an overseas shipping line. present we are engaged in what is known sions by the Government of greater imporus the Address-in-Reply debate.

Secondly leap onto their various hobby horses and we have had the imminent total withgallop off in all directions. The honourable member for Kingsfordthe Empire, foresaw this situation: Smith( Mr Curtin) has had something to say about the building of ships in Australia for use in overseas trade. The building of such ships in Australia would be very expensive-muc h more expensive than to We have witnessed nothing less than the build them in other places. Also, the manfall of an empire in our part of the worldning of these ships by Australian crews something that greatly concerns us. would mean notonly more-expense but Generations of dedicated British men have more uncertainty because Australian brought peace and justice to peoples bordersailors are not renowned for being on the ing on all the seven seas and the oceans of job at all times. Nevertheless, we should the world but that is gone and finished. We save some exchange and we should break have to adapt ourselves to a new situation the monopoly of the overseas shipping lines. These things are worthy to be balanced. I do not think that the honourable member has sought to balance them at all. It may well be that the new Minister will look at these matters. When the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith talked about the old class war and all those things, it brought hack an echo of 30 years ago in the State Parliament of New South Wales. After all, the Labor Party docs live a long way back in the past. I pass this by. Whether or not this House or the people outside know it or not, the fact is that Australia faces a totally new situation and a new era. This is the subject to which I propose to devote my attention tonight in order to put matters a little in perspective. Whether or not Australia knows it. 1 believe l Dramatic events at home and abroad drawal of the British from east of Surz.

Our nor would the House wish to know from capital came from the United Kingdom. We me, in detail what these problems are and did not have to go round the world looking what solutions I suggest. Who am I to sugfor it; we did not even have to accumulate gest solutions? But I will. We have a little it ourselves. The skills that came with time. First of all I take the frame of Parcapital and the skills that were learned liament itself, and look at it very briefly. when people went abroad to be educated Let us compare it with two vital features of all came from the United Kingdom. This the American system of government. The is finished. Colonialism has finished. The President of the United States of America old familiar ocean is done; we face a new world. We face it with a new leader and a new future. I am glad the new leader is Australian to the fingertips, not British to the boot heels because we need a national leader in these times as we go into a national future. His responsibility is an awesome one. He deserves understanding, support and loyalty from us and from the nation. His responsibility is great and he is future. He faces a destiny for himself and the nation as well and he may succeed or fail. This may lead to triumph or disaster for him and for us. The task is what? It is to promote the security and progress of this minuscule European community on the fringe of an Asia inhabited by two-thirds of the human race seething with the discontents of the past, poverty and disease and the rest, striving after the hopes of the future, seething with the revolution in rising expectations, distraught by contending political ideologies, fiddling policies about sewers. Sewers are important but these other things can choose whom he will to be his Ministers. In Australia the Prime Minister can choose only those who are members of Parliament. Here the Government can be no better than the members of Parliament. Let this sink in as it is vital. The second aspect of the American situation is that Congress has independent powers. There are checks and balances and a division of powers under the American system and, therefore, Congress is vigorous and dynamic. For those who live under the Westminster system, so called, the party that supports the Government tends to be a rubber stamp. Whether it is a party whose political ideas are similar to ours or a party with opposing ideas does not matter; 1 am talking about systems. In our system the opposition party, as I said at the outset, simply continues an election campaign from one election to the next, extracting the last ounce of political capital from every issue but otherwise unconcerned with what may be a solution to the problems which face the nation. What are the disabilities in Australia? First of all there is the image of the member of Parliament and remember that the Government can be no better than members of Parliament because Ministers have to be drawn from the Parliament. I suggest that by reason of our history, by reain private, but politics seem to be conducted rather son of our colonial past, the image of a member of Parliament-confused , incidentally, always with the image of the State member of Parliament, and, indeed of the contemporary State Parliament-is an image of roads and bridges, an image of persons concerned with internal domestic matters of development. Let me contrast the situation in the United Kingdom for the sake of making the point. Britain has gone through many crises from the days of Cromwell tQ the days of Ohurchill. ber chooses he can go back to the days of Boadicea. Britain has had many crises in her history and any man who goes into the House of Commons knows that there at the dispatch box once stood William Pitt. William Ewart Gladstone or Churchill. He knows that they were worthy of the emulation of the most qualified people in the country, that no man ean rise higher than they did, and that the position of a member of that Parliament is worthy of the competition of the most worthy people in the community. Is that the situation here in Australia? Secondly, we have no leisured class here as they have in England, where it was the pride and privilege of British citizens to contend for this highest office in the land. Thirdly, we have our geography. Who can attend to his affairs in thc great metropolis and at the same time be in his place to vote in this Parliament? All this was expressed in an interview given by Dr David Butler, who some members may recall was here for 2 or 3 months at the end of last year. He was a political scientist from Nuffield College at Oxford. In an interview which was reported in the Melbourne 'Herald' on 13th December 1967 he said: 'The people I've met-the top civil servants and academics-ar e from the same level of talent as in Britain. '1 think they are just as talented. 'The politicians are quite a bit farther down the scale. Tliere are fewer politicians than in Britain, but even allowing for this the number who seem fairly able men, compared with others in other walks of life, is very small. It is disheartening when you look at them by international standards. then went on to say: . . . Australians . . . are not blunt spoken more in name-calling or personal terms. The voice of Dr David Butler is not the voice of God, but I have given some reasons for feeling that what he said is true. The best government that we can have in Australia is chosen from the Parliament and Dr Butler says that our Parliament is third rate. I have given reasons which lead to this conclusion. up; I am third rate like the rest. Nevertheless, I hope. Honourable members may recall: Hope was ever on her mountain Watching until the day begun. Crowned with sunlight over darkness From the still unrisen sun. And so I hope. We can only live by hope. So there are three reasons why I believe that in 10 years time when I am out of this Parliament and, I hope, dead, we will be dealing not with trivial affairs, not with colonial affairs, not with roads, bridges and skeleton weed, but with what are called great affairs which will attract men of quality.",67,Governor General S Speech

96,Mr Benson (Batman) [10.14],"1 was what they are up against. As soon as yougiven immediately. The pilot vessel from which I used to work went to the position at once and picked up out of the water 27 of thc commandos. Those men were saved because the pilot vessel was alerted promptly. The captain of the ship did such a wonderful job that in the Queen's birthday honours list he was made a Member of the British Empire. But at Portsea last December it was not until 2.50 p.m. that the pilot vessel was notified that something was amiss. That ship could have been in the area in 20 minutes. It could have lowered four boats and patrolled the area close to the shore. I do not suggest that it could have done anything at that stage but the point is that when incidents such as this occur it is imperative that the appropriate authorities be notified immediately so that they may get on the job. I hope than when the Victorian authority concerned is considering this tragedy, as it must, it will think about the points I have raised and sec that in future everybody is notified as quickly as possible so that the best possible course of action may be taken in the least time. I just want to say something about what is happening in Britain at present and how it affects this country. I know that at this time my speech is of insignificant importance because the British Government is about to bring in its new Budget. 1 feel that some of the measures that have been adopted in Britain recently have not been in her interest. Honourable members will recall that the British Parliament decided by a very small majority not to provide South Africa with arms. I think this was ill advised. As soon as Britain said that she would not supply arms, France, the nation next door, said that it would do so. So France obtained South African orders instead of Britain. The irony of the situation is that France is the nation that is continually keeping Britain out of the European Common Market. So when Britain said that she would not supply arms to South Africa, France took the opportunity. principles that Britain has. involved. I shall discuss it later. I think what ships. was done was wrong. The recent arms embargo and vetoes on South Africa and other countries have cost Britain dearly. Over £Stg300m has been lost in warship orders alone. On top of this, Britain has lost the opportunity to tender for the building of warships for countries that have always dealt with her. According to 'Lloyds List and Shipping Gazette', some 50 vessels are concerned-2 8 destroyers and frigates and 22 submarines. These orders would be worth about £Stg300m. Portugal has always traditionally leant on Britain for the supply of warships and arms. It has recently ordered 4 frigates and 4 Daphne class submarines from France. The honourable member for Hunter (MT James) spoke of principles. I do not like to see these ship orders going from Britain to France; I think they should go to Britain. These ships will be built no matter what happens. West Germany is having three guided missile destroyers built in the United States of America. Argentina, because of what she described as bad terms, has abandoned an order for the construction of four Leander class frigates in Britain. Pakistan has acquired a submarine from the United States and has ordered three Daphne class submarines from France. Spain wanted British Leander class frigates. Her order has been cancelled and she has now ordered 5 Daphne class submarines and 5 United States Brooke class guided missile destroyers. India could not obtain suitable terms. She wanted Oberon class submarines. She has now ordered 3 Daphne class submarines from France and 3 submarines and 15 other warships from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Indian and South African personnel have been trained in Britain to man British built ships, but as these countries have had to look elsewhere, the training has been for naught. I am very much concerned at the turn of events in Britain, for Britain cannot afford to lose orders such as I have just described. It is very hard to get a clear picture of which way Britain is going. Whatever Britain does in the maritime field brushes off on us in Australia. We depend a lot on British ships for the transport of our primary products and for the carriage of our goods to markets in Europe. is closed this is more important than ever. 1 was very pleased to hear the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith say that we",71,Governor General S Speech

99,Mr Curtin,We should build our own,72,Governor General S Speech
100,Mr Benson,"No w that the Suez Canalshould build our own ships. 1 go along with him on this point. But we have to be realistic about some matters. I just want to say that if a country whose commerce and trade depend on maritime activity is to prosper, those who man the ships must be non-political. They must keep politics out of their work altogether. I say to the honourable member for Kinesford-Smith and all other honourable members that when we commence our service to Japan we should consider what will happen if it is necessary to divert our new ship to Vietnam, whether or not this is done to transport war material. Will the ship go to Vietnam? Will the seamen who man the ship take it there? It costs a lot of money to run ships. When we start our overseas shipping line, will the seaproduce to European markets, it is essential men who man the ships run them to South Africa? I do not say that they will not. Until we are prepared to trade to all parts of the world the operation of an overseas shipping line will be a very costly exercise. If ships are not run efficiently, you and 1 will pay, because no matter what government is in office, if the operation is not running profitably taxes will have to go up. I wish our overseas shipping line the greatest of success. I want to see it come about as quickly as possible. But I want to see politics kept out of its operations altogether. Come what may, no matter what the seamen think about this country or that country, the ships will be manned. As the House knows, at present the Suez Canal is closed and it is necessary for us to send our goods to the European market via the Cape of Good Hope. The extra distance via the Cape of Good Hope is not as great as most people think. Let us take Sydney as a central point in Australia and Liverpool as a central point in Europe. The distance from Sydney to Liverpool via the Suez Canal is 11,501 miles. The distance from Sydney to Liverpool via the Cape of Good Hope is 12,595 miles-a n extra 1,094 miles. A modern ship travelling at 20 knots would take two extra days to travel this additional distance. However, a ship travelling to London via the Suez Canal has two days delay. A day is taken in travelling through the Suez Canal even if she is lucky enough to get a convoy straight away, and another day taken up in bunkering in Aden. In my opinion it is essential that we in Australia have a better understanding with South Africa, because if South Africa falls om with Britain and says that British ships cannot use South African ports, this would mean that ships would have to bunker with enough oil for the entire trip to Australia. The more oil that is put into a ship the less cargo can be carried and vice versa. So when ships are in Australia loading cargo for Great Britain and are not allowed into South Africa Mr JamesI do not think th:u ihe British believe that will happen. papers that South Africa has said that it will deny use of the Simonstown Dock to Britain if the present British attitude is maintained. This is a very serious development. So that Australia can send its primary for South Africa to remain open to ships sailing from Australia to Great Britain. If the ships must complete the entire journey to Britain, they must take more oil and less cargo. I hope we will reach a better understanding with South Africa. at Mombasa? that way. We must go around the Cape of Good Hope. I hope that these factors will be understood. I was speaking to a Government official recently about the surcharge. I was informed that this has been imposed because of the two extra days that are added to the journey when ships go around the Cape of Good Hope. The current events in the Indian Ocean make it most important for us to have a good understanding of what is happening. As the honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney) said, the Russian Navy has moved into theIndian Ocean. 'Time' magazine of 23rd February 1968 reported that a Russian admiral, Admiral Sergei Gorshkov, who was visiting Indian ports, said: The flag of the Soviet Navy now proudly flies over the oceans of the world. Sooner or later, the United States will have to understand that it no longer has mastery of the seas. I have never known the United States to claim that it has mastery of the seas, although it has a mighty fleet. When words such as those that I have read are uttered, they show that one nation is cognisant of the activities of another nation. If the Suez Canal remains closed, we must, as the honourable member for Perth said, ensure that our sea lanes are always open. We will always need the means to take our exports",72,Governor General S Speech
101,Mr Bensoni Have Read In The News,,73,Governor General S Speech
102,Mr James,Could the ships not refuel,73,Governor General S Speech
103,Mr Benson,"No, we are not goingto other markets. The apple season in Tasmania is commencing now. The crop will be exported from ports in the south of Australia and it is only natural that the ships must go south about and around the Cape so that the goods will reach their destination. But we must ensure that we have the ships available and, if necessary, the protection for them so that they can ply on the world's sea lanes. The Governor General said: Therefore, in addition to providing economic and technical assistance and training to Singapore and Malaysia to help them build up their own forces, my Government will participate in Five Power consultations when they are called and will be prepared to discuss the size and role of an Australian contribution to combined defence arrangements which embrace a joint Singapore/Malaysia defence effort. 1 hope that the Australian Government will work out a plan with the Singapore Government that will enable the two governments to take over the Singapore naval base when Britain vacates it. If necessary, the governments should allow merchant ships to use the base for repairs and docking. Mr Lee Kuan Yew has pointed out that 30,000 Singapore families depend upon the base for their livelihood. While we have forces in South Easi Asia and while our naval forces are patrolling in the area, we will need to have somewhere to dock and repair our ships. Therefore 1 make the plea that action be taken to ensure that the dock will remain open for Ihe use of Australian ships if we continue operating in t'he. area. It must also be kept open for the. use of merchant ships that need to be docked and repaired. I hope the Government will offer to take over the dock with Singapore when Britain leaves. I was very pleased a few weeks ago to us. I find this offensive. Not only is she learn of decorations that had been awarded not supporting us; in Government circles to some members of our forces, especially and in other places she is critical of our to national servicemen fighting in Vietnam. involvement. Britain is not involved in 1 was very pleased to see on television a sending civil aid. The only record I could young national serviceman being awarded find of any help being given by the British the military medal. the war. This young man had been disof our involvement in Vietnam and it is charged from the Army and was back in civil not proper that Britain should have any life. Nine months after he had earned the connection with the approval of our awards award it was presented to him. That is not for gallantry. I am concerned about the good enough. I am glad to know that the series of broken promises made by the deeds of these men are being recognised and United Kingdom not only to us but also I hope they will always be recognised. A to Malaysia and Singapore. The fina] piece military medal is not easily won. But a of irony about the whole business is that delay of 9 months after the event, when the man is discharged, is much too long. I hope, that the Minister for the Army( Mr Lynch) or the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairhall) will take this matter up with the British Government. It should recognise that we are a responsible nation and should give us the right to issue, decorations readily instead of continuing with the old-fashioned idea of getting the approval of the British Government, because they are British decorations, before they are awarded. It is time that we made our own awards, especially decorations as significant as the military medal is. I am very glad to see that the national servicemen are receiving a full measure of these awards and are playing their full part for the benefit of Australia. very much pleasure in strongly supporting the last remarks of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Benson). It is odd that the first item I wished to mention in this debate was the delay in the award of medals for bravery. Some servicemen have had to wait for a year from the date of the action for which they were awarded a decoration until the date on which it was approved. TodayI made some inquiries and I found that one reason for the delay is that final approval for the award must be given by Her Majesty the Queen. I do not suggest that this is a reason for very much of the delay, but it is a procedure that 1 find unattractive. The time has come for us to make our own awards and the Governor General should approve of them. I am very sensitive about this. The awards are being earned in a war in which Great Britain is not taking a part and is not supporting Government in Vietnam concerned one specialist doctor and some medical supplies -",73,Governor General S Speech

106,Mr Mcleay (Boothby) [10.38],"I haveBritain is making money out of the war by shipping goods to North Vietnam, our enemy. I support the honourable member for Batman and urge the Government to implement this system whereby our own awards for gallantry are approved by the Governor General. I deal now with that part of the Governor General's Speech which deals with defence. I do not think any honourable member has noticed this item. The Governor General said: My Governmeni regards defence as a major responsibility and tbe expansion and re-equipment of our forces steadily proceeds. 1 deal with the question of expansion. We all know that very shortly my colleague, the honourable member for Henty( Mr Fox) will be supervising a national service ballot. At the moment one in nine young men are balloted for national service. I have no argument with the system, which is the only fair one. No-one would want to see introduced here the system that exists in the United States of America, where a draft board consisting of leading citizens is set up to select candidates. This system could be open to corruption and is entirely unsatisfactory. I am happy with the system of balloting that exists at the moment, but I am not happy with the numbers being called up; not enough are called up. The Defence Report 1967, tabled last session, deals with national servicemen and volunteers. Much of the Report suggests that we could maintain our defence commitments with volunteers. I do not believe w can. The attitude of young people today is different from what it v.as in 1939. The Report confirms increased enrolments in the Citizen Military Forces. Increased enrolment is not due to any rushing to the colours by young men but is due substantially to the fact that by enlisting in the CMF a young man is exempted from national service. I am not critical of this, but tunity to train and relieve men from base we must be realistic. We must expand our forces rapidly. As the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) said tonight, an emergency exists now that the United Kingdom is rapidly withdrawing from east of Suez. I would not want to see the same situation exist that existed in Australia between 1940 and 1943, when I was a recruit. I remember one 19-year-old friend of mine, who enlisted, went to Buna, saw his first action and came back to a hospital in Australia, all in approximately 6 weeks. That is an indication of how poorly trained we were. At one stage my unit was in position to defend Port Moresby. We had 18-pounders which were used as artillery weapons in the First World War. If the Japanese had attacked Port Moresby we could not have defended the place. In the first action in which my unit took part we were using 35 lb howitzers of 1908 vintage. for that. over that subject as we did during the last sessional period. I am anxious that our soldiers should not again be given such inadequate training and be provided with suoh antiquated equipment. I realise I do not have sufficient time to build up a tremendous story but I am anxious that ultimatelyperhaps not in 5 years or 10 years but at some point in time-w e will have a society in which every young man will be called up for national service. Whether it takes 5, 10 or 15 years to implement that policy is not very important provided we decide upon that policy. In my opinion every young man should be trained at some stage in his life so that he will be able to defend this country. We would have a formidable Army-w e have one nowwhich would be 8 or 9 times its present size. The expansion of our forces, to which reference was made in the Governor General's Speech, should be speeded up as a matter of extreme urgency. The Government, while hoping for the best, should be preparing for the worse and national service should be stepped up progressively to the ultimate target of every Australian of military age having undergone military training. At the same time we should be doing something about the young women in the community. They should be given an opporduties. I want to refer briefly to the disgust 1 felt at the debate last week on the so-called torture of a Vietcong spy. I was concerned to note that honourable members opposite, certain sections of the Press and the Australian Broadcasting Commission went to a great deal of trouble to belittle our soldiers.

He said: The Leader of the Opposition-surprisingly , unbelievably-is reported in today's Press as having urged that we should give safe passage to this Vietcong spy, that we should bring her to Australia to give evidence against one of our own compatriots. Mr Clyde CameronMr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Has there been an alteration in lhe standing order relating to a reference to a previous debate in this House? honourable member for Boothby is making a passing reference !o the debate. Mr Clyde Cameron-He can do that? in making a passing reference to the debate but I say to the honourable member for Boothby that he should not continue along that line for any great distance. again and I am sure that will satisfy all honourable members. However, I should like to refer to a letter 1 received on 10th February from a young friend of mine who is a national serviceman at present serving in Vietnam, and to a second letter I received from him a few days ago. I am concerned because what I believe to be important points of view put forward by honourable members on the Government side are rarely properly and fully reported. I am anxious to say something tonight because the proceedings of this House are being broadcast and only in this event can we be sure that what we believe in is transmitted to the public. Some sections of the Press are very good at using headlines such as one which appeared in a Victorian newspaper last Friday. It reads: 'PM Admits Torture Charges'. The word 'torture' is not even in parenthesis, as it should bave been because this was a long way from being torture. I propose to illustrate to honourable gentlemen opposite just what torture or sadism really is. I have a letter that I received from a national serviceman serving in Vietnam which reads: These Vietcong are dirty little sadistic animals. theatres of war, I pass on these final words Over half the people in Baria have been murdered of the journalist: by these . . . I cannot use the next word, Mr Speaker, because I tbink you would rule it to be unparliamentary, but it is a word that I , too, use to describe them. The letter continues: . . . when they had control .of the town. A lot of women were raped over and over and then bad their throats slit. The old lady who did our laundry for us was found crucified, nailed to » wall, with her throat cut, so that will give you an idea of what goes on. If any of these Vietnam war sympathisers try and rubbish our commitment here when I'm around there will be a considerable number of knuckle sandwiches handed out, I'm afraid. This is the final sentence that I would like to read: God help us if we don't slop them here and they get to Australia. That is what I call torture. Another letter from the same young man has just arrived. A very brief extract reads: I Ind a letter from Dad this morning and he is worried sick about me as are the rest of my family. This is what worries me-the sort of rubbishing which is done to secure political advantage and which obviously has an effect on thc morale of our troops up there. I would say to all of the men on service and to their parents and sweethearts that we in this part of Australia are proud of them, and I am sure that 1 speak for almost all Australians. To the parents, families and sweethearts of the 18 killed and 21 wounded as a result of the action referred to earlier tonight I say: 'We are proud of you.' I should like to read, because they are appropriate, brief extracts from statements made by a British journalist in the 'Daily Mail' just a couple of weeks ago. Referring to the war in Vietnam and his own shame that Great Britain was not involved with us, he wrote: The war there is confused and horrible, its aims blurred, its methods savage, its cost in innocent blood uncountable. But if it is lost, if the Americans finally get. tired of doing the world's work for nothing but the world's abuse, if South Vietnam is left too its fate, then what will follow is not merely the piecemeal engulfing of the rest of South East Asia. What will follow, as surely as Austria followed thc Rhineland, and Czechoslovakia followed Austria, and Poland followed Czechoslovakia, and 6 years of world war followed Poland, is a nuclear confrontation on a global scale between the forces at present engaged in one tiny corner of the globe. I will go along with that. To those who have loved ones serving in Vietnam and other Our words may be useless, but they are all we have to offer. We understand why you are there, and know that your cause is ours too. I close on that note, and I am pleased to be able to do so while we are on the air. Debate (on motion by Mr Cope) adjourned.
