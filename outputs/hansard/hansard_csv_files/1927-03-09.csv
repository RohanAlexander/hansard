I Do Not Know Whether That Idea Dominates The Mind Of The Treasurer; He Did Not Say So Much, But, Personally, I Am Sorry That The Strangulation Did Not Take Place At Birth. The Result Would Then Have Been More In Consonance With The Vote Given For Feder","ation. If a vote of the people were taken to -day, on the value of unification, they would vote for unification rather than for what we know as federation. ber favour unification? a nation, possessing an island continent should have the many costly systems of government that Australia has to-day.

26,Mr Yates,"Yes, and the subsequentsaid tliat our problem was bow to settle our financial relations on a reasonable and au equitable basis. I do not think the States will argue about per capita payment so long as they are assured of sufficient revenue to meet their obligations and develop their territory. But .tlie development of Australia should be looked at from an Australian point of view, and not from that of any one State. The present proposal is, in effect, that the States shall be robbed of their most easily collected revenue, and be obliged to accept, in lieu thereof, revenue of which tlie cost of collection would be heavy. knows, it would be extremely difficult for any State, even for Queensland, to secure legislative authority for imposing extra probate, income, land, and amusement taxes. My feeling is that it does not matter how our taxes are collected, nor who collects them, so long as the requirements of all parties are equitably met in the most economical way. Dr. that the taxes should be collected in the most economical fashion. Commonwealth could most economically collect these taxes. proposed that it should do so, but that was not acceptable to the States. ment should have all necessary power in these niatters, and should make a devolution of powers to the States. The States should be treated equitably. Because the bulk of the Customs revenue is collected in Melbourne and Sydney-eve n on goods that are afterwards transported to, say, Western Australia-it is not fair that New South Wales ancl Victoria should receive the bulk of the revenue. Western Australia and other similarly situated States are entitled to reasonable treatment. Although the eastern States have most of the importing business, we should consider ways and means of giving to the other States a fair proportion of the Customs revenue. This proposal is neither comprehensive nor progressive. We have had 25 years of federation. It may be said that the machine has become clogged. To put it in another way, we are living in a wooden building which has got out of repair, and we really need an up-to-date reinforced concrete structure. All kinds of arguments, relevant aud otherwise, have been used in the course of this debate. The Minister for Markets and Migration ( Mr Paterson) discussed public borrowing policies, ancl argued that the provision of sinking funds improved our credit overseas, and made money available at a cheaper rate. But who could prove such a contention? I do not think that a sinking fund would make a difference of l i d . in £1,000,000. When Mr Tom Price was Premier of a Labour Government in South Australia As every honourable member years ago, he adopted what I believe to be the only reasonable ancl sensible plan for managing national debts. At his instigation a measure was passed which provided tliat all surpluses should be devoted to the reduction of the public debts. I trust that the Labour party will never dejiart from that principle. Public debts should not be incurred without provision for their liquidation. We have a fortunately the government which succeeded Mr Price's Government in South Australia discontinued his policy. But that did not lessen the facility with which South Australia could obtain money overseas. Honourable members will recollect that, during the war, that magician of high finance, the right honourable member for Balaclava said that to float a £20,000,000 loan on the local market would destroy Australian industries, and that Mr Fisher would be well advised to raise his proposed local loan in five instalments. It is now history that, in less than five year3, £400,000,000 was raised by local loans. The right honourable member for Balaclava did not know his book. Not only was that amount raised, but Australian industry never thrived as it did during those years. I am well aware that the seasons have a great deal to do with the prosperity of this country, but in those five years our manufacturing industries made remarkable strides. The argument of the Minister for Markets and Migration, that the provision of sinking funds offered greater inducement, to financiers abroad to invest their money in Australia, is all moonshine. For other reasons, I , of course, agree that we should",31,Speaker Mr Sion And Consulted The People As To Neces

31,Mr Yates,"T h a t is so.but a large portion is spent in paying interest at rates varying from 4 | to 6 per cent, on money raised for prosecuting tbe war. If the Labour party had been in power during the whole of the war period the Commonwealth would not be faced with a war debt such as we have to-day, as it was w ill in g to carry on those war activities which the Commonwealth should rightly undertake, and honour also the pledge of our Leader at thattime of contributing "" the last man and the last shilling,"" which was wrongly construed in some quarters to mean that we would eventually conscript the manhood of this country. That we did not propose to do. If the Government which succeeded the Labour administration had adopted the proposal of the honourable member for Hunter, which embodied a common-sense idea, and one which all patriots would have supported, the Commonwealth would not now be faced with a tremendous war debt. D r . EAKI.K PAGE -What was the proposal ? an amount necessary to maintain an average household should be taken for the benefit of the nation. Terrific fortunes were amassed by profiteers, many of whom, as the present Treasurer should know, could have been shot down from the steps of this building. Bayley) I ask the houorable member to connect his remarks with the question before the Chair. direct taxation, which, as I have said, was imposed in the first place for the purpose of prosecuting the war, and, I submit, is germane to the question before the House. It has been said that honourable members on this side of the chamber, while freely criticizing the policy of the Government on this and other questions, do not submit alternative proposals. In this instance,.! suggest, as an alternative, that the time is ripe for going to the people w i th a sane scheme of unification. Surely we can dispense with the six State Parliaments and six Governors, and be governed by one Australian Parliament, thus abolishing a good deal of the duplication of effort and unnecessary expenditure which at present exists. The risrht honourable member for No r t h Sydney( Mr Hughes) knows that direct taxation was imposed solely for the purpose of meeting our war commitments, and it is unreasonable to propose that we should forgo our rights in that respect. that we should repudiate our responsibility in the matter of war loans. when, as suggested by the right honourable member for Balaclava, we shall have to curtail our borrowing activities, and settle our war debts, as is being done in some other countries. The time is approaching when some readjustment of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States must be made; but the present proposal is not f a i r to the States. An y Commonwealth Government going' to the country on a proposal for continuing to impose direct taxation would be returned with a large majority. It is easy to imagine the position arising in which, our commitments having been T h a t all income beyond deliberately made so heavy that a surplus would not be available, other methods of raising taxation would have to bo employed. If this proposal is carried, and the Commonwealth vacates the field of direct taxation, it w ill .be found that, the power of the Liberal or Nationalist party ha-i declined, and that finances of the Commonwealth on a proper basis in 1910 in spite of the policies then enunciated, has increased. A t that time the Labour party, which I am dealing with strongly opposed the purchasing of a Dreadnought with borrowed money, was returned to power, and did such good work that it left behind it a record that has never been approached. The Government should not attempt to strangle the Statesi n this way; but, to use the metaphor of the right honourable member for Balaclava, should invite them into the operating-room, feel their pulses, and see if their hearts are strong enough to stand the operation. This is not an ordinary operation, but one which may make the States sterile for many years to come. If the Government carries its proposals in this instance, the people w ill shortly demand a proper system of unification, so that, with the assistance of",33,Earle Page Ou R Proposal Is Duty To Posterity In This Matter Un

[5.24] -Afte r listening to the speech of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr. Yates), I must say that, with the exception of one definite utterance, he left me in doubt as to whether he was supporting or opposing the bill. For a time. I felt that at least one member of the Labour party was supporting the Government. But the honourable gentleman qualified his statement by saying that he wished the bill to be withdrawn. Apparently he approves of it in general terms, but thinks that the time is not ripe. by other speakers in opposition to the bill. If it were adopted, ancl if the bill were withdrawn, there would be a shout of derision from one end of Australia to the other. The Federal Government would be the laughing-stock, not only of its opponents, but also of its friends, and the State Premiers and State Treasurers, who are raising all this outcry about the per capita payments, would chuckle and say, "" Once more Ave have bluffed the CommonAvealth Government."" These State Ministers have been pursuing this policy of bluff for a long time. My own opinion of them is that, whilst they are A ery estimable gentlemen r who are trying to discharge tlieir State obligations, they are not the kind of people who, so f a r as this Parliament is concerned, are Avorth losing a great deal of sleep over. Their general attitude towards Commonwealth Ministers has always been one of more or less discourteous hostility. The allegation that, in the negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States, all the hostility comes from the Commonwealth Ministers cannot be sustained. Those who study the reports of the numerous conferences that have been held, and the negotiations that arc continually being carried on between the CommonAvealth and the States, must come to the conclusion that all the forbearance and all the courtesy are on the side of the Commonwealth leaders, irrespective of party, and that all the cantankerousness and hostility emanate from the State Ministers. Only the other day the Premier of NCAV South South Wales, the famous Mr Lang, accused the Treasurer ( D r . Earle Page) of being a Aveakling. Other political opponents take the contrary vieAv; they (New England) declare that he is too strong. The Treasurer's action in persisting with this bill, notAvithstanding all the abuse and misrepresentation to Avhich he has been subjected by the Premiers and Treasurers of the States, demonstrates conclusively that, whatever other faults he may have, at all events he is not a weakling. As the Leader of the party to AvhichI belong, I feel that the Treasurer deserves much stronger support i u this House than he is receiving from honourable members on this side of the chamber. It That suggestion has been made is largely for that reason that, as a member of the Country party, I feel it my duty to dispel the notion that has been carefully disseminated by a section of the press in Melbourne, that not only arc the Nationalist supporters of the Government hopelessly split over this issue, but that the Country party also is only being kept in its place by the stern discipline of the party whip. W it h two exceptions, the Country party is solidly behind thc G-overnment on this issue. Because of its attitude tOAvards this proposal, I think it may be claimed for the Country party that it is more national in spirit than many of those Avho criticize it. Opposition to the bill from Government supporters boils down to two gentlemen belonging to the Country party Avho are known as. "" State righters,"" pure and simple, and the conservative "" r u m p "" of the Nationalist party. In e\ ery big political party there r is a certain conservative dross Avhich, rising to the surface, causes a good deal of trouble until it is skimmed off and thrown aAvay. I believe that, so f a r as this measure is concerned, this political dross to AvhichI refer, w ill not be in evidence much longer. We have heard a good deal about the intentions of the framers of the Constitution. The same cry has been raised on every previous occasion, Avhen any measure has been brought forAvard to grant additional poAvers to the Commonwealth. We have always been told that it was against the intentions of the framers of the Constitution. Actually no honourable member",34,Speaker Mr Of The Labour Party Which Put The
37,Mr Thompson,"can say definitely what were the intentions of those who moulded the Constitution. Those who have studied the Constitution and have gone to the trouble of reading the debates of the Federal conventions, and, therefore, may be regarded as authorities as to the intentions of the framers of the Constitution, are themselves at sixes and sevens. There is no accepted authority in Australia as to the real intentions of the founders of thc Constitution upon a number .of controversial issues. This issue was very prominently before the people in 1910, when the Federal Labour party was rising to its great triumph. Mr Andrew Fisher, the then leader of the party, raised the effecthe doing of many things which the small tive cry that the Commonwealth should not be bound by the dead hand of the past. Mr Fisher's party was in favour of the per capita payments, but was against having the principle embodied in the Constitution. The State Premiers also were hostile. Sir Charles Wade, then Premier of New South Wales, was absolutely opposed to per capita payments at all. He wanted a continuation of the previous system. The Premier of one other State said it was an insult to offer the people of Australia so much per head. That was the opinion ten years after Federation. Mr Fisher, as I have shown, did not wish to be influenced by the dead hand of the past. Federation then was only a matter of yesterday. It is now 27 years since Federation was inaugurated, and seventeen years since Mr Fisher raised tliat cry, .and still we hear thc same objections to-day. When some authority can definitely inform us as to what were the intentions of the framers of the Constitution, we shall have some reason, for accepting their interpretation of the Constitution. why we should be bound by their interpretation. honourable member for Fawkner. As I have already said, no one is in a position to state just what were the intentions of the founders of the Constitution. Will honourable members who raise this cry suggest that the wise men who took part in the Federal convention debates 30 years ago would express exactly the same views on this important issue if they were attending a similar convention to-day? Obviously they would not. Yet we had the right honprable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) last night suggesting that the framers of the Constitution were the repositories of all the political wisdom that Australia has ever had. They were wise men in their day, it is true; but we are 27 years wiser to-day, and it is about time that we "" scotched "" this cry whenever it is raised in opposition to proposals to the granting of extended powers to the Commonwealth Parliament. We may be sure that as the framers of the Constitution were wise in their generation, they would be wise enough to-day to sanction Australians of the present generation say we should not do. cationists. have heard in opposition to this bill is that the time is not ripe. That objection also is raised whenever an attempt is made to extend the powers of the Commonwealth. We heard it only the other day in connection with the referenda questions, ancl with as much force from representatives of the Labour party as from the conservative sections of the Nationalist and Country parties. A survey of the political arena discloses a conservative clement in all parties; an element with its mind steeped in the past, and its influence is detrimental to national progress. We cannot get away from the same old crowd, every time any constitutional reform is contemplated, whether referenda questions or per capita payments. This fact should make all big Australians a little bit suspicious. We are always being told that these reforms are either against the intention of the framers of the Constitution, or that the time is not ripe. There is not the slightest doubt that thc time has come for an extension of the functions of the Commonwealth, but I do not agree with those honourable members opposite who say that unification is the solution of all our difficulties. I do not agree with them because I doubt their sincerity, since we hear of this demand for unification only when some extension of Commonwealth power is asked for.

No authority in politics is quite clear as to what particular form of unification would bo most acceptable to Australia. Ideas on the subject are too nebulous. Only a few months ago we had the spectacle of alleged unificationists like the dore) and the Premier for New Soutli Wales( Mr Lang), who, on one occasion said he would wipe out all State Parliaments, rising in their wrath and declaring that they would not trust the Commonwealth Parliament as far as they could kick it. Apparently when these so-called unificationists have an opportunity to test their theory, they fall down in a fright. There is no justification for believing that the people of Australia desire unification. Wc have to face tbe facts as we find them. The outstanding need of the moment is an extension of the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament. It needs a little more elbow room. This extension has been denied to it iu the industrial sphere, but I feel sure that we shall get it some day. In the field of finance more elbow room is needed, but we find "" State righters"" in this Parliament and outside insisting that an extension of authority in the direction sought was never intended by the framers of the Constitution, and that the time is not ripe. We shall have to push these opposing influences aside, and declare that if the time is not ripe we must make it ripe. Something will have to be done to bring this issue to a head. The only way will be to intimate to the State Premiers and Treasurers that as they have not offered any suggestion, the Commonwealth Government is going on with the proposal, and they can take it or leave it. antagonism to the Commonwealth on the We shall never achieve anything unless we adopt that attitude.

They do not say when, if ever, a constitutional session prospect of it as another excuse for deferring a decision on this subject. Probably when the constitutional session is held, these gentlemen will still favour procrastination, and try to make the session abortive. A financial issue, such as that involved in the bill, might wreck any constitutional session. It is far better that it should be dealt with now, so that it may be subject to at least twelve months' trial before a constitutional session is held. We may be sure that if this proposal is put on the business paper for a constitutional session, State Premiers and Treasurers and their supporters in this House will endeavour to convert the session into a financial one, and no progress will be made towards the solution of the real problem of constitutional revision. We are told that the States must reeeive a fair deal. I have never sat in a State Parliament, but I have studied very closely State politics in New Soutli Wales and Victoria, and, to a lesser extent, in Queensland, aud I claim to know a good deal of the trend of politics and policies in the State legislatures. I have never discerned any foundation for the suggestion that the States are not getting a fair deal. On all occasions of conflict between them and the Commonwealth, the latter has given way. Whenever the .States have dug in their heels, the Commonwealth has yielded for the sake of harmony. Upon no occasion has the Commonwealth deliberately baulked the States in respect of their rights, but frequently the legitimate aims of the Commonwealth have been frustrated by the cantankeronsness and anti-Federalism of the States. In this Parliament thero has never been any sign of hostility tc the States, but there has been deliberate part of the State Parliaments. Those honourable members who have made such a song of the hostility of the Commonwealth to the States have been unfair to this Parliament, because the history",36,Speaker Mr Of The Labour Party Which Put The
42,Honourable Member For Dalley ( Mr Theo,"of negotiations between tbe Federal and State authorities does not furnish any warrant for such a charge. So much is heard of State rights that one would think that they had been divinely handed down to us on stone tablets. State politicians trade upon the anti-Federal prejudices of the people to inflame them against the Commonwealth Parliament. During the last referendum campaign, it was very noticeable that State politicians of all parties adopted towards the Commonwealth an attitude of suspicion and distrust. The whole burden of their speeches was that the Commonwealth could not be trusted, no matter what party was in power. The very men who had praised the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) as a heaven-sent leader said that they would not trust him with the powers for which the Commonwealth was asking, and, similarly, State Labour politicians said they would not trust even a government led by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton). tility to the Commonwealth is being carefully fostered by the State politicians for their own ends. They are jealous of this Parliament, and that jealousy is largely responsible for the opposition to this bill. beyond their means. Another regrettable fact is the tendency of former State politicians to bring into this Parliament the anti-Federal spirit of the States. The speeches of some of them have reeked with anti-Federal bias. The speech of the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) was founded upon State rights; there was nothing Federal or national about it. The speech of the honourable member for Dalley Theodore) was anti-Federal. this House the honourable member poses as a great federalist; inside the chamber he has shown himself to be a Statcrighter. Men who have been responsible for the financial muddles in which their own States are floundering have not remained in State politics, to clean up the mess they caused, but having sought sanctuary in this Parliament, they attempt to teach us how the finances of the nation should be handled. No doubt it is helpful to the House to have the advice of men who have been State Treasurers for long periods, but when they are advising the Commonwealth to adopt a course that led their own States into financial difficulties, we must hear their Mr Thompson. precepts guardedly. I do not wish to make invidious distinctions, but it is obvious that one State is in such a hopeless muddle that its representatives in this chamber should be concerned as to its future, and should welcome any proposal by the Commonwealth Government which is likely to give relief. Instead of doing that, they condemn the Government's proposals as an infringement of State rights. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have shown clearly that this bill will not deprive the States of anything. It will merely cast upon them the obligation they were under for a number of years to live upon the direct taxation which they themselves raised. Some honourable members think that it is an injustice to ask the States to raise their own revenues, and tbe honourable member for Dalley said that no State Treasurer would like to be obliged to levy increased income tax. I do not doubt that; nearly all State Treasurers Hoshave already imposed fairly heavy income taxation, but if they wish to spend lavishly, it is right that they should have the responsibility of raising the money. All of them are trying to live They produce budgets, not characterized by prudence and common sense, but designed to tickle the ears of the multitude. Popularity is the sole basis of State finance. Without exception, the Sta.te budgets are extravagant, and some honourable members ask us to help the State Treasurers to maintain that extravagauce. I have obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician ( Mr figures showing the increase of revenue Outside expenditure in the States since federation in comparison with the increase of population. I do not say that these figures are an infallible guide, but they give a good indication of the direction in which the States are travelling. The increases since 1901 have beenRevenue State. Population. Expenditure. Per cent. Per cent. New Soutli Wales .. 67 201 Victoria. . 39 245 Queensland . . 70 307 South Australia . . 51 270 Western Australia .. 91 IS2 Tasmania. . 25 210 Average .. 56 254 The increase in the expenditure from revenue has been altogether out of proportion to the benefits which have been conferred upon the community. A fact which is never stressed in this Parliament is that the States are not giving to their taxpayers a fair deal. The taxpayers are divided into two sections, half in the city and half in the country, and the latter arc not getting a f u l l share of the benefits of public expenditure. Railway construction has practically ccased, no irrigation works are in progress, and, except in Western Australia, and some small soldier settlements in other States, there is practically no progress in land settlement. Buti n all the capital cities enormous expenditure is being incurred. That is where the money is going, and the ex-State Treasurers who seek sanctuary in this Parliament ask us to continue that system. If we do, we must accept responsibility for the consequences. The following comparison between 1901 and 1936-estimated-indi cates what will happen if the present rate of expenditure in proportion to the growth of population continues for another ten yearsEevenue State.

New Soutli Wales .. 103 320 Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia .. 128 Tasmania Average figures depends upon the value of the jiermanent assets that are being created. ing, permanent assets are created, not out of revenue expenditure, but out of loan expenditure, and the following tabic shows the increases of population and loan expenditure from 1901 to 1926:State. Per cent. New South Wales .. 67 126 Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia . . 9 1 Tasmania Average [11] That proves conclusively that the States are spending disproportionately to the growth of their populations. When I speak of population I mean that half of Ihe population which is receiving 75 per cent, of the benefit of the expenditure. In spite of all this we find a deplorable financial condition of affairs in all the States. I cannot cite the figures for every State, but the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) said that no State Treasurer to-day could show anything but a deficit. The New South Wales Government, which is the largest spender of all, showed a deficit of £2,176,000 for the last eight months; even in Victoria, which has been better managed and financed than the other States, there is a deficit; and there are very large deficits in Queensland and the other States. In spite of this heavy loan expenditure and enormous increase in expenditure from revenue, in comparison with the relatively slow increase in population, the State Treasurers cannot even now handle the business. There must be some definite cause of that, and it is to be found in thc fact that a large part of the money has not been spent on legitimate development, but on social experiments Population. Expenditure. that have not been of very great benefit Per cent. to the people, who would not be much 00 423 worse off if the experiments had not been .. 119 637 made. That, however, has not been the 92 503 whole cause, for much of the financial 283 muddle is due to the fact that the State .. 29 324 Governments have developed their terri90 392 tories solely with the idea of promoting the interests of the large capital cities. The result is that we have decreasing populations in country districts, and rapidly increasing populations in the cities, where there are traffic problems with which the State authorities cann cope. the Commonwealth Government accentuate that?

We have the pathetic plea reiterated throughout this debate that the States will be smashed by the adoption of this proposal. figures I have quoted are intended to show that the States are smashing themselves. The £7,500,000 that the Commonwealth Government proposes to take away from them, and the increase in their powers of direct taxation, will not make a scrap of difference, except that an extravagant treasurer like Mr Lang will will not be able to boast without justificato the bill. I should like to see the Comtion that he has not increased taxation. The Commonwealth Government will be able to say it surrendered some taxation; but, after all, the effect on the people will be very little. Tho real objection of the State Treasurers to increasing direct taxation is that nearly all their governments have expensive programmes of social experiment to carry out. might be made of the party to which the honourable member belongs. wealth has the money, but tbe States have not. parties compete against oue another in offering big bribes to thc electors. Three years ago, in New South Wales, it was widows' pensions; now it is child endowment. The Labour party puts forward such schemes, and the other parties, in order to have a chance at the polls, have to say, ""We will give you that, too."" Competition between the political parties is occurring in every State of the Comredeem their extravagant promises that they are getting into such a financial muddle. And the deplorable feature of it is that while they are spending large sums of money in doles, and are building big cities, they are not developing their States outside the cities. There is no new railway construction work being done in the country districts of New South Wales, and I doubt whether any is being done in the other States. How will the with the honourable drawal of £7,500,000 from the Statesaffect their development, seeing that, although they have the money, they are"" not developing to-day, and have no intention of developing? I should be very pleased to hear any honourable memberattempt to counter my argument that the States are not doing their jobs to-day in developing their areas, and that, therefore, the withdrawal of the money will The not bring them to ruin any faster. the Commonwealth comes back to thefield of taxation it now proposes to surrender ? danger, and that is the only valid objection, if there is one, that I have heard monwealth get out of the field of direct taxation entirely, and would have no hesitation in voting for a proposal to do so; but the scheme now submitted is a good beginning. The States seem to me to resemble naughty school boys, who know that they are due for a hiding, and are seeking to postpone it by "" wagging "" behind a corner. The Commonwealth is big enough to carry the blame, especially as it has a blameless conscience. We have nothing to fear from what the State Treasurers may say.

The Treasurer can take little or no comfort from his suggestion that this Parliament should not await the pleasure of the States before determining wliat action it should take. Por a considerable time the Government has shown that it is not settled in its own mind as to what is the correct course to pursue regarding an alternative; it has suggested several. Even on the major question the Prime Minister has previously expressed decided views contrary to those now advanced. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) was Treasurer in 1922, and, when addressing the Brisbune Chamber of Commerce in that year, ho gave a very definite assurance of his belief that the per capita payment should be continued. He saidHi!

Certainly, wo had many Governments, to (he point of being overgoverned; but, until there came some changes in the basis of government in thc Australian! States, the payment must be continued. I pass on to the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, held in May,. 1923. The Prime Minister met that conference in a spirit, not of conciliation, I know that conferences but of arrogance, which did not make for harmony. Even then, the proposal he submitted was not that the per capita payments should be abolished, but that they should be suspended for five yearsThe honourable member for Herbert (Dr. Nott), thought fit to challenge the consistency of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) on this issue. He stated that the honourable member for Dalley adopted an attitude at the Premiers' Conference in 1923 which is It is certainly desirable entirely different from that which he now takes. The honourable member for Herbert was not generous enough to tell us that the conduct of the honourable member for Dalley in 1923 was governed by the adamant stand taken by the Prime Ministei-, who insisted upon the suspension of the per capita payments. It was in that circumstance that the Premiers' alternative proposal was submitted, always having in mind that if it did not prove to be a satisfactory solution of the difficulty the per capita payments would be resorted to at the end of five years. Thc position of the honourable member for Dalley to-day is quiteconsistent with that which he took in 1923. The 1923 conference failed to reach an agreement because tha ex-Treasurer of New South Wales( Sir Arthur Cocks) was so incensed by the uncompromising attitude that the Commonwealth assumed that he would not consider either the proposal or the alternative. I know that a conference was held last year between the Commonwealth and State authorities with the object of reviewing financial relations, and that it was disheld that they had a moral right to thepencapita payment. Without discussing the merits of that position, I assert that the failure of last year's conference is nojustification for the adoption of the coercive methods which the Commonwealth is now pursuing.

On the other hand, if the Federal Government attempt to force an exchange of taxation upon the various States, and retain for their own purposes for all time the revenue that they receive from the Customs and the excise, a permanent and intolerable burden will be placed upon the* people of New South Wales. It must be borne in mind that the proposals which suit the sister State of Victoria in regard to company taxation would be disastrous if applied to New South Wales, by reason of the fact that we would lose £1,250,000 of taxation that we now receive from companies. This would force upon any Government, irrespective of party, the necessity of entirely revising their income tax basis and increasing the individual contributions to such an extent as to add heavy additional burdens upon the great bulk of those who are paying income tax on small and moderate incomes to-day.

The honourable member should play the game in this House, and realize that thore is a general desire on tbe part of honourable members to be consistent, and to assist in some practical way to put the politics of the country on a better level than they are to-day. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr trust that, even at this late hour, Perkins) is not supporting the bill upon its merits, but, because of the possibility of some other Government coming into power. If he thinks that he is going to determine the public policy of this country beyond the term of this Parliament he is greatlv mistaken. The honourable member is assisting in making laws for to-day, but I remind him that he is not a dictator of to-morrow. He may endeavour to use his powers in this Parliament to determine the future of the people, but the return of a Labour Government w ill determine the future policy of the country during its term of office and exercise of power, irrespective of the present wishes of the honourable member. Although he might feel that he is protecting the interests of a certain section from the actions of a future Labour government, I remind h i m that he has no power to prevent such contingencies. Therefore, it would have been as well if he had dealt with this issue on its merits and considered carefully how it w ill affect the financial relationships of the Commonwealth and the States. The agreement made in 1910 to grant 25s. per head of the population had a definite relation to the amount of the Customs and excise revenue. In round figures it represented about 50 per cent, of the total income from those sources. Since then there has been an extraordinary increase in revenue from this form of taxation, with the result that the per capita payment of 25s. now represents only about 19.1 per cent, of the total Customs and excise revenue of the Commonwealth. It would appear, therefore,, that there is urgent need for a revision of the payments, with the object of bringing them more into line with our ideas of equity. South Australia has suggested that 50 per cent, of the Customs ancl excise revenue should be paid into a f u n d and disbursed to the Statesi n Accordance with their needs. That proposal is really I shall be sufficiently on the basis of the 1910 agreement. All honourable members, I believe, acknowledge that the present system is neither as scientific nor as equitable as it might be; but that does not justify the Government's proposal to discontinue the payments altogether at this moment and thus seriously to dislocate the finances of the various States. I the Ministry will recognize its obligation to the States and the people whom we represent. No differentiation can be made between Federal and Stateelectors; they are the same persons, and they have every right to be considered in all proposals that so vitally affect them. The figures submitted by the Treasurer in support of the Government's scheme are unreliable. The honourable gentleman spoke of a natural increase in gross incomes of 6 per cent, per annum. Asf a r as South Australia is concerned, and I believe the position is the same in the other States, instead of an increase in nross incomes there has been a con-, traction. D r . EARLE PAGE -The figures for last year show that there has been a bigger increase. Treasurer, across the table, to denv the accuracy of what I am saying. I should be obliged if the honourable gentleman would quote his authority for that statement. My informant is the Deputy Commissioner for Taxationi n South Australia. It is only right that, in these matters, we should know exactly where we stand. I want, not figures which the Treasurer himself may have manufactured, but informatio n from some reliable outside authority whose statementmay be accepted without reservation. The aggregation of incomes has been mentioned during the debate. It has been stated that the States have power to tax the aggregate incomes of their citizens, and that it would be lawful , as well as expedient, for the States to adopt the principle. Let me tell honourable members what the right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) had to say on this subject at the Premiers' conference in 1923. This statement by Mir.",44,Speaker Mr Of The Labour Party Which Put The
94,Mr Makin,"It is easy for theBruce is to be found on page 32 of the report of that gatheringThere is only one other proposition-that the Commonwealth should take over the whole of the income taxation, because it is the only excise revenue is really tantamount to a body which can tax aggregate incomes. I thought it my duty to quote that statement of the Prime Minister, so as to give the right honourable gentleman an opportunity to reconcile, if he can, his declaration of to-day with his statement ot the conference in 1923. of the Government's declaration that its policy is to protect Australian industries, I am astounded that it should propose to withdraw from the field of direct taxation. intends to meet all its obligations, including commitments arising out of the war, from Customs and excise revenue, then it is clear that instead of the tariff being protective in its incidence it is merely a revenue-producing tariff, ancl as such cannot effectively protect Australian industries. most pernicious system of taxation. to those who have invested capital in 'Australian industries, and are employed in the secondary industries, to know that the Government proposes to look to its Customs and excise revenue for all the money necessary to carry on Commonwealth activities. If we had an effective tariff, one which was truly protective iu its incidence, instead of revenue from this source increasing in volume from year to year, it would steadily decrease, ancl consequently the Government would be obliged to look elsewhere for its income. Ministers must answer to the people for their stand upon this vital issue. The Government's proposal will enable the wealthiest sections of the community to evade their taxation obligations, with the result that these burdens will fall on the shoulders of those least able to bear them. direct taxation proposed to be vacated was entered by the Commonwealth in order to meet its war obligations. No one will dare to say that those obligations have disappeared. As a matter of fact, we find tliat in some respects they have heen added to, so there is no justification whatever for this proposal to relinquish that source of revenue. The Government's proposal to meet those obligations from Customs and proposal to remit taxation of those who can best afford to pay it, and to place it upon the shoulders of those least able to pay. The bill will make the position of the people increasingly difficult and irksome. Both the Treasurer and the PrimaI n view Minister have shifted their ground from time to time in regard to this proposal. I am reminded of the logic of Walt Whitman's linesDoI contradict myself ? Well, I contradict myself. Am"" I inconsistent? ThenI am inconI f the Government sistent. The Treasurer would do well to take those words to heart, for they very aptly fit his position ancl that of his political chief. Time will prove the futility and the injustice of the proposals which the Government has submitted in this bill. The measure will not make for the peace, progress, and prosperity of the Commonwealth. On the contrary, it will prove unduly burdensome It is poor consolation and irksome, and I feel sure that those honourable members who support it will have good reason to regret their action. The Government is guilty of a misuse of power in submitting this bill, which is wrong in principle ancl unfair in its incidence, and will be injurious to the people of the Commonwealth. -Before I deal with the arguments that have been advanced for and against the bill, I propose to say a few words about the principles that underlie the Constitution and the Pederal pact upon which it is based. In its very nature a federation involves a division of rights and powers. I agree with the statement that the test of a measure is its probable effect upon the people. That is the supreme test. The people of the Commonwealth have, in their wisdom, appointed as their serThe field of vants two instrumentalities, giving to the one authority in certain specified matters over a sphere as wide as the continent itself, and to the other authority, within the boundaries of each State, over many matters which concern the people more intimately.

We exercise functions, many of them remote from the daily lives of the people, yet necessary and most appropriate to the nature of the federal instrumentality created by the Constitution. The State Parliaments, on the other hand, are concerned more with the every-day affairs of the people. The right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) dwelt last night at considerable length on the extent and variety of the functions of the States. We have to bear in mind that the present distribution of powers has existed for 27 years with the authority and approval of the people, who have resisted every effort to amend it . Assuming that the people know what is best for themselves, and applying that test to this measure, we must assume, therefore, that they wish things to continue as they are. But all of us do not hold that view. Speeches have been made during this debate in disparagement of both antifederalists and unificationists. own part, I have always been in favour of the extension of the powers of the Commonwealth. To that end I led every fight prior to the last one for the amendment of the Constitution. But not even my bitterest enemy has ever said I am a unificationist. I speak, therefore, as one having authority and knowledge of this inatter. We have to remember that the present constitutional position was deliberately created by the people, who have given to the States certain definite functions, and vested in them certain powers, tlius creating moral, and, if you like, legal rights to sufficient revenue to discharge the duties entrusted to them. It would be absurd to suppose that the people vested the States with power to control education, police, land, railways, and the hundred and one things which f a l l withm their purview, and yet denied them the means with which to exercise these powers. Wo must assume, there for* that the distribution of powers gavn authority, explicit or otherwise, to raise revenue sufficient for their exereise. The honourable member for Barton( Mr Ley) stated that Mr Fisher, who was responsible for the Surplus Revemie Act of 1910, was opposed to the continuance of the per capita payments. That emphatically is not true. I was Attorney-Generali n his Cabinet, and am able to speak with assurance on that point. We were opposed to inserting in the Constitution the per capita agreement, which had been made by representatives of the States and of the Commonwealth We had already found by experience that in some respects the Constitution waf> not sufficiently elastic to meet the requirements of a progressive community and, therefore, we did not consider it proper for the Parliament of that day to legislate for posterity. Accordingly the arrangement for the payments to the States was embodied in a statute, but we always regarded it as an agreement. It was an agreement deliberateh entered into without duress of any yort. Upon the provisions of that agreement the country was unanimous, the only difference between the two political parties being as to whether or not the arrangement should be placed in the Coustitrtion . The electors endorsed the For my agn-ement, but preferred that it should be enshrined in a statute rather than be embodied in the Constitution. Statutory authority was given to it . A t the expiration of ten years ithad come to be regarded as an integral part of the financial machinery of the Federation. It has now been in force for seventeen years, and I emphasize the point that, unti l the Treasurer introduced this measure some months ago, no one had suggested the revocation of that agreement or understanding by force majeure. Certainly an alteration ormodification of the arrangement had been suggested, but only suggested. There was no gesture of defiance; there vas nothing in the nature of an order ssued by a superior to an inferior. In he light of all that has come and gone, we are entitled to ask why this measure is being forced down our throats. What new set of circumstances has arisen to create a position so entirely foreign to that to which we have been accustomed for the last 27 years? Why should this Parliament be seeking to force au arrangement down the throats of the State Parliaments, which are equally under the protection of thc Constitution which created the Federation. Whatever the States were originally, they are now sheltered by the Constitution. Their powers are limited by its provisions and, being limited, are clarified, strengthened, and sanctioned by it . It has been said that the for the Government date of the people. that well the circumstances last general election was held.

The honourable member entirely missed the point of the argument. The right honourable member for Balaclava, who put forward certain proposals in 1919, discussed those proposals with the Premiers. And that is all he did do. I have never suggested that there is anything sacrosauet about the per capita payments; but I do say that there is an agreement to pay them, rhat this agreement was solevuuly entered into by the States and Commonwealth, endorsed by the people, aud given statutory authority, and that the per capita payments can properly be abrogated only by agreement, or by the direct authority of the people. If the servants of the people cannot agree among themselves as to how they shall carry out the will of their masters, then they should appeal to the people. The people, and they alone, should direct them. No one else has the right or authority to do so. The right honourable member for Balaclava in 1919 put forward certain proposals. good or bad is not to the point, but whereas the right honourable member for Balaclava submitted his proposals to the Premiers, and accepted their refusal, thu present Treasurer forces his down the throats of the Premiers, and they are expected to submit whether they like it or not. methods is the difference between civilization and barbarism, between peace and war. The States and the Commonwealth are equally the servants of the people. We discuss matters with our equals; we give orders to our inferiors; wo fight our enemies. We, who are partners in this Federal pact, ought not, merely berausc we have a majority in this Parliament, to treat the other parties to the pact as if they were enemies or inferiors. wealth. Many of us are very sorry that It is true that we have a majority; but this majority did not come here authorized by its masters to do this thing. That is the poiut. The Premiers rejected the proposal of thc right honourable member for Balaclava, and there the matter ended. It need not have ended thero, because the right honourable gentleman was a member of the strongest Government that has ever held office in this Parliament. not a composite Government made up of factions, but a united party of 50 members, and as everyone knows who rememAlr Hughe*. hers the circumstances of that time, it was only necessary to hold up one's hand in this place and any legislation one wished would have been passed. I remind my honourable friend, however, that although we had the power, we did not abuse it. The honourable the Treasurer has, by a turn of the wheel, come into oflice, and because the Premiers have not accepted his proposal, he is seeking to coerce them. I admit freely that the Premiers can be very irritating. At times they are extremely difficult to get on with, but I have never attempted to force things down their throats. The honourable gentleman has. To that we strongly object. The honourable member for Barton said that he preferred the Treasurer's proposal because it was sudden death with an , anaesthetic, whereas the other was slow torture. It is evident that running in the honourable gentleman's mind were the linesWhether they were If it were done. . . Then 'twere well It were done quickly. 1 can imagine the Prime Minister, a little reluctant, being addressed by his coadjutor the Treasurer. . . . Infirm of purpose! Give me the daggers. The Government has no authority from The difference between the two the people to abolish per capita payments. No circumstances have arisen to change the situation that existed at the time of the election. Since then, there has been a direct reference to the people in regard to a readjustment of the powers of the States and the Commonwealth. On that occasion the people showed unmistakably that they were supporters of the States' attitude, and not of that of the Common, the people rejected the referenda proposals; but, in the face of that rebuff, I venture to say that the proper course for the Treasurer and for the Government to adopt is to submit this matter to the people, either by way of another referendum, or by the time-honored method, which has much to recommend it, of another election. It must not be thought that in anything I have said I It was have suggested that the Government is not actuated by thc best motives; but we are told that the road to hell itself is paved with good intentions. I can well understand the attitude of the Treasurer: Ho has become tired of continued rebuffs, ho has put forward very many perfectly good schemes, which have been rejected again and again. l i e is annoyed; he is -angry. He has a majority, and what is the use of having a majority unless one uses it? That being the principle upon which he is working, be brings down this bill, and is determined to pass it . Althoughi t is clear that if anything is of a non-party character this bill ought to be, we are told that it is to be made a party matter. That is quite wrong. B ut the reason why it has been made a party measure is obvious. If it were not, the bill would not stand one chance in 50 of being carried. shall say a word or two on that aspect later. said may sink in a little. We are told that the b ill has been brought forward to put an end to a condition of affairs that the Commonwealth has long outgrown; that the war created an entirely different set of circumstances, and placed upon the Commonwealth huge obligations. That is true, but as the honourable member for Henty( Mr GullettJ pointed out last night, it is obvious that the war is, financially at any rate, still with us, imposing upon us and on generations very great burdens. ought to be f a i r l y apportioned among all sections of society. We have to ask ourselves what would be the effect of this measure upon the taxpayers of this country. It is suggested that would make for economy. Some peopio have a passionate desire to reform others, and their leotures on economy are worth going miles to hear. For years in this Parliament we heard the honourable the Treasurer, as a private member, speaking of the virtues of economy. (Now that he is placed in a position of authority, he still continues his noble work, and never tires in his efforts to reform the spendthrifts in the States! He is the more determined to do this at the present time because, -by an unhappy chance, in five of the States Ave have Labour Governments. k ill two birds Avith the one stone. Thc Treasurer gets the preaching economy, and at the same time puts a. dagger under the rib of our brothers, the Labour Premiers, We embarrass them. Wo compel them to shoulder the unpopular taxes; we denounce their profligate expenditure; we create a very aAvkward situation for them; ancl, in short, enjoy ourselves thoroughly. As for ourselves, we spend money left and right, and seek every day for some neAv thing upon Avhich AVC can laA-ish millions. I come back again to the poor taxpayer. From his stand-point it does not matter A cry much whether he pays taxes r to the State or the Commonwealth. Both are instrumentalities through Avhich the people govern themselves. Some day the people may devise better or different in I struments. But, at the back of the States and the CommonAvealth are the people. For the present, what I have What effect is this bill going to have upon their pockets? Are they going to pay less? Are they going to get better value for their money? The Treasurer said that the field of taxation he is Avilling to hand over to them Avould yield a larger sum than they receive under the per capita agreement. Assuming this w ill be so. Avhere would the additional money come from . It would come out of the pockets abo of the people; but not from the same people.

A virtuous person can avoid going to such haunts of vice as the racecourse, and, if he does go, ean avoid being victimized the bill by the thimble and pea trick. But nobody can escape paying Customs ancl excise duties, and what is more, the people do not realize that they are paying them. This is the kind of thing that appeals to the Treasurer. If and when he has palmed off the unpopular flaxes upon the States he will be able to go through the country on his tours, and the people will say, "" Lo, here comes a man after our own heart."" He gets r i d of the entertainments tax, ancl all the little children say, '-' God bless Dr. Page.""

There is no other way. Sof a r as the land tax is concerned, what this proposal means in plain English is that, instead of estates of moderate size escaping witb small payments, they would have to pay an added sum sufficient to make up for the loss on the great estates, that could not be taxed by tbe States individually. As I pointed out in this House when speaking on the proposed grant of wider powers to the Commonwealth, there are some things that the States cannot do. It is evident, on the Treasurer's own showing, that this bill will not result in a saving to thc taxpayers. It may be Jones who will pay instead of Smith, but the Jones who will have to pay will be Jones, the man on the basic wage, or the small land-owner. It is very curious that the Treasurer who, when be first entered this House, advocated, with considerable force and earnestness, deliberately seek to divest himself of aH hated revenue taxes, which increase the cost of living to the man on the land. It is also most curious that since the honourable gentleman has been in office, the revenue fro m Customs and excise has grown out of all knowledge. He asks the people to accept this proposal because it will make for economy. Buti t w ill not save the taxpayer's money. Let hi-1 show wherethe taxpayers by and large-the have to pay the same amount of money ns before. The honourable member for Barton( MrL e y ) , who was hard put to it in coming to the defence of this bill rather hurriedly, was naturally a little at a loss to know what to say. He spoke of what would be saved by abolishing the bureaucratic staffs that now exist in the Federal Taxation Department. I point out, however, that if some were abolished, others would have to be created by the States, and in the aggregate the co<!t. of collection would be greater. There can be no doubt about that. Tbe Government is on the horns of Mr fluyhet. As my friend, the honourable a dilemma. Either the States will get for Henty( Mr Gullett) the same amount of money-the Treasurer says they will get more-o r they will get less, in which case there will be chaos in regard to some of the State instrumentalities. If there is not sufficient money to carry on tlie busiuess of the .country the people will suffer. In place of progress there w ill be stagnation and unemployment. When there is disturbance of the financial equilibrium it reacts upon the whole community, and saps that feeling of confidence in the future, upon which, to a large extent, prosperity depends. Here is a financial edifice that has endured for 27 years. The people have never for a moment indicated that they desire to change radically the design of the building; but the Treasurer proposes to pull down one of its main pillars. A t best, that w ill disturb the financial equilibrium of the States. It w ill embarrass and hamper them, and do good to nobody except the honourable gentleman himself. I do not say that there is no other way of meeting the need of the States except that of the per capita payments, but I do contend that none of the argulower duties, should ments put forward during the debate w ill j u s t if y any honourable member in voting forms of taxation except the for the bill. It w ill not benefit the people. We hear from some quarters about the demand by the wage-earner for ah increase in the basic wage. This w ill not lessen that demand. t The demand for increased wages is caused by the increase in the cost of living, the Treasurer, depending, as he w ill , upon high Customs revenue to make both ends meet, is not likely to do anything to reduce that cost. Why whole country-wil l not should we pass this bill? It does not go to the root of the trouble of public finance. It w ill not reduce public borrowing. It will not lessen public expenditure. The right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) told us something last night which should be blazoned from one end of the land to the other. He said that, in the last six years £176,000,000. Are we to go on borrowing at this rate? It is a condition of affairs that cannot continue, and still leave the body politic normal. Whether Labour,",46,Speaker Mr Of The Labour Party Which Put The

101,Mr Hughes,"We had borrowedNationalist, or Composite Government is in power, this cannot go on. Yet this bill does nothing to remedy the evil. It will not reduce borrowing. It does not aet up a council to control borrowing. It leaves these vital things just as they are. does nothing except, perhaps, for the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. Possibly it simplifies matters for him. At any rate, the Treasurer has set his mind upon it, and has determined to force it down the throats of the State Treasurers. people. If it would do something to reduce or regulate borrowing; if it would put the State debts upon a proper footing, or, as the right honourable member for Balaclava said last night, create a sinking fund that would really do something to provide for the redemption of debts as time went on it would stabilize our credit and improve it. If it would put an end to competition in borrowing as between State and State, by forming a loan council to control borrowing, it would be worthwhile. But it does none of these things. It simply transfers to the States some taxes now collected by the Commonwealth, and retains to the Commonwealth the whole of the Customs and excise taxation from which 25s. per head, or about £8,000,000 per annum, now goes to the States. And that is all it does. If we pass it, it must throw the finances of the States into confusion, and increase the amount of taxation which the great bulk of the people have to pay. It will l if t considerable taxation quate defence. And this is advanced as from a few, the very rich, and place it on the shoulders of the rest of the community. As I have said, the Treasurer has a passionate desire to reform others. He, the Prime Minister, and, in fact, all of us, deplore the condition of the State finances. All seem to be on the borders of bankruptcy. And yet no one takes much notice, which is perhaps the most serious symptom of all. It has become well-nigh the normal condition of things, and is so regarded. What the people want is good government, ancl a reduction in taxation. Briefly, they want the best possible government at the least possible price. The Treasurer points to the extravagance of the States. He preaches economy, but he does not. practise it. Since this GovernmentI speak with particular reference to the Treasurer, of course-ha s been in power, we have had large increases in taxation. I used to sit in the Prime Minister's It is a proposal which chair, and listen to the present Treasurer speaking, as a private member, from the Country party corner about the virtues of economy. I very well remember sitting there with the honourable member for Warringah ( Sir Granville Eyrie) when we had to submit to a reduction of Buti t will not help the £500,000 in our Defence estimates which the present Treasurer compelled us to accept. Last night, the Minister for Markets and Migration gave as one reason why this bill should be passed the fact that the Defence expenditure, without including the amount for naval construction, totalled £5,500,000, or thereabouts. I do not know what the estimate was when the honourable member for Warringah was in charge of the Defence Department's Estimates in this House. enough. ply that I want from my honourable friend, but at least I have this, that although the amount proposed by the then Government was really not enough, it was cut down on the motion of the present Treasurer. Now, when these very people are in office they come forward and plead with tears in their eyes for more money in order that they may provide for adeone reason why we should repeal the per capita payment to the States. It was in his advocacy of reduced taxation that the present Treasurer shone most brilliantly when he was a private member. But what is his record ? When my Government went out of office the Commonwealth taxation per capita totalled £8 17s. l d . annually. Last year it was £9 Is. 6d. It is in this way, of course, that economy shows itseK most effectively! The net increase from 1922-3 to 1925-6 was 4s. 5d. per head of the population. We must add to this the petrol tax, which averages 6s. 8d. per head, and makes the increased taxation per capita no less than 12s. l d . as the result of four",52,Speaker Mr Of The Labour Party Which Put The

The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) asserted that there was only one issue at the last election, that nothing else was before the people. Later, he was good enough to say that the Prime Minister had placed before the country a great programme which contained several items to the postponement of which he objected. Either statement may be correct, but both cannot be right. In the Prime Minister's policy speech this subject was referred to in unmistakable terms. I shall read the relevant portions of that speech, A fte r referring to the fact that there had been now more than 25 years' experience of federation, the Prime Minister, speaking at Dandenong, went on to BayIt The ideal which the framers of the Constitution had before them was to weld Australia into one great nation, while preserving to the States their rights of self government. The greatest problem that had to be faced in the realization of this ideal was the question of Commonwealth and State finance. This question was dealt with by the States surrendering to the Commonwealth sources of revenue far in excess of the requirements of the Commonwealth. Of this revenue for the first ten years three-quarters was handed back to the States, and SIIICP the expiration of that period a ner capita grant of 25s. has been made by the Commonwealth to the States. The whole basis of these arrangements, however, was destroyed by the Great War. Having briefly enlarged upon that subject, he saidThe result of these fundamental changes is that the Commonwealth to-day is raising revenues in order to provide the per capita payments to the States. This is contrary to the basic principle of national finance that every government shall have the responsibility of raising the revenue whicli it is expending. He further said that for the purpose of discussing this subject right honourable gentleman to say that he",53,Speaker Mr Of The Labour Party Which Put The

The payment of a population grant was, he saidContrary to the basic principle of national finance that every government should have the responsibility of raising the revenue it expended. Is not that the issue we have been discussing in this House? Is not that the proposition upon which this bill rests? Is not that the proposal to which the Prime Minister was referring when he plainly stated that the continuance of the capitation grant was inconsistent with a basic principle of national finance? The Prime Minister went on to speak of the special position of Western Australia and Tasmania, and concluded this portion of his speech by sayingThe Government is giving careful consideration to the questions raised as a result of the investigations of the Western Australian royal commission, and proposes in the near future to invite the States to attend a conference for the purpose of reconsidering tlie financial relations between the Commonwealth und the States and dealing with the disabilities suffered by certain States with a view to laying down a basis for our national development in which the Commonwealth and the States will co-operate. At this conference an opportunity will be afforded to consider all questions affecting the relations of the Commonwealth and the States, including the question of new states. That conference was held in 1926, in accordance with the Prime Minister's promise to representatives of the States, who their own point of view, to adopt the position, with respect to Commonwealth and State finances, that there was only one possible solution of the problem, and that was the continuance of the payments. The States were adamant and would not make any agreement involving their surrender. The Prime Minister made it perfectly plain that the existing system upon which the financial relations of the Commonwealth and States was based was, in the opinion of the Government, unsound, that it could not be allowed to continue, and that he proposed to ask the representatives of the States to attend the conference for the purpose of evolving an alternative system. When that conference was held, the States, as they were gentleman quoting? fully entitled to do, said that they insisted upon the continuance of the present sysI am prepared to tem, and would not consider anything else. In view of that attitude, we are now asked to accept the position that any alteration of the financial relations be-tween the Commonwealth and the States should be preceded by some agreement. That means that so long as any State or a substantial number of States, withhold agreement, nothing can be done, and matters must remain as they are. I submit that an earnest attempt has been made to arrive at an agreement upon this matter, that the States have deliberately refused to enter upon auy discussion of an alternative to the per capita payments, and that the responsibility, therefore, devolves upon this House of considering whether the payments shall be allowed to continue. Appeals have been made to the Government-the last was by the right honourable member for North Sydney-to approach this subject in a kindly and friendly manner, with a view to securing State co-operation. The right honourable gentleman has at all times been so distinguished for the mildness and gentleness of his own methods that it is difficult to resist the appeal. I suggest, however, that every effort to arrive at an agreement upon this subject with the representatives ""of the States has failed. They have taken up a position which prevents discussion, and the matter must therefore be determined by Parliament. That has been the view, T think, of all representatives of the Commonwealth who have had the responsiwere doubtless entitled, from bility of dealing with this subject, which has been under consideration on many occasions. A conference on this subject was held in 1909, legislation was introduced in 1910, and, in 1919, when the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) was Treasurer, another conference was held. There were further conferencss in 1920, 1923, and in 1926. It cannot, therefore, be said that this subject is being sprung upon the people, or that it is in any way being rushed. At the conference in 1920 the then Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) dealt with this matter, and in plainly expressing his views, said-",55,Speaker Mr Of The Labour Party Which Put The

The right honourable gentleman on that occasion saidIn all the circumstancesHe was referring to the warsince the money conies out of the pocket of the taxpayer, whether in State or Commonwealth, I cannot see my way to say that tlie per capita payment shall continue. We ehall hear all you have to say, hut the position we take up now is, in view of what has been said, and the attitude of the States in regard to the referendum, and in regard to the expenditure of public money, and the offer by the Commonwealth to commit itself to an expenditure of very many millions£4,800,000 for the railway gauge, und one-quarter of the increased expenditure on the Murray waters scheme, or not less than £8,000.000-that we cannot continue the per capita payment. of the Commonwealth to engage in the expenditure alluded to, we can arrive at no sort of agreement. In all the circumstances, we must ask you to adjust your finances upon the assumption that the per capita payment w ill be reduced as set out by Mr Watt. to take it from the States? as stated by the right honourable gentleman at that conference. I presume it was the considered policy of the then Commonwealth Government. It is true that it was not persevered with hy them. exactly what I said. parently f a i r l y summarized in a question which the right honourable gentleman put Fihelly, who represented Queensland at that gathering, asked whether t h j Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) had any sense of equity, and saidEitheri t is a fair thing to continue the subsidy to the States, or it is a fair thing to take it away from them. To that Mr Hughes repliedDo you want equity or do you want the per capita grant ? the conference? the report of the Premier's conference I am about to quote held in May, 1920. Honourable members will, I hope, remember that I have said that, allied to the declared policy of the then Commonwealth Government, was a in expressing the view of his proposal for a convention; I do not wish to be misunderstood on the point. This bill proposes the repeal of the Surplus Revenue Act, and provides for the making of equivalent payments to the States during the coming financial year, and the granting of financial assistance to the States of Western Australia and Tasmania. The bill itself shows upon its face that it is in tended to hold a conference with the States, if the States are prepared to attend a conference, and meet and discuss these important matters with representatives of the Commonwealth. At that conference the whole position w ill be open to discussion, subject to the decision which this Parliament is asked to make, that, the population grant Notwithstanding the offer is wrong in principle. The Government is taking the responsibility of asking the House to do that. It would, be easy for the Government to say, "" We w ill abandon our policy and merely have a conference with the States."" I suggest, however, that there is a question of principle involved in this, and that the Government would be unworthy T h a t was the policy, of its position if it were ready to take any of these easy methods of retreat. The House is asked to determine whether or not the population grant is sound in principle. Unless other legislation were brought in to alter what the Prime Minister, in his policy speech, described as the unsound principle upon which the The position is apper capita grant had been made, the Government would not be endeavouring to carry out the nolicy proclaimed by him at the same conference.

The suggestion BLOW made is that these niatters can never be dealt with unless the States agree with the Commonwealth. question which I wish to approach now. The people have expressed their opinion on this particular issue. The will of the people with respect to these matters is to bo found in the Commonwealth Constitution itself. The right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) , who has a very f u l l knowledge of this subject, referred to the history of the Pederal Conventions. Ho referred to the referendum of 1898, when section 87 of the Constitution did not have the ten-year limitation in it with respect to the return of three-fourths of the Customs and excise revenue to the States. The right honourable gentleman spoke also of the Premiers' Conference, at which an arrangement was made for the imposition of a ten-year l i m it upon the constitutional right of the States to share in the Customs revenue; but, probably by inadvertence, he did not mention that the Constitution was submitted to the people again at a referendum in June, 1S99, and was adopted in its present form , so that the provisions of the Constitution represent the w ill of the people upon this matter. Those provisions are to be be found in sections 87 and 94. I shall not weary honourable members by reading them, but I should like to remind them that they provide that, after, the first ten years of federation, this Parliament has the right to determine the basis upon which the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth, if there be any, shall be paid to the States. Tliose sections impose upon this Parliament, not only the right, but also the responsibility, of determining this questiou. deal with the method of payment until Parliament otherwise provides? nui making is that they place entirely within the powers of this Parliament the power to determine the matter Thev have been discussed and determined the Government by the people, and there is no doubt as to the powers of this Parliament to deal with the per capita payments as now The conference havproposed. It is obviously important, however, that the States should be consulted. That has been done already, and it is proposed to consult them again. Asf a r as the strict legal position is concerned, however, this Parliament has f u l l power That is t b "" to act. The question which arises under section 94 is with respect to payment to the several States of all surplus revenue to the Commonwealth. That section statesAfter five years from the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. If there is surplus revenue, it should be distributed to the States. This matter has been litigated in the H i g h Court, ancl it was laid down by that tribunal, in an action brought against the Commonwealth by one of the States, that the responsibility of determining whether or not revenue was surplus rests with this Parliament. That is to say, the matter is entirely in the hands of this Parliament. The real question which arises on the present occasion is this: Is the Commonwealth bound to raise surplus revenue in order to be in a position to pay over surplus revenue to the States? That, I suggest, is not the only question but one of the real questions to which we should direct our attention. As long as the States receive money from the Commonwealth, it is clear that they are dependent on the will of this Parliament. I put it that, speaking generally, it is a sound principle that Parliaments should be responsible for raising the revenues which they spend. I say, speaking generally, because, in some cases, it is impossible to apply that principle, and it should not be operated unwisely. The Constitution provides for the giving of financial assistance to the States on certain terms and conditions; but the essence of the Federal' system is that there shall be separate sovereignty in the Commonwealth and the States; that the Commonwealth and the States shall have f u l l powers w it h in their respective domains. The essence of sovereignty is independence of external",57,Speaker Mr Of The Labour Party Which Put The

122,Mr Latham,,58,Speaker Mr Of The Labour Party Which Put The
123,Dr. Maloney,D o not those sections,58,Speaker Mr Of The Labour Party Which Put The
124,Mr Latham,"Yes: the point Icontrol. Comparisons have been made between the grants made by the Commonwealth Parliament to the States on the oue hand, and grants made by State Parliaments to municipal councils on the other hand. The position is entirely different. Municipal councils are creation of State Parliaments, whereas the States and their Parliaments are in no sense a creation of the Federal Parliament. They are independent entities not deriving their existence or power from the Commonwealth, and the principle of federation is that within their spheres each shall be independent, and as sovereign as circumstances permit. The existing provision does not satisfy that Federal criterion, because the States arc entirely dependent for a large proportion of their revenue upon the w ill of the CommonwealthParliament, which w ill may be changed at any moment. Disguise the position as we may, thc States are in a position of absolute financial in security, because this Parliament is able, by merely repealing a statute, to deprive them of a large proportion of their revenue. I propose to show how the Government's proposal w ill improve their position. There is, and should be, no means of binding this Parliament in respect of the exercise of its legislative powers. It must retain the right to legisla!--->. under all its powers at any time, as it thinks proper. But, if the proposed si'homo be adopted, the States will, fro m a practical point of view, be in a more siicure position than they occupy to-day. If some scheme can be devised at the proposed conference, uncier which liabilities of the States will be assumed by the Commonwealth, to that extent the States will be in a secure position, so far as they can be secure without an absolute abrogation of Commonwealth powers. Accordingly, this bill and the proposed conference offer to the States a degree of financial security which is not obtainable by any means other than an amendment of the Constitution, which nobody has yet suggested. The vision which this bill is based, is that the Couunonwealth has exclusive power in relation to the imposition of duties of Customs and excise. In all other fields of taxation, the powers of the Commonwealth are concurrent w i th those of the States, but if there are to be duties of Customs and excise, as there must be, they must be imposed by the Commonwealth, whicli must leceive the revenue. The Federal authority need not, as the a constitutional matter, raise any other revenue; that is a inatter of polioy to be determined by this Parliament. But Customs and excise revenue is the p r i mary source of Commonwealth finance, because that revenue, at least, the Commonwealth must receive. A policy of Customs and excise duties is devised for the protection of industries or the taxation of luxuries, and not for the raising of money to be handed back to the States. It is difficult to conceive of any Parliament framing a Customs ancl ""excise policy in accordance with protectionist principles or for the taxation of luxuries, and then saying, "" T h a t w ill produce a certain amount, but we shall have to find some more money to hand back to the States, and, therefore, we shall increase the duties."" It is impossible to devise any coherent policy of Customs and excise duties which, within its own limits, would provide for the payment of moneys to the States, and there is no obligation upou this Parliament to attempt to frame such a policy. Certain Commonwealth charges and expenses are inescapable, notwithstanding the derision with which I have heard that word received during this debate. It is all very well to say that statutes can be repealed, but can we repudiate the interest on our war loans, or the obligations in respect of war and old age pensions? Certainly not. Thesei n escapable charges absorb the whole of the Customs and excise revenue, aud the. Commonwealth is imposing direct taxation to the amount of about £7,600,000 merely i u order to raise money to hand over co the States. If the Customs and excise revenue exactly eqtialled the expenses of the Commonwealth, would it be suggested that tlie States were still entitled to a share in that revenue? If the primary f u n d upon which the Commonwealth has fundamental financial prot.o depend is completely exhausted by of the Constitution, upon undoubtedly legitimate and inescapable charges, how caii it be suggested that there is any surplus in which the States are entitled to share? The claim of thc States to a share in that revenue is not only unjustified by any provision in the Constitution-whie h is the only expression of the w ill of the people-bu t is also futil e and unintelligible when the financial position is closely examined. I come now tc the proposal which the Commonwealth submitted to the States, and which they, up to the present, have rejected criticized from many points of view, and particularly by the member for Henty( Mr Gullett), upon the ground that it involves an abandonment of direct taxation by the Commonwealth. I remind the honourable member that 60 per cent of the Commonwealth income taxation w ill remain, and that represents a very substantial sum indeed. The 'honourable member appeared to assume that direct taxation, once lifted, will never be reimposed. essence of the Government's scheme that the States, which are confined by the Constitution to direct taxation, are to raise their own revenues to make good what they lose through the discontinuance of the per capita payments. Therefore, the picture which the honourable member for Henty drew, of the results of the abandonment of direct taxation, does not truly represent the effects of the adoption of the Government's proposals. be driven to impose higher railway freights, for instance. point. The honourable member for Henty submitted a most interesting argument based on the assumption that all Commonwealth direct taxation would be abolished, and that therefore direct taxation would be largely reduced in Australia. The reply to that argument is, first, that the Commonwealth would keep in operation no less than 60 per cent, of the income tax, and, secondly, that the States would, by their own legislation, raise an amount approximately equal to the amount now paid in per capita grants. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) objects to the Commonwealth reducing direct taxation; but the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), at the last Premier's conference which he attended, urged and besought the Commonwealth to go out of the field of direct taxation entirely. Accordingly those who are opposing this measure are doing so for diametrically opposite reasons. The proposals of the Commonwealth involve not absolute and final remission of direct taxation, but a redistribution of taxation. The position at present is that, where a taxpayer pays, say, £100 under certain heads to the CommonI t has been wealth and the States-le t us suppose £70 to the Commonwealth and £30 to honourable the States-h e shall pay, say, £50 to the Commonwealth and £50 to the States. Sof a r as the taxpayer is concerned, the change w ill make very little or no difference. W it h much surprise, I have heard repeated in this chamber what has been said again and again outside, that Customs revenue is easy money, and that It is of the money raised by direct taxation is hard money, the raising of which exposes a government to criticism. It has become almost a commonplace among opponents of these proposals, to be accepted as a matter of course, that a government raising money by indirect taxation receives no criticism, whereas one raising money by direct taxation is exposed to the concentrated fire of public opinion. But what do we find? I think I may apply, not unfairly , my experience in this House. I have never heard any States may attacks made upon the Government for maintaining the land tax, the entertainments tax, the probate duties, or the in T h a t is a different come tax; but the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart), the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), the honourable member for Porrest( Mr. Prowse), and the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) criticize the imposition of indirect taxation. If one may assume that these honourable members are representative of their constituents, as we all deem them to be, may we not f a i r l y say that our experience in this House shows that indirect taxation is criticized much more than direct taxation? I s not that our experience from day to day, and from week to week, and does not every honourable member know it? The suggestion that it is easy to raise money through the Customs, .and that a government is immune from criticism in so f a r as it derives its revenue from that source, is very f a r from the fact. A government is open to criticism however it raises its revenue;",58,Speaker Mr Of The Labour Party Which Put The
125,Mr Theodore,But the,60,Speaker Mr Of The Labour Party Which Put The
126,Mr Latham,"but in tbe Commonwealth sphere the criticism is against indirect rather than direct taxation. There has, apparently, developed suddenly a general admiration of the present taxation, and we have learned that the system is not to be touched; that it is sacrosanct; that it is almost perfect; and that it must not be altered, because abandonment of any of the taxes is iu some way wrong in principle. Certain of our taxes represent policy. tariff and excise duties, for example, represent a definite policy. The land tax represents a policy which, I understand, when it was imposed aimed at breaking up large estates in the country, but which raises a large amount of revenue from valuable properties in the cities. Until recent years, however, that tax had a distinct effect in breaking up estates in thc country. The rest of our taxation has been imposed simply to raise money, and for no other purpose, and taxation imposed simply to raise money is not based upon wonderful principle with which it is improper to interfere. The Commonwealth Government has submitted to the States certain figures, which are before honourable members in a paper which has been circulated to them. challenged only in very terms. I am well aware that various representatives of the States have said that the States cannot raise this money, or that there is something wrong with the Commonwealth figures; but I have not yet been sufficiently fortunate to hear any direct attack upon any particular figure in the statement. The source of every figure is stated in a footnote, in order that any honourable member may turn up the authority for the figures upon which the statement is based, and determine for himself whether they are correct. There is not a figure, except those that are mere additions, to which there is not a footnote showing how it has been arrived at. lenged them, done is to challenge them in general State taxation, a Queensland act which terms. pointed a commission. pointed a commission to consider the position of South Australia in relation system of Commonwealth to tlie Commonwealth-quit e a natural thing for it to do.

At the conference in 1926 the States' representatives refused to examine them, and since then they have not pointed out to the Commonwealth Government any error in them. One of the recent acts of the Commonwealth Government was to offer a royal commission, with one member appointed by the States, for the purpose of examining the figures; but the States refused to any agree to the appointment of it. The 'Government has done everything possible to show the accuracy of the figures by stating their sources, and by giving the States an opportunity of examining them, and, if they could do so, of demonstrating where they were wrong. Those figures have been I wish to deal with one point on the general subject of aggregation. Several honourable members have said that it is beyond the power of the States to aggregate, for the purpose of taxation, any property, whether in the form of land or not, under the land tax or estate duty acts, or incomes under the income tax acts. That statement 4'.ias been made by several honourable members, but none has cited any authority for it except the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), who referred to a case decided in the High Court, in which it was determined that certain legislation of the State of Queensland was invalid. That was a case in which I appeared for the State of Queensland, and, unfortunately for my client, failed to convince the High flnurt that T was right.

It has been said that the States could not raise from the fields of taxation which are proposed to be abandoned money needed for the cessation of the per capita payments. tention to the figures and the footnotes which have been circulated ? These figures show the actual proceeds of the existing Commonwealth taxation. A footnote indicates that land tax was reduced by 20 per cent, in 1922-2?!. Tbe entertainment tax has also been reduced, it formerly applied to every ticket of more than 6d. in value, but now it only applies to tickets valued at 2s. 6d. or more. The proceeds from that tax have fallen from £675,000 to £320,000; and this has been by reason of the reduction in the rate of tax, and not by reason of any falling-off in the productive field. Income taxation produced £16,790,000 in 1921-22, and it is now producing only about £11,000,000. The rate of tax has been reduced three times recently by 10 per cent., 10 per cent., and 12£ per cent, respectively. sums have been raised in these fields of taxation than they are at present yielding, except in the case of estate duties, which have not been altered, how can it be suggested that there is no taxable field from which the States cotild raise the money which the Commonwealth is now raising j f it were necessary for them to do so? If the States wished to obtain a larger revenue than that which they at present receive from the per capita payments, all they would havo tn do would be to readjust their rates of taxation. Obviously there is a large margin in the three fields which I have mentioned. 117 of Among the critics of this proposal there appear to be some people who are honestly unaware that the Government is proposing to reduce Commonwealth I do not, as at pretaxation to the extent of the amount paid to the Statesi n capitation grant. This subject has been looked at f a r too much Wales act, as if it were merely the abolition of the capitation grant. It is really tbe abolition of the per capita grant and a reduction of Commonwealth taxation to an amount, at least equivalent, and on the figures more than equivalent, to that which is now paid to the States. Let me take the case of my own State of Victoriaf o r a moment. If the Commonwealth proposal were adopted there would be a saving to the Victorian taxthe payers of more than £125,000 upon tba to compensate them only figures which have yet been submitted to the public. The Victorian May I again invite atTreasurer ( Sir Alexander Peacock) denies that this is so, but he has given no details to support his denial, nor has he challenged a single figure i,n the Commonwealth statement. This statement shows from whence every figure is derived. Sir Alexander Peacock gave an interview to the press yesterday on this subject, and as a Victorian I ask the forbearance of honourable members whilst I deal briefly with the eight points which he submits for the consideration of the Victorian people. The first point is as .follows:The Federal Goveniment neither asked for nor obtained a mandate from thc people at the general election. I have already read that part of the policy speech of the Prime Minister which dealt with the capitation grant. It stated quite definitely that the GoSeeing that much larger vernment considered that the present scheme was based on unsound financial principles, and expressly declared that the matter should be re-examined. does not appear at all. speech dealing w i th the per capita payments reads as follows:The whole basis of these arrangements, however, was destroyed by thc Great War. . . . The result of these fundamental changes is that the Commonwealth to-day Is raising revenues in order to provide the p»r capita payments to the States.

I had some difficulty in securing the copy of the speech from which I have just quoted, and I obtained a copy of the Argus and found that those precise words appeared in it . Some honourable members apparently wish to frighten the Government by referring to government supporters outside of Parliament, and by referencesto the general elections. this as a matter of principle of the greatest urgency and importance, alike to the Commonwealth, the States, and the people of Australia as a whole. An y honourable member is entitled to the opinion that this is wrong. surely not suggested that, though the Government sincerely believes that a proposal, important on the ground of principle, and affecting the whole future of the Commonwealth, should be introduced to Parliament, it should be abandoned because some of its supporters outside of Parliament are opposed to it . The Government is not prepared to abandon this proposal. Sir Alexander Peacock's second point wasThe majority against the federal refeTendum proposals last September was increased because the people were incensed against the Federal Government for a proposed tyrannical misuse of power in respect to the abolition of the payment of 25s. a head of population annually to tlie States. General say that there was anything definite in the policy speech declaring that the Government intended to abolish the per capita payment? stated that, in its opinion, the per capita payments were founded upon an unsound principle, and that the whole question would have to be re-examined. That is quite plainly stated. It can hardly be said that the second point made by Sir Alexander Peacock is a reason against these proposals. Is the Government never to attempt to give effect to its policy? Is there no responsibility upon it at all? Isi t , simply because there is opposition from some of its supporters, to abandon any proposal that it may make? The third point made by Sir Alexander Peacock was stated as follows:There would have heen no federation (he I assure the honorspoke as a member of the Constitutional Convention) without a financial partnership between the Commonwealth and the States regarding the distribution of Customs and excise revenue. The history of the matter shows that the partnership was limited for ten years. It was that change in the federation scheme, and the Pederal Capital proposals, that caused New South Wales to supposed decisions of agree to federate. The partnership lasted for ten years and was then terminated in accordance with the Constitution. The The Government regards fourt h point made by Sir Alexander Peacock is stated as follows:It wa3 impossible for Victoria to incorporate in its taxation system tlie direct taxation the Federal Government proposed to relinquish, and it would be forced to throw the Buti t is income tax system now in force into the melting pot and mould a new scheme with a distribution over a much larger area than at present. The alternative was to cut down services now considered essential. It is obvious that if the Victorian Parliament is prepared to increase its probate, land, and income taxes, it will be able to recoup itself for the loss of the per capita payments. Amended taxation laws may be necessary; but are we to accept it as a principle that the States are not to amend their taxation legislation? Thef if t h point isI t was fair for all classes of the community to contribute to the upkeep of social services to fulfil the primary functions of government, and that this contribution was secured by receiving a share of Customs and excise revenue. The members of tlie State Parliament, who were closer to the people by reason of greater numbers and smaller constituencies, had voted unanimously against the abolition of per capita payments, and the press had voiced similar protest. able gentleman's own attitude at the last election ? for m that I was in favour of the finances of the Commonwealth and the States being separated, so that each should assume responsibility for raising the money it expended, and that, if I were returned, I would do all I could to bring about a more sensible system of",63,Speaker Mr Of The Labour Party Which Put The

That point has not been taken, in this House, and is rather a matter for honourable members, who, up to the present, have not found it embarrassing, or, if they have, delicately refrain from mentioning it. The seventh point readsVictorian members of the Federal Parliament, whether members of the House of Repreno one suggests that the Federal Parliasentatives or senators, would be unmindful ment has not the right to terminate the of thc interests of Victoria if they voted for per capita payment if it so desires.

The question that other Statesi n demanding that the paythe House is asked to decide is whether ments be continued. We have been asked the per capita payment to the States, to say that the measure should be treated which has been in existence for the last as a non-party question.

Why should that be done? That is the simple question which I , as a representative of the people, have to ask myself. We are told by the Government that under the Constitution it rests w i th the Federal Parliament to say whether this arrangement is to continue. It is true that the Surplus Revenue Act provides that the arrangement shall continue u n t i l Parliament otherwise provides, and State Governments have no constitutional or legal right to the continuance of the Government, which is all they ask.

Three of the Ministers in this House are members of the Victorian Farmers' Union, which is the organization behind the Country party in the State of Victoria. There is no suggestion in the rules and platform of the Victorian Farmers' Union or the Country party in Victoria that it favours the withdrawal of the per capita payments, which we are now told represent a vicious principle of finance. I turn now to the platform of the National party, to which I am proud to belong. The National Federation is the organization behind that party in Victoria, and, indeed, plank in its platform readsThe maintenance of the 25s. per capita payment to the States until such time as a satisfactory alternative is agreed to. That is the position in which we, as members of that organization, find ourselves.

Let us consider for a moment what we are now asked to doThe honourable the Attorney-General( Mr. Latham) , who has just resumed his seat, solemnly maintained that we had a mandate from the people to discontinue the per capita payments and that the bill As for the Counnow before the House was in accordance with the declared policy of the Nationalist party as outlined by the Prime Minister during the last election campaign. I absolutely deny the correctness of that statement. The Attorney-General told us that in the opinion of the Government these per capita payments, representing the collection by the Commonwealth of money which the States were to spend, were a violation of a fundamental principle of finance, and that it was the intention of the Government to call the States into consultation to consider I think these are the very words he used -''the problems arising out of the existing financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States."" The Prime Ministeri n his policy speech went on to say, and this was the throughout Australia. One gist of his argument, that the existing conditions in Australia rendered necessary "" a re-examination of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States."" This policy is in accordance w it h the platf o r m of the organization behind the members Prime Minister, an organization which, do not know so much I think he w ill admit, rendered valuable members in the service in the last election in organization is bereturning this party in the strength and assists them in which it finds itself to-day. I have read carefully the Governorwas selected by tlie National General's speech, which is supposed to foreshadow the legislation proposed to subsequent be brought down by the Government, and Federation I cannot find in it any reference whatjustified in its selection. ever to a proposal of the character of the bill now under discussion. Honourable organization, a few members may recall that the GovernorAttorney-General General's speech emphasized that the and Senafinancial position of the Commonwealth was sound and reflected the general prosAfter hearing those perity of the people. That was all that resolved was said about the financial outlook, and, had taken curiously enough, following almost immeand diately on that passage in the speech came this statementThus The election has shown that the people of Australia are determined to maintain law and order. In through the Governor General, said"" We recognize that the real meaning of the state of parties as the result of the recent election is a declaration on the part of the people that they are in favour of thc maintenance of law and order, and will support the Government in dealing with certain sinister influences that have been at work in the community hitherto."" The Attorney-General stated that on the public platform during his election campaign he gave utterence to the sentiments he expressed to-night. No doubt he did, but how many of the hundreds of thousands of electors heard him? Besides, he was uot speaking on behalf of the Government: he was expressing the opinion of an individual who in no way bound the Government. The Attorney-General twitted the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes') with the fact that he and his Treasurer ( MrW a t t ) , in 1920, had foreshadowed the withdrawal of the por capita payments. Last night the right honourable member for aud f u l l y what induced the then Government to make that suggestion. It is an extraordinary fact that the right honourable gentleman, who with his Treasurer in 1920 made that proposal, should in 1922, have had as Treasurer the proBent Prune Minister, who in tbe course of a speech before the National Democratic Council at Brisbane dealt with federal finance, and, particularly, the special appropriations. The slogan of his speech was "" Stable Government and Sound Finance."" Up to that time the finances of the Commonwealth had included the per capita payments to the States, and the right honourable gentleman, in referring to the special appropriations said : As mutters now stand in Australia, the per involve. The leaders of the State Parliacapita payments cannot be done away with. Possibly the future may hold in store for Australia a different form of government. Certainly we have many Governments in Australia, possibly to the extent of being over-governed. But until there has been a change in the basis of tiie forms of governments of thu States these payments must be continued. That was his opinion as Treasurer in the Hughes Government in 1922. other words, the Government, Sof a r as I know there has been no change in the basis of the for m of government of the States, and the right honourable gentleman, who then said that u n t i l that change occurred the per capita payment must continue, to-day says, although that basis has not been changed the payments must cease. One naturally seeks the reason for this change of policy. As the right honourable member for SydThat, I submit, was the mandate. ney said to-night in the course of a v/itty and able speech, there is no urgency about this proposal: tlie present arrangement has been working satisfactorily for seventeen years. It has been suggested that the man responsible for the b ill now before us is the present Treasurer. Whether or not that is so I do not know. But a prominent member of -the Victorian Farmers' Union a few days ago in conversation expressed the view that the present Federal Treasurer was, especially in financial matters, a superman. I did not consult the dictionary as to the meaning of "" supermini,"" but I suppose it meant in this instance a man who occasionally lauds himself and those Balaclava explained very ably who follow h i m in thp. soup. If this bo the meaning of the term, I think the Treasurer may have some claim to the soubriquet. We have been told by the Government that although the States are totally opposed t» this scheme, it w ill benefit them. The Federal Treasurer and those associated with him may be greater financiers than the men connected with the State Governments. If that is so, the latter are surely entitled to more considerate treatment. They are charged with grave responsibilities in the administration of tlieir respective States. The speech of the right honourable member for Balaclava lastnight helped me to realize the extent, variety, and importance of the functions discharged by the State Governments, and the financial burdens they ments deserve consideration, and they declare that this proposal, if accepted by this Parliament, w ill dislocate their finances. Like the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney, I am unable to understand how the Treasurer reconciles his statements to the States that under his scheme they w ill get more money, and to the taxpayers that they w ill pay less! One reason given by tbe Federal Government for forcing this arrangement on the States is that the State Governments, being to means the surrender of money that huutirto My experience is that there is just as much human nature in Federal as in State governments. vernment is as eager to acquire as the State governments are loth to relinquish money that comes to them comparatively easily. amicable arrangement between the States and the Commonwealth as to how the money shall be allocated. We are told, and it has been emobasized over and over again by the Federal Government, that this is a matter peculiarly for this Parliament; that it is for this Parliament to say whether the payments shall continue. Surelyi t is for the people to say, through, I admit, this Parliament. This Parliament through which the popular w ill, in regard to this and other matters, must be expressed ; but I say we have no right to discuss and decide a matter like this which has never been before the people of Australia. hands. "" In view of the oxpress opinions of the State governments, the State Parliaments, the people, and a very large section of the Federal Parliament, we shall stay our hands. We shall call the States into consultation, as was foreshadowed in the policy speech, for the purpose of considering the whole financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States."" doue it as I say it should be done. Each side should, go into consultation uncommitted to any view. problems be discussed on their merits. If the Government has a scheme, let it place it before the States, and if after it has been discussed by them and, in the press, and by the nublic, the States refuse to accept it , let thc Federal Government say to the people at the next election, "" We have consulted the States, we thoroughly, and we think that in the interests of the Commonwealth the scheme we have propounded ought to be accepted. If we are returned to power the first thing we shall do will be to put it into execution."" The Government human, are not likely could then come down and say, with entertain a proposal which perfect truth , that it had a mandate from the people. This bill iB going to .a has been easily obtained. division in the House, and in that connection I wish to make an apueal to honourable members.

It would be a calamity if any vote cast A f t e r all, it is a matter for in this House on a question, which will have such far-reaching and important effect upon the various interests of the Commonwealth, were dictated by any other feeling than that of conviction. Some honourable members might be tempted, out of a feeling of mistaken loyalty to the Government, to cast a vote in favour of the bill because they think not that it ought to be oassed, but that the Government ought to be saved. The is the instrument Constitution provides for the continuance of the arrangement until the Parliament otherwise provides, but not, as has already been pointed out, until some government that happens to be in power so determines. Therefore, every vote We ought to hold our ought to be cast strictly on the merits Tho Government should say, of the question, and it is because I consider the course I have outlined the proper one to pursue, that if the Government insists upon forcing thc matter to a division, I shall vote without hesitation and without misgiving against it . adjourned.
