At the present time, the strength of the Tasmanian Forces is 1,214 men, and the expenditure on defence, in 1904-5, ,£39,907. Fuller information is given in the following return :Strength, 3i/i2/'oo. Permanent Others (who received no pay except when attending annual training, and then at a nominal rate of only 3s. per day). Total Strength, 2o/6/'o$. Permanent Militia (.paid at same rates as in other States, an average of about £ j each per annum). ... .Volunteers ... Total The figures given as the strength on 31st December, 1900, ^re taken from the report of the Commandant 'of Tasmania, dated ist March, 1901. The expenditure for 1900-1 is taken from a statement furnished by the Commandant of Tasmania, on 13th March; 1902, and is stated to have been compiled from the two half years, viz., ist July to 31st December, 1900, and ist January to 30th June, 1901. The information was supplied in response to a request from the Commonwealth Treasurer, dated 22nd February, 1902. Letters dated February 14, 16, and 26, 1901, from the State Minister of Defence, Tnsmania, show the condition of the Military Forces in Tasmania at time pf transfer to the Commonwealth. In a letter from the Premier of Tasmania, dated 26th June, 1903, lie urges that the proposal to introduce the system of partially paid Forces in Tasmania-o n the same basis as' in other States-and tlie consequent increase of the Estimates for the Military Forces, Tasmania, by £4,000, be' deferred. In compliance with this request, the conversion of portion of the Volunteer Forces to Militia was suspended, the estimates being reduced accordingly. . . I have no alternative but to say that it was apparent to me in the early stages of a searching inquiry, which I made into the condition of our Defence Department, that the service had been cut down to such an extent during the years of .retrenchment--1892.1897-that ft had become probably more a menace to the State than a security. I found that, from the Staff downyards, the Department had been so cut down that it was impossible to put it upon anything approaching a serviceable footing, without incurring very much expenditure. The batteries had been allowed to d r if t into a slate of disrepair, necessitating, in the case of'the Alexandra battery alone, a very large amount of expenditure for the purpose of putting it in bare working order. The whole (Infantry Forces) were badlv equipped, many of the men being without uniform, others were in Uniform which had been Expenditure, 1900-1. issued two or three times over, and quite unfit ... ... 27 for use. Many were without belts and slings, some even without rifles. Then again, the Mar. tini-Hcnry rifles with which the Infantry Force was armed had been in use some 15 years.

Generally, I found that, we were deficient in every article of equipment. In some instances dangerously so. For instance, we had not nearly sufficient tents.. Nearly half the force was without overcoats. The stock of ammunition was' ridiculously low-, so low that beyond the equipment stock for the purposes of the Martini-Henry rifles, we had scarcely any small arm ammunition on hand. The above is a brief outline of the wretched condition of our Defence Force as I found it in October, 1899. Firstly, the staff must be materially increased by the appointment of certain permanent officers. It is impossible for the Commandant to satisfactorily carry on his work under the existing ar.. rangements, whereby, owing to the paucity of assistance, as described above, he has to spend a very considerable portion of his time in the office, dealing, with, matter .of detail and routine, which properly belong to subordinate officers,",12,Personal Explanation

6,Mr Ewing,"A t the end of 1900, theresulting in neglect and injury to the armament, administration, &c. At the present time the system of partial payment had dwindled down to a nominal grant to the Artillery and the Engineer Corps attending annual training, but I now propose to establish a uniform rate of pay to all branches for annual training, and to provide pay for a certain number of whole day and half day daylight drills. last week, promised to obtain information in regard to the effect of Commonwealth legislation upon pearl shelling operations at Thursday Island, which. I assured him, could be obtained from the officers of the Customs Department. Has that information yet come to hand? for, but has not yet rettched me. the motion for the third reading is moved, I desire to move, in accordance with the Standing OrdersThat the Bill be now re-committed to a Committee of the whole House, for the purpose of reconsidering clause 10, so far as it relates to the confiscation or forfeiture of the goods of Australian producers and manufacturers. My reason for taking this step is that I desire to finally test the opinion of honourable members in regard to the confiscation of the goods of Australian producers and manufacturers intended for export, apart from any other issue. An extraordinary series of misstatements have been made respecting the action of the Opposition towards this clause, and a great deal of misapprehension exists as to the effect of the clause. This is evident in the statements in a recent leading article of a well-known Melbourne journal. The writer points out that this measure is to provide a guarantee for the bona fides of Australian exports. It is a proposal to make false descriptions of goods such an offence as the law can reach. I do not object to the clause in order to prevent the law from reaching such an offence as the applying of false descriptions to goods, but because it provides for the confiscation of goods intended for export, whose producers or manufacturers have unwittingly, carelessly, or negligently applied to them the wrong trade description. In [102]2 the article from which I have just quoted, it is also pointed out that the B ill aims at. securing for Australian exports in foreign markets the benefit of that enhanced reputation which springs from public confidence in the trustworthiness of a trade mark. The consumer is to be guaranteed the genuineness, both as to quantity and quality, of what he buys. We do not desire to injure the reputation of Australian goods, but we feel that the Australian producer and manufacturer who has made a mistake in describing his goods should not be liable to have them confiscated. It is stated in the leading article to which I have already referred that it is the principle of grading which has "" kept Parliament wrangling over the Bill for a month past;"" but that statement is due to a total misapprehension of the reaI t was at once asked sons which have actuated the opposition to certain clauses in it, a misapprehension which has been to some extent conveyed by the remarks of the Minister of Trade and Customs and the Attorney-General. These honourable gentlemen have conveyed the impression that the clause with which I am dealing is a clause to penalize the application of false trade descriptions. Clause 11 imposes a penalty of ^ 1 0 0 on any person who knowingly applies a false trade description to any goods intended for export, or knowingly exports any goods to which a false trade description has been applied, and clause 12 provides that no goods to which a false trade description has been applied shall be exported, but that such goods shall be forfeited. Clause 10. however, which is the clause with which I am dealing, provides for the confiscation of goods intended for export to which a false trade description has been applied, ignor/antly, carelessly, or negligently, and, to my mind, places an outrageous power in the hands of the Minister. The Minister of Trade and Customs referred to"" a number of State Acts which he said contained a similar provision; but no Act passed by any of the States or by New Zealand provides for the confiscation of goods because an inaccurate description has carelessly been applied to them, and confiscation, even for a false description, is not provided for. The Victorian Export Produce Act was passed by a Government in which the present Commonwealth Attorney-General was Attorney-General, but that Act does not provide for the confiscation of exports to which a false description has been applied, and no one dreamt of",13,Extracts From A Letter From The Minister For Defence Tasmania To The Minister Of State For Defence For The Commonwealth Dated 14th February 1901

9,Mr Robinso N (Wannon),"Befor eproposing to confiscate goods in regard to which a mistake in description was carelessly, ignorantly, or negligently made. The Attorney-General knows that, had such a proposal been put before the Victorian Parliament, the country constituencies would have been in an uproar, and T am convinced that it is only owing to lack of interest in the proceedings of this Parliament that there has not been an ebullition of feeling against clause 10 of the Commerce Bill. country understand that the clause allows the Minister to confiscate goods to which a false trade description has been negligently or carelessly, but not dishonestly or wickedly, applied, they will be strongly opposed to it, and clause 2 provides, in effect, that any accused person shall be presumed to be guilty until be has proved his innocence. Much of the produce of this country is exported directly, either by individual farmers or by associations and unions of farmers, managed by persons many of whom are not accustomed to read Acts of Parliament and departmental regulations, on whom the provision will fal l with undue severity. When it was proposed to apply the provisions of the Arbitration Bill to rural industries, the representatives of every farming constituency voted against it, and the farmers, when they understand this clause, will attach the same importance to its amendment as they attached to their exclusion from the Arbitration B ill . The effect of my motion will be to draw a clear line of demarcation between those who favour' the confiscation of . the goods of producers or manufacturers who have been of negligence, or carelessness only, and those who are opposed to such drastic penalties being inflicted. I have framed this motion in order that the division-list may show who are fighting the battle of the producers, and who are opposing their interests. Minister will agree to the motion, and thus afford honourable members a further opportunity of reconsidering clause 10, and the the words "" the title and clause 1 "" after the word disastrous effect it is likely to have upon the producing interests. member justified in directing attention to the under false representations, and therefore fact that the producers of Australia the title of the Bill should be "" A Bill to will probably be subjected to very prevent the exportation or importation of serious loss.

It is certainly desirable that a clear-cut issue should be submitted to the House, so that the producers of the country may be able to distinguish AVhen the producers in the their friends from their foes. I think that the commercial community have a distinct grievance against the Minister of Trade and Customs, owing to his failure to carry out his promise that the scope of the Bill would be restricted to foodstuffs and patent medicines. The Minister yielded all too readily to the pressure brought to bear upon him by the Labour Party, and I regret that ht: did not rely upon the members of the Opposition to assist him, and his immediate supporters, to resist that pressure, and to enable him' to keep faith with the commercial community. The assurance given by the Minister misled the public, and lulled them into a state of quiescence. Otherwise a strong agitation would have been raised against the Bill, which is regarded in many quarters as likely to have the most pernicious effects. 1 suppose that it is useless to urge upon the Government and their supporters the claims of the producers to further consideration. Secure in their majority, the Government are apparently prepared to disregard all representations made in that direction. I cannot, however, refrain from pointing out that, in addition to having to overcome the difficulties inseparable from the nature of their occupaguilty, not of fraud, but tion, our producers are to be hemmed in by all sorts of regulations and restrictions, and to be subjected to all kinds of pinpricks. I think that the title of the Bill should be altered. Strictly speaking, it is not a CommerceB ill , but a measure which is likely to restrict trade, and is, therefore, really an anti-commerce B ill .

Clause 1.1 provides for w i l f u l misdescription, and I am satisfied that the House is at one with the Ministry in their desire to prevent anything in that direction. But surelv there is a distinct difference between accidental misdescription or a failure to give any description at all, and a w i l f u l misdescription. Upon further consideration, it seems to me that there is a serious objection to .our insisting that all -goods shall bear a description. I do not suppose that tbe Minister will endeavour to rigidly enforce the provision, but he has, nevertheless, the power to insist on an arbitrary description being applied to goods. We export many foodstuffs or products which have been produced for the purposes of food, and I can quite conceive that there are many lines which, although unsuitable for the purposes of food, have some value as an exportable commoditv.

Honorable members who have not had experience of these questions may think that this is a very trivial matter, but the point is that the result of this interference on the part of the Minister might be serious. I do not think it is necessary to insist upon a description being placed on all goods. Eveni f the Committee adheres to its decision in that respect, we shall go very much beyond tbe necessities of the case if we insist that goods that are accidentally misdescribed or not described at all shall be forfeited. I concur in the proposal made on Wednesday by the honourable and learned member for Corinella that instead of providing that goods which have been accidentally misdescribed or not described at all shall be forfeited when the Minister is satisfied that there has been no intention on the part of the persons concerned to do anything wrong, it would be reasonable to allow him the right to seize them with a view to insisting upon the exporter or importer, as the case may be, placing the prescribed description upon them. There could be no objection to that.

I have already pointed out what should be -done in regard to exports. If the Bill is to be inoperative no harm will be done; but there is always danger that a law which has become a dead letter may some day be applied most unjustly, because of the arbitrary action of a Minister or the intervention of an interested party. I trust that the Minister will give the Committee an opportunity to so amend tjhe clause as to provide that goods which are not marked as prescribed, or are not marked at all, shall be seizable only for the purpose of enabling the exporter or importer to comply with the regulations. If the person concerned persisted in refusing to comply with them, the goods could of course be forfeited, or otherwise dealt with. There is no doubt that if this ,power were vested in the Minister, instant compliance would be made with his demands. I trust the honourable gentleman will consider that ithe opinions that have been put forward by honourable members having experience and knowledge of these matters are sufficiently reasonable to warrant him in attaching some weight to them. If the clause be passed as it stands I shall hesitate to vote for the third reading of the Bill. 10 has an important bearing upon the exporters of primary products, and I think that the honourable and learned member for Wannon is perfectly justified in asking the Minister to reconsider it. Recent events in connection with the export of butter from Victoria have shown that it would be very undesirable to increase the number of exports through agencies, but I hold that the effect of this clause must necessarily be to compel individuals to employ such agents instead -of shipping their own goods. Our object should be to give the primarv producer -every opportunity to obtain as much as he -can for his produce, but this clause will have the opposite effect. It is provided that exports shall be in accordance with regulations to be framed by the Minister acting under the advice of the Comptroller-General; but it will be almost impossible for a farmer, or the directors of a small factory in a remote part of Australia, to become familiar with all these regulations. The result will be that the export business will gravitate to centres where agents who have made 1 law. and the regulations will be prepared to transact the business^ of exporters for a certain reward. In this way the profits of the primary producers will be reduced. Another very important point is that many men in a small way of business who do not fully appreciate the provisions ofl the law, may commit some slight breach of it, with the result that their goods will be seized, and loss occasioned by the consequent delay in shipping them. There should be no delay in placing our products on the market. Those engaged in. the butter industry in Australia are placed at a serious disadvantage in competing with the exporters of Danish butter on the London market, inasmuch as it takes them six weeks, as against one week, to send their shipments to EnglandI t must necessarily follow that considerable delay will occur if the power given to the Minister by clause 10 is exercised. The seizure of goods would probably make them miss the vessel by which it was intended to export them, and the consequence would be that it would take them perhaps eight weeks or more to get to the market. That delay might cause deterioration in the quality of the goods, and would certainly inconvenience the exporter by keeping him out of his money for a longer time. member rhink that there will be more delay than occurs under the Victorian Act? the Bill had been brought forward last se'ssion, the honourable member would have helped us to make things more easy for the primary producer. honest man into gaol. of the Chamber is with the honourable member there.

I ask the Minister, who represents a rural constituency, if he does not know that those who are connected with our primary industries are men who are likely to .be careless in these matters? But are they therefore to be made criminals, and subjected to the severe punishment provided for in the clause? I hope that all country representatives will give the clause their most serious consideration. The honourable member for Cowper has shown that in America and Canada the person who has produce to export, asks intending buyers how they would like to have it described, so that it may, be as acceptable as possible, and may obtain good prices. The same practice has been pursued to some extent in connection with the export, of Victorian produce. I know that some of our factories send away their butter unsalted, while dthters export salted bu'tjrer. Under tKe Bill, however, the export of unsalted butter might be prohibited, although such butter obtains the best prices in the London market. against grading, but I wish to point out that, interests of the primary producers? notwithstanding the grading done here, produce is re-graded when it gets to London.

I suppose that there is not a single member of this Chamber who is not entirely in accord with its main object. only object to "" details."" from these interruptions, because I feel that this is a most important measure, and I wish to divest myself-as do my honourable friends upon this side of the Houseof all responsibility in connection with its objectionable features. In doing that, we wish to make our position perfectly clear. We are just as heartily in accord with the Government as any honourable member upon the other side of the House can be in regard to the main objects of this measure. Those objects are the discouragement and suppression of fraudulent practices in connection with articles which pass info human consumption in the shape of food, or which have so much to do with the health -or . perhaps, fhe death-of the people, under the heading of ""drugs,"" and with other matters of great importance. Take the item of manures, or that of seeds and plants. These are excellent items, I think, to include in this measure. Articles of food, articles which are considered to be medicinal, and others which relate to the primary industries-suc h as manures, seeds, and plants-ma y well come within the scope of a Bill of this character. But if such articles as apparel and boots and shoes are to be included in it, I cannot understand why its provisions bave not been extended to a number of other articles of far more importance, when viewed from the stand-point of fraudulent practices. I noticed the source from which the proposal to which I refer emanated. It came from the honourable member for Yarra, and, of course, we cannot help seeing-o r at least suspecting-wha t is his object. thinking all the time, not of Australia, but of certain industries which have their chief home in Victoria. Victoria-greatl y to her credit-ha s established a very large trade in the manufacture of apparel and of boots and shoes. These industries are amongst the leading industries of this State, and therefore we find that the honourable member for Yarra is desirous of including them in the schedule of this Bill. Tn order to do what? Not to apply the same law to boots and shoes and apparel manufactured in Australia as will be applied to imported goods, but in order to handicap the importation of these articles from bther_ parts of the world-fro m ""the mother country and elsewhere. I do not object to any provision which will punish fraud; but I"" think that the Minister has placed himself in a very false position in regard to that proposal, as, indeed, he has throughout the entire consideration of tlie Bill. What honourable member opposite can rise and say one word in favour of the Minister's action in reference to this measure? Is there a single honourable member who does not recognise that when the honourable gentleman submitted it he had not the remotest idea of the nature of its provisions? Could any Government be humiliated more than the present Administration have been by reason of the disclosure that more than two Ministers have held most diverse views in regard to the meaning of the Bill? I do not believe that Ministers have yet cleared up their differences in this connection. When the Government submit to Parliament a Bill affecting the trade interests of thousands of people,' 'surely the least ye can expect is that they shall have studied its provisions, and understand what they mean! A fiction prevails in some quarters that Ministers are acquainted with the details of the measures which they introduce. But who can cherish such a fond delusion in the light of our experience in connection with this Bill? Did we not have the Minister of Trade and Customs and the Attorney-General betraying a hopeless conflict of opinion as to what was the nature of its provisions? The least that the Government might have done was to carefully consider it before submitting it to the House. Instead, they have conclusively shown either that they did not consider it at all, or that, they considered it from so many points of view that we could get nothing like a harmonious expression of He is the true meaning of its provisions.

It is in that way that I make the reference. If this Bill set up some standard to which all men alike would be subject-if the question of whether they are obeying or breaking the law had to be so decided that every man would be subjected to precisely the same scrutiny, the position would be very different. But there is no attempt to embody in the Bill any principle of procedure which will apply absolutely to all persons alike. Let me refer to clause 10 as an illustration of what I mean. This is the clause to which so much attention has been directed. We find in it a prohibition of trade. That in itself is, in the eyes of an enlightened Legislature, one of the most serious steps that could be taken; but in this case the prohibition applies not merely to trade inwards-jwhic h some of my honourable friends would probably abolish altogether if they could-bu t equally to trade outwards. It applies to the fruits of the industry of our own producers and manufacturers. Surely in that sense this question ought to appeal to my honourable friends opposite. I know that they have just as great a desire as has any one on this side of the House to improve the prospects of our producers. I am sure their desire is not to increase, but to lessen their difficulties, We find not to hamper, but to free their productive energies. Honourable members opposite have, or ought to have, just as keen a desire as we have in that direction; but the Bill proposes to hamper, not only the importer, who is regarded by some as a natural enemy, but also the exporter, to whom members of iall fiscal parties look for the future greatness and prosperity of the Commonwealth. Matters of commerce are to be regulated and decided, not according to the intelligent consideration of the legislators of Australia in two Houses assembled, but in tlie office of the Minister of Trade and Customs, who, in his determinations, will have the assistance of his subordinates. That office is to become the Parliament where all these questions affecting our commerce are to be settled. Was there ever a more lurid light thrown upon the imperfect perception and intelligence of the Minister of Trade and Customs i,n matters of trade and commerce than is afforded by the fact that the honourable gentleman actually proposed to secure the power to legislate in his own office against the producers of Australia? He actually proposed to so buttress himself in his office, that unless both Houses agreed to negative the regulations made under the Bill, they should have all the force of an Act of Parliament. A more monstrous, ignorant proposal in connection with the framing of regulations was never made by a Minister. I ask the House to consider what it means. . The power to legislate and to punish was to be absolutelyhanded over by this Bill to one man, acting behind the back of Parliament, except in tbe ordinary sepse of Ministerial responsibility. That one man sought to so surround himself with powers, as against even this House, that he desired to have the right under the Bill to make regulations which should become the law of tbe land, even if this House unanimously rejected them, unless another place also agreed to their rejection. Was there ever a more monstrous attempt to establish a star chamber-to submit the producers and business people of Australia to the Ministerial thumb-screw.

The goods are specified in a subsequent clause; but this is a very serious power to be exercised on the initiative of the Minister. The power to prohibit this export or that, this article of human trade and industry or that, and this subject of Australian production or that, is to be absolutely vested in the Ministerunless there is applied to them a trade description of such character, relating to such matters, nnd applied in such manner, as is prescribed.

It shows what .administration means according to the particular view of the Minister of Trade and Customs.

I should like to know what position a Minister would occupy who would single out from amongst the agents or producers of Australia certain persons as the objects of his favour? enough to see that if , in one case where there was no trade description, he shut his eyes and raited no objection to the goods being exported, and in another case he decreed that the goods were not properly described, and must be confiscated, he would expose himself to the strongest criticism. often repeated, the scandals which were exposed by the Butter Commission would be as nothing to the scandals at the Customs House. The commissions paid in respect to exportations of butter, serious as they were, and objectionable as they seemed to have been, according to the report of the Butter Commission, were as nothing compared to the* in jury that might be inflicted by the exercise of the power to say to one man, "" You can, with impunity, walk through the Customs House with your unmarked goods and launch them upon the markets of the world "" j and to another man, who might happen to be an opponent in politics, "" We shall stop you. You are a pestilent fellow. You are a MasseyHarris man.

Under the provisions of the Bill, the Minister might seize the crops of all the farmers in the Commonwealth who did not happen know what the Bill meant, or whose agents might have neglected their duty. I do not care how anxious the Minister might be to do wrong.

I hope that I am doing my honourable friend, the member for Barker, no injustice when I say that while he is as keenly anxious as is any Minister or Ministerial supporter to have deception suppressed, he desires to separate the strictly innocent from the guilty, and not to include all the innocent producers of the country in the same category with those sharks who prey upon the public. That was the point of the amendment in clause 10 proposed by the honourable and learned member for Corinella. My honourable You are friend did not seek to paralyze the arm of the law, but wished to provide that, even in the case of the innocent exporter, the goods should be seized until security was given that a proper mark would be attached to them before they were shipped. to The course which the honourable and learned member for Corinella suggested in his amendment was a very much more satisfactory one than that which is provided by sub-clause 3 of clause 10. He was willing to allow goods which had been inaccurately marked to be seized by the Customs authorities, and held until the prescribed trade description had been applied to them. Nothing could be more drastic and effective in the case of an innocent omission than the The Minister admits that proposal of my honourable friend. He was perfectly willing that the Department should have power to seize goods which No .

Sub-clause 2 renders any. goods seized under the circumstances to which I have referred liable to forfeiture, and subclause 3 provides! thatSubject to the regulations the Comptroller General, or on appeal from him the Minister, may, in any case, and if in his opinion the contravention has not occurred either knowingly or negligently There are two elements introduced here. AVe have inserted in the Bill a clause which is intended to establish a certain state of things, but we make that provision subject to certain regulations. In other words, it is within the power of the Minister to frame a regulation entirely opposed to the clause itself. I recognise that it is impossible to provide in the Bill for every case which may arise, and that it is necessary that power should be given to deal with unexpected cases by regulation. But in all my parliamentary experience I have never known a provision such as this to be inserted in any measure. The clause purports to legislate in a certain direction, but makes that legislation subject to the arbitrary whim of the Minister. It is the most extraordinary thing in the world. I admit that it is usual to leave certain matters to be dealt with by regulation, but the regulations must always be consistent with the Act under which they are framed. In subclause 3. however, we lay down the law subject to regulations which may be made by the Minister. In other words, we enact a certain law affecting the rights of individuals with this proviso. ""Subject to regulations."" Under the Bill the Minister can frame a regulation which is absolutely opposed to the deliberate will of Parliament. AVe are, by making Parliament the creature. of the Minister, instead of the Minister being the creature of Parliament, revolutionizing the methods of legislation which are ordinarily adopted. Here is a provision under which the Minister can wipe out our legislation by one stroke of the penSubject to the regulations, the Comptroller General, or on appeal from him the Minister, may in any case, and if in his opinion the contravention has not occurred either knowingly or negligently, shall permit any goods which are liable to be or have been seizedThis is one of the most extraordinary pieces of draftsmanship that I have ever seen. The Minister is compelled to do a certain thing only if he desires to do it. He can say that, in his opinion, the Act has been contravened ""negligently."" If he does that, the word ""shall"" in the provision in question will not apply. drafted by the right honourable member's late colleague, the honourable and learned member tor Corinella. patching a garment which is all holes. One may patch it as much as he likes, but he cannot make it a good garment. The objefct of the amendment was perfectly clear, but when it was tacked on to the subclause it became idle. Under this provision the compulsion is on the Minister, who has the option of thinking one way or the other. What sort of compulsion is that ? General's words which were inserted. in connection with this Bill is that our legislation is enacted ""subject to regulation."" In other words, the will of Parliament exists subject to the will of the Minister to wipe it out. Absolute power is given to the Minister to forfeit goods if he thinks that they have been improperly marked as the result of negligence. In this connection the word "" negligence"" is open to two constructions. What is the first presumption that binds every person in our civil and criminal Courts? I admit that it works badly sometimes, but nevertheless it is an irresistible assumption. That assumption is that everybody knows the law. We cannot set up as a defence the plea that we are ignorant of the law. It would clearly be "" negligence "" -fro m the stand-point of that assumption -no t to apply that proper trade description to goods which the law enacts shall be applied to them. General and the Minister not to insist upon the insertion of the word ""negligently,"" but they both insisted upon its inclusion. sire to retain the word ""knowingly,"" because there is clearly another point involved there; but I cannot understand their insistence upon the retention of the word negligently,"" because ignorance of the law does not excuse a Breach of it.

Then the Minister, with that lofty uprightness which characterises all his actions, would be compelled to say, "" In spite of the fact that you are a friend of mine, I must consider that you are presumed to know the law, and therefore I cannot help you. I am obliged to seize your goods."" But to knowingly commit a breach of the law is quite a different matter. Let us consider for a moment what will happen in this tribunal. Talk about the Arbitration Courts-the y will be friendly gatherings compared with the business which will be thrown upon the Customs Houses throughout Australia, at any rate until this law comes to be understood. orable member intends to vote for the Bill. provisions that I cannot avoid voting for. For example, there are the clauses which relate to punishment for fraudulent and deceptive practices. A man who would not support them would be unworthy of a seat in this House. The cruel position is that the good in the Bill is so obvious that we cannot associate our names with its rejection. But we are fighting against the proposal to penalize innocent persons who are not associated with a gang of swindlersinnocent traders and producers. That is the brunt of our attack. I may say at once that we might have to reconsider our vote upon its third reading if the present occasion represented absolutely the final stage in the consideration of the Bill. But I cannot help cherishing the hope that, so far as these innocent persons are concerned, we may ultimately see the measure in a shape which will enable us to give it our full endorsement. If this Parliament consisted of only one House, we might be called upon to seriously consider the advisability of voting against the third reading of the measure. But I hope there is a reasonable prospect that whilst the stringent provisions of the Bill which are applicable to misconduct may be preserved in their entirety, the wisdom of another place may suggest some more considerate treatment of those persons who do not knowingly attempt to defraud and deceive. Of course, I am aware that, in drafting a measure, lawyers very properly endeavour to make its provisions cover as much as possible. This is very evident in clause 15. In ordinary provisions connected with criminal offences, that endeavour may work out all right; but. when it is proposed to make criminals of innocent persons, we must study the language we employ in reference to aiding and abetting. Clause 15 statesWhoever aids, abets, counsels, or procures, or by act or omission is in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in the commission of any offenceThis clause exhibits wonderful draftsmanship. We are getting a rich sort of literature in our statutes now. Surelyi f a thing is done ""knowingly,"" it must be done ""directly."" How can a man ""knowingly"" and ""indirectly"" do a thing?

There are a number of statutes in which that term isused, and this is the first occasion upon which it has been found necessary to employ it in conjunctionwith the words ""directly or indirectly.""

Let us take the case of an innocent man and a guilty one: The guilty man would commit the fraud directly. "" Look here, Smith, I will give; you a fiver to do this for me, in spite of the law;"" or he might go to Brown, a perfectly innocentman, and say, "" I have a shipment of goods to send away and I wish you would look after it for me."" Brown, being perfectly ignorant of this law, might do what he was requested: to do without any intention to defraud. The man who appealed to Smith or Brown would be covered by this provision; because he would knowingly bribe Smith to break the law, or would knowingly make use of the innocent Brown for the same purpose. These words are quite unusual, and I do not think that they make the meaning of the clause any clearer. Where the instrument is consciously guilty of misconduct, it is quite right that he should be just as liable as the principal; but I wish to point out what may be the effect of the use of the woid ""aids."" It will certainly catch innocent persons. Suppose that there is a consignment of butter made upon a particular farm in Victoria, that it is going to be shipped, and that there is a regulation, which requires that the butter, or the cases which contain it, shall bear a certain description or brand. further that neither the farmer nor his hands, nor the officers of the Railway Department employed in carrying the produce to Melbourne, are aware of these regulations. Nevertheless, if the description were not applied, all these persons would be aiding the commission of an offence against the Bill. The person who took the butter from the farm to the railwav station, the men who looked after it whilst it was beincr brought to town by train, and those who removed it in carts from the railway depot to the wharf, would all be aiding in the carrying out of an offence against this measure, although they were perfectly innocent, and/ ought not to be subjected to punishment, as if they had wilfully committed the offence. It could not be said that they were "" directly or indirectly knowingly "" concerned in the commission, of that offence. If those words had to be read in conjunction with the word "" aids,"" the objection would' be removed ; but they are disjoined one from the other. If the clause simply provided that any person who knowingly committed an offence against the Bill should be liable to punishment, there could be no objection to it, but it declares thatHe would say, perhaps, Whoever aids, abets, counsels, or procures, or by act or omission is in any way directly or indirectly knowingly concerned1 in the commission of an offence, shall be punished. The word "" or "" in each case separates, instead of couples, the antecedents. The effect of the whole of these provisions is such that if the Government had paid a little more attention to the suggestions that have been made with regard to this part of the Bill, an amendment would have been agreed to. I am glad to see that the honourable member for Bass sees, on mature reflection, that there is something in my point. a "" stone-wall."" with the "" etone-walls "" I have seen, this is only an elegant picket fence. I have said all that I desire to put before lhe House in regard to this Bill, and do not wish to delay the third reading.

The deputation was disarmed by the promise that he gave. that every commercial centre in the Commonwealth should be apprised by telegraph of the reply which the honourable gentleman had given, my desire being that he should be placed in a proper light before the members of the different Chambers. But instead of offering any resistance to the amendment to which I have referred, the Minister practically accepted it. been lulled into a false sense of security by his promise, they might have taken more decisive action. so rational that I think it ought to be placed on record. Thev said in the first place that if such .1 measure were considered necessary, to be consistent its provisions should apply not only to imports and exports, but to Inter-State trade. But the Government have not endeavoured to make the Bill apply as far as possible to both internal and external trade, nor have Mr Knox. they recognised that' it was drafted in the absence of commercial experience; but they have obstinately and pertinaciously adThe hered to practically every line of it. The second point made by the Chambers was that they were satisfied from their experience that it would be impossible for all the details enumerated in paragraphs a to / of clause 3 to be supplied. Unfortunately, These practical men, although they do not possess the legal knowledge of the right honourable member for East Sydney, conWe are propossidered the effect of every line of the Bill, and saw the practical difficulties which he has pointed out. They impressed upon the Minister the need for inserting some qualification in clause 3. They asked that the trade requirements of . other countries On behalf of the should not be interfered with. They desired special consideration for the Eastern trade, not so that fraud might be perpeIn created by the marking of goods in a manner which might give offence to foreign buyers. Under the Bill as it stands, every article of export, whether intended for the markets of the East or for the markets of the West, may be subjected to the criticism of an official of the Customs DepartThe honourable ment, who may exercise his power in such a way as to bring the trade and commerceof the Commonwealth into disrepute. It is true that these merchants made the representations to which I referred at the instigation of business necessity, but in endeavouring to increase their own business they are incidentally swelling the trade of I took care the country. At the same time, they wished to assist in the achievement of the good objects underlying the Bill. They recommended that reasonable notice should be given of any change in the law, and asked that a period of not less than six months be fixed. The necessity for such notice was strongly impressed on the Minister. The difficulty of apprising foreign, agents and buyers in other parts of the Had not the Chambers of Commerce world of the effect of regulations issued by the Customs Department here was pointed out to him, and he was made acquainted Their request was with the delays which would occur because of the long passages made by sailing vessels, and for other -reasons. Consequently he somewhat reluctantly agreed that not less than three months' notice should be given, though he expressed the view in this Chamber that such notice was unnecessary. The deputation had consulted the Attorney-General as to whether the Bill provided for the grading of exports, and that honourable and learned gentleman distinctly declared that that was not its intention. But there is now as vague an understanding of the meaning of the clause which deals with grading and standardization as there was when the Bill was introduced, and even the Minister of Trade and Customs would find it difficult to state definitely what its meaning is. He was asked by the deputation if the Government intended to fix standards, and his reply wasI do not think that would be done. That would commerce must be regulated by a restrictive be grading. I do not think it is intended to grade 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. A member of the deputation objected to the use of the word "" inferior,"" on the ground that manufacturers would not desire to have their goods marked "" inferior."" To that objection the Minister replied, "" I would not care what the manufacturer desired. If his goods were inferior, I would have them marked ' inferior.' "" forget that there is a legitimate market for goods which are not of the highest standard, but it would be against all trade usage and custom, and would probably prevent business from being done, if ""inferior "" were marked across any goods exported from Australia. fairly explained to the deputation his position in 'regard to the Bill, and its members left under the impression that consideration would be given to reasonable suggestions for amendment. We did not expect that there would be the obstinate resistance to amendments and the determined retention of clauses which, if not amended, might have disastrous effects on 'the commerce of the country, which we have seen. It is true that some of the powers given in the Bill may not be exercised, and if it is not intended to exercise them they should not have been asked for. portations and exportations is a reasonable thing, and I am glad that the word ""may"" was substituted for the word ""shall"" in clause 10. Buti f the powers given by the Bill are rigidly enforced, great mischief may be done, and a great number of experts will have to be employed. The Minister has promised that he will not object to the consideration of an amendment for the changing of the title of the measure when the Bill is before another place. I think that we cannot object too strongly to the placarding of a measure of this kind as the "" Commerce Bill"" of Australia. The underlying purpose of the measure is a good one, and we are all ready to support the Government in trying to prevent fraud in connection with both importation and exportation ; but to call a restrictve measure of this kind the ""CommerceB ill "" of Australia is to tell our customers in the TJnited Kingdom, the United States of America, Germany, Canada, South America, China, Japan, and other places that our producers and exporters are so unprincipled that our measure for the protection of those who purchase our goods. slander on the country. foreigners in the way I have mentioned. Let us indicate in tKe title the real purpose of the Bill. Let us call it a Bill to prevent fraudulent importation and exportation. The honourable gentleman seems to I hope that this measure will be very seriously considered in another place, and that provision will be made for its reasonable application. If it be allowed to pass in its present form, it will stand befoie the world as an indication that we are a corrupt people, that our transactions The Minister are fraudulent, and that it is necessary to impose the severest restrictions and penalties in order fo insure honest dealing. Surely such a measure must do untold harm to the Commonwealth. On behalf of the commercial community of Australia. I enter the most emphatic protest against the Bill being placed on the statute-book. I regret that the Minister has not seen his wa,y to accept' the suggestions made by honourable members on this side of the Chamber, who have been free from anv desire to defeat the object of the Bill. Dissatisfaction exists throughout the Commonwealth at the manner in whicK'the BillA humane oversight of our imhas been dealt with. If its provisions are applied in the manner which appears to be contemplated by the Minister, such an outcry will be raised that the Ministry will be swept out of existence. sire to follow the example of other honourable members of the Opposition, and record once more my protest against the principle which. underlies the Bill.

126,Mr Bruce Smith (Parkes),"I dethe honourable member for Kooyong, who, as the representative of every Chamber of Commerce rn Australia, has perhaps made the most vehement speech that he has ever delivered in this House. I do not remember any previous occasion upon which the honourable member has failed to exercise that spirit of restraint which he genertoms, but would also have taken precautions ally allows to influence him. The futility of the criticisms passed upon the Bill by honourable members on this side of the House is indicated by the fact that the Minister who is in charge of the measure either dozed, or appeared to cloze, during the delivery of the speech of the honourable member for Kooyong. same speech about twenty times. seems to have reached such a condition that it may be said of him that he is impervious to ideas. But let me assure him that this Bill will bring far more curses than blessings on his head. Minister may have become inured to that kind of thing, but I am sure that he will live to regretthat his name was ever associated with such a measure. I am not taking this opportunity to address the House in the spirit of an obstructionist. I do not approve altogether of the methods adopted in Australian Parliaments by members sitting in Opposition. I think that they cry "" wolf "" too often, and that consetries. But all men of the world who have quently when the wolf comes it is difficult, if not impossible, to convince people that he is present. I do not approve of the practice of going on day after day and week after week obstructing every proposal that is introduced by honourable members on the opposite side of the House. have seen that course followed in this House. But the whole of the opposition offered to this Bill has been thoroughly jusgested that, in order to deal with some' tified by the amendments which have been made. From the moment that the Bill was introduced, it was clear that it was a patchwork measure, which affected to be aimed at the morality of the commerce of this country. It does not, however, touch the morality, of commerce. In the first place, in attempting to deal with imports it affects to watch over the character of the materials brought into this country, and to see that they are properly described, but with what result? The honourable member for Darling showed us a number of samples of materials called leather, which were, however, composed entirely of paper. I have pointed out more than once that if the Minister had been anxious to guard the moral conduct of the commercial and industrial classes of this country, he would not have been satisfied to insure that a particular fraudulent manufacture should be properly described when it passed the Cusagainst its fraudulent use by the manufacturers of Australia. Under the Bill, a substitute for leather may be passed through the Customs under the description of brown paper. It may be transferred direct from the wharf to the stores of a boot manufacturer, and without impediment of any kind, be used in turning out I have heard the children's boots. Therefore, the fraud upon our own people will be worse in its last than in its first stage, because the material will bear the stamp of approval of our Customs officers. If the object be to secure a higher standard of commercial and industrial morality, the Minister should have exhausted every practicable means of securThe ing that end. It will be useless to guard against the dishonesty of the importer, unless we at the same time check dishonesty on the part of our manufacturers. The Minister would have effected the high moral purpose he has in view if he had introduced a Bill providing against the use of improper material for manufacturing purposes. We are all anxious to introduce a high standard of morality into our indusmixed in the business affairs of life, know very well that there is a limit to the practicability of any attempts that may be made'to force manufacturers and others to be honest. In order to make a small effort towards the attainment of an impossible I ideal, we are instituting a state of affairs which must end in paralyzing the business of the Commonwealth. It has been sugclasses of manufactures which appear to urgently call for condemnation, the measure should have operated in regard to goods passing between the States, as well as to those being imported into and exported from the Commonwealth. But, I venture to say that if that circumlocutory method of. disgusting the people with the Bill had been followed up, there would have been such a hue and cry throughout Australia as would have driven the Ministry out of public life. The fact that the honourable member for Kooyong, who represents the interests of the commercial",34,William Lyne N O T In Reference Sir Williamlyne I Said That I Would

128,Mr Bruce Smith,"The Ministercommunity of Australia, has introduced more vehemence into his condemnation of this Bill than he has ever before been known to impart to his utterances, should have ' given the Minister pause and induced him to conclude that he was making tempting to force this Bill through the House. It is a notable fact that amongst the members of the Government there is not one who can be said to have had any extended commercial experience. The reputations of Ministers are good, and their characters are honourable, but not one of them has gone through the fire of practical experience in such a way as to impress upon him the difficulties and complexities of commercial life. seem to think that the commercial work of a great country like this is carried on acgovernment, be supervized by the Customs cording to elementary rules; but a very short experience of the difficulties, complexities, and sinuosities of trade would have shown them that the application of regulations, such as are contemplated under (he Bill would bring about a state of chaos. Why was the Bill introduced at this particular time? It is true that when Ministers took office they found a Bill which happened to have been prepared, not by the late Government, but for them; but there was no obligation on their part to take up that measure. The Bill has had an improper title applied to it. It does not deal Bill is intended to prevent? What is the with the commerce of this country, but with only one or two features of it. If the measure had been introduced in some other form, and had been less ambitious in its objects, it might have been possible to deal with a number of important matters in a very much more satisfactory and much less injurious manner. When the Bill was introduced, I pointed out that it contained features which I should be very glad to support; but I also directed attention to the fact that it dealt only in part with the particular commodities which it affected to control. I pointed outalso that the control of the Customs authorities over imports would cease immediately they were allowed to pass into the Commonwealth. If the Minister will only pay proper regard to the criticism offered by the honourable member for Kooyong, he will hesitate^ before he allows the Bill to pass from this House in its present form and as a matured measure. Let me again point out what I suppose every man of business recognises, namely, that the consumer is being almost entirely lost sight of in this Bill. Once or twice I have been twitted with thinking too much of the interests of the consumer, and some time ago I had the pleasure of quoting the extraordinary a huge mistake in atdoctrine which was laid down in the Age newspaper, that the whole principle of protection implied that we should look after the producer, and that the consumer would look after himself. I maintain that the consumers are the people, and that it is the duty of every free-trade representative in this House to look after their interests. I submit that in this measure the interests of the consumer are practically ignored. He has a sort of false security given to Ministers him, because he is assured that all importations will, in the interests of good authorities. But whilst the Bill provides that all imports shall be true to their trade description, no attempt has been made to prevent the people of Australia from manufacturing fraudulent goods in our midst to the detriment of the consumers. In the Custom's Act we exercise a good deal of supervision over the manufacture of a number of articles which come under the heading of ""narcotics and stimulants."" What is to prevent us from responding to the invitation to supervize the manufacture of goods, tbe importation of which this use of keeping out of Australia boots made of paper, if similar articles can be manufactured here? The same remark is applicable to patent medicines. Where is the utility of excluding fraudulent goods of any kind if we permit them to be made within the Commonwealth? Consequently, I claim that this is a patchwork measure, which the. Minister will live to regret having passed. Much as I admire his administrative powers, I say that in allowing the impressive speech of the honourable member for Kooyong-wh o spoke as the figurehead of the commercial community-to pass unheeded, the Minister is not doing himself justice. I repeat that he will live to regret the introduction of this Bill. itself suffices to justify my opposition to this Bill, namely, the absolute power which it is proposed to place in the hands of the Minister. I suppose that we should have to go back in history at least 200 years to find a parallel to the present position. So",35,William Lyne N O T In Reference Sir Williamlyne I Said That I Would
129,Mr Conroy (Werriwa),"On e fact infar as English history is concerned, our efforts for many years have been directed towards lessening the power that is reposed in the Sovereign. The whole struggle has been to bring even the King himself under the control of the law. After many years that end has been achieved. Now, however, it is proposed to substitute a new form of despotism for parliamentary authority. In the old days there was some excuse for a despotism, in that it was always supposed to be used in a beneficent manner, and in accordance with the wishes of the great bulk of the people. As the masses at that time were unable to read or write, they were to a certain extent safeharsh that men have set themselves guarded by such a form of government. But in this Bill-despite the advance of civilization-an attempt is being made to make the Minister in his Department practically autocratic. Under its provisions, the liquor law passed in New York to despite any injury which may be inflicted upon the producer or consumer, his decision cannot be challenged. It is not open to review. No matter how harshly he may administer the law, he has merely to say, ""Such and such is.my opinion,"" and there the matter ends. Some time ago, when certain measures relating to lands and mining were before the New South Wales Parliament, I took the opportunity of drawing attention to the fact that extraordinary powers were being vested in the Minister for the time being-powers that would inevitably lead to corruption. Nobody who is familiar with the history of that State can doubt that my prediction has been verified. Had the Minister's decisions there been subject to review in a Court of law, the scandals which have occurred in the Lands Department would have been avoided. The great bulk of honourable members opposite do not appear to grasp that fact. to assume that the Minister in charge of the Customs Department will always be immaculate and absolutely unapproachable. To my mind it is perfectly clear that men will have peace, and if they cannot secure it in any other way they will pay for it. Consequently, under this Bill we shall produce a deterioration in the standard of men who will administer the law. I think we should provide that if the Minister gives a questionable decision, that decision should be subject to review in a Court of law. What is likely to happen if we vest in the Customs inspectors for the time being the extreme power to grade Mr Conroy. all goods that are imported or exported? Undoubtedly the man who is prepared to pay those officers for shutting their eyes to irregularities will be able to get his goods through, whilst the individual who refuses to indulge in such reprehensible practices will not. Consequently we shall be offering a premium to dishonesty throughout our commercial world. No better illustration of the truth of my contention could be obtained than that which is forthcoming from"" America, where time after time-whole departments have been corrupted. The administration of the law there has been occasionally so to work to obtain relief, and being unable to secure ft at the hands of Congress, have sought it through corrlupt channels. Who would have thoiurht that minimize the evils arising from the excessive use of strong drink would have been so administered as to render it impossible for an honest publican to carry on busi-' ness ? But the fact remains that its provisions were so stringent-that so much power was placed in the hands of the police-that honest men had to go out of the business. Their places were taken by others who were ready to give bribes, with the result that their houses remained open day and night. As a matter of fact, in no other citv in the world are life and property less secure thap they are in New York. This is due to the demoralization of the police. Such is the stringency of some of the laws in operation there, that many honest men have been driven out of trades to which they apply, and their places have been taken by others prepared to secure relief by means of bribes. This, in turn, has caused men, determined to live by blackIt is unreasonable mail, to join the police force. In our attempts to enforce a high standard of -purity, we may bring about a similar state of affairs. We sh?U place in the hands of the inspectors for the time being under this Bill such immense powers to restrict trade and commerce that men who are determined to carry on their business, despite this law, will be perpared to pay for the privilege of doing so It is stated that in some of the departments at the present time certain prices have to be paid. I do not mean to suggest that there is open corruption in connection with them, but it is said that attempts are made to soothe and allay the prejudices of officers, and to induce them not to attend to their duty as well as they might do. And yet we now propose to absolutely place the Minister outside the law. That is one of the strongest objections that could be urged to tlie Bill. If the Minister chooses, he may frame such stringent regulations that practically the whole of our trade for the time being will be blocked. I ask the House to think for a moment of the injury that may be done to our producers by means of such, a system before' the law can be amended. We have pointed out these dangers; but honourable members opposite, in blindly following the Government wherever they may choose to lead them, are opening the door to new frauds. I strongly resent the extreme power that is given to the Minister, and have no hesitation in saying that the result will be injurious to the bulk of the producers of Australia. We are even trying to, regulate the sense of taste of those who wish to buy our products on the other side of the world. It seems useless to make any further protest, but I . for one, am certain that, unless there is a failure to administer the Bill as it mav be administered, the difficulties and dangers arising from it will be found not to have been unduly exaggerated by the Opposition. tiently awaited an opportunity to s;peak to this motion. Representing as I do a community whose prosperity practically depends on its export trade, and the safeguarding of the interests of the consumers of its products, I do not intend to allow this Bill to pass without entering an emphatic protest against it. For my own part, I believe that while it does not go far enough in one direction, it goes altogether too far in another. It places too much power 'in the hands of the Minister. promised that the Bill tain a provision which would to a certain extent prevent unfair competition between the various States, but that promise has not been fulfilled. As an illustration of the unfair competition to which I , refer, let me point to the present position of the wine industry.' The winegrowers of South Australia, by ' adulterating their wine for sale in their own State with sugar, are able to sell, by means of the may, nevertheless, be consumed in our own profit thus made, unadulterated wine in the neighbouring States, at a price below that at which the local vignerons can supply it. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent that practice. So far as I can see, its only effect will be to hamper the exporter and give no relief whatever to the importer. We were also promised that it would prevent the introduction of deleterious compounds and patent medicines harmful to the health of the community. The Minister will find, however, that the Bill is practically unworkable. If it is to be so administered as to prevent the importation of deleterious goods, an army of experts will be required. The only satisfactory way to achieve the object I have mentioned is to institute a system of Federal quarantine and to establish a Commonwealth Department of Public Health. I think that time will prove that this is but another example of the evils of party government. The Bill has been forced through the House by a Government which has not a majority of direct supporters, but is kept in office by a party, the members of which have shown by their silence that they do not approve of some, at least, of its provisions. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). I do not wish to detain the House by joining in useless opposition to the passing of the Bill. I supported its second reading because I believed, as I still believe, that it contained a principle that we might very well adopt. But, as I said on a former occasion, it places in the hands of the Minister powers which are fraught with the greatest danger. The Opposition have failed to induce a somewhat stubborn Minister to adopt any amendment designed to make it a workable measure. On the contrary, the Bill has been made even more drastic than it was when introduced. If I were influenced by purely party considerations, I should be pleased to see it carried, because there can be no We were doubt that it will raise such a hornet's would connest about the ears of tbe Ministry that it will bring them' to the ground. No measure yet passed by this House is calculated ro produce so much irritation as this will do if it be strictly administered. The Minister has either to stultify himself by allowing the great powers vested in him bSv the Bill to remain inoperative, or else to enforce those powers, and so prevent people from exporting certain commodities, which country. So many difficulties will arise from the exercise of the powers vested in the Minister that I am satisfied that both he and the leader of the Government will regret the day that they submitted the Bill",36,William Lyne N O T In Reference Sir Williamlyne I Said That I Would
130,Mr Liddell (Hunter),"It have pato the House. The cardinal feature in the measure at the outset was one of which we almost wholly approved, but throughout its consideration the Minister has made no response to the appeals of experienced business men, who have pointed out that the Bill, unless it is to be used as an instrument of tyranny, will be practically inoperative. The honourable gentleman has set himself up a*ainst the practical knowledge of t -business men in the House, who have no other interest in the matter than a desire to insure the well-being of the commercial community. Although he has teen asked again and again to say whether there has been any demand for this Bill, we have not been able to ascertain whence the -request It is only right that the public should be protected from the importation of deleterious commodities; but the Bill goes far bevond that. fashion, to protect the consumers of Australian produce in other parts of the world, and may thus do great harm to our commerce. I venture to predict that many of the provisions of the measure will prove inoperative, and will not be put into force, or, if they are put in force, the Minister will wish that he had never caused their enactment. We, on this side of the House have been -challenged over and over again to give a .reason for the .passing of the Bill. Honourable members opposite speak as though Australian produce has no reputation to maintain. The purpose of the measure, I take it, is to keep watch and ward over the reputation of our goods, and to prevent fraud in connection with either importation or exportation. That statement, I think, answers the whole of the objections to the measure. Sydney) I wish to remind the Minister publicly of an omission of which I reminded him privately. As the Bill stands, a trade description includes a Customs entry. As honourable members know, the regulations may require that a particular trade description shall give particulars in regard to a great variety of subjects. Every ingredient in a complex article may have to be named, together with its place of manufacture, and many other things. While it may be perfectly right to demand the statement of such information on a label or invoice, it would be manifestly unjust and cumbrous to require it to be repeated on a Customs entry. I understand from the Minister, however, that in another place he will have carried out his promise that the statement of this information on the Customs entry shall not be required unless that entry is the only trade description. not repeat the objections which have already been urged against the Bill. It is another instance of legislation for the accomplishment by indirect methods of what should be attempted by direct methods, and tht-. result is that powers are given to deal with for its 'introduction came. major offences which may be applied to minor offences. Another objection to the Bill is that a farmer or producer, reading its provisions, will not gain from them a It seeks, in a ridiculous knowledge of the requirements of the law. In my opinion, the measure should have dealt directly with deleterious and improper imjportations and exportations, and should have been so framed that those whom it is likely to concern could, by reading it, ascertain exactly what they must do. and what they must avoid doing. I trust, however, that improvements will yet lae effected in it, and that when it becomes law it will be a much better measure than it is now. enter my protest against the Bill. I think that no measure of equal importance has ever been forced through an Australian Parliament in the way in which this measure has been forced through this House. Men who possess practical experience in connection with exportation have shown conclusively that it will be impossible to put into operation some of the clauses of the Bill without absolutely stifling Australian industries. So that, as the honourable member for South Sydney has pointed out, a great part of the measure must remain a dead-letter, or, if applied, will do such damaae that the next Parliament will find it necessary to amend it. Although the discussion of its provisions have occupied some time, that time could not have been better occupied. The measure, as originally introduced, was a very crude one. and Ministers showed that they possessed no knowledge as to what would be the practical result of the operation of its main clauses. The effect of the debates which have taken place, however, has been to secure the passing of amendments which have greatly",38,William Lyne N O T In Reference Sir Williamlyne I Said That I Would
