0,"Not The Treasurer Now Consider That, Hav","ing regard to the disaster that has overtaken the depositors in that hank, it is more than ever apparent that central bunking under the control of political nominees is fraught with danger to the community and to sound finance? that that inference can he drawn from the present position of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. It cannot be contended that the disaster that has overtaken that institution is attributable to the form of government, control to which the honourable member has referred. As a matter of fact, the suggestion has been made by all earnest persons who are looking for a solution of the problem that an amalgamation should take place between the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales and the Commonwealth Bank, and the latter bank is controlled by a board of directors appointed by the Government. NAVA L DEFENCE. lian Navy is registered ' under the Washington Treaty as a part of the naval defence forces of the Empire, and as the League of Nations has been, apparently, unable to prevent an outbreak of hostilities between two of its members, namely China and Japan, which connotes the advisability of strong naval defence on the part of all nations, can the Prime Minister give an assurance to the people of Australia, and also to the British Admiralty, that no further reductions will be made in the personnel of the Royal Australian Navy whereby its efficiency would be further impaired? such a matter should be made the subject of question and answer in the House -The urgency of this matter, which I The Government's policy in regard to the various departments, including the Defence Department, is well known, and it is not proposed to vary that policy.

Customs( Mr Forde) state whether it is afact, as reported in the press, that the French Government has imposed a duty of £4 a ton on Australian rice entering New Caledonia; and if so, is this impost, a retaliatory duty in reply to the heavy duties which Australia has imposed on French products entering this country? had no official advice that the French Government has imposed a high duty ou Australian rice entering New Caledonia. As a matter of fact, until quite recently Australia was unable to produce sufficient rice to meet her own requirements, and even now her export of rice is negligible. I know that at the wool sales in Sydney yesterday, French representatives were very active buyers, and I am glad of it. the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House this morning for the purpose of discussing o definite matter of urgent public imporfauce, namely, "" The necessity to use silver currency to assist in Australia's financial recovery."" Five honourable members having risen in their -places, Question proposedhave brought before the House on many other occasions, has impressed me with the need for moving the adjournment of the House in order that it may be discussed.

9,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [11.35].,"the price of silver at Is. Cd. an oz., a f ront of 2GG per cent, could still be made, n 191.4, just after the outbreak of war, Mr W. L. Baillieu, after several conferences of the silver interests of Australia, offered Mr Fisher, the then Prime Minister, the entire silver, lead and zinc out£1,000,000 worth of silver would mini put of the mines at the English selling price prior to the war, les3 30 per cent. Had Andrew Fisher been wise enough to accept that offer, Australia would have made a profit of over £200,000,000 which, as Mr Baillieu has pointed out, might have prevented the present economic depression. During the trouble on the coal-fields of Newcastle, when there was great distress among the miners, it occurred to me that, by using silver as currency, the Government would be able to make sufficient profit to render to the miners the assistance they needed. At that time certain promises were made to the miners which, unfortunately, could not be kept, although they, out of their small savings, contributed £1,000 towards carrying on the political fight which returned the preappreciation of my suggestion; they have sent Labour Government with the biggest majority enjoyeda by any party since federation. Those miners are suffering still. At that time silver was at the lowest price in the history of the world, namely Is. an oz. As honourable members may be aware, every ounce of silver will coin into 5s. 6d. worth of currency. What business man in Australia would refuse to embark upon an enterprise which would return him a profit of 450 per cent.? Yet that is what the Government could have made out of minting silver when its price was Is. an oz. Although it was unanimously decided at the caucus meeting to adopt my proposal, the matter was left, at my suggestion, to the consideration of the Government, and the Government, apparently, has been considering it ever since. I do not wish the price of silver to remain always at a low level; but the Government should seize the present opportunity before it passes. I have communicated Premiers of all the States of Australia regarding this matter, and have received from them favorable replies. calculations were based upon a selling price for silver of Is. an oz., and, Dr. Maloney. although it is dearer now, I am certain that the mining interests would be glad to accept from the Government less than the market price, seeing thai they would be saved freight and insurance charges, &c. At Is. an ox... into £5,500,000 worth of currency. Neve in the history of Australia has a worker, man or woman, refused to accept wagef in silver. My suggestion was that th< new silver currency should be lent tt the various State governments at 2 pei cent., in order to provide employment This would be equivalent to a return of 11 per cent, to the Commonwealth Government, and the State governments, iiturn, would lend the money to municipal! ties, shires and boroughs, which would furnish the actual employment. Sir James Mitchell, Premier of Western Australia, is by no means a Labour sup porter, but he is a keen financier, and he informed me that he would be verj pleased to borrow money at 2 per cent, in order to relieve unemployment. AH the other Premiers have expressed theii not promised anything, but the Premiei of New South Wales stated definitely that, if his Government had the power of minting-of which it has been deprived-l u would commence minting silver immediately. Just imagine what the currency minted from £1,000,000 worth of silvei would have meant to the Governmeni Savings Bank-that institution which, \h my opinion, should never have beei' allowed to close its doors! The bank would have had £5,500,000 in coin to pa\ away to its depositors, who, I am certain, would not have refused to take silver. And why ? Because, after gold, which is recognized throughout the world as the mosi acceptable form of currency, silver comet next. If it were possible suddenly to remove either all the gold currency or all the silver currency from the world, much less distress would be caused by removing the gold currency. Only Great Britain. Ireland, Canada, South Africa, Nev. Zealand, and Australia base their currency on gold. Every European nation, with the every Eastern nation, as well as the United States of America, base their currency on silver. When the money powerf My of the world enthroned the gold standard, they sentenced every third man, woman -and child in the world to poverty and misery. I am including in my reckoning tbe massed millions of the East, in China, India, Japan, and the Straits Settlements. New South Wales is justly described as the silver State of the Commonwealth, but a great many of her miners are now out of work. According to the Year-Book, out of 5,589 miners, 56 per cent, were unemployed in 1930. In 1920 the English people were beginning to doubt the value of their fiduciary currency, which had reached the total of £300,000,000. Silver at that time was at the highest price it has ever been; it paid to melt down silver coins for their What would the minting of four shillings metal content. I have here a silver halfcrown minted in 1920, but only 500 parts out of 1,000 are pure silver, and I have here an Australian coin, of which 925 parts out of 1,000 parts are pure silver. England reduced the silver content of her coins until it fell below what it had been at any time since the reign of Edward the Confessor, with the exception of the 37th year of the reign of Henry VIII . Whereas £1,000,000 worth of silver at Is. an oz. will mint into £5,500,000 worth of currency in Australia to-day, it would mint £9,175,000 worth in England, according to the silver content of English coins. The average cost of minting should not be added to the overhead charges of issuing silver currency. The overhead charge of minting goes on whether the mint is working at full speed or not. Therefore, minting charges should be reckoned only as the difference between the ordinary overhead charges, and the actual cost of minting when the institution is in full swing. The profits which would be derived from the coining of silver could also be employed for assisting distressed farmers. An appeal was made to the -farmers, not only by the Government and its supporters, but by honourable members from all parts of the House, to grow more wheat. In that way this country was to be helped out of its difficulties. That slogan was broadcast throughout the length and breadth of Australia and the farmers nobly answered the call. vernment, in an endeavour to honour its promises, sent the Wheat Marketing Bill to another place, which promptly rejected it. I maintain that the Government should not have stopped at that; it should have taken this House into its confidence, and said definitely that it would help the farmers, despite the opposition in another place. I have with me an attache case full of letters and newspaper cuttings sent to me from all over Australia by farmers and students of finance, &c, supporting my plan, and these are only a part of what I have received. The Government could have assisted them by giving them 4s. in silver for every bushel of wheat that they produced. No farmer would have refused that form Of payment. cost the Government? If Is. worth of silver would make 5s. 6d. worth of silver coin, the actual cost to the Government of four silver shillings would be less than 9d. The wheat could have been sent to England and sold at 2s. a bushel, leaving this Government with a profit of Is. 3d. a bushel. Had 100,000,000 bushels of wheat been sold at 2s. a bushel, the Government would have received £10,000,000, plus £3,000,000 in exchange; or a total of £13,000,000. That would have been a very useful sum to this Government. In answer to a question by the honourable member for Barton( Mr Tully) the other day, the Treasurer stated that it now costs £167 to send £100 to the United States of America. The £13,000,000 which the Government would have received from the sale of wheat in England, had it adopted my suggestion, would have realized a profit of £9,000,000. That sum, if sent to the United States of America, would have obviated the tremendous exchange rate, which is to-day crucifying this country. I have shown clearly that the Government, out of the profits of minting silver, could have paid the farmers 4s. for every bushel of wheat produced by them. Had that been done, the Government would have honoured its promise to the primary producers, which I consider has now been broken. I come now to wool. RecentlyI asked the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) what would be a fair average What happened? This Goprice for wool, and he told me that Is. 3d. per lb. would be satisfactory. I said, ""How about Is. 6d. a lb.?"" He replied "" The farmers would bless you or any one else who could guarantee them an average price of Is. Od. per lb."" I do not know of any farmer who would refuse to accept in silver currency Is. 6d. per lb. for his wool. The sum of Is. 6d. in silver coin is equal to 3 3-lld., which is the actual cost to the Government. Therefore, we could have paid the wool producers Is. 6d. per lb. for their wool, and sold it in England at 9d. per lb. and made a profit -of 5d. per lb. Had that been done, all concerned would have been satisfied. me point out that £4,000,000 worth of silver £22,000,000 worth of silver currency. It must be remembered that the chief overhead expenses continue whether the mint is fully or partly occupied, therefore, the cost of minting should be based upon the difference between the overhead cost and the extra cost when the mint is in full swing. Some people say that paper money is cheaper and better, and returns a greater profit. If that is so. why did England in 1920 increase its silver currency? It was because the people there were becoming nervous about the enormous increase in the fiduciary note issue. The more silver we mint the more credit there will be for our note issue. Then suppose that of two men living in different houses, one held £100 in notes, and the other £100 in silver. If both houses were burnt down, the notes would be destroyed and their value lost, but the weight of the silver would remain, and if the owner could prove that he had withdrawn £100 worth of silver from his bank an honest government would be justified in paying him the face value of the coins. Another advantage of silver is that it is the second bust money in the world. At the end of 31*28 New South Wales had produced over £142,116,291 worth of silver. I venture to say that had that State been able to obtain the permission of the Government to mint its silver, and to pay the profits into generally would have been greatly benefited. [Leave to continue given.] The honourable member for Barron ri.i-tnt.ly asked the Treasurer1. is it a fact, on the firist of fhe month (October) a heavy payment, on account of intrrcst on Australian loans floated in New York, fell due? 2. Isi t a fact that we had to [ml t:|> i ' l i i "" sovereign, and making it legal as a curin Australia to pay £100 of interest in New York? Or. Maloney. '-I. Isi t a fact that this hunvy excliang'e cost places a prodi-rious burden upon the taxpayers of Australia V 1 The answer in each instance was in the affirmative. I have to thank the honorahle member for Barton for having asked that question, and I fee! sure that if the press will give his action sufficient publicity he will receive a great deal of kudos at the hands of his conLet stituents and the people generally. Australia is in difficulties, and we must at Is. per oz. will mint endeavour to overcome them. By the remonetization of silver in the direction that I have indicated, we could help the miners of New South Wales, 56 per cerri. of whom are out of work at Broken Hill alone. That would give some impetus to silver mining, although it is only a by-product at the present time. I hope that the Government will take action along the lines that I have indicated, and if it has not the courage to mint additional silver, it should, at any rate, permit the States to do so under government supervision. It is rather singular that honourable members opposite, who pride themselves on being exponents of finance, are not able to enlighten the people of Australia rsn fhe subject of bimetallism, or the advisability of increasing the silver currency. The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) deserves recognition for the pertinacity with which he has put this matter before the people of .Australia -The Government has said that it would he delighted to know of any remedy that would assist in overcoming Australia's difficulties. [Quorum former].] I do nor say that the Govumment, because it has failed to increase the silver currency, has injured the financial stability of Australia. T do not aaree with the honourable member for its Treasury, the community Melbourne that an increased silver currency would be fhe solution of our financial problems. Tliere arc other ways in which we could bring that about with much greater benefit to Australia. All the currency we need can be made of paper, which is much cheaper than silver. There is nothing wrong, if Ave wish to make money plentiful, with putting 5s. or even 2s. 6d. worth of gold into a rency of 20s. sterling.",20,Silver Currency Formal Motion Tor Adjournmkwt

He has a keen understanding of most subjects, but not of bimetallism or trimetallism. I realize that he, too, may have been misled by the honourable member for Melbourne. In Australia a £1 note represents 20s., and it is cheaper to print more notes than, to increase the silver currency. abandon paper currency. Money may be anything. During my business career I have had to handle paper money bearing the signature of private citizens, and it has never failed me. Some of them could hardly write their own names. In many cases the signature could not, be deciphered; yet I have accepted their cheques, and so have the hanks. That form of currency has been in existence for years, and it will serve to meet our future needs. The difficulty with this Government is, not that it has no money, but that it is not making money available. Tens of millions of money is locked up in the vaults of our banks. money into circulation. If a person takes gilt-edged securities to the Commonwealth Bank, and obtains on them overdrafts of £20,000, the moment that sum is transferred to his banking account the money is made available. That man's purchasing power is immediately increased by £20,000 which did not, exist before the transaction took place. Whence did the money come? It is clear that credit, which is purchasing power, is just a book entry. If the Senate would pass the necessary legislation for the reform of the banking system nothing more would be required. Give to the hundreds of thousands of business men and farmers a chance to get advances from The the banks on gilt-edged securities, and we shall need neither silver nor gold* This city of Canberra WHS not built ou£ of an abundance of silver and gold; it was financed by book-entry credits; the* men who worked on the job accepted' cheques for their services. The country requires an extension of credit and the reform of banking so that £3,000,000,000 worth of assets will not be regarded as valueless security for the credits which are essential to the development of Australia. Many men with £20,000 worth of property have not £100 worth of purchasing power, solely because the banking system has destroyed their credit. The Government is not blameworthy for not taking more notice of the advocacy by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) of silver currency. taking notice of the honourable member There is no need to for Adelaide( Mr Yates) ? the honourable member for Adelaide has advocated anything other than the policy of his party, but we have not the power to give effect to that policy.

They are more concerned with protecting the interests of the shareI t should put more paper holders in banks and other financial institutions. They represent interests that are opposed to the true welfare of the country. One reading the conservative newspapers would imagine that the Labour party in this Parliament has no other monetary policy than the printing of notes. That is the result of the propaganda of our newspaper r-nemies, who are trying to make the people believe that we are in favour of inflation. McGrath) -Order!

25,Mr Scullin,"On Wednesday th*>Consideration resumed from the 14th October (vide page 762). That the resolution he adopted. [12.5] I ask the Minister to agree to re-submit the schedule so that stud stock may be removed from paragraph 2 of the schedule, in which the duties are 4 per cent., to paragraph 1, containing the list of exemptions. I desired to have that done on ""Wednesday night, but was ruled out of order. I now propose this alteration on the broad ground that the improvement of our flocks and herds is essential to the development and 2 P *ity of our people. 3r0S ei To a large extent Australia is dependent on stock-breeding. During the present depression, stud masters are at a particular disadvantage, and there is no immediate prospect of conditions improving. No body of specialists in primary production, is doing more useful work than those stud masters who are working to maintain and improve the standards of our flocks and herds. Any obstacle to these endeavours must operate to the serious detriment of the country. For the maintenance of proper standards, regular supplies of imported stock should be available. Primage duty will press heavily ou those stud masters who, after experiencing year's of drought, are suffering further from the general depression. The concession I am suggesting would not involve any substantial loss of revenue, but. would be of considerable relief to individual stock-breeders. The duty proposed hy the Government will hamper their operations, and sprag the wheels of progress in an important, branch of primary production. for Trade and Customs) [12.11] -Repre senting a primary producing district, tbe honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Morgan) naturally takes a very keen interest in the primage duty on stud stock. A. deputation of stud masters waited upon me to urge that stud stock should be exempt from primage duty. It is already free of import duty; rightly so, because it is of the utmost importance to Australia that stud masters should he able to introduce the best stock from all parts of the world at low cost. Realizing this, the Government, when increasing the general primage duty to 10 per cent., decided to allow the impost on stud stock to remain at 4 per cent. I do not admit that the burden on stud masters is as heavyas the honourable member for Darling Downs has said. There are manybreeders in Australia who are able to supply, for the time being, at any rate, stud beasts from their own flocks and herds. Any stud master who is not satisfied with the stock available in Australia, and desires to import, will have to pay primage duty at the rate of 4 per cent. But for the financial stringency', the Government would have removed altogether the primage duty from stud stock; in the circumstances, the best it could do was not. to increase it. revenue. the tax cannot be the burden on stud masters that it is represented to be. When1 informed the deputation of stud masters that the duty would be left at 4 per cent., instead of being increased to 10 per cent., 1 understood that they were satisfied that that, was n fair compromise. The Government would gladly remove all primage duties, but if it did so it could not raise the new revenue to which it is pledged under the Melbourne conference plan, and if individual items are to be exempt, there are hundreds in respect of which the claims are more urgent than are those in respect of stud stock. stock is insignificant from a revenue point, of view. that statement. Because of the prevailing depression, the market is poor, and the importation of stud stock is not very great. However, it might develop into a substantial item. After careful consideration, the Government has decided that at present it cannot go further than to bring stud stock under the 4 per cent, instead of the 10 per cent. rate. If such stock were admitted duty free, the door would be open to numerous requests from other persons, who could put up just as good an argument as the stud masters, the majority of whom are-",25,Thrips

In December, 1929, tlie present Government reduced it to Is. lOd. a gallon; but later, for financial reasons, it was again raised to 2s. a gallon. I am afraid that if the excise duty on stout were reduced, there would immediately begin an agitation to reduce the duty on beer. It would be urged that the workers of Australia should not be penalized by having to pay a higher duty on beer than on stout. meet overseas coin petition to the extent that stout does. and nearly all the stout consumed in Australia is produced in this country. The imports are comparatively small. those lines last year were valued at £45,000. before the imposition of the restrictions. The present duty on stout, imported in hulk, is, British, 3s. a gallon; intermediate, 3s. 3d.; and general, 4s. 6d., while bottled stout is dutiable at 3s. 6d., 3s. 9d., aud 6s. 6d. a gallon respectively. Generally, the higher rates apply to all imported stout, because it nearly all comes here in bottles. The special duty adds 50 per cent, to those charges, the higher rate having been imposed in accordance with the plan to restrict imports. It was only after very strong representations had been made by Tasmanian members, particularly the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Frost), in whose district practically all the hops grown in Tasmania are produced, that the Government decided to lift the surcharge and rationing on imported stout. Acftion was not taken until its possible effect on the Australian stout-making industry was considered. The enabled us to dispose of the surplus stocks of hops, comprising 2,500 bales of the 1930 crop, and 1,500 bales of the 1931 crop, and, in addition, 1,000 bales per annum from 1933 onwards at world -parity prices. That meant that £57,000 in Australian currency was given to the .Australian hop-growing industry, practically all of which went to one small district in Tasmania. I realize that the Australian breweries are the best market for Australian hops, and that we should give adequate protection to Australian brewers against importations of ale, beer, and stout from other countries. I understand that they are quite satisfied with the existing protection. Hoticeable increase in the importations of stout recently? came into operation so recently that 1 have not yet had any advice; but I understand that no big importations of stout have been made recently, or are likely to be made because of the exchange position. The honourable member for would be no loss of revenue to the Commonwealth if the excise were reduced by 6d. a gallon That is problematical. The experience of the Customs Department is that a reduction of excise h'as always led to a reduction of revenue, and I am afraid that any reduction now would have the same effect.

I mention the matter now so that the question may be framed in such a way that, in the event of this amendment being carried, it will not exclude a further amendment to give effect to what I have indicated. I support the amendment. The longer whisky is kept in bond the better it is. We must consider the health of the public, and whisky that has not been properly matured is harmful to health. I have no interest in the liquor industry myself, but we all know that properly matured whisky is more palatable and less likely to injure the consumer than raw spirit. The Government would not lose any revenue if the period of maturity were extended to three years, and the public would benefit. amendment might well have been moved by the Minister for Trade and Customs himself, or by his colleague, the Minister for Health. The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) has pointed out that the change provided for in his amendment would benefit the health, if not of the whole community, at least of that section of it which drinks whisky. We in Australia have long prided ourselves on the'steps which we have taken to safeguard and improve the health of our people. We have boasted, for instance, that our factory legislation is the best in the world. One may well ask how it is that, we have lagged behind other parts of the world in regard to regulations governing the sale of whisky. The honourable member for Wide Bay quoted a number of countries in which the period during which whisky has to be kept in bond exceeds that in Australia. Canada, is the only leading country in the world where whisky which has not been matured for three years may be placed on the market. get it into the TJnited States of America; that is why. ber for Corio( Mr Lewis), who is an ardent prohibitionist, has put forward the suggestion that the demand for Canadian whisky from the United States of America is so great that the authorities do not insist upon its being properly matured. I cannot say how true that is. We have lagged behind in Australia for the reason that until recently we have not been a whisky-producing country. We had a similar experience with regard to lager up to, and including, the j'ear 1914. Until then by far the greater quantity of bottled beer and lager consumed in Australia was imported. The ships of the Nord Deutcher line used to visit Australia regularly, and their holds contained large quantities of pilsener, munich, bock, and other light beers, for consumption here. The war taught us that we could make lager in Australia equal to anything manufactured abroad, and at the present time most of the lager consumed in Australia is locally made. The result is that there has been an increased demand for a section of our primary produce. When thefiguresrelating to the importation into Australia of lager and light beer were put into my hands, my interest in the subject was aroused, and I went to the library, where I consulted the Canadian Year-Booh. I found that, as a result of the increased demand for Canadian whisky, the distilleries there consumed last year no less than 4,000,000 bushels of grain. If the Minister accepts this amendment, as I feel sure he should, we shall be able so to improve our locally-manufactured whisky that the public will not desire to drink the imported product. At the present time the public is not satisfied with Australian whisky. There is no more discriminating consumer than the whisky drinker. Honourable members know that in every city in Australia whisky drinkers will take their patronage from one hotel to auother in order to obtain spirit which is true to label. The chief object of this amendment is to improve the standard of the whisky manufactured in Australia. I am sure that the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lewis) will agree with me that if we aTe to consume whisky in this country it ought to be Australian whisky, the making of which provides employment for Australian workmen, and a use for Australian primary produce.

The Minister, right throughout the defence of the tariff schedule, has taken the stand that the granting of increased protection would develop aud promote the efficiency of Australian industries. need quote only a few examples to show that, where Australian industries have proved really efficient, the public have supported them most generously. example, 95 per cent, of the boots and shoes consumed in Australia are of Australian manufacture. Why? Because the price is right, and the quality is right. Of the rugs and blankets used 93 per cent, or 94 per cent, are locally made, again because the price and quality are right. of the soaps used in Australia are made here ; no one can complain of their quality; no one can complain of the price. Similarly, practically all the sauces and pickles, used in Australia are now made here. At one time we imported large quantities of pickles made by Crosse& Blackwell and Morton, but we ore now satisfied with our own product. We cannot induce the public to consume Australian whisky unless the quality is satisfactory. matured for only two years will not satisfy the public taste.

The act was assented to on the 12th For October, 1906, but due notice of the proposed change was given. On the 1st January, 1908, the provision became operative that whisky must be stored in wood for two years. That gave to distillers fifteen mouths' notice of the proposed change. By this amendment it is proposed to bring about the change overNearly 99 per cent, night, without notice, and with disastrous results to the small distilleries. Before that no period was stipulated. That action was taken by the Government of the day under this act after the Royal Commission on Customs and Excise Tariffs had made an inquiry into spirits and the distillation of spirits.

The arguments that have been put forward this afternoon require examination. I am not an expert in whisky, and I think it well to refer this proposal to the Tariff the spirit which necessitates maturing. Board so as to give all sections of the trade an opportunity to place their views before the Tariff Board, and to give the board itself an' opportunity to examine the representatives of Milne's of South Australia, and the other distillery that is opposed to an extension of the maturity period. Tliose who favour the amendment are United Distilleries Limited, embracing Corio Distillery and the Federal Distilleries which are putting a 5-year-old Australian whisky on the market. Milne's sell a 2-year-old whisky. If the amendment is carried, it will put them out of the market for a year, and play into the hands of the combine. take? treat this as an urgent matter. The two years' term was fixed on the advice of the trade and of experts at the time, and although it has been stated that certain countries favour a three-years' period of storage in wood, Canada has adopted a two-yeurs' period. In 1906 the experts considered that a two-years' period was sufficient. Since then no representations have been made for an alteration in the period, and no evidence has been forthcoming as to the necessity for any change. This proposed amendment was put in my hands a clay or two ago, and neither the department nor myself have had time to examine it thoroughly. In those circumstances we do not feel inclined to accept it. If this amendment were accepted, section 12 of the Spirits Act would have to be altered, because it would have to apply to imported whisky as well as to Australian-made whisky. Therefore, the question whether it should apply as well to Australian brandy and rum would also have to be considered. No maturity condition, is imposed on gin, because it does not contain the natural ingredients which occur in brandy, whisky, and ruin, and necessitate the spirit being matured. In the case of whisky, brandy, aud rum, the spirit or part of the spirit used is distilled at a comparatively low in the materials which give the characteristic flavour of brandy, whisky, or rum as the case may be. It is the presence of these elements in The Government considers that the Tariff Board should make an investigation so as to determine whether the condition of maturity should apply to brandy and rum as well as to whisky. power to regulate this matter? tralia insists upon a period of maturity of three years. In the other States the period is two years. If the period is fixed at. three years, we will prevent Milne's from selling for a year, and we will render more difficult the establishment of new distilleries to compete with the large distilleries which are able to carry large stocks, and to mature them for three years. In other words, the Opposition, from which the amendment came, favours the monopoly in this case as against the small man.

75,Mr Lyons (Wilmot) [3.4],"I regretAugust, 1930, that steps in that direction should be taken. The plans considered by the Federal and State Ministers in conference in May and June of this year included a proposal for the conversion of the public debt, and, then, for the first time, the application of compulsion was advocated. The conference was agreed that the reduction of the interest burden was essential, that it could be achieved -only by conversion, and that the conversion must be compulsory. A t that stage, the Leaders of the Opposition in the -Senate .and the House of Representatives -were invited to confer with the Federal an a 'State Ministers. that we were agreed that the conversion -should be on a compulsory basis. there w.as a .very definite majority in the -conference committed to the principle .o.f -compulsion. version. T'he conference iwas in favour of -specially taxing those who did not. convert. Mr 'LYONS -The relative merits of -compulsory and voluntary conversion were being discussed when the Leaders of the Opposition were admitted to the -conference. We strongly advocated tin.' adoption of thevoluntary principle, expressing our conviction that the 'bond holders, who are mainly representative taxpayers and citizens, would, i'f property appealed to, come to the assistance of the Commonwealth and the,States. Subsequent to our intervention, the con'fer-ence adopted the principle of voluntary -conversion, and the result of .the appeal to the conn try amply justified our faith . 'The Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) has said that the response-by bondholders was a wonderful achievement, and I feel sure that the proposal now put forward-no t by this Government-alone,-but by all the -Governments of Australia-wil l do much to mar the remarkable success of the -conversion appeal. time was the threat of taxation. Mr 'LYONS -There was never any threat of compulsion after the voluntary -ostein had been adopted. that compulsion would be resorted to if necessary. about it . Prime Minister said fchat compulsion was not the policy of the conference; now, he savs that, nobody had any doubt about it."" never favoured compulsory conversion. We did discuss the taxation of the unconverted stock. i.o-day still more difficult. When the It is not correct to say conference adopted the voluntary plan, there was no intention that compulsion should be applied to those who dissented; but some reduction in the interest return by taxation might have been contemplated. The 'Treasurer was right in emphasizing 'that many who freeTy and cheerfully converted, might well have held back and waited for automatic conversion. -But-one of the most striking features .of a wonderful achievement .was that, of the £557,000,000 involved, £510,000,000 was converted with the direct and positive consent of nearly 250,000 holders. The legislation now proposed w ill destroy some of the benefits that otherwise would be derived from that achievement, and i i is a pity that the bill has,been introduced. not conyert. truly, that nobody expected a i.00 per cent, conversion; probably none of those at the conference were so optimistic as to believe that. 90 per cent, of the .stock would be converted, whereas the conversions represent 97 per cent, of the total. When the success of the loan was known, the national appeal executive, consisting of the Prime Minister. Sir Robert Gibson, and myself, decided to make a further appeal to the dissqnters, pointing out what other bondholders had done, and asking the remainder, iu the interests of the nation, to revoke their first .refusal. We emphasized t h e ' f a c t t h at many of it all .the those who had already converted were probably making at least as great a sacri'fice as was asked of those who had dissented'. ;B,ut,-unfortunately, .while money was being .expended .on that appeal, the",35,Second Readin G

86,Mr Lyons,"The Treasurer saidPremiers, again in conference, decided to apply compulsion to the dissenting minority. That diminished the value and force of our final appeal. Nevertheless, according to the figures quoted by the Treasurer, 2,700 of those who had dissented, holding £2,565,000 worth of stock, changed their minds. stated that the small percentage of dissentients vindicated the voluntary appeal. No other policy would have been justified. Morally, and patriotically, the right and only practicable course was that which the conference adopted. Therefore, I regret the bill now before the House. I am not perturbed about the interests of the dissenting individuals and institution*. My concern is that the Government is committing a breach of contract. seven. this legislation is the decision, not of one government, but of all the governments of Australia. A breach of contract on the part of the governments of Australia must inevitably have the effect of depreciating the value of the security held by those who converted. It must make for the destruction of confidence, which, in turn, will render it difficult in the future for governments to raise money by loans. It will not be very many years before the first maturity date of the new securities is reached. Anything that makes it difficult for governments to meet the situation then must depreciate the value of the security then maturing. breach of contract to-day will not only do an injustice to those who found themselves unable to convert, but will oalso do a definite injury to those who have converted. Treasurer's speech the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) interjected, '-' The Government would not have been asked to do more than that"", referring to the Government honouring its compact. The Treasurer repliedNo, it would not, but n man may, though people some portion of their own capital. asking for no more than the honouring of a oompact, be guilty of the grossest selfishness We are making a virtue of this. It is when, by refusing to convert, he fails to accept humiliating for men and women who, his proper share of the national sacrifice. From .that it would appear that tliose who the object of providing for their old age, did not convert-and we must put them to be compelled to come, cap in hand, to into one class, because we cannot disthe Government when their money is due, tinguish one from the other, as we do not know the circumstances-hav e displayed a certain amount of selfishness, which gives the Government justification for breaking its contract. Surely that is a new theory in morals and in legislation. When we raise loans upon the market The Treasurer we deal with certain individuals from whom we borrow money, and with whom we make a contract. Whether any of these is a selfish person who wants his last shilling out of the Government, or is generous enough to take less than the Government offers for his money, makes no difference to the binding nature of the compact into which the Government enters. assume that dissentients are selfish? in assuming selfishnojss on the part of these people. I know that the Treasurer has made an uusuccessful effort to obtain an analysis showing those who have converted some portion of their holdings, and have refused to convert the balance. If we could obtain that information it would disclose that there is a large number of such persons. I know of an instance in my own electorate. A man and some members of his family interviewed me, stating that they had invested their money in practically every loan that has been launched in Australia in recent years. They were advising the Treasurer that they desired to convert every holding, except one small amount that fell due Therefore, a in 1931. They were forced to do that because of the present state of their finances. Many others arc similarly situated. Are such to be branded as selfish individuals? I admit that there During the course of the are a number of selfish people, but that does not justify the Government in breaking the bond into which it entered. I know that, in order to soften the blow, the Government is endeavouring to meet necessitous cases.

The Government recognizes the injustice of the procedure, and is doing what it can to overcome the difficulty. The Treasurer stated that those who -criticized the proposal before Parliament should suggest alternatives. action of the Government has made it very difficult to do so., as it has destroyed confidence. Treasurer himself indicated a solution. The honourable gentleman stated that the sinking fund might be utilized to relieve necessitous cases to the extent of £1,250,000 this year, and £1,000,000 next year.; that if more were required it might be possible to come to some arrangement with the banks about it. To-day the honourable gentleman stated that the sinking fund commissioners are prepared to find £2,000,000 this year instead of £1,250,000. That will ease the position somewhat. The Treasurer pointed out that, under existing conditions, it is impossible to go on the market and raise the £9,600,000 that is unconverted, and that will fall due within the next sixteen months. I recognize that difficulty, and I know its cause. Nobody would be optimistic enough to think that, with legislation such as is before us, it would be of any use to go on the market in the ordinary way. Had a different policy been followed I should have no doubt about the position. I look back to the time when the Commonwealth Government launched its conversion loan in 1930. Then the Treasury was advised by the banks that it was more than doubtful whether the money would be forthcoming. The banks pointed to the market position, and declared that anybody who wanted to invest money in government shares could do so more profitably by buying upon the open market than by investing in the proposed conversion loan. The loan was launched; an appeal was made to the patriotism of the people, and the loan was oversubscribed to the extent of several million pounds. thing to inspire them. fidence had not then been destroyed. I stand up to their obligations. believe that that success could be repeated, despite the opinion of the banks, whose judgment has been astray on more than one occasion. I am confident that the Government could, within the next sixteen months, raise the £9,600,000 that is necessary to meet its obligations to bondholders. TheI f we could obtain a couple of million pounds each year from the sinking fund, and it is a proper purpose to which to However, the apply that money, it would all go to improve the position. We should then -require:, in addition, in the next two financial years, only £5,600,000. It is suggested, and I know there is something behind the suggestion, that, added to what could he obtained from the sinking fund commissioners, assistance might be had from the banks. Why could not the Commonwealth Savings Bank take over some of the smaller holdings of our investors and treat them as deposits. If the bank could not meet the bonds on their due date, it could meet a substantial proportion of them, and pay the rest within a reasonable time. I am confident that if we met the problem fairly, squarely, and honestly, we could obviate the necessity of committing this breach of contract. It is important to re-establish confidence in governments in order to make it easier in future to raise the money needed to meet commitments, particularly having regard to the paying off these debts at maturity. The appreciation of holdings which would follow a restoration of confidence in governmente is a matter of great importance. I understand that there is a sum of about £7,000,000 available in various sinking funds. I realize that there are certain commitments for which the Government is morally and legally liable, but I should say-and I speak without the exact figures before me-that there would still be at least £3,000,000 available in each of the next two years. That would leave only about £3,600,000 out of the 69,600,000 to be raised. If the Government were to appeal for that sum, explaining what had been done, there would, in my opinion, be no difficulty in getting it. because I imagine that the banks would be able to find some money.

AlthoughI do not want to see this measure placed on the statute-book, I do not oppose it on party grounds. A few months ago legislation was introduced into this Parliament for the voluntary conversion of our internal indebtedness. Investors were invited to convert their holdings into new stock bearing lower rates of interest. There was no hint or threat of compulsion in any shape or form. They responded nobly; yet within a few weeks of the passing of that legislation we are asked to amend it. Let me quote the actual words of clause 3 of the schedule, so. that honourable members may realize what they are asked to accept in this bill. That clause providesNotwithstanding anytjiing in tlie abovorocitcd Debt Conversion Agreement or in the said act contained, every holder of existing securities which have not been converted into new securities in accordance with the provisions of the said act shall, notwithstanding repudiation. So strongly did the people that any holder of those existing securities may have signified or may signify dissent, be deemed to have made an application in accordto his proposals. What were those proance with section 0 of the said act for their conversion into now securities, and they shall hp. deemed to be so converted accordingly. I do* not know, who is responsible for the wording of the clause; but it is extraordinary that those who have intimated that they do not desire to convert their holdings are told by this bill that their very intimation to that effect is to be regarded as an application to convert, and that their holdings will be converted accordingly. Surely no Parliament was ever asked to pass such an extraordinary measure! I give the Gdvernment credit for acting conscientiously in this matter. Probably, it feels that no other'course is open; but I suggest that, in the drafting of the measure, wordscould have been used which would not have placarded to the world the breach of faith of which Australia will be guilty if this measure becomes law.. . gentleman that the Governments of Australia gave this matter earnest consideration. The representatives of those governments sat for three weeks in Melbourne discussing this problem. After a decision had been arrived at, the phraseology was left to the draftsmen. accurately set forth the decisions of the conference; I regret that the Government did not scrutinize the wording of clause 3 more carefully before submitting the bill to Parliament.

Did the honourable member for Bourke intend that the Governments of Australia should refuse to pay their debts? He did not. His proposal was that the repayment of loans should be deferred for twelve months, and that in the meantime the existing rate of interest should be paid. He further proposed that arrangements should be made with the banks fo meet necessitous cases. As I have said, his proposal was rouudly condemned. It was regarded as a breach of contract, repudiation of the worse type. As a result of the publicity given to his proposal, pledges were given by all the Governments of Australia when the £28,000,000 loan was launched that they would stand to every part of the new contract. Those pledges were signed by the Premiers of all the States, the representatives of the Commonwealth Government, and many Opposition Leaders.",38,Second Readin G

General) [3.48] -Some time ago a number of articles dealing with sweating in lhe clothing trade, particularly in Melbourne, appeared in the Melbourne Age. These disclosures excited some controversy in this Parliament, and they were naturally of interest to the Government. By direction of the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), I have obtained a report upon the subject, from the Industrial Registrar of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and I shall lay that remachinery coucerned could be manufacport upon the table in the Library for the information of honourable members. Not desiring to detain the House at the present juncture, I merely wish to state that the report deals with the complaints that have been circulated, in respect of which much evidence has been adduced, and it also indicates certain suggested remedies. been made in other States? has not arisen in other States in an acute form. The report deals exclusively with the complaints in Melbourne, and it serves to emphasize the manner in which the Commonwealth Legislature is hampered through its limited constitutional powers. Tho people are in the anomalous position of having two legislative authorities, Federal and State, endeavouring to grapple with this problem, neither being able to deal with it effectively. There remains, however, an extensive field over which State legislatures may operate, and which has not yet been touched. I am pleased to note, in that regard, that a bill is now before the Victorian Legislature to deal with the particular matter that I have mentioned. I am glad, also, to leant that the appropriate union is exercising vigilance to see that the awards are being observed. I have only to add that the Government will take the matter up further on fuller consideration of the legislation now awaiting the determination of the Victorian Parliament. considerable time. I have been awaiting a favorable opportunity to bring forward a customs case that has been causing considerable concern in South Australia. Some time ago, News Limited, Adelaide, gave an order for a printing press and conveyors from London, and the company has been called upon to pay £917 in customs duty. This matter has been mentioned from time to time in another place, and although Senator Daly haB made favorable comment upon it, and bas promised to bring the matter before the Cabinet, the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) has refused to make a refund of any portion of the duty, on the ground that the printing tured in Australia. I am not sure whether the Minister in another place has taken the matter to the Cabinet; but the position, so far as I am aware, remains unchanged. On the 5th August, 1927, News Limited placed an order with a British firm for a complete new press, including conveyors, to be delivered within eight months. On the 12th September, 1928, the press had been delivered in ten shipments, and on the 15th October, 192S, the conveyors arrived at Port Adelaide. The press and the conveyors, of course, were placed in bond. On the 23rd June, 1930, News Limited paid under protest £916 in duty. On the 16th July, 1930, the matter was taken up with the Customs Department, which replied that Scott and Company Proprietary Limited were manufacturing machines of this nature at the date of the importation. On the 28th July, a reply was sent to the department that Scott and Company, who were really Gibson, Battle and Company, were not making conveyors about the time of the importation, but were merely contemplating doing so. As a matter of fact, this particular firm actually borrowed the drawings from News Limited, in order that they might put in tenders for the conveyors. Further, we find that the conveyors were ordered of necessity twelve months earlier than this. The manufacture of printing presses and conveyors is a long job. Ou the 8th November, 1930, the matter having again been brought before the Minister, he again",40,Clothing Trade out Y On Printing Machinery Judges Salaries And Pensions Woo L Freights Buffal O

In June, 1931, the Minister for Customs refused a renewed application, the reason stated by the Minister being that in June, 1928, Scott aud Sons Proprietary were prepared to accept orders for conveyors. Minister apparently overlooked the fact that the order for the whole press was given twelve months earlier, that the conveyors were specially made for this order in London, and waited there until the completion of the whole plant. A reference to Gibson, Battle Proprietary Limited, will prove the truth of the chief fact relied on. by News Limited, namely, that Scott and Sons Proprietary were not manufacturing such machinery at the time when this was ordered. Some of the other newspapers in Australia, such as the Sydney Morning Herald and the Adelaide Register, actually imported these machines free.

EIOEDAN (Kennedy) [4.1] -Fo r the information of honourable members, and of the workers whom I represent, I should like the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) to make public the replies received from the judges to the requests that they should accept a reduction of their salaries and their pensions. The other evening I raised the subject of freight charges on wool from Australia to Great Britain, stating that, in my opinion, the freights were too high I suggest that the shipping company might be induced to do the fair thing by the producers if the Postmaster-General's Department used the subsidies paid on mail contracts as a lever in the negotiations. I again urge that steps be taken to deal with the buffalo fly pest in Northern Queensland. This matter may not seem serious to some honourable members, but it is of the greatest importance to cattlemen in the north, particularly to those in a small way. The big cattle-grower can work his cattle down to South Australia, and get them in as store cattle to be fattened next year; but the man with 200 or 300 bullocks to be put off each year has no chance of getting them away. As his area is limited he must destroy the increase, or give them away for practically nothing, because his land will not carry them.",41,Clothing Trade out Y On Printing Machinery Judges Salaries And Pensions Woo L Freights Buffal O

We know that.£3,000,000 has been made available for the assistance of wheat-growers, but the unemployment situation U so serious, with men tramping all over the country looking for work, that something should be done. The sum of £3,000,000 is to be devoted to the payment of a bounty on wheat to bring the price up to 3s. a bushel. I noticed in to-day's press that the price of -wheat in Sydney is now 2s. l i d . a bushel, so that, if the bounty is to be paid on this year's wheat, the bankers will have to find only Id. a bushel. If this amount is not made available to the farmers, it should be diverted for the relief of unemployment, and to my knowledge there are plenty of schemes, independent of any secretariat, capable of providing interest and sinking -fund. I trust that these matters will receive early consideration. ter) [4.6] -The matters mentioned by the honorahle member for Boothby( Mr Price) will be attended to by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde), who had no warning that the honourable member intended to speak on the subject this afternoon. No communication has yet . been received from the judges in reply to the letter forwarded to them by myself. I am expecting a report on the matter of wool freights. Tho Minister for Home Affairs( Mr Blakeley) will deal with the buffalo fly question. A number of proposals, including some from Queensland, have been submitted to the Unemployment Secretariat. As the House has been informed on many occasions, the decision rests with the Commonwealth Bank Board to whom application for advances must be made.
