When the bill was introduced into this We should also thank the state and terriplace on 24 February the minister said that tory governments around the country, who Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria are all committed to a national scheme for had already passed bills which put in place the registration of health professionals and the national system.

Wednesday, 12 May 2010 ----Petition: MRI Licence, Warrnambool 26 signatures by doctors, mainly, and people around Warrnambool who are very keen to see an MRI licence granted in Warrnambool. We have reached the point where it seems almost ridiculous that the minister continues to procrastinate on the granting of an MRI licence in Warrnambool, despite a number of delegations to talk with her. The point is that there is no MRI machine between Ballarat, Geelong and Adelaide, so the whole of western Victoria and south-eastern South Australia does not have an MRI machine. When you look at the fact that there are MRI machines in Gippsland and in other regional areas in south-eastern Australia, you see that the time really has come to have one put in Warrnambool. We already have two extremely competent oncologists in Warrnambool, both of whom would find an MRI machine greatly advantageous, as would patients in the region who would no longer have to travel at great expense to have an MRI scan. At the moment, patients have to put up with a CT scan, which, while a very good diagnostic tool, if used too often can cause a lot of problems due to high radiation. This petition for an MRI machine is just the first step in getting a cancer treatment centre in Warrnambool. We have a very active group running Peter’s Project, led by Vicki Jellie, whose husband recently tragically died of cancer. The whole community is right behind this push. This petition for the MRI machine was started by Dan Tehan, the Liberal candidate for the seat of Wannon, who is working extremely hard for the area. I am very confident that, given the effort he is making, he should be successful at the next election. At the same time, it shows that he is very much in touch with local issues. The fact that we do not have an MRI machine in Warrnambool, I think, is a scandal. I urge the minister to reconsider and not continue to procrastinate, and to recognise that an MRI machine is a very valuable part of diagnostics in modern medicine. For people who are already suffering, who have to be put in an ambulance or be driven by their family or whomever all the way to Ballarat or Geelong to get an MRI scan, it seems quite unreasonable in this day and age. We are talking of a region with over 100,000 people who would benefit. Given we already have oncologists, I urged the minister to take notice of this petition and I commend Dan Tehan for the work he has done. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives This petition from certain doctors practicing in Western and South Western Victoria and other citizens of Wannon draws to the attention of the House the decision of the Rudd Government not to grant the Warrnambool Hospital a Magnetic Resonance Imaging licence depriving it of the ability to begin the process of establishing a radiotherapy unit for South West and Western Victoria. We therefore ask the House to call on the Rudd Government to immediately reverse its decision and grant Warrnambool Hospital a Magnetic Resonance Imaging licence. from 26 citizens Petition received.

209,Mr Hawker (Wannon) (9.30 Am),"TodayI would like to formally present a petition ofBlair Electorate: Ipswich Sesquicentenary 150th anniversary of being proclaimed a municipality. I congratulate the Ipswich City Council for its commemorative council meeting on 12 April 2010. Ipswich is the oldest provincial municipality in Queensland. It could and should have been the capital of Queensland. Long before Europeans arrived, the Ipswich area was home to the Jagera, Yuggera and Ugarapul clans, who managed the land and waters in a sustainable and reverent way. Explorers John Oxley, Allan Cunningham and Lieutenant Butler first spotted the mouth of the Bremer River on a trip up the Brisbane River in September 1824. John Oxley is thought to have named the Bremer River in honour of Admiral Sir John Bremer, who sailed the HMS Tamar to northern Australia and established a settlement at Port Essington. Ipswich was first called Limestone Station by Captain Patrick Logan who discovered hills of limestone during a trip up the Bremer River in 1827. A team of convicts were then sent out to begin work at Limestone Hill. There are recorded conflicts between the Aboriginal clans of the area and the new arrivals. Ipswich was named by Governor George Gipps, who was the Governor of New South Wales. The first town plan of Ipswich was drawn up by surveyor Henry Wade in 1842 and clearly showed that ‘Ipswich’ was to be the name for the new city. In 1860, after Queensland became a colony, Ipswich was proclaimed a municipality with a population of 3,000 people. The local industries included cotton, sugar, dairy farming, vineyards, woollen mills and coal mining. On a walk through the city centre at that time, you would have seen tailors, blacksmiths, milliners, watchmakers, grocers, cobblers, saddlers, coachbuilders and candle and soap makers. The 1880s saw coal mining grow to a significant industry in Ipswich, attracting migrants from England and Wales to join German migrants who settled in the Ipswich and West Moreton area. Steam engines were used in boats, trains, mills and works and needed coal as fuel. Coalmines were located in suburbs like Blackstone, Dinmore, New Chum, Goodna, Redbank, Collingwood Park and many other places. Ipswich was the birthplace of rail in Queensland. The first line was launched in 1865, and it ran between Ipswich and Grandchester. As far back as 1914 the railway workshops employed 1,500 workers. The population has ebbed and flowed, but Ipswich has grown and in 2010 it covers 1,090 square kilometres and has 6,000 heritage sites. It is the fastest-growing area in Queensland-with five per cent population growth, 166,000 people, 115 different ethnic backgrounds and 84 languages. It is a fast-growing area. Congratulations to Ipswich on its sesquicentenary. Greenway Electorate: Hospitals gion, particularly in my local area of the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury. Blue Mountains residents already travel great distances for essential health services and specialist care, but they could be forced to travel even further under the Rudd Labor government’s health proposal based on casemix funding.

211,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (9.36 Am),"I rise to speak on health and hospitals in my reBlue Mountains residents are below the service targets set by the Labor government in New South Wales. If Labor cannot get it right from Sydney, how can they get it right from Canberra? The Blue Mountains District ANZAC Memorial Hospital in Katoomba is recorded as having only 64 per cent of imminently life-threatening cases seen by a doctor within 10 minutes, but the government’s benchmark is a minimum of 80 per cent. This means that the Blue Mountains hospital is coming in 16 per cent below the government’s acceptable target. As a comparison, the Hawkesbury District Health Service, which is in the same district group 1C1 class as the Blue Mountains hospital, comes in at 96 per cent in the same category. In the category of percentage of potentially life-threatening cases seen by a doctor within 30 minutes-for which the government’s target is 75 per cent-it is bad news again for Blue Mountains residents. Yet again, the hospital comes in at 67 per cent when the Hawkesbury District Health Service-in the same class-weighs in at 96 per cent. For the last 30 months, Kevin Rudd has flown around Australia talking about health reforms. In the last six weeks, Mr Rudd has continued talking but has not been able to say said exactly when, where or how these reforms will be delivered. Despite this, Blue Mountains residents remain no better informed as to how the government’s so-called health reforms are going to improve local access to services and specialists or how many extra doctors, nurses and aged-care places will be provided under the Rudd Labor government in the Blue Mountains area. Labor’s health plan will be no different from their bungled BER and insulation programs. State Labor have proven through the absolutely disastrous BER program that they cannot be trusted to wisely spend Commonwealth money on school halls. There are local examples in the Blue Mountains of wasted government money in this program. Quite simply, how can we trust state Labor to spend money for people’s health needs now when they have failed so dismally over the last 15 years in New South Wales alone? Why is the Prime Minister going to trust New South Wales Labor with health money when most New South Wales residents and especially those in the Blue Mountains do not trust state Labor with their health care? The government must come out and explain to Blue Mountains residents how their so-called health reforms are going to improve services to their hospital. I am calling on the government to commit to improving health services access and delivery to the people of the Blue Mountains. Corio Electorate: Australian Animal Health Laboratory In recent months the streets of East Geelong have been dotted with the macabre sight of dead bats hanging from above, the victims of encounters with power lines. Over the summer the population of bats in Eastern Park has skyrocketed. As the arrival of the bats in Geelong has become a local water cooler topic, next door to Eastern Park is an institution which is taking a far more serious interest in bats. My bedroom window frames a local landmark. It is the large water tower of the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, otherwise known as AAHL. For the virologists at AAHL, it is all about bats. It appears that many deadly diseases, including the Hendra virus and the SARS virus, have their roots in bats. Why bats in particular seem to cook up these viruses is the question on the lips of the scientists of AAHL. An even bigger question is: what is it about bats which means MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Constituency Statements
212,Mr Marles (Corio,"Parliamentary Secretary for Innovation and Industry) (9.39 am)that they appear totally unaffected by the viruses? Bats may be the issue of the day, but they are just part of the work undertaken by this low-profile facility which represents the primary weapon against exotic and emerging animal diseases. AAHL is Australia’s most secure facility and is the best in the world for the handling and containment of diseases. It has kept us free of foot-and-mouth disease, mad cow disease, scrapie and many fish diseases that could threaten the nation’s economic health. The language used to describe the science carried out at AAHL is military: early response, front line, rapid detection tools, disease countermeasures. That is because AAHL is to biosecurity what our Defence Force is to national security. It is a place where diseases can be safely studied and understood and responses developed to manage some of the deadliest disease threats of our time. Three years ago horse flu nearly crippled the nation’s horse industry. AAHL was critical in the national response that quarantined and eradicated that disease from our horse population. We now know that three-quarters of new diseases in people can be traced back to animals. This was the case with the deadly Hendra virus that killed horse trainer Vic Rail back in 1994. Scientists at AAHL were the first to identify Hendra and today continue their work to develop a vaccine and treatment. To give some idea of the growing demand for its expertise, the number of individual diagnostic tests AAHL receives has grown 900 per cent in 10 years. This year AAHL celebrated its 25th birthday. On the very day of its birthday, I had the great privilege of touring the facility. It is indeed impressive-more than 2,000 precast concrete wall panels, over 500 airtight doors, 62 air-handling systems and 1,000 high-efficiency air filters. To rebuild it today would cost $650 million, more than four times the money spent on construction in the early 1980s. In recent years, the Australian government has spent $55 million on AAHL, ensuring that it remains the pre-eminent facility of its kind in the world. The 300 people who work at AAHL may not wear army fatigues, but, as they handle the deadliest diseases known to humanity each and every day, the work they do is indeed heroic and just as fundamental to defending our country. Isaacs Electorate: Employment new general merchandise hall of the recently renovated Dandenong Market. It was the first time that the market had been used for a non-market use, and I thank the City of Greater Dandenong Council for making it available. It is an unfortunate fact that, in times of financial uncertainty, unemployment in areas like Dandenong goes up to a higher level than the national average. The Dandenong area-and, in particular, suburbs like Dandenong South, Braeside and Carrum Downs-provides a significant chunk of Victoria’s and the country’s manufacturing output. So, when times are tough, manufacturing, retail and hospitality jobs in this area are often the first to go. That is why Centrelink hosted the Dandenong Jobs Expo on 15 April, when more than 120 local businesses and organisations from Melbourne’s south-east gathered to employ more than 800 people. It was the 10th jobs expo held nationally and the most successful in both turnout and jobs created. It was great to have the Parliamentary Secretary for Employment, Jason Clare, and the Mayor of the City of Greater Dandenong, Councillor Jim Memeti, there with me to see just MAIN COMMITTEE",190,Constituency Statements
213,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (9.42 Am),"Last month the Dandenong Jobs Expo was held at thehow enthusiastic the Dandenong region is to provide employment. Major local companies like Jayco, Myer and Ventura Bus Lines were there offering employment, and I must recognise the hard work of the local jobs coordinator, Keith Pimblett, for his role in attracting local businesses to the expo. While the opposition are out there with hollow talk about taking action, this government is serious about actually doing something to get Australians back into work. Representing an area that has higher than average unemployment, I am proud that the Rudd government has been decisive and unapologetic in its priorities since the global financial crisis hit in late 2008: protect Australian jobs and keep unemployment down as low as possible. This government took early and decisive action to promote spending in retail and hospitality with the oneoff cash payment bonus payments in December 2008 and early 2009, which helped keep employment up and going in these vulnerable sectors. Then we announced and have implemented the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, which has brought important community infrastructure like the complete redevelopment of the Noble Park pool and the construction of the Kingston Heath regional soccer facility, both of which are boons to their respective local communities and for local jobs. Every school in my electorate has received extra maintenance funding under the National School Pride program, and every primary school has new classrooms, a new library or a new hall. I have visited many of the schools in my electorate to see how construction is going, and the principals and parents are excited. Many of the workers have told me that if it were not for this funding program they would not have a job. The opposition leader wants to take away the projects promised to local schools under the third round of the Building the Education Revolution program and the jobs that go with it. As I have previously done in this place, I invite the opposition leader to my electorate to tell the principals, parents and teachers at schools like Noble Park Primary School, Wallarano Primary School, Parktone Primary School and the Chelsea Primary School exactly why, if elected, he would try and take away their important infrastructure projects. There is a stark difference between the Rudd government and the coalition on this issue. We are for jobs and those opposite are not. (Time expired) Mayo Electorate: Digital Television of the Rudd government is coming soon, too. I rise today to talk again in this place about the digital television issue in my electorate, particularly in Yankalilla and Gumeracha. We have had in recent months some good news delivered by the broadcasters that the five self-help stations in Yankalilla will be upgraded by the broadcasters to ensure that the people in Yankalilla receive digital television when the analog service is switched off in Adelaide in 2013. It has always been an area which has struggled with television reception because of its topography. While it is very close to the main broadcasting tower in Adelaide, it has, unfortunately, always struggled. The council has maintained these self-help towers for some time. It is good news now that we are going to have these upgraded to ensure that digital television is received. The question now is how quickly they will be upgraded. We are hoping they will be upgraded sooner than 2013 and we will be sitting down with the shadow minister, the member for Casey, who has done a sterling job on this issue, to ensure that that is the case. MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Constituency Statements
214,Mr Briggs (Mayo) (9.46 Am),"Thank you, Madam Speaker Burke, and the time expiredMore worryingly, however, Gumeracha, Cudlee Creek and Forreston have not received the positive news that Yankalilla has. They have received some news, which is that the broadcasters in their assessments believe they will be picked up by current stations which will be upgraded as part of this process. However, we are looking for some assurances from the broadcasters. Again, in conjunction with the shadow minister who visited my electorate recently and met with some of these locals, and the Adelaide Hills Council Mayor Bill Cooksley who has focused on this issue very much as well, we will be working to ensure that the people in this area-who believe it or not live closer to the Adelaide broadcast tower than most people in Adelaide do and cannot get digital TV-will be picked up by the increase in services. We will work to ensure that that view of the broadcasters will actually come to pass. Again, we want to know what the time frame for that is to ensure these people are able to get their TV service, as they deserve. Unfortunately, this has been mishandled by the Rudd government. We are seeing that in Mildura today with a disastrous situation occurring up there, and we will see it more broadly through regional and rural Australia. They just simply do not understand the regions. They simply do not think about the impact of these sorts of policies on people who live out of the city areas. Thankfully, the Yankalilla council and the Adelaide Hills council have both worked very hard on these issues for their constituents, working alongside me and the shadow minister, who has been very focused on ensuring that people are not left behind by another Stephen Conroy stuff-up. by their correct title. Melbourne International Jazz Festival Getz said that other than conversation, no art form can give satisfaction of spontaneous interaction like jazz. On1 May I attended the opening of the Melbourne International Jazz Festival’s ‘Baby It’s Cold Outside’ event. Held at the Melbourne Town Hall, it was inspired by two volumes of popular ABC music of the same title. The festival was held over seven days and showcased the extraordinary talent of our local jazz musicians at venues big and small, from the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra to the laneways of Melbourne. In a music world that is apparently dominated by Lady Gaga and pop, the impact of jazz on popular music is often understated. I want to congratulate the artistic director, Michael Tortoni, the program director, Sophie Brous, and the festival’s chairman, Leon Kempler, for an enjoyable opening evening and an extraordinary week of jazz in Melbourne. What impressed me most about the opening were contemporary artists Lior, Clare Bowditch, Megan Washington and Whitley, who joined together with Joe Chindamo, the celebrated Melbourne jazz pianist, and his trio, bassist Philip Rex and drummer Raj Jayaweera, to celebrate the hits of the jazz era. Standards by Frank Sinatra, Nina Simone and Billie Holliday were recast. Rodgers and Hart’s Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered was truly an extraordinary performance that quite overwhelmed the 3,000 people in the town hall. It was magnificent to see these young Australian artists paying homage to a form of music that has shaped many of their own musical styles. MAIN COMMITTEE",192,Constituency Statements

216,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (9.49 Am),"The great international jazz musician StanOne of the gifts of jazz is that it reminds us of the need to have a little more spontaneity and improvisation in our lives. Often we are confined within the walls of this honoured and esteemed building, and we get bogged down in the routine of committee meetings, reports and speeches and forget that life can be spontaneous, like an improvised note played. Jazz reminds us of the importance of spontaneity in our lives. The jazz festival, with 40,000 people attending, cements Melbourne’s place as the cosmopolitan, cultured capital. Budget Ms O’DWYER (Higgins) (9.51 am)-As expected, the budget announced by Treasurer Wayne Swan is a budget that demonstrates a government out of its depth and out of control when it comes to our nation’s finances. It is a government that has focused on growing government and sucking life out of the Australian economy rather than on taking the necessary and tough decisions to reduce spending, continuing the Labor Party’s tradition of deficits and spending and no real reform. Labor’s debt of $93.7 billion represents $4,260 for every man, woman and child, which will eventually have to be repaid. The government will need to borrow $700 million a week to fund this. Labor’s debt is over $542 million for the people of Higgins alone-that is seven times the amount of BER spending in the electorate. I am deeply concerned that we are not seeing value for money for all this borrowing and spending. This continued big spending will only put further pressure on the Reserve Bank to continue to increase interest rates, putting further pressure on the people in my electorate of Higgins. What is this budget predicated on? It is predicated on a great big new tax, a super big tax. Labor’s resource rent tax is a desperate response by a panicked government to get revenue to pay for its increased spending and cost blow-outs. In attempting to cover for its policy failures, the government is wilfully putting this country’s jobs and prosperity on the line. Amazingly, not only has the government gone so far as to say that the new tax will have no effect on the resources sector; it has claimed that investment will grow as a result. Only in muddled ‘Ruddled’ economics can this logic be understood. These brazen claims by the Rudd government are completely at odds with the market’s view. The global credit ratings agency Moody’s has already said that the new tax will have a negative impact on access to credit by mining companies, as well as creating uncertainty for future investment. Resource stocks fell by seven per cent last week, since the new tax was announced. This equates to a $50,000 drop in a typical superannuation balance. On top of this, numerous companies have been forced to postpone new projects and expansions and are now taking a hard look at their investment in Australia. The government has tied the future of the Australian economy to a single industry that is prone to large cyclical fluctuations. The government thinks it will be able to fund its debt and spending into the future. This is not smart economic management. But do not take my word for it. The views of commentators and business are probably best summed up by Katie Lahey, CEO of the Business Council of Australia, who said: The government is playing a high stakes game. If the resource boom was to falter or be killed off the whole budget would collapse in a heap. Australians have a real choice at this upcoming election: a government addicted to spending, spin and deficits or a government led by Tony Abbott which will safeguard our nation’s finances, reduce spending, stop the waste and mismanagement of taxpayer money and deliver real action that will protect and secure Australia’s economic future. MAIN COMMITTEE Law Enforcement ing to law and order in the past few weeks in New South Wales, I am concerned that hard working police officers must be asking themselves why they became cops in the first place. Two weeks ago a magistrate came to the decision that it was acceptable to call police officer a ‘prick’, clearing a university student of offensive language charges following a heated row with a senior constable at a railway station in Sydney. The magistrate went on to say that he was not satisfied that a reasonable person would be offended by the word ‘prick’ and that a police officer would have heard much worse in general conversation on numerous occasions; therefore, our police officers should be used to this type of language. I am reasonably confident that in the ordinary course of parliamentary life this would be deemed to be unparliamentary. Another well-known magistrate in the Manly court last week accused two police officers of fabricating their versions of an incident which occurred in the early hours of the morning in Manly last year, and the magistrate consequently threw the case out of court. The finding came after the police were called to respond to and defuse an ugly crowd. It is alleged that the person charged had been drinking. He became hostile towards the police and wrestled one of the officers to the ground, pinning him down. I understand that this occurred after police officers had tried to move him from the middle of the road. He also went on to call the police ‘fucking pigs’. though he is quoting, it is unparliamentary to quote that language. I am going to have to ask him to withdraw. I am very concerned that some members of our esteemed judicial system are sanctioning this style of language and behaviour against our hard working police officers. It is utter nonsense, and it is not good enough for our legal system to let down the people who protect our community and to feel that it is okay to treat police as second-class citizens. It is distressing that in this chamber over a year ago I raised similar concerns regarding how police and the community felt abandoned by the Western Australian justice system after an assault took place on a police officer, leaving him paralysed. That matter went unpunished. I applaud the tough comments of Peter Remfrey, the Secretary of the Police Association of New South Wales, and I echo his remarks that police should not be regarded as punching bags for society nor should they be open to this form of abuse. I have always taught my children, and now I am teaching my grandchildren, to respect the police, and it is time that members of our judicial system show similar leadership and community based thinking. Surely our police cannot be expected to protect our communities if they themselves are not being properly protected. Finally, I would like to congratulate Minister Chris Evans on his intention to cancel the visa of a man who was convicted of the manslaughter of Senior Constable Glenn McEnally.

219,Mr Hayes,"I withdraw, Madam Deputy Speaker. I would like to put on record today thatBudget time yesterday that the three per cent increase in superannuation guarantee contributions will not be paid for by the mining super tax but will be paid for by employers. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and his ministers have repeatedly tried to mislead people into believing that the proposed mining super tax would pay for the increase in employer superannuation contributions. The simple fact is that increased employer funded superannuation contributions are paid for by employers. This is in stark contrast to what the Prime Minister has been trying to convince the Australian public of. In an interview on the ABC in Perth on 5 May he said that the super profits tax will, amongst other things: … boost the superannuation earnings of working Australians by increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent … In a doorstop on 4 May in Perth, the Prime Minister said that our super profits tax in the mining industry is about three things. He went on to say that the first thing is raising the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent. He went on and on making this false and misleading claim, trying to link this super tax on the mining industry to somehow funding employer contributions for superannuation. The small business community are awake to this. Employers well know the point that the opposition has been making-that is, the Rudd Labor government is making false and misleading claims about the mining super tax paying for increased employer superannuation contributions. Just look at some of the quotes. Jaye Radisich from the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia said that there is little doubt that the increase in the superannuation guarantee of three per cent will be passed on to consumers, given that it represents a direct cost for business. Russell Zimmerman of the Australian Retailers Association said: … retailers are being hit with increases to employment related expenses including a three percent rise in superannuation payments. Peter Anderson, the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also made the point. He said: Some media reporting this morning claims that ‘the new Resource Super Profits Tax will fund the Federal Government’s promise to raise the superannuation levy from 9% to 12%.’ Regrettably, this is not the case. And he goes on to outline why it is. What an interesting revelation it was yesterday when the Minister for Finance and Deregulation corrected the record by pointing out that the super tax is in no way funding an increase in employer contributions. He went through some budget babble and talked about forgone tax and said that that represented a cost. For the record: the forgone tax he is trying to impute has something to do with the super tax on the mining industry being forgone because there has been some forgoing of pay, wages and salaries, on which income tax would be paid, and that benefit is in turn being received as a superannuation contribution at a lower tax rate. There is no such link. There is no guarantee of that. There is no mechanism to offset future wage claims against this increase in employer contributions. It is way past time for the Rudd government to be honest. It is misleading the Australian people about this supposed link. It needs to produce evidence that there is a direct connection(Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE",195,Constituency Statements
220,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (9.57 Am),"The Rudd Labor government conceded in questiontime for constituency statements has concluded. Primary Industries and Resources Committee Report Debate resumed from 17 March, on motion by Mr Adams: That the House take note of the report. Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (10.01 am)-In my speech on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources on the role of the government to assist Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change, I would like to address the real implications of the government’s CPRS-and no, it has not gone away; it has just been put aside while it is inconvenient and while it is convenient to fiddle the books to make the budget look better than it otherwise would. Pastoralists, graziers and farmers right across the country have played a big part in setting our nation’s course. Australians have great respect for people who work on the land. The esteem in which Australians hold farmers cannot be underestimated. Farmers are seen as trustworthy, honest and hard working, so when it came time to oppose the CPRS and basically the ETS their voices were heard clearly and without contempt. Farmers more than anyone else on earth know precisely the nature and frequency of changes in weather and climate. These changes show up in their annual income. There are bumper crops because of rain at the right time; crop losses through droughts, storms and floods; the production and survival of calves, lambs and so on due to benign weather; and stock losses because of droughts, floods or unseasonably cold weather. Farmers know whether we are having the hottest, coldest, wettest or driest season because the weather pretty much rules their lives. The Productivity Commission report of 2005 entitled Trends in Australian agriculture states: Agriculture is characterised by substantial volatility in output over time, with fluctuations in climatic conditions, such as droughts, substantially impacting on output in some years. Over the last three decades, agriculture has recorded the highest level of volatility in year-to-year output growth of all industries (more than two and a half times higher than the average for all industries). Despite that, agriculture plays a much bigger role in Australia’s exports than might be expected given its output share. In 2003-04 it directly accounted for around 22 per cent of Australia’s total goods and services exports. Speaking as a nonfarmer, I imagine what would help farmers most is factual information about short-, mediumand long-term weather patterns. We hear a lot about El Nino and La Nina effects. Only relatively recently meteorologists decided that Australia’s weather patterns were more determined by the Indian Ocean dipole than by the Pacific, the El Nino and La Nina influences. Therefore, there is still a lot of work to be done to determine the actual causes of weather and climate changes. One thing I can tell you is that there is very little evidence that man-made carbon emissions are causing these changes. I and others have asked Australia’s Chief Scientist, Professor Penny Sackett, for such evidence. None has been forthcoming. MAIN COMMITTEE",196,Constituency Statements
221,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"In accordance with standing order 193, theAnother thing I can assure you is that, despite assurances that agriculture will be somehow exempted or made a special case, farmers will be in the firing line. There is a graph on page 170 of the Garnaut report headed ‘Direct emissions intensity of Australia’s agriculture industry compared with selected OECD countries’. It shows Australia as being the second biggest emitter after Ireland of tonnes of CO2, at more than twice the average. The problem with exemptions is that they are illogical. If you really believe that carbon dioxide is the problem, how can you say to certain sectors, ‘Well, your CO2 is okay but their CO2 must be reduced’? CO2 is either dangerous or it is not. The IPCC and organisations which seek to control economies by the limiting of CO2 emissions insist that it is and that increased man-made CO2 emissions have caused global warming. There are parts of the Garnaut report which, if removed from the carbon dioxide obsession, are still quite useful. It refers to research into adaptation technologies. According to Garnaut, in 2006-07, 22 per cent of all government expenditure on research and development could be attributed to research into plant and animal production and primary products. However, the general idea that farmers need to be flexible and adapt to changes in consumer demands and government policies, technological advances and innovation, and emerging environmental concerns is not new. Farmers have been doing that very successfully. The Productivity Commission research paper Trends in Australian agriculture 2005 states: Australian agriculture has undergone considerable change over the last few decades. Thanks to rapid productivity growth, agricultural output has more than doubled in this period. I wonder how Mr Garnaut thinks farmers achieved this amazing success, if not for flexibility and the ability to change and adapt. Farmers have been doing it pretty tough compared to other sectors of the community. The Productivity Commission report shows the ratio of prices for each sector to an all-industries price index. The changes in relative prices have contributed to the decline in the share of GDP accounted for by agriculture. In summary, Australian farmers have been doing everything that they possibly could to ensure their farming sector is productive but, in pure economic terms, are being overshadowed by the growth in services and mining. In addition, farmers are not affected just by market vicissitudes that impact on markets but by the added variation in weather and climate. Despite this, agriculture will suffer from any form of carbon restrictions taxation or whatever other political imposition the government finally decides upon. This ETS will provide limited protection for our trade exposed industries and, given the level of protection in certain large markets given to their local farmers, this added limiting of overseas markets could prove devastating. Despite vague indications that agriculture may get special consideration, the agricultural sector has not been provided with a certainty that it will be excluded from the scheme. As I said, that would be illogical if you are a CO2 purist. Even if there are allowances made for methane emissions from politically incorrect cows and sheep, farmers are still affected by costs on input such as energy, fertiliser and chemicals. There is not one shadow of a doubt that electricity costs will rise suddenly and substantially-and that goes for your super tax on profits with the mining sector, I have to add. Fossil fuels are generally the cheapest, most reliable and most plentiful source of energy the world has ever seen. As I reflected in parliament recently, it is precisely that cheap and accessible energy that has enabled human progress over the last few centuries, including agriculture. One example is that farmers in Tasmania will face an increase in their electricity costs MAIN COMMITTEE of over $10,000 by 2020 according to the government’s own modelling. This means that the 3,000 farmers in Tasmania, who collectively employ one in five Tasmanians, will face a huge rise in their electricity prices without any compensation. Everyone will feel the impact of Labor’s ETS but regional communities will be hit hardest of all. Research commissioned by the New South Wales government into the regional impact of Labor’s scheme found that regional centres would be hardest hit. Regional communities in WA, such as central Western Australia and the Kimberley, would bear the brunt of Labor’s ETS. This pretty bleak output was reinforced in the June 2009 ABARE study which looked at the effect of the CPRS on the economic value of farm production. It confirmed that there will be increased costs of electricity, fuels and freight. It also said that farmers may face lower farm gate prices for their goods from downstream processors. The production of fertiliser and chemicals is an energy-intensive process. Therefore, domestic fertiliser and chemical producers will face significantly higher input costs. Amazingly, ucts, competition will prevent price rises. The problem for Australian companies is that, if their costs are increasing but they cannot increase prices, financial oblivion surely beckons. Then we will have no local chemical and fertiliser companies and farmers will be at the mercy of overseas companies without the protection of a local producer. The ABARE report also highlights the difficulty of assessing the economic impact of the CPRS, because no-one has any idea what the real price of carbon might be. The government estimated that the initial price in 2011 would be $10 per tonne. The price after that will be determined by the domestic permit market as well as rules around access to international markets and will not be known until after the scheme commences. ABARE also says that its analysis assumes an emission price equal to that projected by Treasury, increasing on average by four per cent a year. In summary, agriculture may initially be exempt from paying for its direct emissions but will be impacted upon by other sectors, principally energy, but that exemption may change at any time. The cost of carbon may start at $10 a tonne but, because the price is not attached to anything real, the price in one or five years is anyone’s guess. If that sounds like economic vandalism and the height of stupidity, you have it in one. All of the economic assessments I have read include such uncertainties. In other words it is a matter of, ‘We will try to guess what impact this will have, not knowing how exempt or not your industry will be and what the carbon price will be.’ It reminds me of the old story about the farmer who won Lotto. He was asked what he would do and he replied, ‘Keep farming until it is all gone.’ ney’s 15-minute discussion on Farming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Unfortunately, he did not actually glance at the report in front of him. I will try to correct that, having been one of the members of the committee that did work on this report, a committee which involved people from the National Party, Independents, Liberals and the Labor Party, a broad group of people. But the member for Tangney obviously did not take the time to engage with the report when he was standing up in the chamber giving his diatribe. I probably did agree with his first three sentences where he talked about the role that farmers have played in Australia. But after that he went off on a bit of a flight of fancy that did not MAIN COMMITTEE",197,Committees
222,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (10.13 Am),"I listened with interest to the member for Tanghave much to do with the real world that we live in-the real world that involves real facts from real scientists who have provided peer-reviewed information that insists that climate change is real. That is the first fact that I wanted to bring the member for Tangney back to. The report we have in front of us understood that very clearly. Even though we dealt with a range of farmers over a range of areas in Australia, from very wet to very dry and everything in between, farmers understood that the climate is changing. It is not just variable; they understood that the climate is changing. I too am familiar with the Garnaut report. I am not a scientist or a farmer, but I do understand the basic aspects of science. If you keep increasing the heat in a system then something will happen. If you look at page 26 of the Garnaut report and just look at the measured trends of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide-which have been measured with varying degrees of accuracy, but certainly quite accurately from the 1800s to the 1900s-there is just a clear progression. It makes scientific sense to me that if you keep increasing temperatures then something will happen. If you look at some of the other graphs in the Garnaut report, you see what Australia’s role is in terms of being one of the 20 largest greenhouse gas emitters. Even though we are a small country, our per capita emissions mean that we have a particular responsibility to the rest of the world to show some leadership. Why is that so? If you look at the history of Australia, we have always been particularly susceptible to the variations of climate-temperature, rainfall and the like. Obviously the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders were able to adapt to these harsh variabilities, whether they were fisherpeople, hunter-gatherers or whatever. If you look at the first white settlers from 1788 on, they came with European sensibilities and farming practices. They were reasonably advanced compared to the rest of Europe, but they still ended up sowing the wrong crops at the wrong time. They quickly had to learn how to be Australian farmers rather than European farmers. They had enough ingenuity. Even though the First Fleet nearly starved to death, they eventually worked out how to survive. Australian farmers, from those days to now, have always been at the coalface or the cutting edge when it comes to coping with climate change. I think ‘the cutting edge’ is a farming term, but both the coalface and the cutting edge are expressions that are out of date because the minimum tillage farming used by modern farmers is nothing like the farming that I grew up with, as we saw on some of our field trips. It was incredible what they were doing with GPS guided ploughs. They use minimum tillage so they are able to minimise disruption and produce incredible crops. In terms of our productivity gains over the last 50 years, farmers have held their heads high. They have been at the lead in the economy in terms of making sure they can produce lots of crops, take them to the world market without the subsidies of the Europeans, the United States and a few other countries, and hold their own. From what we saw from the field inspections and from the peak bodies that we interviewed in the committee, we certainly will be able to hold our own in the years to come because they understand climate variability and they understand climate change. This report brings together that intersection that we need for the future. You will always need the individual ingenuity of farmers. We always need that and the strong, financially secure farmers do that. We also need the market forces so people who make money out of innovations-fertilisers, ploughs or whatever it is-can take those innovations to the market and MAIN COMMITTEE sell them. That is one of the ways that we bring in innovation, but we also need government support and guidance and some of the peak bodies to look at opportunities that come with climate change. We have seen it. The peanut board saw that climate change was going to bring rainfall variations and said, ‘In the long term, we need to find other places to grow peanuts.’ They said, ‘There will be rain and reasonably available land in the Northern Territory and it suits peanuts, so we will go there.’ If you are sitting at home as a farmer down in Kingaroy or something like that, you might not necessarily know that. So that interaction between the peak bodies, the market and government support seems to bode well for a bright future. The member for Tangney, in his rambling discussion, mentioned the CPRS but forgot to mention the fundamental problem with the history of the CPRS as told by the members of the Liberal Party. I was in the chamber; I saw how people voted on the CPRS legislation. Apart from one bloke from the seat of Wentworth, everyone I saw was on the other side of the chamber. Everyone in the Liberal Party voted against the CPRS. They voted against bringing in a price on carbon. When the legislation went to the Senate, I held out some hope that at the Copenhagen climate change summit we might be able to stand up and show some guidance to the world, go there with a bit of certainty and say, ‘This is what we might do.’ I was hopeful. Young, optimistic, I thoughtGovernment members interjectingCopenhagen and see humanity’s finest hour. That is what I hoped. Instead, in the Senate, apart from Senator Sue Boyce from Queensland and Senator Troeth from Victoriabott got his anti-climate-change ticket up and rolled Malcolm Turnbull, they crossed the floor. When I looked over at the other side of the Senate, I could see the five Greens sitting with the National Party and Liberal Party climate change skeptics. It was a shameful moment. So we went off to Copenhagen, and a lot of great things came out of Copenhagen, but it was not humanity’s finest moment. People forget the good things that came out of Copenhagen. We got a commitment from all world leaders to hold an increase in global temperature to below two degrees Celsius. That is a commitment important to every Australian farmer, especially the marginal farmers in South Australia beyond the border. It is an important achievement: farming will continue in South Australia because of the hard work done in Copenhagen. I remind people that the two countries that worked hardest to achieve that consensus were Australia and the United Kingdom. That is something we can tell our grandchildren. We held our heads up high. We had dark moments in the Senate and on the floor of the House of Representatives but we did achieve something in Copenhagen. There is also a framework to keep track of what we are doing so that we can measure what is going on in terms of production and so that the climate change sceptics, the Lord Moncktons and the like that have grabbed the ears of those opposite, do not hold sway. The other big thing is that, obviously, it is not enough to just be committed to something; you have to put your money where your mouth is. That is what happened. All the leaders agreed on the finance necessary to support the emissions reductions and particularly the adaptations that are necessary in developing countries.

225,Mr Perrett,"Responsible people, courageous people: on the very day that Tony AbRevolution, but some of those developing countries have not. Rather than just saying, ‘Tough luck-there’s no more space at the table; you’ll just have to suffer and burn up,’ thankfully, the world’s governments had enough soul to say: ‘No, we’ll do what we can. We’ll find the finance to ensure that you can make some adaptations.’ So they were some of the good things that came out of Copenhagen. If you listen to talkback radio and some of the misguided people on the other side of the chamber, from the way they misrepresent the Copenhagen conference you might think it did not achieve anything. The reality is that the Copenhagen summit, led by the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, Minister Wong, Gordon Brown and a few others from the UK, was able to achieve some wonderful things. While it was not humanity’s finest hour, it was maybe not its darkest hour, as it is painted by some people. To return to the Farming the future report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources, it was incredible to travel around the country-although I was not able to go to Western Australia or some of the other field centres that the committee visited-and talk to the farmers and see the simple things they are doing to ensure the future of farming. For example, they are putting in something as simple as harvestable trees, which put carbon into the soil but also give a good timber yield every 20 to 25 years or something. The innovations were incredible and it was quite comforting, as someone from the bush, although I now represent a city seat-even though the Brisbane Markets are in my electorateto see that the farmers are well and truly ahead of the fact that Australia’s climate is changing, and we need to be prepared for that. It is not a matter of knee-jerk reactions and short term goals-‘It has rained this year; it will be a drought next year.’ Instead, the committee saw time after time that Australian farmers are ready to adapt to climate change. Obviously there are some recommendations there as to how we might further their preparedness, how we might further their readiness. I am sure that the government will consider those. I was quite comforted by what was happening on the farms we visited. I commend the report to everyone, and especially to the member for Tangney, as it demonstrates how prepared and how far advanced our farmers are. I am drawn to the comments of the member for Moreton. I would consider, even though he might publicly bemoan the lack of passing of the ETS, that privately his opinions might not be quite the same, given that had we passed the ETS we would be implementing a $14 billion tax a year on industry to go with the $9 billion resources tax that the government announced only two weeks ago. In fact, if he feels so strongly about it, of course the government can go to a double dissolution election on it. He and his colleagues may well wish to do that, but I suspect not. I am not a member of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources, but I do have a long standing interest in these matters. As a farmer before I entered this place, involved in agripolitics, and having a long involvement in the agricultural research community as a farmer representative, I have been looking at this report with great interest. I was particularly drawn to its chapter on research and extension. I was recently at a Canberra dinner, hosted by the Australian Institute of Agricultural Science and Technology. I was privileged to hear an address by the respected agriculture journalist Julian Cribb. He informed us that while MAIN COMMITTEE",201,Abare Says That Because There Will Be International Companies Also Producing These Prod
226,Mr Ramsey (Grey) (10.26 Am),"I am pleased to speak on the Farming the future report.the world was focusing on eight to nine billion people in 2050, in fact he believes we will have 11 billion people in the world by 2060. Surely this is an alarming figure. It will be one of the great challenges of the next 50 years and, as far as addressing the greatest moral issue of our generation is concerned-the Prime Minister used to talk about this on a regular basisfeeding this world of 11 billion people will indeed take some topping. Feeding the population is not just about things like widespread famine, as calamitous as that would be; it is about the security of the world as we know it. Most wars are caused by economic disadvantage-nothing sharpens the bayonet like starving children. At the same time as this demand increases, we will continue to lose the most productive land on the planet to urban sprawl and land degradation, and there will be increasing competition for water resources. The planet will need to double food production while at the same time we expect to lose up to 30 per cent of our arable lands. Australia has both an opportunity and an obligation to be a big part of the solution. We must unlock the untapped potential of this land. We are traditionally a supplier of food to the world. Our regional security will rely on us expanding this role. Those who believe agriculture is a sunset industry are wrong. They are wrong, they have to be wrong, because if agriculture is not a new horizon all else will fail. Collectively, the agricultural industry and parliaments have allowed governments to steadily reduce public investment in agricultural science. The road to discovery is very long, and we are still reaping the benefits of the investment of the sixties and seventies into agricultural advances. Certainly many of our scientists were trained in this time, when the prospective career paths in agricultural sciences were more attractive. Currently our agricultural training courses are well undersubscribed, and, without wishing to offend anyone, we struggle to attract the top students. There will be simply no alternative: Australia and the world will have to start seriously investing in agriculture again. Five million dollars of research funding was cut from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry budget last year, and this year another $80 million has been taken away from Caring for Our Country. In my state, South Australia, the South Australian Research and Development Institute can expect no more than standstill budgets in the foreseeable future. We must spend more. We must invest more heavily. We must promote the industry as the progressive future we need. For that we need more research and development funding in order to address this imminent threat to food production. Investment in R&D is the backbone of agricultural industry, but it has been diminishing in real terms for 25 years. We have had emergency drought aid around Australia for some years now, with mixed results. In some cases it has done what it was supposed to do and supported good producers through a tough patch. In others it has distorted the market and stopped good young farmers from investing in the industry. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Burke, has signalled the government’s intention to move away from exceptional circumstances support and has announced a pilot program in Western Australia targeting farm planning and efficiency. I wish the program well, as at least it aims to increase productivity and efficiency, but much more will be needed for our farmers to remain profitable and the world to avert a food crisis. The key to farmer and community prosperity is production advantage-to be the best cutting-edge farmers in the world. As we deal with climate change, the pressures from internaMAIN COMMITTEE tional trade, the rising costs of doing business in the Australian economy, the likely rises in inputs, and the weakness of the American dollar which will continue to reduce our competitiveness, the best possible chance we have of avoiding the periodic requests for assistance to the agricultural industry is to make sure we have a profitable sector. The best way to ensure we adapt to the impacts of climate change is to make sure we have a profitable agricultural sector. The best way of doing this is to provide the scientific horsepower to drive adaptation and the adoption of new technology. Disturbingly, we are held hostage of the green left, who tend to oppose any advances in technological agriculture as being somehow bad for the general public-as if starving to death would be a good outcome. At the current time there are still bans in South Australia on growing GM products, when the rest of the nation has moved on. Indeed, the rest of the world is moving on and we will soon see widespread adoption of this technology in China and other parts of Asia. We simply cannot limit technology; we must support and amplify it. Unfortunately at the current time we have the handbrake on. Australia’s agricultural research, development and extension effort is declining at the very time growers and rural industries need research to provide solutions to the challenges of the world’s growing population. Less funding directly impacts upon production capability, food security, natural resource management and the ability to cope with seasonal variation and climate change. Recommendations 3, 5, 6 and 7 in this Farming the future report all ask for extra research funding-recommendation 3 for soil sciences, recommendation 5 for greenhouse gas science, recommendation 6 for new technologies, and recommendation 7 for weather forecasting. I sit on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Innovation, which has just completed a report on long-term weather forecasting. That report also recommends greater funding in this area-science to assist agriculture to predict and adapt to climate change. Agriculture has maintained productivity growth of about 2.8 per cent during the past 20 years but it is starting to slow, a trend that Geoff Thomas, the President of the Australian Institute of Agricultural Science and Technology-who was the host of the dinner I attendedbelieves is directly linked to the slowing down of research. He said another major threat to Australian agriculture was the shortage of agriculture graduates. Mr Thomas said: This is at a time when Australian growers are being expected to maintain or increase productivity in the face of unprecedented cost and environmental pressures and rapidly worsening terms of trade. I welcome this report into farming for the future, particularly the chapter on research and extension. Its conclusion at paragraph 6.53 actually says that research funding in Australia is at a bare minimum to drive the industry. So this report is not a signal to kick back; it should actually have the alarm bells ringing, because, as I pointed out, in four other recommendations it asks for increased research spending. If Australia does not meet its challenge to increase food production, if it does not make its farmers profitable, the world in the end will not be secure and it will become increasingly insecure if it is not well fed, as indeed will our farmers.

228,Mr Adams,"I thank the honourable member for Grey for his contribution on the reportpull together many good recommendations on the needs and the future for farming in Australia. As I mentioned in my tabling speech, this report set out to look at the current and respective adaptations to the impact of climate change on agriculture and the potential impacts on downstream processing. It also considered the role of government in augmenting the shift towards farming practices which promote resilience in the farm sector in the face of climate change, and promoting research, extension and training which assist the farm sector to better adapt to climate change. The report covered a pretty broad area of changes that are currently going on and also gave us an insight into the barriers to change for the future. For instance, one submission noted: Rural research development and education will need to be greatly increased if Australian farmers are to remain profitable, sustainable and internationally competitive. Research and knowledge creation will not achieve the rates of change and adaptation required from Australian farmers without mechanisms to ensure its effective communication and adoption. I think that sums up a lot, including what the honourable member for Grey, the previous speaker, was saying: we need to have a lot of research and development but also education and getting that out there into the farming sector. The barriers in this case were the lack of ways of getting innovative ideas out into the community. The CCRSPI submission states on page 16: Over the past decades successive governments, both state and federal, have reduced funding to rural extension networks and shut rural research stations. This has greatly reduced the capacity of governments to assist farmers to adopt new R&D and to be able to demonstrate and commercialise new technologies and practices in the field. Others raised the point that adoption of improved practices takes time. One of the best ways to foster and accelerate the adoption rate of improved practices is through incentives and investment which reduce the barriers and risks, often financial, of adoption. A triple-objective practice/improvement/incentive program would well position Australia’s agriculture for whatever mix of emissions, carbon trading and international agreements are to be implemented in Australia. Equally importantly, this would improve Australian agriculture’s overall resilience by improving productivity and sustainability. One could say the same applies to the forest industry that is going through some restructuring traumas at the moment, especially in Tasmania. So the message was that there were currently no good pathways by which the research organisations or innovative individuals could share their knowledge in a cooperative way. Most of those pathways have been privatised, so the spread of good news can only be gained if you have the funds to pay for it or if you know where to look. Professor Frank Vanclay and Mrs Aysha Fleming identified a number of social and attitudinal barriers to climate change adaptation: Resistance to change is not just about individual reactions, it is a broader social issue. This means that resistance does not occur within an individual’s head, or because of an individual’s personal characteristics-education level, personal motivations or situation, skills or beliefs. Resistance is created by common perceptions, norms and values held in society. They also go on to say: If climate change is perceived as being too big to influence, because climate is something intangible, invisible and seemingly out of human control, it can lead to rejection. Climate change is dismissed outright, and can lead to feeling overwhelmed or hopeless. MAIN COMMITTEE So, sold badly, it all becomes too hard and farmers, like many others, are not equipped to really find out how it will affect them. Communicating a clear and consistent message on climate change is a prerequisite to successful adaptation. Governments at all levels need to undertake to deliver this message in a manner relevant to the experience of farmers, for whom managing climate variability is a long-term and everyday experience. Part of this is in understanding the decision-making processes of farmers. Another part is the creation of positive messages about how adaptation can improve business resilience, maintain or increase productivity and promote personal and social welfare. Then there are the social implications, which are highlighted only too vividly in the Rural Alive and Well submissions and discussions. There need to be options, ways forward and ways out without losing your life savings or your dignity. Remember that people have sometimes been on their land for many generations. They explained to the committee the importance of reaching out to vulnerable members of the rural community and providing support. A key role of the service was to make connections with the support services provided by government and help people access those services. One problem the service faced was the silo mentality of governments and bureaucracies; another was the lack of secure funding for the service they provided. The essential ingredients of the service they provide are intervention and building personal connections, giving people a sense that they are not facing the trials and tribulations of life alone. The consequences of such an approach were highlighted at a meeting with departmental officials and farmer representatives in Geraldton in Western Australia. The creation of a strong social support network in the region involving strong peer support and pre-emptive strategy allowed the farming community there to get through a period of severe drought in 2006 and 2007 without one instance of suicide. The success of such services, which were highlighted in Tasmania and Western Australia, shows that we should be concentrating our assistance packages in difficult circumstances to smooth the exit routes and provide support and networks where change can be managed. I believe in and support the extension of funding periods to allow stability for these services as well as ensuring that the methods of information sharing can be further investigated and maybe allow a return to state governments employing a new breed of extension officers to assist with opportunities through new ways and new thinking. We in Australia are more fortunate than many in the Western world in that we have the skills and resources to manage change as long as governments recognise the need to support and fund given the upheavals that come and go. The federal government has proved itself in successfully boosting the economy during the economic downturn. NowI believe it is the turn of the rural sector to be assisted in dealing with the changing circumstances which are bearing down on it. Climate change can be managed if understood. Its impact varies across the nation. We must be ready to ensure our rural industries are flexible and able to adapt to the changes from that as well as being able to minimise the risk of their impacts, such as through drought proofing and crop and stock variation. I hope the report is found to be useful in this ongoing discussion and I look forward to the government’s response and assistance in putting the recommendations in place. It was a pleasure to do the report. It was about a year’s work for the committee, who worked hard through its visits and through its meetings with people in Canberra. There are several points MAIN COMMITTEE that I would like to touch on. One concerns recommendation 3 of the report where we touch on soil stabilisation and pasture improvement using such methods as having annual pastures instead of open soil, pasture cropping, putting wheat straight into a pasture and rotation grazing, which has probably been around some time but is new in many areas whereby people only graze a paddock for a couple of days and move the stock on so that the grasses grow and are not eaten right down. That is a whole new concept coming into play there. There is biodynamic farming and minimumor no-till cultivation and controlled traffic farming. Of course no-till or minimum-till agriculture farming as to moisture, as I think they call it, is on the Liverpool Plains. It is quite interesting to see the way that they have gone about that. I think they claim that they retain two per cent extra moisture in the soil by not turning the soil and keeping the old stubble on top of the soil, therefore the following crop grows straight into the soil. It has its issues which they are continuing to deal with as they move into that sort of new concept. Controlled traffic farming is where you take the tractor or the machinery along the same wheel lines down the paddock every time so that you do not compact the soil and therefore destroy many of the good things such as the micro-organisms et cetera in the soil. You would also be wasting fertiliser and seed if you were to put them in areas which got chopped up by wheels. These are emerging opportunities for rural Australia. Getting the position right globally is important. Getting manufacturers to make wheel alignments so that contractors can buy the same wheel line-ups for that sort of work will take some time, but it is important for the future of agriculture in Australia. Soil water retention strategies are important, as I said, to reduce the cultivation of soils and to retain moisture in them. AgainI would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the House, who worked so well with me, and also the member for Hume, my deputy, and the staff of the secretariat who bravely stepped at times where others feared to go. Farming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change and begin by commending the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources, the committee’s chair-the member for Lyons-and the secretariat for its work on this very important national issue. Since European settlement of Australia, our farming sector has been crucial to Australia’s prosperity and the well-being of the Australian people. Animal farming, cereal crops, horticulture, wine growing and vegetable growing are major industry sectors that underpin the economy of communities around Australia. I understand that, on the latest figures available to me, which were the figures for the year 2008-09, agricultural exports alone were worth $32 billion to our nation. The income generated from these farming communities in turn has a flow-on effect on numerous other industry sectors as well as being of critical importance to Australia’s balance of trade net position. Furthermore, the production of quality agricultural products has been and will continue to be critical to the good health and health costs of the nation. Since World War II, employment in the agricultural sector has been in decline, primarily because of automation. If you travel around Australia-and certainly in my own state of South Australia-there are many country towns that 40, 50 and 60 years ago were fairly prosperous small communities. Many of them today are very much in decline and some of them MAIN COMMITTEE",204,Abare Says That Because There Will Be International Companies Also Producing These Prod
229,Mr Zappia (Makin) (10.50 Am),"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this report titledhave effectively closed down altogether because we need fewer people to carry out the farming operations that, years ago, were carried out by entire families, and certainly many more people were directly involved in the industry. What we have been seeing in recent times, however, is not only a threat to employment in the agricultural sector but also a threat to the productive capacity of the sector. There have been several factors which have contributed to these threats. Climate change is undoubtedly the most significant of these factors, with the last decade being clear evidence of the impact to Australia’s farming sector of climate change. Rising temperatures, heatwaves, droughts, floods, tornadoes, cyclones, fires, disease and pests are all associated with climatic changes and all can have devastating effects on farming. On the issue of pests, only yesterday the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry outlined a government response to the locust plague that farmers around Australia are facing right now. It is a plague which is seeing the eggs being laid right now and which will break out into a full-blown plague perhaps in spring, right at the worse possible time for farmers. Having recently travelled through the Riverland areas of South Australia and Victoria, I saw for myself what that locust plague is doing and the number of locusts already affecting farms in those areas. It is truly frightening for those people whose livelihood depends on producing a product which can literally, in one or two days, be entirely wiped out. All of those kinds of risks have been faced by the farming community for years and years, but there is no doubt at all that those risks, as a result of climate change, are now more unpredictable and likely to be more frequent. We saw only last year in Northern Queensland the effects of the floods. We heard stories from members of this House who represent constituencies in those areas about the devastation to farming communities as a result of those floods. We are told by the scientific community that those floods are likely to occur more often and be more unpredictable. It is that kind of unpredictability that makes farming even more risky than ever before. In that respect, the farming community of Australia and the farmers themselves understand weather as well as anyone. They understand the risks they are taking and in the past have been able to adapt to them and cope with them. But I believe it is going to get tougher and tougher for them as our climate continues to change in a way that we have never seen before. The severe impacts of climate change on the Australian farming sector were recognised by former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer as far back as 2001. He noted at the time that the impacts would increase in the future. How right he was. That was a decade ago. It was a decade before we saw effectively one of the worse decades in our history in respect of drought in this country and a decade where the farming sector was truly put under severe strain as a result of that. Of course, there has been much more research on and a better understanding of climate change over the last decade. The evidence continues to mount that we will face more extreme weather events in the future, that global temperatures will continue to rise and that rainfall patterns will change. We have seen in the last century alone an increase in temperature here in Australia of 0.7 degrees, most of which occurred in the last 50 years. The trends suggest that by the end of this century temperatures will have increased by another one degree. In fact, although I do not have it with me, I noticed a report in one of the newspapers-it was yesterday, I believe-which talked about temperature rises over the next 200 years that will make MAIN COMMITTEE some parts of this earth almost uninhabitable. Those are certainly long-term predictions and things may well turn out to be different to that, but they are certainly warning signs and ringing alarm bells that we should be taking note of. If we do, we may be in a much better position at the right time to respond to those changes because we might have adapted to them or in some cases we might have been able to prevent them. All of these changes have impacted and will continue to impact on the farming sector, as I said a moment ago. I am sure that farmers will be at the forefront of providing the appropriate adaptive mechanisms. In my own state of South Australia those effects have been most noticeable in the Riverland region, which is the region I mentioned a few moments ago. The combination of drought, record low Murray River inflows and international market competition has been disastrous to the region. I note that the committee was unable to come to South Australia but, if in the future there is an opportunity for a similar committee to do so, the Riverland region of South Australia is certainly worth visiting in terms of understanding other aspects of the effects of climate change on the community. The Riverland community of South Australia has a population of around 35,000. Fifty per cent of South Australia’s grapes are grown in that region. It is also a prime area for the growing of citrus, cherries and olives. BecauseI have a lot of friends and acquaintances who are property owners in the Riverland region, I am aware of the impact the last 10 years have had on their region. Firstly, it began with competition from overseas, when the price for what they were producing was being undercut by overseas competitors-both affecting their export trade and impacting directly on their local markets. That in itself was difficult enough to contend with. They then had the wine industry also under intense pressure from overseas suppliers and growers. We saw wine prices begin to decline. On top of that they were then hit with the drought and low water levels in the Murray River which, in turn, meant that their water allocations were insufficient to enable many of them to produce their full quantum of crops. As a result, if you drive through the Riverland you will see long-term plantings ripped out and lying there waiting to be destroyed and you will see whole fruit blocks abandoned. You will also see that a lot of the farmers from that region have put their properties on the market for sale. All of these are clear signs of the difficulties that they have had to contend with. They have certainly done it tough. Individual farm production has dropped and we have seen families at both health and financial crisis points. In that respect I commend the committee on its very first recommendation, which talks about supporting groups such as Rural Alive and Well. I have spoken with people who act as counsellors and advisers in the Riverland region of South Australia and have heard directly from them some of the stories about the difficulties being faced by people from their region-the financial difficulties and the health impacts on families, particularly on the mental health of some of the farmers from that area. Most of those people are very proud people-they will not ask for help. They will do what they can to ensure that they survive, but at times the pressure just gets too much for them. If farming production continues to decline in Australia it will affect not only the farming communities but all Australians. Reliance on countries that do not implement food production standards similar to the standards that are applied in Australia is a real concern to me, as it is to most Australians I talk to. I know that most Australian farmers are well informed and responsible in their use of chemicals, pesticides and fertilisers in food production. I do not have MAIN COMMITTEE the same confidence about imported foods. What is just as concerning is that most consumers do not know the origin of the food they consume, which highlights the need to have clear labelling laws in place in Australia. I have spoken with farmers here in Australia and I have confidence that they do understand the impacts of the chemicals they use. Sometimes those chemicals are absolutely necessary to prevent disease or pests, but farmers understand the effects of chemicals on humans who consume their food, so they take the right precautionary approaches when they use those chemicals. Regrettably, that is not necessarily the case with food grown overseas. While we have import standards in place, the reality is that we simply cannot check all the food that is imported into this country to the degree that we would like to ensure that it has not been grown using, for example, pesticides that have been banned in this country or other fertilisers or chemical treatments that we would never use. Those chemicals were banned in this country because of their effects on health, so when we consume food from overseas countries we cannot have the same level of certainty about the possible health outcomes. That, in turn, impacts on the nation’s health budget because there is no question that good food gives you good health outcomes and bad food does the opposite. If we have poorer health outcomes because of the food that we are eating, there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that our health costs will continue to spiral and add another layer of burden onto governments trying to manage Australia’s health budgets. If we had clearer labelling laws, at least consumers would have a greater opportunity to choose the foods that they purchase when they go into supermarkets. I suspect that, if they could choose, we would find that more of them would choose the Australian grown product. And that would in turn-getting back to an earlier argument I put-support the growers here in Australia because I suspect that most Australians would like to think that they are supporting Australian growers when they do buy their food. There is another element to the purchase of products from overseas: because they are grown the way they are, they are grown generally much cheaper than locally produced products. We live in a society where we have two major supermarket chains that in turn dictate the price at the farm gate for all products. That is also putting intense pressure on growers. I am well aware that many growers, in order to secure big contracts with those two major supermarket chains, agree to prices that make it absolutely borderline as to whether they can make their farms viable and continue to survive. They have no option because, if they do not provide products at those prices, they do not provide products at all because the two major supermarkets are the outlets for most of the food grown in this country. So it becomes very difficult. The combination of international competition, market domination by the supermarket chains and now climate change means that the future of Australia’s agriculture and farming sectors will be fraught with uncertainty. For those reasons, the work of the committee-in acknowledging the risks to farmers associated with climate change, outlining a series of strategies aimed at mitigating the impacts of climate change and putting in measures to assist affected communities-is in the national interest. I particularly acknowledge the emphasis placed by the committee on the need for more research across a range of areas and the important role government has in that research. There is no question that the research carried out by CSIRO and others is of vital importance to the MAIN COMMITTEE future survival of agricultural and farming industries in this country. I also note the section of the report that talks about farmers being involved in that research. I emphasise that point because I think there is a great deal of merit in it. Farmers understand their land and their products. They understand changing climatic conditions, and I think they understand the science behind the production of their products. Therefore, it is absolutely important that we include them in research. I commend the report to the House. Committee on Primary Industries and Resources on their report Farming the future: the role of government in assisting Australian farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change. I particularly commend the chair of the committee, Dick Adams; the deputy chair, Alby Schultz; and, indeed, the members. This is a bipartisan report and it shows that there is a deep concern among members of this House about the effects of climate change across the country. This report deals with the effects on the farming community, and it follows a report by another standing committee of the House of Representatives-the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts, chaired by the member for Throsby. It reported last year to this House on the effects of climate change on coastal management, particularly in relation to planning issues. Reports of this type show that there is an understandable and entirely proper concern among members of this House with the effects of climate change, which are real, which are being observed across the country, which will affect the lives of everybody in Australia and which do call for action by governments and all Australians. I would start with this observation. It has been noted most recently by the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology and it can be summarised in this way: Australia will be hotter in coming decades Australian average temperatures are projected to rise by 0.6 to 1.5 ºC by 2030. If global greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow at rates consistent with past trends, warming is projected to be in the range of 2.2 to 5.0 ºC by 2070 … Much of Australia will be drier in coming decades We have already observed the average surface air temperature of Australia increasing by 0.7 degrees Centigrade over the past century, and that warming has been accompanied by marked declines in regional precipitation, in particular along the east and west coasts of the continent. These seemingly quite small changes in temperature are already having profound effects across the continent, which is, as we all know, the hottest and driest continent on earth. Even if all greenhouse gas emissions ceased today, the earth would still be committed to an additional warming of somewhere between 0.2 degrees Centigrade and one degree Centigrade by the end of the century. These real effects are what make it necessary for all industries, including agricultural industries, to adapt to the changes that are already occurring and will continue to occur. What this report does is make a series of considered recommendations. They are conservative recommendations-they show a conservative approach-and perhaps that is why the report attracted bipartisan support. They are conservative in a way that can be contrasted directly with the crazy radical approach that has been adopted by the Leader of the Opposition and indeed by Senator Minchin on this subject.

230,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (11.07 Am),"I commend the House of Representatives StandingIt is a matter of extreme puzzlement as to why the Leader of the Opposition and the gang of climate change deniers that are now controlling the opposition have made climate change denial a plank in the coalition’s platform.

The approach taken in this report is conservative. Senator Minchin, the Leader of the Opposition and the gang that they are with are crazy radicals. They are reckless in the face of the overwhelming consensus of climate scientists, not only in this country but across the world. Senator Minchin and the Leader of the Opposition want to line up with the tiny minority who are denying the science. A true conservative would say that, given the scale of the cataclysmic events that are predicted, if there is even a one per cent chance of those events occurring we should be doing everything possible to conserve the world which gives us life. A lot of this denial ideology, which we see on a daily basis from people on the opposition benches and, in particular, from the Leader of the Opposition, is taken directly from Republican Party hardliners in the United States. It is the Republican Party of Sarah Palin. I am happy to say that even some Republicans in the United States understand what the true conservative position is. I can indeed quote from a perhaps unlikely source: the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has fought against the climate change deniers in the Republican Party in the United States. He spoke very eloquently, using a medical scenario, which I will paraphrase: 98 doctors out of 100 say to you that your child has a particular ailment and the cure for that ailment is a particular medicine, and two adamantly say, ‘Absolutely not; we don’t think your child has that ailment and, even if your child does, that is not the cure.’ Governor Schwarzenegger said-rightly; it is what any parent would do-‘I go with the 98.’ That is simply the precautionary principle, a principle recognised in environmental science and in Australian environmental law. We do not ask for certainty before taking action to prevent environmental damage; we act on probabilities. We act on proper risk assessments, just as we do in other spheres of life. That is why this report is properly viewed as taking a true conservative approach. It recognises that the effects of climate change are happening, even if there is some doubt about the extent of those effects. For example, it is known that one effect of climate change will be less frost and therefore there will be a temporary benefit to agriculture in some areas of Australia, but overall the likely effect of climate change will be less rain over most of the continent and greater evaporation because of hotter temperatures over most of the continent, and agriculture will become more difficult. That is why the recommendations in this report which are directed to increased research by the Commonwealth government on issues affecting farmers and agriculture are appropriate, as is an analysis of government policy generally as to how government policy can guard against the potentially disastrous effects on agriculture. All of these are to be commended. However, on a daily basis, we have had a continuation of the Leader of the Opposition’s position that climate change is absolute crap. He was at it again last week, speaking to primary school children in Adelaide and telling them, bizarrely, that it was warmer ‘at the time of Julius Caesar and Jesus of Nazareth’ than now. Rightly, scientists across Australia have condemned the Leader of the Opposition, who should know better. The President of the Australian Academy of Science, Professor Kurt Lambeck, was quoted as saying: MAIN COMMITTEE … true scepticism was fine, but required looking at published data with an open mind. “To make these glib statements to school students, I think, is wrong. It’s not encouraging them to be sceptical, it’s encouraging them to accept unsubstantiated information.” The Leader of the Opposition is seeking to disagree with Australia’s Chief Scientist, the Bureau of Meteorology, the CSIRO, the overwhelming majority of climate scientists in Australia and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose work is supported by Australia. I am hoping that the Leader of the Opposition will wake up, that Senator Minchin will depart and that the coalition will start to adopt a true conservative position, which is to preserve the earth which preserves us. That is why I commend the report of this committee for taking a true conservative position which acknowledges the risks to Australian agriculture and calls for action. Debate (on motion by Mr Hayes) adjourned. Treaties Committee Report Debate resumed from 15 March, on motion by Mr Kelvin Thomson: That the House take note of the report. Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (11.18 am)-I wish to speak today about the extradition treaty between Australia and the Republic of India that forms part of report No. 110 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. My concern is not with this treaty per se but with certain aspects of Australia’s extradition treaties in general. I was first alerted to these issues when JSCOT considered the extradition treaty between Australia and the United Arab Emirates in 2008 in the context of the committee’s report No. 91. First, I want to acknowledge that extradition treaties are an important part of Australia’s criminal justice system and that they contribute to the effort to combat transnational organised crime, which has been made easier through modern international travel and communication technologies. We do not want Australia to become a safe haven for persons who have committed serious crimes in other countries. It is also in Australia’s interest and part of its duty as a good global citizen to cooperate with other countries as much as possible. However, it is with a measure of concern that I note the international trend towards a ‘no evidence’ standard for extradition cases, which means that, with most extradition requests received by Australia, a determination of guilt or innocence is regarded as a matter for the courts of the requesting state. While this has meant more expeditious processing of extradition cases-and I acknowledge that an in-depth examination of the possibility of the death penalty or torture being applied takes place prior to an extradition decision being taken-nevertheless, the no evidence standard means that a person can be extradited on the basis of quite limited information. I note that this is not the case for certain countries, including the United States, South Korea and India, which still require a prima facie case to be made out from the evidence that the person to be extradited could be found guilty of criminal conduct. During the public hearing with regard to the extradition treaty with the UAE, the CEO of Civil Liberties Australia, Mr William Rowlings, said the following: In talking about ministerial prerogative, our paper makes clear that there are effectively no standards or guidelines by which the minister is to make a serious judgement as to whether or not a person is to be extradited from Australia. The minister is not obliged to consider evidence and has only to consider MAIN COMMITTEE information. This is a very low standard of level of satisfaction that any case has actually been made out. In effect, the minister is acting in a similar role to a committing magistrate in Australia but without the person to be extradited receiving the benefit of any of the legal protections of someone in a committal procedure in a court of law in Australia. Such a person cannot argue their case and see or know what the information is that has been put before the minister, and there is no mechanism for the person in question to receive any hearing to counter any allegations or to make a case for nonextradition. According to Civil Liberties Australia, the person who is the subject of the extradition request is not entitled to see or know what information has been provided about them and their country’s circumstances to Australia. I think it is entirely fair to ask how a person who is the subject of an extradition request is meant to legitimately resist their extradition in such circumstances. They would be denied the natural justice right to know and respond to the terms in which they are accused, and Australia is in turn denied the important opportunity to perceive any possible inconsistencies or other shortcomings in the nature or process of the extradition request. However, the most disturbing aspect of the extradition system as I see it is that Australia’s involvement with an extradited person ends the moment they are extradited. Also during the inquiry into the extradition treaty with the UAE, an officer from the Attorney-General’s Department stated the following: There is no formal regime for follow-up reflected in our treaties or reflected in our practice. When it comes to extradition of Australian nationals, Australia has consular responsibilities and has the ability-and in practice it does this-to follow up the situation of the person who is being returned. However, when you have a circumstance whereby someone might be travelling through Australia and is sought for extradition, say, from the country in which they are a citizen, we do not have a mechanism in which we actually continue to check the prison conditions in which the person is being kept or continue to check on the processes that have been undertaken. In effect, Australia accepts the undertaking of the relevant country and that is where it stands. In its treaties report No. 91, including the extradition treaty with the United Arab Emirates, to monitor the trial status, health and conditions of detention of people extradited from Australia. The government did not accept these recommendations on the grounds that, inter alia: it is not aware of any precedents for such a requirement in existing bilateral and multilateral extradition agreements; potential bilateral treaty partners would not accept a requirement to report on persons extradited from Australia, on the basis that it would provide an administrative burden that would hinder the operation of a treaty partner’s judicial system; … … … the conditions of extradited non citizens is a matter for their country of nationality. During JSCOT’s inquiry into the extradition treaty with India, the Attorney-General’s Department reiterated the government’s response and added: if a credible monitoring process was to be undertaken by Australia this would involve issues of resources and infringement of the sovereignty of the country requesting the extradition … With regard to the claim that requiring information from a treaty partner concerning the fate of the extradited person would be ‘an administrative burden that would hinder the operation of a treaty party’s judicial system’, I believe this is significantly overstated when you consider that Australia assists with an average of 17 extraditions per year. So, if in 17 cases we ask for brief annual information for two or three years following the extradition about what happened MAIN COMMITTEE in the trial, whether the person was acquitted or convicted, and the place and conditions of their detention, I fail to see how this could conceivably constitute an administrative burden that would hinder a country’s judicial system. During the hearing, an officer from the Attorney-General’s Department also suggested that if we were to have a requirement for countries to provide information after the extradition, it would be pointless because we would have to take countries at their word or involve ourselves in burdensome monitoring. In my view this is not borne out by experience. Being required to report makes countries more attentive to due process. Many successful campaigns by Amnesty International on behalf of political prisoners are a testament to the fact that knowing you are being watched is an incentive to better behaviour. With regard to the department’s argument that a follow-up mechanism would somehow infringe on that other country’s sovereignty, I note that whenever a country enters into an international treaty it is willingly giving up a part of its sovereignty. Indeed, a request by another country to extradite a person from Australia is also an infringement of Australia’s sovereignty, involving considerable time and expense for Australia. Why should we not require certain information from that country in return? The fact that something has not been done before is a poor argument against good policy. In its report No.110, JSCOT has rejected the department’s arguments, as I have just outlined, and confirmed its support for the principle and practice of follow-up and monitoring. The committee recommended that new and revised extradition agreements should explicitly include a requirement for monitoring the follow-up of the cases of extradited persons. The committee noted that monitoring extradited persons would be a means of mitigating the risks associated with a no-evidence standard. I strongly believe that the rising trend in extradition arrangements towards the no-evidence standard, in combination with the absence of any follow-up and monitoring, has the potential to undermine the positive trend towards greater international accountability and transparency and respect for human rights. It is now common for international human rights and environmental treaties to contain mechanisms for follow-up and monitoring. As the chair of JSCOT, the member for Wills, said in presenting report No.110 to the parliament: Given the immense amount of work involved in any extradition, it does not seem unreasonable to ask countries to tell us, for example a year later, what happened to the extradited person. Are they in jail serving a sentence? Were they executed? Did they disappear? It is not unreasonable for us to simply ask what became of them. Debate (on motion by Mr Hayes) adjourned. Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories Report Debate resumed from 11 May, on motion by Ms Annette Ellis: That the House take note of the report. in one sense, to speak on this bill, and I will explain the ambivalence and then explain the pleasurable parts of this bill. This is a report on the Territories Law Reform Bill 2010 and it was carried out by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, of which I am a member. I compliment the authors of the report-the staff of the comMAIN COMMITTEE",211,Abare Says That Because There Will Be International Companies Also Producing These Prod
231,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.27 Am),"Today it gives me some pleasure and ambivalence,mittee-for their hard work, as indeed I compliment my fellow members. I was ill for part of the compiling of this and I think they have delivered a very good report. This report is about prescribing the process for selecting and dismissing the Chief Minister and ministers, as well as determining their roles and responsibilities, on Norfolk Island. In fact, most of this, other than a few sections on the Cocos Islands and Christmas Island, is about Norfolk Island. It establishes a no-confidence motion process for the Chief Minister. It allows the Norfolk Island Administrator to have greater access to a range of advice when bills come before him for assent. It allows the Governor General and the minister responsible for territories to take a more active role in the introduction and passage of Norfolk Island legislation. It talks about reform of the voting system of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly and providing more certainty about when elections are held. It establishes a customised and proportionate financial framework which provides for responsible management of public moneys and public property, preparation of budgets, financial reporting, annual reports and procurement. It provides for the appointment by the Commonwealth of a financial officer for Norfolk Island should that be required; the appointment of the Commonwealth Auditor General to conduct audits of Norfolk Island, as he would of other government agencies; amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act which will confer on the AAT a merits review jurisdiction for specific decisions of the Norfolk Island legislature; and amendments to the Freedom of Information Act to apply on Norfolk Island. It also allows the Commonwealth Ombudsman to assume functions on Norfolk Island and to become the Norfolk Island Ombudsman. Norfolk Island public sector agencies will also be required to adhere to information privacy provisions in the same manner as the Australian government public sector agencies on the mainland. A lot of those are eminently sensible matters but, as this report reveals, they have been matters of some contention for the people of Norfolk Island. I think it would be fair to say that there has not always been a happy relationship between the Commonwealth and Norfolk Island. It has never gone into really bad territory, but the 2,000-odd people on Norfolk Island take on a huge responsibility in running the government. The Norfolk Island government not only assumes the responsibilities of a territory government in the absence of the state but also assumes the responsibilities of a territory government and the local government obligations that apply to an island of that size. So it has a dual role and, as such, it is a very responsible role. It has always been my contention that the Commonwealth has been too harsh with Norfolk Island over the years. Some of my colleagues on both sides of the House do not agree with me on that. Whether we like it or not, the formation of Norfolk Island came about when the Pitcairn Islanders in the 1850s petitioned Queen Victoria for a new home. They were granted the old penal colony of Norfolk Island, and the bulk of the population moved there. Mr Adams interjectingthrough the chair. the case one way or the other, other than to say that the spirit of the thing was that Queen Victoria, who was the supremo of this part of the world at the time this unusual event occurred, when the Pitcairn Islanders had outlived the resources of their island, gave them residency on MAIN COMMITTEE",215,Jscot Made A Number Of Recommendations With The Intention Of Seeing A Process Established
232,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Georganas),Order! Please keep your comments,216,Jscot Made A Number Of Recommendations With The Intention Of Seeing A Process Established
233,Mr Neville,"I think that has always been a matter of contention. I do not want to argueNorfolk Island. Over the years various forms of government have developed. Norfolk Island has been under the jurisdiction of New South Wales, Tasmania and New Zealand, and back to New South Wales; more recently, it has been under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. They have been pushed from pillar to post but it has always been my contention that the spirit of letting Norfolk Islanders have an independent lifestyle was inherent in Queen Victoria’s actions. Most Australian governments have observed that, not necessarily to a great extent but to some extent. I feel that, now that we are proposing a reformation of some of the laws and processes of Norfolk Island, we should take into account that spirit of allowing Norfolk Islanders an independent lifestyle and not overburden them with Australian control and bureaucracy. I, for one, think it would be an outrage to reduce Norfolk Island, as some people suggested a few years ago, to being a shire council of New South Wales or something of that nature. I do not think that that would be acceptable. I just want to put that on the record, because I think the Commonwealth could do a bit more than it has done in the past for Norfolk Island, irrespective of whether it pays tax. Forget this perennial argument that, because it does not pay tax and it is a tax haven, it is not entitled to this or that. Any outback town in western New South Wales, western Queensland, Western Australia or wherever, regardless of what they return to Commonwealth revenue by way of taxation, whether it be a lot or a little, would not be denied a hospital or some major facility such as that if it were needed. The island runs a very good hospital there, but it is old and needs replacing. My view is that the Commonwealth should kick-start things like that. I do not think that the island should be indulged, but I think a few things should be put right. Another thing that offends me isMr Adams interjectingmistic view of people. When Norfolk Island’s airport needs resealing periodically, companies are brought in from New Zealand and Australia to do that. When that happens I think the Commonwealth should take the opportunity, while they have the hot mix and all the various screenings and things that you need to do roadworks and runway works, to upgrade a number of streets on the island. In fact, an offer was made some years ago by one of the companies that, for another $1 million, they would do work on most of the streets. Because, let us face it, it is a very difficult thing to do bitumen work on a little island, with a population of only 2,000 people, or 3,000 if you want to count the tourists at a peak period. I wanted to put those things on the record at the beginning, because I, as a member of this committee and as an Australian, tend to think that we should consider Norfolk Island as our third territory. We talk about six states and two territories, but I would prefer that we talked about six states and three territories. We acknowledge Norfolk Island as one of our territories. We respect its independence as a territory to do certain functions of government and we do not interfere any more than we need to. But, having said that, I share a lot of the recommendations of this report. One recommendation is that, once the Norfolk Island parliament meets, it should elect a Speaker and a Deputy Speaker, which has to take place for the good running of the government, and the next thing it should do is appoint a Chief Minister. I agree with that because, as it does not have a well-developed party system, nor would it be appropriate to have a well-developed party system where you have only 2,000 or 3,000 people involved, it has to meet to decide who will be MAIN COMMITTEE",216,Jscot Made A Number Of Recommendations With The Intention Of Seeing A Process Established
234,Mr Neville,"Let us not get down into that sort of stuff. I always like to take an optithe leader. It will not necessarily be the leader of the biggest political party on the island. It establishes that the nine elected members recognise someone as a leader. That person then appoints his ministers, as would the premiers and the chief ministers of the other states and territories, whereas, under the old system, they were all elected. The Commonwealth recognises the right of Norfolk Island to carry out the same procedures as the other states and territories, and I think that is a good thing. I see that my colleague opposite agrees with me on that. Although it is not specifically laid down in this report, I also think it is fair enough that we should have a more clearly defined method for elections. The island uses the Illinois system, which has its good points and bad points. But I think it should be more in keeping with what exists on the mainland as part of the general Australian experience. As such, it should be tailored to that island to give a good result and reflect what the people of the island feel about the nine people they want to elect. There will be a provision-it is recommended in this report-for a financial officer if that is required. Sometimes in a small territory like this you lack a skill in your government. It is fair enough that Norfolk Island should be able to ask for-or the Commonwealth should insist; whichever is the case-a financial officer should it be required. The appointment of the Commonwealth Auditor-General to be the Auditor-General for Norfolk Island is also a good measure. No-one should object to that. There are amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act so that the AAT merits review jurisdiction should apply on the island. Freedom of information should be available. Far from these things denigrating the authority of the island, I think they enhance it. I think they say, ‘Hey, you’re up there now.’ It is good to see the Minister for Home Affairs in here, because he has done quite well with this report. It has raised the tenor of the thing and given the islanders a greater deal of recognition. I think the move with the Commonwealth Ombudsman is also a good one. There is one other provision I would like to talk about. I hope the minister will insist on this with his department. One of the things that has dogged the relationship between Norfolk Island and the Commonwealth, that has dogged progress on the island, has been the slow response from the Australian bureaucracy even to matters that are purely administrative in nature. To have to wait six months for bills to be approved by the Commonwealth is a bit weak. To some extent it takes from Norfolk Island a measure of the true meaning of self government. Keeping the ministry to four and the backbench to four, with a speaker, also reflects a separation of powers that has long been required. (Time expired) speech on the advisory report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories on the Territories Law Reform Bill 2010. I know his long-ranging commitment to Norfolk Island. He has done a lot of work on the external territories committee for a long period of time. I know his concern about making sure that we do not change things on the island. I differ with him slightly about the taxation side of it, but I agree with him that we do not want to take away the assembly. I do not think that is the correct direction. The Minister for Home Affairs has done a good job in working through and discussing matters with the Chief Minister and others. Our committee has been there and has produced MAIN COMMITTEE",217,Jscot Made A Number Of Recommendations With The Intention Of Seeing A Process Established
235,Mr Adams (Lyons) (11.42 Am),"I commend the honourable member for Hinkler for histhis report. Our committee has, over the years, brought down many reports that seek change. Some of them are addressed in this bill, which deals with transparency, right to appeal and administrative law issues which are costly if you have to set them up in a small community. It still leaves the assembly there to deal with its own affairs, while making it into a more Westminster-type system. There will now be one member of a political party elected to the assembly who can claim to be the Leader of the Opposition there. So there is a movement in that direction. But Norfolk is sort of governed by committee. I do not think that is a council process; I think the executive should make decisions and stand by and sell its decisions, as we do in this parliament, and oppositions or others can say why they do not think that is right. I see that situation emerging and I see it as a good process. Accountability and transparency in small decision-making areas with small councils-the member for Hinkler represents some and I do too-is always difficult. Sometimes you have to be brave to make decisions in some of those areas if you think something is particularly right. So this is a good direction and I commend the minister and the people in the Attorney General’s Department who have done some work in the area. Our committee worked pretty hard to make sure that the islanders and government had their opportunity to put submissions to us, and we have dealt with several of their issues within our report. I think we are really getting there. During the term of the last government there was a recommendation and a cabinet submission to wipe them out as an authority. That did not pass and we have now got to this stage. I think we are going in the right direction. The report before the parliament also deals with the Christmas Island Act 1958 and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955 to provide some vesting mechanisms for functions under the Western Australian law and how they apply to the Indian Ocean territories, leading to greater efficiency in the administration of service delivery arrangements. This goes to the point that the member for Hinkler made about having three territories. We would have to have a couple more if Christmas Islanders sought to come to a parliamentary arrangement over the years as well; and, of course, we have got Antarctica. I do not know if the leader of the Antarctic mission down there who has the responsibility of governing, with the laws and employment issues of the Antarctic division, wants it to be called-although we do call it such-a territory, but it throws up other issues to do so. The report is certainly an accumulation of many visits and lots of discussion, and some of those discussions helped move it forward. The islanders do, I think, sometimes get a little locked into their ways. Being a Tasmanian, I know that this is the way of islanders-that you can go inward and not outward. However, it is often important to look outward on an island to find solutions and also to make sure that you are keeping up with the rest of the world. Speaking broadly, I think they might need to do that more in regard to some of their views. There are some good jobs in this parliament, and I am sure that the member for Hinkler would agree that there are sometimes bad ones. Enduring hostile public meetings as a member of parliament is not all that good, but visiting Norfolk Island is always one of the pleasures of being on the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. It is a magnificent island and a beautiful place with delightful people. It is also, of course, enormously important in the history of our nation, and those of us who have had ancestors there feel some connection to it. After the first settlement of Norfolk Island closed in 1813 all the MAIN COMMITTEE people on Norfolk Island were moved to New Norfolk, which is in the electorate of Lyons, or Norfolk Plains, which is my home now, and the northern midlands. So those connections with my ancestry are big and strong. Of course, Tasmania governed Norfolk Island for some years along with New Zealand, and there was a very interesting situation regarding the power and politics, and in particular the location of the bishop’s see, of the Anglican Church that looked after Norfolk Island over the years. There was a mistake of latitude on one occasion and it ended up in New Zealand. The Bishop of New Zealand had half the island and I think someone else had the other half, which caused a few problems. But maybe they wanted to visit the island and enjoy the beauty of it. The culture of the island is very nice, but it is not the stereotype of the South Seas, and I don’t think they should go there with that view. It has a different history. Its flora is not the palm tree; it is the beautiful Norfolk pine. That was the reason Captain Cook, when he landed there, wrote in his journal about the Norfolk pines being used for ships. He wrote too about being to use the flax that he saw growing there. Unfortunately, neither worked out very well for the British Navy or the future settlement. It has been a part of Australia since 13 weeks after the first settlement at Sydney Cove and it is a magnificent piece of Australia. I recommend that every Australian should visit it. The governance of the island, as I have said, is by an assembly backed up by an administrator of the Australian government, with the current federal member of Canberra, Annette Ellis, being the member of that area. That is another matter to tidy up that is mentioned in the report. Anyone that lives there as an Australian citizen can name their electorate. That disperses the electoral opportunities for the island. One recommendation is that we bring everybody into the one federal electorate under this recommendation, and that is probably a good thing. One of the issues the island has is waste management-dealing with its waste, and getting some waste off the island and transporting it somewhere. I first came across this when I was on the treaties committee. I thought that we as a nation would not have any problems the dumping at sea treaty, but someone said we did have because there was an issue in Norfolk with what was put into the sea. Eradicating Argentine ants has become a real issue for them. They are working hard, but it is a small island and it is difficult to deal with that sort of pest. Water quality and the findings that have just come forward is also a real issue. There are also issues around the absence of worker’s compensation protocols and applications of the Trade Practices Act and other Commonwealth legislation which would help give some people opportunities to state their case and deal with issues in which they have concerns. These, I think, will be picked up through the legislation which is before the parliament. The committee noted in its report its deep concern about the findings of the water assessment report on Norfolk Island. The health of Norfolk Island’s natural waterways is poor and in places contaminated. There were other environmental issues raised. They were of considerable and sufficient seriousness for the committee to urge the government of Norfolk Island and the Commonwealth to take immediate action to resolve them as they certainly pose serious threats to the health and safety of residents and, of course, to visitors to the island. With only 2,000 residents, it is always difficult to deal with issues like water quality, and it can take a lot of intellectual rigour to find solutions. Water comes from aquifers and local bores, which are used throughout, but sanitary issues are not dealt with adequately. I think the CommonMAIN COMMITTEE wealth government put the last scheme in, and the honourable member for Hinkler probably remembers and knows more about that than I do. One of the submissions from the Norfolk Island government proposed the establishment of a working group of officials from Norfolk Island and the Commonwealth to determine suitable ways forward and asked that outcomes be modelled, like in the ombudsman process, that successfully incorporate requirements of the Commonwealth ombudsman to deal with some of the complaint issues that are continuing to come forward on the island. Like the member for Hinkler, I believe that there are lots of opportunities for moving forward. I am very interested to see Norfolk Island look at solar opportunities into the future to bring down their diesel costs, which are pretty steep. The Commonwealth could certainly assist with wind and solar issues, which would be one way of bringing down the costs. Island economies are always looking for ways to do that. Being from an island, I have made a study over the years of transport issues. Dealing with those sorts of issues on an island is always difficult, but I am sure that we will get there. I would say to Norfolk Islanders, with my apologies to John Donne: ‘No community is an island entire of itself. Every group is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, the country is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as any manner of thy friends or of thine own were. Any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind. And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for the-Norfolk Island.’ I commend the bill to the House and commend the minister for his work in getting us to this stage after a long period of time and with lots of committee reports. Debate (on motion by Mr Hayes) adjourned. Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 March, on motion by Mr Brendan O’Connor: That this bill be now read a second time. Bill (No. 1) 2010. This bill amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to incorporate end dates for three concessional items in schedule 4, which deals with concessional rates of duty. The bill contains three amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. Two of these amendments relate to the import concessions for the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. The third amendment provides a mechanism to reduce the general rate of duty for certain goods that were not of a kind used as components in passenger motor vehicles. Item 53C of schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 provides a mechanism to reduce the rate of customs duty from 10 per cent to five per cent for certain goods entering Australia on or after 1 January 2005. These goods are non-passenger motor vehicle goods that are classified to the same tariff classifications as passenger motor vehicle, PMV, parts and components. The rate of customs duty applicable to passenger motor vehicle parts and components was 10 per cent. On1 January this year the rate of customs duty on PMV parts and components fell to five per cent, making item 53C of schedule 4 redundant from that date. As the proposed amendment to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 will insert an end date of 31 December 2009 and hence have a retrospective commencement, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny MAIN COMMITTEE",218,Jscot Made A Number Of Recommendations With The Intention Of Seeing A Process Established
236,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (11.57 Am),"I rise to speak on the Customs Tariff Amendmentof Bills examined the proposed amendment and made the following comments in relation to it: As a matter of practice, the Committee draws attention to any bill that seeks to have retrospective impact and will comment adversely where such a bill has a detrimental effect on people. These items relate to the commencement and completion dates of a mechanism in schedule 4, part III, item 53C of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to reduce the general rate of customs duty from 10 per cent to five per cent for certain goods for home consumption. They initially appear to have a retrospective effect because clause 2, item 2 provides that the commencement date of schedule 1, item 1 is 14 December 2009 and schedule 1, item 1 provides for a commencement date of the mechanism of 1 January 2005 and a completion date of 31 December 2009. However, there is no detrimental result because this is essentially a technical amendment giving effect to Customs Notice (No.3) 2009, published in Special Commonwealth Gazette S213 of 14 December 2009, and in it the committee notes from the explanatory memorandum the general rate of the relevant customs duty fell five per cent from 1 January 2010. As you can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a relatively dry bill. I will continue to speak about the Clothing and Household Textile Building Innovative Capability Program. On 12 May 2009, the government announced a retargeted textile clothing and footwear assistance package from 2009-10 to the year 2015-16. Under the package, the Clothing and Household Textile Building Innovative Capability Program would replace the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Post 2005 Scheme from the scheme’s 2010-11 program year. The new package redirected $55 million towards innovation, mainly to the clothing and household textile sectors, with $25 million in additional funding. The package also included a new Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Capability Program to support innovative capability in the textile, clothing and footwear industries. As recommended in the review of the textile, clothing and footwear industries by Professor Roy Green, Building innovative capability, the new package would be partially funded by discontinuing the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Product Diversification Scheme and not proceeding with the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Supply Chain Opportunities Program. The product diversification scheme applied to the clothing and finished textiles sectors and was legislated to continue until 30 June 2017. The principal legislation implementing the new textile, clothing and footwear assistance package, the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment (Building Innovative Capability) Bill 2010, was passed by the Senate on 18 March this year with two amendments which were agreed by the House of Representatives on the same day. The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Expanded Overseas Assembly Provision Scheme commenced on 9 June 1999 and provides assistance through duty concessions to firms that assemble clothing and footwear overseas from predominantly Australian made fabric and leather and then import them back into the Australian market. Since the scheme began, the duty or revenue forgone has totalled $40 million, with annual duty forgone of approximately $3 million. The scheme was scheduled to expire in 2005 and was extended under the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Post 2005 Assistance Scheme announced by the Howard government in November 2003. However, there has been only limited use of the scheme in recent years as TCF tariffs have fallen and the scheme is scheduled to conclude on 30 June this year. In his MAIN COMMITTEE review of the textile clothing and footwear industry, Professor Green gave the following assessment of the scheme: It has generated a pull-through of Australian-made fabric and leather for firms assembling clothing and footwear offshore and bringing them back for domestic consumption. However, because of the reducing rate of tariffs for the finished product, the value of the scheme is declining. From1 January this year, two different tariff rates apply across a range of TCF goods: 10 per cent for clothing and for certain finished and household textiles-these items of course make up the bulk of TCF imports-and five per cent for cotton sheeting, woven fabrics, sleeping bags, table linen, tea towels, carpets, footwear, textile yarns, sewing threads and finished leather. The opposition supports the measures that have been proposed in this bill. ply-I would like to thank the member for Stirling for his contribution to the debate and for his support for the bill. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2010 contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that insert or vary end dates for three concessional items in schedule 4. Successful passage of this bill through the parliament will enable the incorporation of these amendments in the customs tariff to give effect to recent government decisions and to provide certainty to importers. The cessation of the Expanded Overseas Assembly Provisions Scheme and the early cessation of the Product Diversification Scheme implement a component of the government’s TCF innovation package, as announced in the 2009-10 budget. This package will provide assistance to the textile, clothing and footwear industry through grants rather than through a combination of grants and duty concessions. Importers in the Australian industry producing TCF goods are aware of the pending changes through budget announcements and through advice from the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research. Concessional items 61 and 73 in the customs tariff give effect to duty concessions under these schemes. The items are therefore no longer required and are being end dated. For item 61, the end date is 30 June this year. For item 73, the end date is 30 June 2011. While importers will no longer be able to earn duty credits under the Product Diversification Scheme after 30 June 2010, the end date of 30 June 2011 for item 73 will provide importers with an additional 12 months to use those credits. Item 53C in schedule 4 of the customs tariff provided a mechanism to reduce the general rate of customs duty from 10 per cent to five per cent for certain goods that were not of a kind used in passenger motor vehicles. However, when the customs duty for motor vehicle components fell from 10 per cent to five per cent on 1 January this year, item 53C became redundant. The insertion of an end date of 31 December 2009 in item 53C was previously given effect through Customs Notice (No.3) 2009 and the tabling of Customs Tariff Proposal No.1 (2010). I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. MAIN COMMITTEE",221,Customs Tariff Amendment Bill No 1 2010
237,Mr Brendan O’connor (Gorton,"Minister for Home Affairs) (12.04 pm)-in reBILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 March, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010. Since the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, significant efforts have been made around the world to improve transport security. Consistent with this, the former coalition government made ongoing efforts to ensure that Australia had a security regime that was suitable for protection against potential terrorist threats and attacks. The original introduction of the Aviation Transport Security Act and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act was part of these ongoing efforts. I will talk about the aviation industry in the first instance. International and domestic aviation is vitally important for all Australians. It connects us with each other and, of course, with the rest of the world. This is particularly important considering one has to travel approximately 4,000 kilometres from east to west, a fact of which members from Western Australia are very much aware. Our aviation industry is also a central component of our economy. The attempted terrorist attack on a flight bound for the United States from Europe on Christmas Day last year indicated to the United States, but also to Australia, that we are in need of stronger measures to prevent unlawful interference with aviation. We need to acknowledge the contribution that aviation makes to Australia’s overall economy. Steady economic growth, particularly during the years of the previous coalition government, have increased tourism and made for a more profitable airline sector, which in turn has driven the expansion of Australia’s aviation sector. In the 2007-08 financial year, over 49 million passengers travelled on Australian domestic airlines. It is also very important to note that regional airlines carried 5.8 million passengers, a figure which represents an increase of 11 per cent over the year 2006. Regional airlines and regional airports are an important part of Australian aviation’s history and future. A healthy aviation sector is vital for our ongoing prosperity and ongoing economic growth. Alongside the aviation industry, Australia’s maritime industry is equally critical to the economic prosperity of Australia. Australia relies on sea transport for 99 per cent of our exports. A substantial proportion of our domestic freight also depends on coastal shipping. The former coalition government implemented a maritime security regime to help safeguard Australia’s maritime transport system and offshore facilities from terrorism and unlawful interference. Under this regime, all security regulated ports, port facilities, offshore facilities, port and offshore service providers and ships undertake security assessments and implement security plans to address identified risks. Following on from September 11, the international community resolved to implement a system to secure the maritime transport sector against the threat of terrorism. The International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, ISPS, developed by the International Maritime Organisation in December 2002 was the result. The coalition developed the Maritime TransMAIN COMMITTEE",223,Customs Tariff Amendment Bill No 1 2010
238,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (12.08 Pm),"I rise to speak on the Transport Security Legislationport Security Act 2003 to implement the ISPS Code in Australia. Both the ISPS Code and the act came into effect on 1 July 2004. In 2005, the act was extended and renamed the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003. The amended act and regulations under it established the legislative basis for also improving security plans for offshore oil and gas facilities. International developments and a number of reviews have led to changes and refinements in the legislation underpinning the maritime security regime. The Transport Security Legislation Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010 amends the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003. The Aviation Transport Security Act amendments are designed to increase the flexibility of the aviation transport security framework to rapidly respond to an aviation security incident. The Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act amendments, among other things, give or allow for increased powers to various maritime security officials for various purposes. The Transport Security Legislation Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010 seeks to introduce new security arrangements for civil aviation and passenger ships. The amendments were announced as a response to the National Security Adviser’s review of aviation security, following the attempted terrorist attacks on the US-bound flight on Christmas Day last year, which I alluded to in my opening comments. The bill proposes to amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 in the following ways. The Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 amendments change the process of listing prohibited items. Currently items are proscribed under regulation. It is proposed to empower the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government to issue, as a legislative instrument, a notice specifying a list of prohibited items. The effect of this would be to speed the process of amending and updating the list. The notice would be a disallowable instrument. Some examples of items currently on the prohibited items list are meat cleavers, aerosol containers, golf clubs, letter openers and handcuffs. The maximum penalty for being in unauthorised possession of a prohibited item will remain 20 penalty units, which currently stands at $2,200 or two years imprisonment. The government has stated in the explanatory memorandum that enabling the prohibited items list to be amended by legislative instrument, rather than by regulation, will allow this list to remain responsive to emerging threats to aviation security while preserving parliamentary scrutiny via the usual disallowance procedure. The second amendment to the act is to enable the secretary of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government to delegate any of his or her functions to an SES employee in the Attorney-General’s Department in preparation for the establishment of a Commonwealth incident coordinator within the Attorney-General’s Department from 1 July this year. Amendments to the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act are as follows. They will allow operators of Australian ships to apply for an exemption from the requirement to hold a ship security plan in exceptional circumstances; allow operators of foreign flagged ships that have been granted an exemption by their flag state from holding an international ship security certificate to have that exemption observed in Australia; permit frisk searches to MAIN COMMITTEE be conducted on passengers and crew boarding security related passenger ships; enable the appointment of security assessment inspectors to conduct security assessments of maritime industry participants; and modernise the recording media options for maritime security inspectors. In conclusion, the coalition supports the changes that have been proposed to both of these acts. It must be said that they are relatively modest against the rhetoric in the minister’s second reading speech, although we have to expect that from the government. There is a mass of rhetoric and then very modest outcomes. In particular, the minister quoted the counterterrorism white paper. It read: The threat of terrorism to Australia is real and enduring. It has become a persistent and permanent feature of Australia’s security environment. This is at odds with his announcement in December that it was common sense to relax security in favour of reducing waiting time for passengers. Despite the confusion that the minister’s various announcements have created as to the government’s approach to transport security, these measures are not controversial from the opposition’s perspective and the bill, accordingly, has our support. It is integral to continuing to improve national maritime and aviation security and making the necessary amendments to do so, particularly in relation to emerging threats. The coalition recognises that threats to our security are increasingly complex and unpredictable and that we must get on the front foot with a coordinated and uncompromising approach to protecting our maritime borders and our aviation spaces. Ultimately, it is of vital importance to Australia that our maritime and aviation security measures are amended to ensure that we are best able to respond to changes in our overall security environment, and thus these modest proposals have the support of the opposition. (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010 makes important amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003. These changes are designed to strengthen security arrangements in both the aviation and maritime fields and, as such, have the support of the coalition. In relation to civil aviation, the changes to the aviation legislation are in response to the review of aviation security after the attempted terrorist attack on Christmas Day on a flight in the United States. The first amendment allows the responsible minister, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, to issue prohibited items lists by legislative instruments. It also gives the department’s secretary the ability to delegate their powers and responsibilities to a senior executive service officer in the Attorney-General’s Department. This is designed to move towards the introduction, in July 2010, of the position of Commonwealth incident coordinator in the Attorney-General’s Department. I think we are all familiar with the announcement of the relaxation-albeit the small relaxation-but there are have inconsistencies across aviation security in this country. As a frequent traveller, as we all are, one inconsistency that puzzles me relates to umbrellas. If you go through Brisbane Airport or Canberra Airport and you have an umbrella, you have to take it out and put it up. But if you go through other airports in Australia you do not have to. It is just bizarre that there is not a common set of guidelines at the security checkpoints at airports. MAIN COMMITTEE",224,Transport Security Legislation Amendment 2010 Measures No 1
239,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (12.17 Pm),"The Transport Security Legislation AmendmentOn security checkpoints, I am pleased that department officials are here today. At the main security entry in terminal 3, the Qantas terminal, at Sydney airport there are three security scanners. The scanner that is closest to the city-I guess it is best described that way-is far more sensitive than the other two scanners. When you talk to the staff, they say: ‘Yes, we know. We’ve known for two years. We’ve been telling the department for two years, but they keep saying to us that it is adjusted just the same as every other scanner.’ If you stand there and watch the passengers going through, you will see that that is not the case. That is how I picked it up, because I go through many airport scanners and I do not go off, but I go off every time. I go through that scanner. NowI do not go through that scanner or, if I am forced to go through it and I go off, I do not take my shoes off, because my shoes do not have metal in them. I just go through the other scanner and get through and I do not go off. I know it is probably a small point, but that causes a lack of confidence in our scanning system. The sensitivity of each of those scanners should be the same, otherwise the staff could become a bit lax because they know one scanner is more sensitive than the others and they might not worry if it goes off. SoI just ask the department to have a look at that and once and for all fix the problem. I am also puzzled by plastic knives on aeroplanes. As you travel around the world, there are plenty of airlines that have steel knives. We all know that. Steel knives are actually allowed on aeroplanes flying in Australian airspace as well, on aircraft coming in from overseas. I am puzzled why we have plastic knives and steel forks, because it does not seem to be consistent with the security risk. There are many other security risks on aeroplanes. I am not going to canvass them now because it would be irresponsible to do so, but I know that, if I really wanted to do something, if I were a terrorist, I could do it in the context of what is currently allowed on aeroplanes. We should be careful about that. I am pleased to see the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government here. Minister, you and your department ought to have a look at this issue with aviation security identification cards. I say this not as a criticism. I say it to be helpful, because we are all of a mind to make sure we have the best security that we can. All staff that operate air side at an airport are required to wear and display an ASIC tag at all times. That is proper. You get an ASIC if you do not have a criminal history and you meet the security criteria. But what is interesting is, if you want to be a private pilot, to obtain a student pilot’s licence you sign a form and you pay an administration fee. No flight lessons are required to have a student pilot licence. Mr Deputy Speaker, you can go and get a student pilot licence, sign a form, pay a fee and you do not have to fly. But that automatically entitles you to an ASIC without any security checks. All you do is get a student pilot licence, apply for an ASIC and you receive it in the mail six weeks later. There is no security check on the ASIC that is given to a student pilot. It is CASA, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, who manage this process. Minister, I think you ought to have a look at that apparent flaw in our security processes. The requirement to have the security check should be consistent across the application processes, in whatever situation ASICs are issued. In relation to regional aerodromes, the government is moving to fix a problem that exists there. It is not fixed yet, but I recognise that the government is moving to do that. Minister, just another matterMAIN COMMITTEE through the Deputy Speaker’s chair. You are constantly referring directly to the minister. upgrade there are additional charges that go to the airport operators, and the airport operators have to cover those charges from airlines-and that is okay-but because it is a highly competitive business and because airlines are under huge cost pressures, it is very difficult for the airport operators to reach a negotiated settlement on these charges. I have seen at one airport that there is a huge negotiation process going on over a 1c difference in what the charge should be. It is that fine. So the airport says to me, ‘Perhaps the government could assist in this process by finding a way that makes it easier for airports and air operators to be able to have a mechanism to agree on how these charges are passed on, because it is nobody’s fault that we have got to pass on the charges. The passengers have got to pay, we all recognise that, but there is just this argy-bargy that goes on because there is a change in security requirements because the government says we should do this.’ Perhaps the minister could have a look at how that all operates and help both the airline industry and the airport industry to make it easier to allow these charges to be passed on. Thank you for the opportunity to make my contribution this afternoon. ment and Local Government) (12.26 pm)-I thank those members who have participated in the debate on the Transport Security Legislation Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010. This is a bill that further strengthens the aviation and maritime security frameworks that are set up under the Australian Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003. Amendments to both of these acts will make important changes to improve the flexibility and responsiveness of Australia’s transport security regime. I welcome the fact that there is bipartisan support for this bill, but I will also make some comments on the contributions of the two coalition speakers to this debate. The first speaker, the member for Stirling, opposed the government’s changes which came into effect on Christmas Day last year making common-sense changes to what will be allowed on aircraftspecifically, the fact that metal cutlery will be allowed to be used on Australian aircraft. He argued that this presented a confused and inconsistent position from the government. It does nothing of the sort. The confused and inconsistent position of those opposite was highlighted by the fact that there were two coalition speakers and one said these changes were a bad thing and the other said they were a good thing. The member for Herbert, who spoke immediately after the member for Stirling, said-obviously not aware of the changes in regulations that the government has introduced-that the banning of metal cutlery, ‘Doesn’t seem to be consistent with a security risk.’ He was right and the member for Stirling was wrong. The government’s changes to the prohibited items list last year as part of the aviation white paper were common sense changes based upon advice from the appropriate security agencies on risk. We know that a range of items which were on the prohibited list, including nail clippers and other items, were simply a distraction for people working on the front line of security at airports, who need to identify real risk and make sure that we keep them out of our airports. We need to concentrate the effort and energy of those people working on the front line, upon whom passengers rely to keep them safe, by having a common-sense approach to this. This change is consistent with what happens in the United States of America and Europe; indeed, MAIN COMMITTEE",226,Transport Security Legislation Amendment 2010 Measures No 1

241,Mr Lindsay,I would ask the minister to consider this: every time there is a security,228,Transport Security Legislation Amendment 2010 Measures No 1
242,Mr Albanese (Grayndler,"Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Developeven the security-conscious country of Israel allows metal cutlery on planes. And we have made that change. I object completely to the member for Stirling coming in here and trying to play cheap, inconsistent politics on national security issues. I have a great responsibility and I take my obligation seriously. I rely on expert advice. Expert advice must be followed in this area; expert advice, not politics, must dictate action. That is why we introduced the changes to the prohibited items list last year based upon risk. The fact that the only speaker from the coalition on this bill today put exactly the opposite position shows their inconsistency on these items. But there is another area of inconsistency that I would ask the member for Stirling to consider, and that is the new regulation restricting access to the cockpits of aircraft, which was gazetted yesterday. This regulatory change was made last year and it was disallowed by the Senate. We are reintroducing this regulation. I call upon the opposition to agree to these common-sense measures to restrict cockpit access and safeguard Australian travellers based on advice from aviation security experts. As a result of the opposition’s reckless disallowance, there are currently no effective legal restrictions on who can enter the cockpit of an aircraft. It is simply unacceptable that such an important part of aviation security has been left to industry self-regulation. By restricting access to the cockpit, the government is taking a strong, practical and common-sense approach to strengthen the last line of defence against unlawful interference with a plane. Aviation security should be a bipartisan issue but similar regulations were voted down by the opposition in the Senate in September last year. These regulations will commence on 22 May 2010. I ask the opposition to reconsider their position on this issue because access to the cockpit of a plane should be based upon operational need. That is why these regulations are important. I thank the member for Herbert for his support in his comments about government plans to upgrade security at our regional airports. I note that in last night’s budget, as part of our $200 million aviation security package, $32 million was allocated to assist with the upgrade of security at our regional airports. I ask the member for Herbert to talk to his National Party colleagues about why they should support this change. It is a common-sense change based on advice from experts, which surely the opposition also received when it was in government. This government is committed to ensuring our national security. The legislation before the House today contains some small but important measures towards achieving that end. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 March, on motion by Mr Griffin: That this bill be now read a second time. MAIN COMMITTEE ments Amendment (Income Support Measures) Bill 2010. CanI say at the outset that this bill has the coalition’s support and it is not my intention to delay the Main Committee for too long today. The bill contains five minor amendments to the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986. BeforeI address the bill I would like to make a few comments, particularly in relation to my discussions with leaders of the ex-service community, about the workings of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. I would like to place on record my appreciation for the leaders of our ex-service community. These leaders work very hard on behalf of their members to achieve a better deal for veterans. I look forward to continuing to work with them over the coming months, particularly as we move into congress season. The Tasmanian RSL will hold their state congress this Friday in George Town and I look forward to speaking there about the issues that are important to the veteran community. I also want to say that I will be speaking further to ex-service community leaders today and tomorrow about the federal budget and I will have more to say on this topic, particularly in relation to specific measures that were announced, during the budget debate in coming weeks. Over the parliamentary recess I have been able to meet with many ex-service community leaders. I especially want to speak about a visit I had to Adelaide a few weeks ago where I met a very determined advocate for the veteran community. I will not name this person; he knows who he is. Needless to say, this person is literally available at the other end of a telephone to provide whatever support and assistance is necessary to veterans, particularly those returning from recent conflicts in Timor-Leste, Afghanistan and Iraq. A valuable insight into the emerging needs of the veteran community meant that this meeting certainly was an important one. I also had an opportunity to meet with tomorrow’s veterans-those men and women currently serving in the Australian Defence Force-as a participant in the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program. I urge and encourage any of my parliamentary colleagues who have not participated in this program to do so. The Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment (Income Support Measures) Bill 2010 has five provisions. Firstly, the amendment removes provisions of the VEA which relate to benevolent homes. Under the VEA, veterans in receipt of a pension through the Department of Veterans’ Affairs would have part of the pension automatically paid to the benevolent home. This provision is now redundant, with the last benevolent home closing in 1994. This change, which ensures the VEA remains a working act meeting the needs of the veteran community, brings the VEA into line with other acts of parliament which no longer refer to benevolent homes. Labour market programs are operated by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations and provide a pathway back to employment for people who need to gain new skills in order to re-enter the workforce. Under arrangements that exist for labour market programs, participants are paid to train and gain work experience. However, under arrangements in the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, payments made to veterans who participate in labour market programs are treated differently. For example, under the VEA, money paid to a participant for expenses associated with training are exempt from the VEA income test. However, payments for expenses for part-time work experience are not exempt. On this basis, there is a disincentive for veterans participating in a labour market program to undertake work experience in case any reimbursement for expenses adversely affects a pension they are in MAIN COMMITTEE",228,Transport Security Legislation Amendment 2010 Measures No 1
243,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (12.36 Pm),"I rise today to speak on the Veterans’ Entitlereceipt of. This proposed change is important in allowing more veterans to re-engage with the workforce where they choose to do so and where they require new skills, and it is welcomed by the veterans community. It provides veterans with greater flexibility in their dealings with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and makes the VEA a fairer act. One of the more significant changes in this bill is a move to force veterans’ partners, where they are eligible, to receive a foreign pension where they are required to do so under law. I will explain this change in greater detail. Currently, a veteran’s partner who is entitled to a foreign pension is under no legal obligation to accept that pension. In many cases, the pensions are very small amounts of money. Under the changes made by this amendment, the veteran’s partner is required to access that foreign pension and report it as income under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. It is anticipated that, in the vast majority of cases, those affected by this change will be better off. Because of the cut-in point of the income test and the expected small amount of those pensions, the small number of veterans affected by this change ought to be better off. However, the coalition would like to hear from any veteran or veteran’s partner who considers they will be, or have been, directly impacted in a negative way as a result of these changes. This is best explained by way of an example. I point out that this is illustrative and does not indicate the personal circumstances of any individuals affected by this change. For example, Mr and Mrs Jones are entitled to a service pension under the VEA. Mr Jones has qualifying service from the Vietnam War and Mrs Jones is entitled to access a British pension of approximately $20 a fortnight but, until now, has not done so. Under this proposed change, Mr and Mrs Jones are required to apply for the British pension that Mrs Jones is entitled to. When granted, Mrs Jones must notify the Department of Veterans’ Affairs that she is now in receipt of the pension. Given its small amount, Mr and Mrs Jones’s pension is unlikely to be affected, resulting in their being $20 a fortnight better off. This amendment will also allow the partner of a veteran to receive, where eligible, a lump sum in arrears payment for the period in which they have been eligible but have not been receiving their foreign pension. Importantly, the VEA will be amended to allow greater flexibility in the calculation of that income and its effect on the receipt of future pensions from DVA. For example, in the case of Mr and Mrs Jones, Mrs Jones was entitled to access her British pension five years ago and the British government has calculated her entitlement and paid a lump sum of $2,250, taking into account inflation and exchange rates. Under the VEA income test, this one-off lump sum payment may impact on Mr and Mrs Jones’s overall service pension payments. Currently, this one-off payment which has accrued over five years will be treated as one year’s income, which may result in a reduction in Mr and Mrs Jones’s pension. However, under this amendment, Mrs Jones’s lump sum will be calculated as if it had been paid over five years and, in this case, Mr and Mrs Jones’s pension will not be affected by the payment of a lump sum and they will continue to be better off as a result of accessing the foreign pension. It is expected that the proposed changes will better align the VEA with other, similar acts that deal with foreign pensions. We are told that they will ensure that Australia’s veterans continue to receive beneficial treatment under the VEA. I reiterate my interest in hearing from any veteran, their partner or family members about their individual circumstances if they are made worse off by this amendment. MAIN COMMITTEE The final amendment relates to superannuation assets that have gone ‘turtle up’, for want of a better phrase, perhaps as a result of the global financial crisis. Under this amendment, where the value of the specified superannuation asset has been frozen and the veteran is no longer able to access the asset at call, the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs may in exceptional circumstances declare part of the asset disregarded for the purposes of the assets test under the VEA. However, this determination on the general asset will not apply to the deemed income rules or assets deprivation rules. This bill is relatively minor and has the coalition’s support. CanI just indicate again my appreciation to the dedicated men and women of Border Protection Command. I was able to spend time with them during the exchange program with the ADF in late April. I hope that the work we do here on behalf of today’s veterans will flow on to provide the maximum level of assistance to our younger and future veterans. ments Amendment (Income Support Measures) Bill 2010. We have just had ANZAC Day. As many members of this place would know, we come across wonderful people who have served our country in times of crisis, conflict and war. We see them on ANZAC Day and acknowledge their wonderful service to our community, their deeds of valour and the sacrifices made by them and their families. In our various communities within Australia and as a country we need to recognise their deeds, their heroism and their commitment to our country. Therefore, I am very sympathetic towards providing the maximum amount of assistance to veterans, and their families, to ensure that they can retire from their working lives with dignity, respect and financial security and that their widows or widowers are also treated in a decent and humane way in the future. Veterans’ entitlements must be modern, must be equitable and must have a degree of consistency, but also there must be a benign approach with respect to their social security requirements and entitlements. Generally we will see some benefit to veterans and their families as a result of these amendments. The amendments in this legislation remove inequities between other pieces of legislation governing social security law and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, which governs entitlements given to veterans for their service. We need to make sure that any income test which is applied does not have loopholes, is consistent and has integrity, and we want to make sure that administration of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act by the government and the department shows degrees of humanity, and also consistency and stability, so that veterans have certainty about their entitlements. We need to ensure that the legislation is modern, does not lack consistency and is not redundant. The amendments improve the law governing veterans’ entitlements in five stages. Some of them are minor and some of them are technical, but they are important nonetheless. We need to make sure that there is consistency between the Social Security Act, acts and regulations and veterans’ entitlements law. The changes improve how we govern veterans’ entitlements and they correct anomalies. As the previous speaker said, they result in a more favourable pension outcome for people and they are evidence of the government’s commitment to ensuring that veterans receive the maximum number of entitlements. Last night the budget came down, with amendments and improvements to the law governing veterans. There are significant improvements to military funding for our defence forces as well.

Labour market programs are administered by Centrelink on behalf of DEEWR. We are going to make sure that the legislation is up to date in its semantics, terminology and nomenclature. We want to make sure that it is consistent with the outcomes under the social security law. Under the legislation, certain payments made under labour market programs are exempt under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. The amendments before the House replace redundant terms such as ‘labour force programs’ with the current term ‘labour market programs’. The amendments make sure that payments received by those people who participate cover their expenses associated with undertaking work experience under a labour market program and that those payments are exempt as income. That is a good thing from the point of view of the veterans. Such payments are exempt under social security law but not currently under the VEA, so this is an important change that will make a difference in people’s lives. The second aspect deals with ‘benevolent homes’. I have always found this a curious term. I have heard it on numerous occasions in the past, but there is reference to it in the VEA and it refers to institutions in which a person may be placed for a prolonged period of time, according to the digest. It could apply to an adult being placed due to mental illness or a young child or person being placed for the care of that child or person. What we are doing with these changes is removing the last reference to benevolent homes. In the mid-1990s, the last remaining benevolent home ceased operation, and that was a good thing. Inmates of benevolent homes-those that are still with us-can now be found in aged-care facilities across the country. These provisions dealing with benevolent homes are therefore redundant and have been for years. They have been superseded by the legislation governing aged care, which is the Aged Care Act 1997, so the changes here simply remove redundant provisions. The third aspect deals with foreign pensions. They deal with the requirement to claim a comparable foreign pension. The amendments require someone who is a partner of someone getting a VEA income support pension to claim a comparable foreign pension. I think that is a prudent measure. If they are entitled to do so, they should have done so by now. It adds integrity to our system and I think what we are doing here makes sense. If they claim this, it is likely their income will be greater than it currently is, notwithstanding that their claim may have other negative impacts on any VEA or other entitlements coming to that household. Partners of existing income support recipients who are entitled will be required to claim that comparable foreign pension within six months of being notified by the department that they are required to do so. I think that is sensible. I think it is quite a nationalistic approach, but I think it makes sense for the integrity of the VEA system in this country. The fourth aspect deals with the treatment of arrears-this is quite a complicated matterand how lump sum payments of arrears are dealt with when comparable pensions are assessed. Generally we know that pensioners are better off under social security provisions, as the amount of any arrears payment results in a debt under that legislation. That debt is generally less than any cumulative rate of reduction in income support for the following year under the VEA, so they are better off. The legislation contains loopholes under which a person reMAIN COMMITTEE ceiving a service pension who receives a lump sum arrears payment of a comparable foreign pension can transfer it to a social security pension to avoid the application of the income test to the arrears payment. This loophole should be closed and it will provide a better outcome for veterans and their dependants. That is a sensible provision. It makes sure that there is a greater alignment between the social security legislation and the VEA. The final aspect covered by this legislation deals with certain superannuation investments. The previous speaker talked about superannuation funds going belly up or turtle up-I am not quite sure how she eloquently put it, but she meant that they are no good anymore. Under section 52AA of this legislation, the minister can make a determination under the VEA that certain superannuation investments are exempt under the assets test. Such a determination could result in an investment being unintentionally exempt from provisions regarding deemed income and the deprivation of assets. That was recognised and changed back in 2006 with the social security legislation. The amendments here clarify that the provisions regarding deemed income and deprivation of assets will continue to apply to superannuation investments covered by the determination the minister might make under section 52AA. While I am here, I will take the opportunity to commend the government on an issue of veterans’ entitlements. It deals with the Clarke review. There have been people who have been tragically exposed to nuclear testing, and their service was long unrecognised. We have in this budget provided $36 million to implement key recommendations of the Clarke review of veterans’ entitlements, which were sadly ignored by the previous government. I want to commend the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs for his advocacy in this regard. I have had many discussions with him about it. He is passionate about seeking justice for those veterans who have been exposed. The benefits provided here will make a difference in the lives of people, including constituents of mine who have spoken to me about it. It is long-overdue recognition for those military personnel who have suffered. As part of the package that we have announced, $24.2 million over five years will go towards providing disability pensions, war widow or widower pensions and healthcare benefits to people who have suffered from conditions relating to their nuclear test service. Potentially 2,700 surviving veterans will benefit. Subject to any legislative changes, those benefits will apply from 2010. I think this is a long-overdue change. It is something that I have advocated for a long time. It is something that people have talked to me about in my role as a federal member of parliament. I think, in the measures we have undertaken, they will receive a degree of justice for the work they did on behalf of us. By accepting Justice Clarke’s recommendations, we are looking after our veterans who have campaigned long and hard for many years in relation to this. They were put into situations where they were exposed to nuclear tests at Maralinga and other places such as Emu Field. Many of them suffered and many of them died. We have taken a fair and balanced approach. We are recognising the work that they have done. We are opening up their eligibility. We are providing compensation and recognising their service. That is something that the country should have done a very long time ago. I think the government has finally done what it should have done and what previous governments should have done-that is, recognise the nature of the service and the fact that these personnel had no choice. They were put into a situation on behalf of all of us and served our MAIN COMMITTEE country. They did what was right for our country and they were exposed. They did not know any better and finally the government has taken steps to give them a degree of justice. I commend the minister for what he has done. I think he has shown a degree of humanity and a commitment to justice that are exemplary. I want to thank those people who have campaigned so long and hard. Veterans across the country finally will see their service recognised as non-warlike hazardous. I think, in the circumstances, their service and their campaigning should be acknowledged and applauded. I commend the legislation to the House. Sitting suspended from 1.00 pm to 4.00 pm Amendment (Income Support Measures) Bill 2010. This bill is yet another in a series of bills that affect veterans and future veterans alike. This government seems to believe that tinkering on the edges of policy development and introducing administration bill after administration bill on veterans affairs issues are wholesale substitutes for policy reform. It is disappointing that I again stand here and debate yet another bill that fails to deal with the No. 1 issue that affects our veteran community, an issue that the Rudd Labor Party said prior to the 2007 election it would fix. I refer, of course, to the Rudd Labor government’s promise to fix the indexation of military superannuation pensions. The Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, the Hon. Alan Griffin, is now also the Minister for Defence Personnel. There can no longer be any buck-passing between ministerial portfolios in veterans affairs or defence as to who has responsibility for defence superannuation. The matter now rests entirely in the hands of Minister Griffin. It was Minister Griffin who, prior to the last election, demanded that action be taken on military superannuation. It was Minister Griffin who said he would fix the problem. I will come to more on that later. This bill sets out to amend certain sections of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act so that its provisions are more closely aligned to provisions found in the Social Security Act. Overall the changes are non-controversial and in general, on the advice provided by the government, will not leave any veterans worse off. The first amendment in this bill will remove all references to benevolent homes. Benevolent homes are institutions where persons may stay for extended periods of time, such as places for the mentally ill. Traditionally a person would receive a reduced pension if they were living at a benevolent home, with the deducted portion of their pension being paid directly to the benevolent home. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Act 1995 effectively removed the vast majority of provisions that referred to benevolent homes; however, similar changes were not made to the Veterans’ Entitlements Act because at the time there were still pensioners receiving a reduced pension on the grounds that they were residents of benevolent homes. As benevolent homes no longer exist and as there are no longer any veterans who are affected by these provisions, this bill will simply repeal from the Veterans’ Entitlements Act all references to benevolent homes. This bill also seeks to simplify arrangements pertaining to veterans participating in labour market programs that are administered by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations that are designed to assist those looking to enter or re-enter the workforce. Assistance can include training for unemployed people, support services and formal MAIN COMMITTEE",232,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Income Support Measures
245,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (4.00 Pm),"I rise today to speak on the Veterans’ Entitlementsvocational training, all of which are delivered by the national employment services system, Job Services Australia. Currently veterans do not need to include any payments they receive under a labour market program in the income test if those payments cover expenses such as uniforms. However, payments they may receive for part-time work experience under a labour market program are subject to the income test. This acts as a disincentive for veterans to undertake part-time training, as the small amounts of money they would potentially receive may negatively affect their pension payments. The amendments contained within this bill will align the treatment of payments for expenses and part-time training with those contained in the Social Security Act. Simply put, this means that veterans receiving payments for undertaking part-time training as a part of a labour market program will no longer have to worry about those payments potentially affecting their pension payments. The next amendment contained within this bill will require a veteran’s partner to claim any foreign pension to which they are entitled. This provision is based on the underlying rationale that a person who has the means to support themselves financially should utilise his or her own means or resources before receiving financial support from the public purse. This amendment will again align provisions found in the Veterans’ Entitlements Act with the Social Security Act, and will compel the partner of a veteran in receipt of a service pension or income support supplement to claim and receive any foreign pension they are entitled to receive. Although the majority of those veterans affected by this change will be better off, I echo the sentiments of my colleague the member for Greenway in stating that the coalition would like to hear from any veterans or their families who find themselves worse off under these changes. Following on from the previous amendment regarding entitlements to foreign pensions, this bill will also amend the manner in which a lump sum foreign pension payment is treated in regard to an income test. It is important to note that foreign pensions are sometimes paid as a lump sum, particularly at the commencement of receipt of that pension, due to the time taken for the overseas agency to determine the entitlement and then process the claim. Often these lump sum payments pay an amount in arrears over a number of months or indeed years. By way of example, under current legislation, if a veteran were to receive a lump sum pension payment from a foreign source, that payment would be treated as income over one financial year even though that lump sum may have included payments in arrears for a period of two or three years or even longer. The situation would most often result in a reduction to the veteran’s pension, as a lump sum is considered a part of that person’s income under the income test. This amendment will simply ensure that any foreign pension lump sum payment is treated as income over the years for which it has been accrued and paid rather than treating it as income received during one financial year only. Whilst this amendment will likely benefit most veterans, some may incur a debt as a result of this legislative change, particularly those who receive large lump sums for a period covering more than 12 months. I would urge the government to ensure that the veterans who find themselves in this situation are given ample time to pay off this debt, as it would be totally unacceptable that any veteran should be left with a debt through no fault of their own and forced to repay it at an unreasonable rate just because of the government’s short-sightedness or lack of attention to detail. MAIN COMMITTEE Finally, this bill seeks to amend the provisions in the Veterans’ Entitlements Act for the disregarding of an asset. This provision will empower the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs to make a determination with regard to the exclusion of an asset from the asset test where that asset has lost its value or that asset cannot be assessed. For example, if the asset is sold without an adequate return or value, the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs may disregard the asset under the assets test. Furthermore, if the asset is unable to be assessed by the person, which may occur in the event of frozen superannuation assets or bankruptcy of that asset, the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs may also disregard the asset under the assets test. This amendment to the Veterans’ Entitlements Act will align it with similar provisions under the Social Security Act. On the information provided by the government to the opposition that no veteran will be worse off under this bill, the coalition support the measures contained in the bill. We believe they will help ease the administrative burden placed on veterans through aligning the aforementioned amendments with those provisions contained in the Social Security Act. However, yet again we see that the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs is simply tinkering around the edges with policy. Much as with the budget that was handed down last night, Minister Griffin continues to demonstrate that he is unwilling or unable to take the tough decisions. It is more talk and no action. The minister happily announced during his second reading speech on this bill that it: This bill continues the government’s ongoing commitment to supporting Australia’s veteran community and their families and ensuring their well-being now and into the future. That is the talk. As for the action, it has now been over two years since the release of the Podger review into military superannuation reform and not one word has been uttered by the Rudd Labor government. The Rudd Labor government also failed to respond to parts of the Clarke review, failed to review advocacy funding and delayed the introduction of the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2010, a bill that many veterans are sweating on the outcome of. AlthoughI support this bill, it does nothing to address the core concerns of the veteran community. As the Defence Force Welfare Association pointed out in its response to last night’s federal budget, there is: Nothing for long suffering military superannuants whose standard of living continues to deteriorate due to unfair indexation and taxation of MSBS and DFRDB superannuation pensions and the gouging of DFRDB superannuation benefits that service men and women paid for during their working lives. In addition to that, in a situation where this government has announced that we will have a peak debt of $93.7 billion, at a time when it is spending an additional $1 billion just to bail out the Home Insulation Program, how much would the government have been able to do for our veteran community if it had managed our economy economically responsibly? How much would that $1 billion that is being spent to fix up a failed insulation program have been able to do for our veteran community? The minister will argue that in the current economic circumstances there is nothing that they can do for the military superannuants under the MSBS or the DFRDB. I put to the government: your delay in responding to the report, which was tabled on 24 December 2007, your blatant disregard for the financial situation of those former members and current members of the military in relation to their superannuation payments and the fact that you are prepared to spend the taxes that they have paid in other means without due regard to their needs MAIN COMMITTEE says that you have been negligent in the performance of your duty. I do not mean ‘you’ as the Deputy Speaker, of course, Mr Deputy Speaker; I mean the government, the Minister for Defence Personnel and the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. Veterans deserve a government that is upfront and honest with regard to its policies and promises-something the current government has failed to be on both counts. Further, the Defence Force Welfare Association pointed out in its response last night, in addition to what I said before, that there has been: No decision on the reclassification of the service of certain counter terrorism special operations undertaken by SAS personnel. No decision to remove the remaining level of erosion to the value of the Veterans’ Disability Pensions nor to adjust them in line with the increase in community living standards since 1997. Again, that has been held back because of the amount of debt created by the government, by the sheer fact that they are going to be paying $6.5 billion in interest payments to fund that debt. Again, I put to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, a statement that I put to the government: if the government had run their economy as the economic conservatives they said they would be, there would have been money freed up that could have been spent on our veteran community. The wholesale changes that the veteran community were expecting after the promises made by Labor at the last election have simply failed to materialise. This government is unable to make the tough decisions and unable to undertake serious reform. That point was made clear not only in this bill but also in last night’s big-taxing, big-spending Labor budget. This year’s budget deficit of $40.8 billion, the second biggest since World War II, when combined with the continued reckless spending by the Rudd Labor government, will result in only piecemeal policies for veterans and result in legislative changes such as those contained in this bill that only tinker at the very edges of the policy reform that is really needed. As I said, veterans deserve a government that is upfront and honest with regard to its policies and promisessomething that this government has failed to be on both counts. At the very least, veterans deserve a government that respects them for their past service rather than paying lip-service. Ms NEAL (Robertson) (4.15 pm)-I rise today to speak on the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment (Income Support Measures) Bill 2010. The measures introduced by this bill will improve the delivery of government policy entitlements to our veterans. Members of the nation’s ex-service communities will receive substantial benefits from these measures. The bill is also about clarifying, correcting and amending legislation pertaining to veterans’ entitlements in the interests of returned servicemen and servicewomen. This is a bill that will make life easier for many. It is a continuation of this government’s ongoing commitment to the veteran community. We want to ensure that the policies, provisions and entitlements provided to our veterans and the way that these entitlements are delivered are as good as they possibly can be. I will give a brief outline of a few of the key components of this legislation. The main provisions of this bill are intended to align the Veterans’ Entitlements Act with like provisions in the Social Security Act. The bill includes amendments that will exempt from veterans’ entitlements income test payments associated with part-time work experience under a labour market program. This measure aligns the veterans’ entitlements law with social security law and ensures the consistent treatment of these types of payments across most acts. MAIN COMMITTEE The bill will also amend the Veterans’ Entitlements Act so that the partner of a service pension or income support supplement claimant or recipient will be required to claim a comparable foreign pension if the partner is entitled to such a pension. This provides a consistency between the veterans’ entitlements law and the social security law, and can result in a pensioner couple receiving more income overall. These changes will provide for greater certainty in the administration of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, remove redundant provisions and correct an anomaly whereby pensioners paid under the social security law in some cases received a more favourable pension outcome than service pensioners and income support supplement recipients. There are many veterans and their families living on the Central Coast of New South Wales who will welcome the measures laid out in the bill. The Central Coast, where my electorate of Robertson is situated, has long been a favoured retirement destination for people from Sydney and other parts. This has especially been the case in the decades since World War II. As a result, the electorate of Robertson today is home to a very large proportion of veterans, their families and dependants. As at the beginning of January 2010 there were 4,212 people living in Robertson receiving a Department of Veterans’ Affairs pension or allowance or holding a DVA treatment or pharmaceutical card. This group includes over 1,360 disability pensioners and more than 1,400 war widows. Most of these veterans are located in the Gosford City LGA. It has by far the highest veteran population of any local government area in New South Wales. The number is exceeded by only four LGAs in South-East Queensland, making Gosford City the fifth largest concentration of veterans in Australia. They have an average age of just under 80 years. It is clear from these statistics that reforms to the way veterans’ entitlements are assessed and delivered have a direct and important impact on thousands of my constituents and their families. There are 20 separate veteran associations represented in my electorate. These include a wide range of DVA benefit recipients, including the War Widows Guild, several RSL club branches, the Australian Nuclear Veterans Association, the ex-Prisoners of War Welfare Association and two ex-servicewomen’s associations-just to name a few. I have the great honour of being a patron to the local branch of both the National Servicemen’s Association and the Vietnam Veterans Association. I am also an honorary member of the Central Coast and Gosford branch of the World War II veterans association. At this point I want to name Geoff Turner, president of the World War II 1939-45 veterans association Central Coast Gosford branch. Jeff approached me recently for assistance in applying for a federal volunteers grant-a small grant to assist in the purchase of computer equipment for that organisation of hard working volunteers. The very special thing that the World War II veterans do is engage veterans to help other veterans throughout their extended support networks. This is important to note in the context of the bill presently before the House. Being a returned serviceman or servicewoman presents many challenges to our veterans, their families and their carers, not the least of which is navigating the maze of entitlements and regulations attached to pensions and payments due to these individuals. It is not uncommon for friends and families of veterans to spend hours at a time untangling administrative issues associated with their entitlement claims. Any and all measures that simplify matters and assist veterans to access their entitlements take the burden off them, their families and their carers. That is why an organisation like the World War II MAIN COMMITTEE veterans is so important. By linking veterans together to help each other through difficult times, advocate on each other’s behalf and provide experienced advice, these organisations are often the bedrock of the veteran community support network. I congratulate them all on their hard work and their ongoing compassion. Another example of tireless work by veterans on behalf of other veterans is Rick Johnson from the Australian Nuclear Veterans Association. Rick is a Central Coast local and a tireless campaigner for his members. Rick has had many dealings with my office, and we have assisted to the best of our ability and struggled to do better for the lives of Australian nuclear veterans. I have worked quite closely with all these associations to ensure their concerns are brought to the attention of the minister and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. I am also very pleased to announce that in September 2009 more than $7,100 in funding was given to two veterans’ organisations on the Central Coast under the federal government’s Veteran and Community Grants program. The Veteran and Community Grants provide on the ground funding for local projects that promote health and well-being in the veterans community. The National Servicemen’s Association of Australia, New South Wales Branch, Gosford City sub-branch received $6,000 in funding from the Australian government to support the health and well-being of local ex-servicemen. This grant assisted the local nashos to conduct a bus tour for the local veterans community to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. Surprisingly, some of those members had not had that opportunity prior to this occasion. In addition to this grant, the Gosford sub-branch of the RSL received over $1,000 from the program. The sub-branch will use it to purchase equipment and resources for the Broadwater RSL day club. Projects funded through these grants programs include initiatives that encourage veterans, war widows and widowers to learn new life skills-skills that will help them remain independent as well as provide for social activities and support for their carers. Veteran and Community Grants are available to ex-service and community organisations, veteran representative groups and private organisations that contribute to the health and welfare of the veteran community. I congratulate both of these organisations for their good work and their valuable initiatives to support Central Coast veterans. I also take particular pride in seeing the increasing attendance at ANZAC Day ceremonies across the Central Coast over the past few years. It seems that more and more young people are recognising the contribution that returned ex-servicemen have made and it is something that I think is very much appreciated by those returning. One of the most invaluable experiences I have had as a member was to attend the Defence Force Parliamentary Program with the East Timor defence force during March of 2009. I spent five days in uniform in East Timor and went on foot patrol at night with ADF members of the International Stabilisation Force East Timor. It was certainly an eye-opener about some of the challenges and the circumstances. I did not have to face the occasion of being shot at, but even the living circumstances and the tasks that they needed to undertake showed that they were a force of high-calibre men and, on some occasions, women in this case. I can say from my experience that they are doing a terrific job in sometimes difficult circumstances. The servicemen and servicewomen I spent time with will be the veterans of tomorrow. That is why I am pleased indeed to be speaking today in support of this bill, which will substantially improve the government’s delivery of entitlements to the veterans commuMAIN COMMITTEE nity. I feel confident that the reforms contained in this bill will be beneficial to all members of the defence and veterans communities in the future. To the many veterans who live in my electorate of Robertson, I say: thank you for your contribution. You have made Australia a better place to live. Your contribution to the community of the Central Coast is equally notable. For that I am especially appreciative. I trust that the reforms of the Rudd Labor government introduced today will go some way to repaying the debt that our society owes you. I commend the bill to the House. this contribution in your presence, you being one of Australia’s former veterans’ affairs ministers-you did a great job and you are very highly respected in the veterans’ community. I begin by informing the House that there are more of tomorrow’s veterans in my electorate than in any other electorate in Australia. Of course the reason for that is that Townsville is the home of the ready deployment force of the Australian Defence Force. Lavarack Barracks and RAAF Townsville make up the biggest centre of gravity for defence people at the sharp end in the whole of the country. They are also the most modern Army and Air Force bases in our country. It is these people who go on deployment to the Middle East Area of Operations, to Afghanistan and to Timor Leste. It was the people from Lavarack Barracks who first went into Timor Leste when the balloon went up back in 1999-our people from the 2nd Battalion, RAR. I well remember the evening when the troops were about to deploy. I was at Lavarack Barracks with the Prime Minister and we shared a meal with the battalion. It was a very sombre evening, because nobody knew what would happen the next day when the 2nd Battalion went to Timor. To have that kind of experience as a member of parliament is something that you never forget. It is these people who go on operations now who become tomorrow’s veterans. It is these people, having given their service to our country, to whom our country owes an obligation to give service in return. That is what this Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment (Income Support Measures) Bill 2010 is about-in some small ways improving that particular situation. It is not widely understood that there are areas of operations other than Afghanistan, Timor, the Solomons and the Middle East. We have people right now in the UAE. We have people in Qatar, probably. We have people in Israel, in Syria and in Lebanon serving with the United Nations. There is the MFO, which is an organisation that keeps the peace between Israel and Egypt. They are all out there-they are Australians. It is really mighty to be able to report that these Australians, working alongside the members of defence organisations from other countries, are the most highly regarded in the world. The professionalism of our ADF people, who are the future veterans of our country, is much admired by other countries. In the UN operation in Israel, Lebanon and Syria, there are 27 defence forces represented. We are head and shoulders above any other defence force in the way we operate, how careful we are, our professionalism, how we get the job done and how the people of those countries admire so much how we are trying to keep the peace in the region. It is a great story and one that I will always continue to tell, because all Australians should be mightily proud of the men and women of the ADF. I am reminded, if I might digress for a moment, that when I was in Syria our officer there was a female major. She had extraordinary peacekeeping capabilities and she was extraordiMAIN COMMITTEE",235,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Income Support Measures

It is just great to see that our people immerse themselves in the culture of the countries they go to. I too have participated in the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program over many years now. I have done many deployments. I did one-the parachute arrangements-with the Army, which was with ADFA. I have done Navy and Air Force deployments on a number of occasions. It is a terrific experience for a member of parliament to be able to mix with Australia’s future veterans. I congratulate Colonel JJ Frewen, who is in the United States. JJ was the commander of the 2nd Battalion when it went into Timor Leste. He is currently a full colonel. On 12 June he will be promoted to brigadier. He really deserves that; he is a fine commander. He will be going to work for General Morrison at Victoria Barracks in Sydney. General Morrison is also a former commander of the 3rd Brigade in Townsville. General Morrison’s dad was also a general. It is all incestuous in the ADF. He is a very hard taskmaster but he knows what needs to be done and he gets the job done. It is terrific. My colleague sitting next to me, you were in Western Australia in the Army weren’t you? you compare them to the 3rd Brigade. You will have your right of reply later on. In relation to this bill, however, we do have to provide the right support for Australia’s veterans. This bill makes five changes to the Veterans’ Entitlement Act 1986. The changes will better align veterans’ entitlements with the Social Security Act and that is important to provide the most equitable system that we can. Firstly, the bill removes references to benevolent homes. There have been no benevolent homes since 1994 and the term is no longer used so it is time for the legislation to be updated accordingly. Secondly, it exempts payments for expenses made under the labour market program. Under the present system, any payment for an expense incurred during part-time work experience is included in the income test. These payments may be reimbursement for items such as work, uniform or equipment that is required to complete the program. Similar social security provisions do not include such payments in the income test and the same should apply to veterans’ entitlements. It is a no-brainer. This is reflected in the bill, which will ensure veterans who are undertaking this kind of work experience are not financially disadvantaged. Thirdly, the bill changes the requirements for a veteran’s partner in claiming a foreign pension. Under the existing law, a partner is not required to claim a foreign pension even if they are entitled to it. Again, this is different to the rules of the Social Security Act so the bill introduces uniformity in this area as veterans’ partners will now be required to claim an equivalent foreign pension where eligible. In the long run this will mean that, as a couple, they will be receiving more income and support. Another change to this area is the way in which the payment of arrears of a foreign pension is assessed. The bill makes sure these payments are treated in the same manner as other similar pension arrears payments under the Social Security Act. The final amendment explains the treatment of superannuation under the assets test and the income rules. Some superannuation interest is able to be disregarded. However, in some cirMAIN COMMITTEE",241,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Income Support Measures

248,Mr Lindsay,"Western Australians in the Defence Force are quite lesser people whencumstances, the value of superannuation cannot be disregarded under the asset deprivation rules and will be subject to the income rules. The coalition supports the amendments this bill makes. They are straightforward. Veterans are entitled to fair and equitable treatment and it is therefore important to standardise the treatment of pensions and benefits in Australia. A part of this is achieved by bringing veterans’ entitlements into line with the Social Security Act. I support the bill. the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment (Income Support Measures) Bill 2010. The government and the Australian community are justifiably proud of our ex-service men and women. The measures in this bill will go some way towards improving the well-being of Australian veterans and the wider ex-service community. Like most members in this place, I joined with local veterans, their families and the community to mark ANZAC Day only a few weeks ago. Despite the rain and the very cold weather in Ingleburn, which was a bit unseasonable for April, I was very proud to be in attendance. In embracing the spirit of ANZAC Day, it was great to see so many young people in particular taking the time to pause and reflect on the contributions that have been made by service men and women and what has been achieved on their behalf. It was great to see the number of young people attending. At Ingleburn, where we go to the dawn service, I would say that the number of young people who attend has grown considerably over the last five years. Obviously something is having an impact. It could be that the education system is educating young people more about what the contribution is or it could be that innate sense of wanting to grapple with part of our future. I think it is quite significant. I would like to commend Don Keefe, President of the Ingleburn RSL sub-branch, and Richard Moore, its secretary, for organising the moving service which recognised and commemorated the contributions of all the veterans, particularly those who attended that day. Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that the Ingleburn RSL sub-branch received in February of this year a $4,000 contribution from the federal government to undertake an important project to honour and remember the contributions made by Australians in times of war and conflict, as part of the Saluting Their Service commemorations grants program. This $4,000 has gone to help the Ingleburn RSL sub-branch replace the gates of the Ingleburn RSL memorial park, to improve the safety and accessibility. I am advised that that government support has made it more accessible for people who want to attend the services. As we heard from previous speakers, the Saluting Their Service program is making a genuine contribution to servicemen and service organisations around the country. I am very proud to be part of the government which oversees that program. I would also like to take this opportunity to indicate that recently, on 30 April, I attended a vigil at Hyde Park in Sydney organised by the Vietnamese community, the New South Wales chapter of the VCA. I paid my respects and marked the 35th anniversary of the fall of Saigon. This time each year holds a very special significance for Vietnamese Australians. The vigil this year marked the 35th year since the fall of Saigon to the North Vietnamese communists. It was a very sad moment for all Vietnamese people, especially for those who believe in liberty, freedom and democracy. The event was an opportunity for all those present to pause and honour the lives and memories of the many fine Australian and Vietnamese service men and women who had their lives tragically cut short in the Vietnam War. MAIN COMMITTEE",242,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Income Support Measures
249,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (4.35 Pm),"I join with other members and colleagues in supportingOur involvement was at a cost of 521 Australian servicemen, with more than 3,000 significantly injured. Regrettably, as every member of this House would know, a number of their wounds, were they were physical or otherwise, sometimes have a chilling aspect in terms of their effects in later life. That is why a number of our veteran organisations advocate for and support those people in looking after their long-term welfare. The contribution in Vietnamese lives to that conflict was also chilling, with 1.3 million deaths. That is one of the significant reasons to recognise the contribution of Vietnamese servicemen in that conflict. I would like to pay my respects and acknowledge Thanh Nguyen, the President of the Vietnamese Community of Australia, New South Wales Chapter, and the countless volunteers for organising this highly successful vigil and for their ongoing commitment to advancing the interests of the Vietnamese community, particularly in south-western Sydney. I also acknowledge the efforts they made to acknowledge the support of the ADF for their cause when they were in need. I appreciate the significant lengths they went to in acknowledging those contributions, particularly of the 521 young Australians who gave their lives in support of that conflict. Like other members, I participated this year-it was my fourth or fifth time-in the ADF Parliamentary Program. This year I had the opportunity to visit operations in the Middle East region. It was a 10-day deployment which had a number of MPs fly out from Sydney and land at Al Minhad airbase in the UAE. During the time there I had the opportunity to visit all areas of our joint force operations out of Al Minhad. That included being allocated to fly on a mission with the Australian Air Force in their P3 Orion. Our Air Force plays a very crucial role not simply in terms of the military operations there but also, in coordination with the Navy, being tasked to detect activities from people-smuggling off the coast of Somalia through to drug running. As you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, Afghanistan is one of the largest heroin suppliers to the world and our Air Force is playing a crucial role together with the Navy in doing something about that drug trade. When we were there we were not able to visit our Navy’s ship because they were doing a ship changeover. HMAS Parramatta is now on station and is undertaking a role in the gulf region as we speak. I also got to see and work with the people loading the C130 Hercules aircraft. It was great to see these young men and women, and the professionalism out there was absolutely extraordinary. At Al Minhad the average temperature is about 40 degrees and you are surrounded by sand which is much finer than the sand on our beach in Bondi, so it was not the most pleasant place to be. Yet that was the staging ground for our troops as they prepared to go into other areas of operation, particularly Afghanistan. I am not sure how it is arranged, but every member of the ADF going into Afghanistan or on to other deployments must undertake a four-day military course at Al Minhad, which unfortunately means you have to kit up in full military gear, including bulletproof vests laden with all the components that go with it to make it even heavier, and spend four days out there doing various things and learning to look for things such as improvised explosive devices. These are things that, as a parliamentarian, I somewhat take for granted. I was absolutely astounded by the professionalism of all the personnel, whether in the company stores or in the Air Force organising the flying of missions or arranging the stacking of C17s with vehicles. We have people there with a great degree of professionalism and commitment and incredible determination. As previous speakers have said, I could not have felt more deeply that the people we were working with and observing were the people who will be our veterans in the future. We owe it MAIN COMMITTEE to them to ensure that we do everything we can to look after their long-term interests. I would very much encourage members of parliament to participate in the ADF Parliamentary Program when they get the opportunity to do so. It is an opportunity to see up close and personal what our young men and women do on our behalf. I think it is only fair that we acknowledge, whenever possible, their contributions. You cannot really say what they do is a job, but what they do is incredibly important to this country and we should at every opportunity let them know that they have and will always have our full support. The bill before us today demonstrates the government’s commitment to the Australian veterans community and comes at a special time in Australia’s wartime history. This year marks some very significant anniversaries including the 95th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign, the 65th anniversary of the victory in the Pacific, 50 years since the end of the Malayan Emergency and 60 years since the start of the Korean War. I understand there will be various special ceremonies throughout the year marking these occasions. I know a number of those will take place in my electorate and in many other electorates as well. I look forward to the opportunity to pay my respects at those ceremonies. This bill introduces a number of minor technical amendments to the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986. This amendment bill further aligns veterans’ entitlements law with social security law and has a negligible financial impact. The changes will provide for greater certainty in the administration of veterans’ entitlements acts. It will remove redundant provisions and it will correct an anomaly whereby pensioners paid under social security law are, in some cases, receiving more favourable pension outcomes than service pensioners and income support recipients. Under the government’s provisions the veterans’ community can expect our persistent efforts to address a range of issues around veterans’ entitlements and services which go to addressing the well-being and certainly the recognition of our people. We are justifiably proud of our veterans and our ex-service men and women. This was demonstrated in last night’s budget. The government is delivering on some key election promises for veterans in this budget by providing a $246.4 million package of new initiatives. Among those initiatives are commitments of providing greater access to compensation and income support; preventing unnecessary hospital admissions for members of the veterans’ community by expanding the community based health services; acting on the recommendations of the Clarke review; and one specific commitment, which has been raised on many occasions by both sides of this House, better access to health care and compensation for F111 workers. In relation to that I am referring to the cleaning of the fuel tanks of the F111 which impacted extremely seriously on the health of a number of those Air Force personnel. These budget measures clearly demonstrate that the government is serious about looking after veterans’ communities and their families. BeforeI conclude I will also indicate the role that our veterans’ communities undertake in our respective areas. I would like to mention a couple of people before I conclude. Mr Ron Brown is the New South Wales branch president of the National Servicemen’s Association of Australia. Anyone in a Sydney based seat would see Ron around most weekends. I have to say that I am very fortunate that he is one of my constituents, so I get to see him more than most. pay, it is not a matter of kudos; they do it because they are so passionate in their belief in MAIN COMMITTEE",243,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Income Support Measures
250,Mr Katter,Keith Payne is another one.,245,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Income Support Measures
251,Mr Hayes,"Yes. For these people, who put in extraordinary hours, it is not a matter oflooking after their colleagues. Some of the cases they have to deal with on behalf of their constituents are very, very sad. To Ron, I say not only am I very grateful for his friendship but also I am extremely grateful on behalf of the defence community in my area. Similarly, Ken Foster of the Macarthur Veterans Information Service, despite his own ill health and hospitalisation, has been an extraordinary contributor to veterans services throughout the whole Macarthur region. There is also my good friend Max Chinn and his wife, Olive. Max is the President of the Campbelltown Veterans Recreation Centre, Dredges Cottage, where all the veterans can meet. There are various veterans associations, and this is one of those things that we do as a community. It is always a privilege for me to be associated with anything to do with our veterans community, as I grew up in an area where we understood what these people did on our behalf and what they were able to achieve. It is extraordinary to see these old men going about their tasks these days, mainly supported by their wives, and motivated only to do well by their peers. I think we have an obligation to do anything that we can ever do to assist these people in the way they go about their business of looking after veterans. Thank you. chamber, I would like to ask him to pass on my regards to Ron Brown. Ron and his wife come to a little place called Bingara in my electorate and have been there on a number of occasions. I have run into Ron at other national service events, in Inverell and other places. There are 300 or 400 national service people who get together at Bingara each year and have a weekend of events, and Ron is one of the people who have been very supportive of them. So please pass on my personal regards, but I would also like to recognise him and his work in this chamber. I am particularly pleased that you, Deputy Speaker Scott, are in the chair for this debate, because I think that you were a very good Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. One of the sad things that happened with my entry into this building was that the numbers changed within the National Party, and I believe I was partly at fault for your loss of the ministry. I do apologise if I had any consequence in relation to that. I remember you as minister and I know you were very highly regarded in that role, and I think you still have a very positive influence to this day on the current minister and others who are involved in veterans affairs. This Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment (Income Support Measures) Bill 2010 is really about some housekeeping in terms of veterans affairs, and I guess everybody will support the legislation, as I will. But I do intend to make a second reading amendment, which the member for Kennedy will be seconding, and I do intend to have the bill returned to the main chamber, where I will call a division. I am fully aware of the consequences of the amendment-in a sense, the issue is with money bills-but I feel so strongly about the amendment that I think it needs a division in the House to gauge the feelings of the members towards what the amendment is actually addressing. I have raised this issue over a number of years-and I think the first time was in 2002; I only came into this place in 2001-particularly in relation to Second World War veterans who did not achieve what is called qualifying service. Qualifying service essentially is serving in a theatre of war where an angry shot was fired. But they did serve their nation. Back in 2002 I used the example of my father. He has been dead a long time, but he served in the Middle East. If he had lived beyond the 1950s, he would have had qualifying service. Many other MAIN COMMITTEE",245,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Income Support Measures
252,Mr Windsor (New England) (4.52 Pm),"While the member for Werriwa is still in the people-people in all of our electorates-joined up to defend the nation and were ordered to go either overseas or to Townsville, to Western Australia, to Singleton or to various other places within Australia not only to be trained but to be ready to be sent wherever they were ordered to go. In many cases, some of those people served for five years but did not leave Australia. As a consequence, they did not have what is called qualifying service. If they did have qualifying service, they are now entitled to the gold card. Most of those people are now well into their 80s and would not be enjoying the best of health. Obviously, they are being treated by the health system differently from those people who did have qualifying service and served overseas. I will move this amendment. I will read it, if I may, because it encapsulates not only those people in the Second World War but people over 70. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words “while supporting the Bill, the House is of the opinion that the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA) should be amended so that the full repatriation benefit, including the health entitlement Gold Card, applies to Australian veterans who are aged 70 years or over, irrespective of whether those veterans have been in danger from hostile forces of the enemy as the current legislation and proposed amendment bill demands”. It is essentially to recognise those people who were prepared to defend the nation, to carry out the orders of their superiors and to go wherever it was demanded they go. On the example I used a moment ago, of my father being in the Middle East: if the Japanese had defeated the Australian forces in New Guinea, for instance, my father and his comrades would have been absolutely useless in defending Australia. The very people that did not go overseas and receive qualifying service-and receive health benefits now-would have been the ones that would have defended the nation they represented. They would have been in Australia. Obviously, the powers that be at the time would have been making decisions based on how many troops they needed to leave in Australia just in case the Japanese did in fact break through and come to the Australian continent. I think it is an absolute disgrace that we have particularly Second World War veterans-and they are dying at the rate of about 800 a month at the moment-that are being treated as second-class soldiers. They are people who gave up four and five years of their lives to train to serve this nation in any capacity where they were ordered, and they are being treated differently from those who went overseas. There are many people-and I am sure we all have within our electorates examples of men in their 80s who were in their 20s then and trained as paratroopers or tank operators or whatever and received injuries just in the training processes. Now they are in their 70s and 80s, it obviously would be coming against them in their health. They deserve the recognition and the respect of this nation and should get the entitlement to additional healthcare assistance through the gold card. As I said earlier, I recognise that this amendment relates to money, so in a sense it can be treated as an invalid amendment. I am not demanding-particularly since it is the day after the budget-that the government suddenly find additional money tomorrow for this issue, but it is important that those veterans who are still alive actually feel that respect from parliamentarians. They deserve that respect. If we are serious about encouraging young people into the armed services to defend those of us who do not serve-and I listened to the member for Werriwa talking about our young people in Afghanistan and Iraq et cetera-we have to make sure that, if something goes wrong MAIN COMMITTEE with them, if their health does suffer because of their service or associated with their service, they have special regard. There can be no-one more special than someone who was prepared to die for this country in the Second World War, and yet we are still treating some of those people as second-class citizens. As I said a moment ago, Second World War veterans are dying at the rate of 800 a month. It is not an exponential cost to the nation to treat these people the same as their comrades who did serve overseas or happened to be travelling through Darwin when Darwin was bombed or happened to be in Townsville when various incidents occurred in that area. They were going where they were ordered to go. SoI ask the Main Committee and the Housewhen the bill does get back to the House-to look seriously at this, to look past the absolute money requirements and to look into their hearts about this. This is about recognition of people who were prepared to die for us. It is something that we should look seriously at. In concluding, I want to reflect on a recent trip that I did to South Korea with a delegation. It was amazing the recognition that remains in that nation of the Australian forces in the Korean conflict. It was very, very touching that both elderly and young Korean people, when they found out we were Australians, said thank you for what our veterans of the Korean War-in a sense, a forgotten war-did for them. We were the first cab off the rank. It was a United Nations force at the time, but Australia was there first. We were one of those nations that said, ‘Yes, we’ll defend the rights of these people to have their freedoms rather than be taken over by the North Koreans and the Chinese.’ Australians were there first. That has not left the minds of those people. It is an incredible nation now. In a lot of ways, this history is an advantage we have over other nations in the way in which we deal with them, either diplomatically or in a trade sense. SoI just pass on to the House the good wishes of many people-from the Prime Minister to the foreign minister through to people in the street-who wanted it to be conveyed to the Australian people that they remember what our forebears did for them. Those men would be over 70 now too. Those who served in Korea obviously would be in receipt of a gold card, but there would be many others who were prepared to go or would have been on the next plane or boat. They received the same training and had the same capacities but do not receive the same benefits in terms of their health care. I would urge all members to really think about this particular amendment. NormallyI do not support second reading amendments because, in a sense, they are meaningless. But this is not meaningless in relation to the way in which we have regard for these people. I think that, at the rate at which they are dying, it is about time that we showed them that we do consider them to be all the same-not as one class of soldier and another class of soldier. It has obviously been done in the past-and I am not blaming any government for this-because of the sheer numbers and the multiplication of costs. But, as they are dying out at a very rapid rate, I think the least we can do is recognise their contribution and look after their comrades who are still here to this day. I am very pleased that the member for Kennedy is going to second this motion. certainly felt the pain of being medically discharged during the Second World War. Speaking about one of the groups that he was with in the Army, he said the irony of it was that they MAIN COMMITTEE",246,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Income Support Measures
253,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Re Ramsey),Is the motion seconded?,248,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Income Support Measures
254,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (5.06 Pm),"Yes. My father was not a bitter person but he mostwent to Africa, they had a wonderful trip around the world and they never saw a shot fired in anger. He said he could never go in the ANZAC Day marches because he had been medically discharged. He had volunteered before the war broke out. He said he could see war coming and he thought it was everyone’s duty to volunteer. I must also declare a personal interest: I also fit into this category. I think it behoves us to declare an interest when we have one. I also joined up, but not before the war. The war with Indonesia-the ‘konfrontasi’-had already broken out. I was 18 years of age at the time. At 17 I had never envisaged that at 18 I would be carrying a rifle and be on 24-hour call-up to go and fight in Indonesia and later in Vietnam. I was in the 49th Battalion. The average age of the 49th Battalion when they went to New Guinea was 18½ years. My father and his battalion volunteered in exactly the same way as I did. They had not envisaged that Australia would be at war with Japan. The war with Japan suddenly came upon them and, some three, four or five months later, they were up on the Kokoda Trail. One thousand men from the 49th Battalion went up there. As I said, the luck of the coin could have gone the other way, but they ended up at Kokoda and Sandananda. When they were relieved at Sandananda, only 28 of the 1,000strong battalion were able to walk out unassisted. The majority of the battalion died on the Kokoda Trail or at Sandananda or Buna. It was simply a matter of luck. Those men had volunteered and were prepared to go. They were the unlucky ones. My generation volunteered and we were prepared to go. We were on 24-hour call-up. But we were at the lucky ones; we did not end up going. I think the amendment moved by the member for New England is an excellent one. It takes into account the reality of men who were prepared to go to war and sacrifice their life. Through the toss of a coin, they ended up one way and not the other. In the First World War my great grandad and his brother quite literally tossed a coin. As luck would have it, my great grandad lost, and his brother went to Gallipoli-he is still at Gallipoli and he will always be at Gallipoli. So today we are talking about the toss of a coin, and that should not decide whether your country honours you or does not. You volunteered in exactly the same way. Your life was at risk in exactly the same way. You just happened to be lucky that you did not get shot at. Amendment (Income Support Measures) Bill 2010 without wishing to comment extensively on the amendment as I am sure that will be dealt with in due course. Earlier, the member for Herbert spoke very highly, very fondly, of the efforts of members of the 3rd Brigade of the Australian Regular Army, and at that point he made some comments about Perth and soldiers serving in Western Australia. SoI would like to take the opportunity to speak a little bit about what happens over in Western Australia and my high regard for the Army Reserve’s 13th Brigade, because I think that there are aspects of this bill which will certainly impact upon the members of the 13th Brigade. The commander of the 13th Brigade is Brigadier Stephen Cain, and under his command there is A Squadron, 10th Light Horse, a unit which has a very great tradition in the service of this nation. My understanding is that A Squadron served throughout the First World War with the Australian forces and distinguished themselves on numerous occasions. Similarly, the 11th/28th Battalion traces its heritage back to the Second World War and the First World War, and 16th Battalion also goes back to the First World War. Other units within the 13th Brigade MAIN COMMITTEE",248,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Income Support Measures
255,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (5.09 Pm),"I would like to speak on the Veterans’ Entitlementsare the 7th Field Battery, 13th Field Squadron, 109th Signals Squadron and the logistics units for the 13th Brigade. When we talk about veterans and about our soldiers putting themselves in harm’s way, in the current environment we often find that reserves are very much part of the Australian Defence Force and very much part of the Army. Look at what the 13th Brigade from Western Australia, based at Karrakatta, have done. In recent years they have been to the Solomon Islands, serving there; they have been to East Timor; to Malaysia, as Rifle Company Butterworth; and to Bougainville. And they have been in Iraq and Afghanistan. So, in very much the same way that the reserve units of the Australian Army trace their heritage back to the wars that this nation has fought, they continue to serve very much on the front line; on numerous occasions they have done so in recent years and they will continue to do so in the future. So, to Brigadier Cain, and the officers and other ranks of the 13th Brigade, I extend my thanks for and my appreciation of the work they do, the work they have done in the past and the work they will do in the future for our great nation. Also, with regard to this bill, we have recently had ANZAC Day, and on ANZAC DayI attended two formal ceremonies as part of my commitment to the day. Firstly, I attended the dawn service at Ballajura RSL. This has run for several years now, ever since the Ballajura War Memorial and Peace Park was built by the local community. There were private donations, but also the previous federal government was quite involved-to the tune of $155,000 in a couple of sets of grants. Each ANZAC Day a very good dawn service takes place. I would like to thank the president, Mike Gilmore, and the secretary, Scottie Alcorn, for the work that they have done to make sure that the interests of veterans and the community with regard to ANZAC Day are served so well, particularly at the dawn service on that day. Later on that day the Wanneroo-Joondalup RSL held a very good parade and then a very appropriate service. Rob Frencham from the Wanneroo-Joondalup RSL, the RSL of which I am a member, ran that. I was also most honoured to be able to lead the parade this year, marching alongside two World War II veterans. SoI again extend my appreciation to the Wanneroo-Joondalup RSL for the great work they do in commemorating ANZAC Day each year. I would also like to follow up on something the member for Werriwa said. I also would like to pay my respects to another chapter related to Australian history. That was the commemoration of black April, or 30 April 1975, the fall of Saigon and the fall of the Republic of South Vietnam. We recently commemorated that fateful and dark day for the Vietnamese community in Australia. That took place, as it usually does, at the Australian Vietnam War memorial in Kings Park in Perth. I would pass on my appreciation to all members of the community but in particular the incoming and fairly new president of the Vietnamese community, Mrs Dau Thi Tran, and President of the Republic of Vietnam Veterans Association of WA, Mr Nguyen Van Thanh. I would like to thank them for the opportunity to again-I think it is my third year now-attend that service. I will always remind the Vietnamese people that we live for the day when their homeland will be free from the oppression and the failure that is socialism and the Communist Party of Vietnam so that religious freedom and true democracy and freedom of speech can once again help the people of that nation go forward. As we know, the Vietnamese people in Australia have thrived. Their work ethic is second to none, and they are successes in every part of this MAIN COMMITTEE country. A great success story began when they came to this country. However, that is not the case for the 88 million Vietnamese that remain in their homeland. SoI say again that we live for the day when their country will be free, when their opportunities will match those of Vietnamese people who live in this country. To conclude, I would like to say that I stand in favour of the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment (Income Support Measures) Bill 2010, and I look forward to it passing. (5.17 pm)-I have been pleased to present the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment (Income Support Measures) Bill 2010, which addresses minor but necessary measures that will remove anomalies between veterans’ entitlements law and social security law. As a result of the changes in this bill, payments associated with part-time work experience under a labour market program will be exempt under the veterans’ entitlements income test. This corrects an omission in the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. The bill makes two changes in relation to comparable foreign pensions. Firstly, the partner of a service pension or income support supplement claim recipient will be required to claim a comparable foreign pension if the partner is entitled to such a pension. The partner will be required to claim the comparable foreign pension within a time frame that will be specified in a notice. In the case of persons who are currently receiving a service pension or income support supplement, their partners, where entitled to a comparable foreign pension, will be given six months to claim the pension. The second change to comparable foreign pensions affects the treatment of arrears payments of such pensions. Instead of treating the arrears payments as income in the 12-month period from the date of grant of the comparable foreign pension, these amendments will mean that the arrears payment is treated as periodical payments for the period of the arrears. This change is expected to provide a better result in the majority of cases and closes a potential loophole in the legislation by removing the opportunity for pensioners to change to a social security pension to avoid the income test in relation to the arrears payment. Minor amendments in the bill will repeal all references to benevolent homes from the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, as these provisions are no longer applicable. Finally, amendments will clarify the intention of the veterans’ entitlements means test in relation to disregarding the value of certain superannuation investments specified in a determination by the minister. The changes will make it clear that these superannuation investments are not disregarded for the purposes of the deemed income rules and the asset deprivation rules. These corrections to the legislation will protect the integrity of the means test and the pension system by ensuring that specified superannuation investments are treated as originally intended and are counted as assets when calculating deemed income and will be counted as assets if the asset has been disposed of for less than adequate or no consideration. I make mention of the fact that these are largely minor amendments. We often find ourselves in this place correcting anomalies, updating legislation to ensure it better meets the needs of those we are responsible for. The amendments that are included as part of this bill form part of that process of updating matters into the future. I will take the opportunity to address a couple of other points that were raised in the debate. In particular, my good friend the member for Paterson raised a number of issues around MAIN COMMITTEE",249,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Income Support Measures
256,Mr Griffin (Bruce,"Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel)broader questions, if you like, that relate to the veterans’ entitlements system and some related issues. He made some points about a press release with respect to the budget. As I understand it, he raised issues from a press release produced by a series of organisations called the Alliance of Service and Ex-service Organisations. It covers the Defence Force Welfare Organisation, the Naval Association of Australia, the RAAF Association and the Royal Australian Regiment Association. I think, though, for the public record it may be a reasonable idea to go a little bit further than the member for Paterson. The first two-thirds of the press release go to the question of congratulating and welcoming what this government has done with respect to last night’s budget. I do not want to be accused of misquoting, so I am going to quote: … welcome the budget decisions to provide new initiatives for Australian veterans over the next four years. The key features include: access to better health care and compensation for an additional 2,400 F 111 aircraft fuel tank maintenance workers … I will paraphrase the next dot point: ‘Compensation and benefits for Defence Force personnel who participated in British nuclear testing in the fifties and sixties at Maralinga, Emu Field and on the Montebello Islands. And further: … reclassification of the service of certain submarine special operations personnel between 1978 and 1992 to acknowledge their contribution, recognising it as qualifying service, opening up eligibility for benefits such as the Gold Card. Up to 890 former submariners will benefit from this change … Improved health care for veterans and war widows and reduce unnecessary hospital stays through preventable admissions and improve the community care program. The needs of carers have been addressed as part of the government’s broader response to the Who cares report and the national disability strategy. It is true to say-and the member for Paterson was quite clear about this-that additional issues were raised in that press release. That was the last third of the press release, which he spoke of. Three particular issues are raised there. There is a long standing issue around the indexation of military superannuation and an issue around the reclassification of the service of certain counterterrorism special operations undertaken by SAS personnel. Again, there is no decision to remove the remaining level of erosion to the value of veterans’ disability pensions nor to adjust them in line with the increase in community living standards since 1997. I want to go through some of those issues, given that they were raised by the member for Paterson. On the military superannuation issue there are a number of complexities. The suggestion appears to be that the government has not done what the government said it would do when it was in opposition. At that time-and I was part of that opposition and I had responsibilities in this area of military superannuation prior to the election-two commitments were made. One was a commitment to have a review of indexation methodologies. That was the Matthews report. There is no doubt that many in the ex-service community are very unhappy with the results of that report, but the commitment from the government was to conduct a review and the government accepted the review’s recommendations. I do not expect the ex-service community to be happy with that-far from it, but the commitment that was made was honoured. The second one related to the Podger review into military superannuation. The Podger review was commissioned by the previous government and received by the previous government in July 2007. In the lead-up to the election, post that time, the government of the day MAIN COMMITTEE refused to release that report publicly. So the Australian community, the veteran community, who were very concerned about this issue, were unable to find out what the report said. In opposition we committed to publicly release that report in order for a debate to ensue about what recommendations were included in that report. We released that report publicly in December 2007 and we committed to a consultation process with the broader ex-service and military community about the recommendations included in that report. My colleague the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Warren Snowdon, conducted that review in the first few months of 2008. The very clear response to that review-and it was reiterated to me again by a number of ex-service organisations just several weeks ago-was that they were deeply unhappy with the recommendations included in the Podger review and they wanted government to go very slowly around the question of this and they did not want it implemented. If what the member for Paterson wants me to do is to implement a report that the ex-service community did not want and does not want, I wish he would come out and say that very clearly. But I want him to understand and I want the ex-service community to understand that, in line with their issues and their views around the Podger review, the government is very carefully considering what should happen with respect to that review. On the issue of reclassification of the service of the certain counterterrorism and special operations undertaken by the SAS personnel, the member for Paterson needs to check his facts and the background. This came out of the Clarke review, which was a review of veterans’ entitlements undertaken by the previous government some years ago, where there were a significant number of recommendations, many of which were actually ignored by the then Howard government. But you know what? There were some recommendations that were accepted. One of the recommendations that were accepted was one that said that you should not reclassify the service of the certain counterterrorism special operations group SAS personnel. So the member for Paterson has raised a criticism about an issue on which the previous government, of which he was a member-and he is certainly still a member of the same party, last time. I looked-actually accepted the recommendation from Clarke, which was not to do what he raised in the chamber today. I find that passing strange. The third issue relates to the question of veterans’ disability pensions and the erosion of the value of those pensions. This was subject to a great deal of debate and discussion within the ex-service community and in the parliament in the lead-up to the last election. In fact, following on from a decision taken by the then Labor opposition, around the time of the 2007 budget, to put forward a proposal to index disability pensions in the veterans’ entitlements system to the male total average weekly earnings, the Howard government accepted that proposal and extended that proposal in some areas and announced it at the time of the September National RSL Congress. Legislation then went through the parliament before the election with bipartisan support. That system has been in place since, I think, March 2008. Since then, those payments have maintained their value with reference to male total average weekly earnings. There is no question about that. Since that time we have had the Harmer review, which was a review into income support payments and led, as the chamber knows, to significant increases, particularly to single rate income support payments-many of which are received by members of the veteran community. In fact, the Harmer review resulted in a budget commitment of some $1.1 billion over the MAIN COMMITTEE forward estimates to income support payments received by members of the wider veteran and ex-service community. But, in the context of the issue of the continuing level of erosion, once again, the key date here is ‘since 1997’. I am afraid that, for most of the time since 1997, the member for Paterson and his party were in government. The erosion occurred under the Howard government-and no-one other than them. We led the charge to address that erosion issue-and that is a fact. The other point I would make is about the action being taken in the budget and those initiatives on which I have been congratulated by these organisations. What needs to be clearly understood there is this: the changes in relation to F111 deseal-reseal workers, which will mean that some 2,400 are eligible for support if they have become sick with an illness which can be associated with their service-which we estimate will be something in the region of almost $40 million in additional compensation and more than $12 million in healthcare support for these people who have real issues as a result of their service-came as a result of a parliamentary committee report. The report was produced on the basis of a commitment made by the government when we were in opposition, prior to the last election. I made that commitment. I made it at Amberley. I made it at a meeting of the F111 deseal-reseal support group. The next speaker was the then Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, and he refused to match that commitment. The point here is that the government’s initiative from last night, which I believe is supported by the opposition, was a commitment which resulted from an inquiry which the now opposition and then government refused to support. The initiatives regarding participants in British nuclear testing and submarine special operations personnel were again recommendations which the previous government received as part of the review by Justice Clarke and recommendations that they refused to implement. I just want to be clear that people understand that some $36 million in initiatives relating to Clarke recommendations, which the previous government refused to accept, and some $55 million in total in terms of support for F111 deseal-reseal workers, are, as far as I know, being supported by the opposition, but when they actually had the opportunity to do something about it they did nothing. That point needs to be remembered. I will come back to the superannuation issue on that basis. Indexation in relation to superannuation is not a new issue. It has been an issue of concern for quite some time. In fact, it was an issue of concern throughout the time of the previous government. The previous government, at a time of huge surpluses, at a time when they had the capacity, sat on their hands and refused to act. Now, a couple of years into opposition, they seem to have found their voice with respect to that issue. I think the ex-service community should be very careful regarding the wording of any commitments or any suggestions or any intimations that come through from the opposition about what action they may or may not take on this issue. The fact of the matter is that they had 10 years to do something about it, they had a financial situation which would have allowed them to take action and they did not take it. That ought to be remembered. I will close by addressing the second reading amendment moved by the member for New England. The member for New England and I have on occasions discussed this issue of the particular applications of the current test of qualifying service, how it operates and what it means for people in certain circumstances. I think he knows that I find it a vexed area. HowMAIN COMMITTEE ever, he also knows that I cannot agree to his amendment for a number of reasons, which I am happy to outline. It should never be suggested-and I know that he would not suggest it-that we do not value the service of those who joined our armed services at times throughout our nation’s history, particularly when the nation was in peril. It is absolutely true that the question of where someone went, where they were posted and what they therefore faced, was very much a matter of what was required from the particular service in terms of the needs of the country at that time. However, the underlying point around qualifying service goes to the question of facing and incurring danger from hostile forces. It is a cornerstone of qualifying service and it has been, as I understand it, back to at least 1936. It goes back to the question of, regardless of the willingness to fight, the actual impacts that people face as a result of their service and a recognition within the ex-service community, ex-service organisations and the repatriation system that the actual facing of danger has impacts with respect to your life-and, frankly, those impacts are not good. That is why traditionally there has been a situation where qualifying service provides people with additional benefits and additional assistance under the repatriation system. That has developed over time, depending on the time, to a range of different aspects. The gold card is the one that is normally raised, particularly with the decision taken some years ago for over-70s with qualifying service to be able to access that card. That is a point that has been looked at in things like the Clarke review. Although Clarke recommended some changes to the incurred danger test, the bottom line is that he did support qualifying service as an ongoing concept to be maintained. The situation for those who served in Australia is that it depends on where they served and when they served. There are inconsistencies, in my view, around aspects of this. If you served in Northern Australia in certain latitudes at certain times, particularly around the bombings of Darwin, the situation is that that was considered to be qualifying service. If you travelled in coastal waters at times when there was a fear of enemy action, of submarine attack et cetera, again there was allowance for qualifying service. Essentially, that underlying test is seen as being a very important part of the overall repatriation system. It is a test that this government maintains is correct. It is a test that the previous government held to. It is a test that all governments have held to over the years we have had this system in place. That is not in any way to cast any aspersions about the courage, the bravery and the willingness to serve their country of those who are in a situation where they are denied that access. It goes to the question of the circumstances they faced in their service and the nature of that very important principle of qualifying service. It is also a test which is supported overwhelmingly in the ex-service community in terms of ex-service organisations like the RSL because of that recognition of the circumstances people face if they are facing an armed enemy. I would like to leave it on that point. Although the amendments in this bill are minor, they are part of a continuing adjustment of the system to ensure it maintains the support required for those we represent and who deserve so much. I commend the bill to the House. now be read a second time. To this the honourable member for New England has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. Those of that opinion say aye, to the contrary no.

257,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Re Ramsey),"The original question was that this billQuestion unresolved. questions to be considered in relation to this bill, in accordance with standing order 195 the bill will be returned to the House for further consideration. Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 March, on motion by Mr Clare: That this bill be now read a second time. (Flexible Participation Requirements for Principal Carers) Bill 2010 is to alter the provisions for granting exemptions to parents or principal carers who are asked to look for part-time work as part of their welfare requirements. This bill follows the Participation review taskforce report, published in August 2008, which outlines a series of participation requirement changes designed to increase flexibility. The report was subsequently actioned in the 2009-10 budget measure ‘More flexible participation requirements for parents’. Essentially, the bill alters or creates exemptions available to principal carers on income support. The exemption for principal carers undertaking home schooling or distance education will be available until the youngest child leaves school up until the age of 19 years, which is up from the current 16 years. Secondly, the exemption for large families will be available where the family has four children of school age up to 19 years, again an increase from the current 16 years. Thirdly, the domestic violence exemption is currently only available where a party has left the violent relationship. The bill will see family breakdown no longer being a necessary precondition for receiving an exemption. A new exemption for kinship care is granted that allows for principal carers where there is a care plan prepared or accepted by a state or territory government. Job seekers who provide emergency or respite foster care will have an extended exemption to cater for the period of care and subsequent time to support their availability for future care. From1 July 2010, a parent will be able to count their study, voluntary work or part-time work, or a combination of these, towards meeting part-time participation requirements. Mutual obligations are of key importance in making welfare a disincentive for those seeking to avoid work and be supported by hard working Australian taxpayers. Mutual obligations play an equally important role in breaking the cycle of idleness and habits of apathy. The obligations allow people to give back-in return for welfare assistance, they provide people with new experiences, including positive work experiences. Hardworking Australian taxpayers will be angered by the Rudd government’s watering down of mutual obligations. This is bad policy from a weak government. Under the previous coalition government those on income support not meeting participation requirements fell to below 10 per cent, according to industry participants. The coalition’s more rigorous and consistent approach to mutual obligation had a positive impact on returning the unemployed to the workforce. According to DEEWR, in December 2003, 74 per cent of Newstart allowance recipients had an obligation to work. This has now dropped to some 58 per cent. In December 2003, 480,449 Newstart allowance recipients received a payment. In December 2009 the figure was MAIN COMMITTEE",255,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Income Support Measures

259,Mr Andrews (Menzies) (5.39 Pm),"The objective of the Social Security Amendment544,776. According to industry sources, the number of individuals on income support gaining exemptions from mutual obligation requirements has increased from a low of less than 10 per cent under the previous coalition government to in excess of 30 per cent in some areas. The total number of penalties imposed has fallen from 32,000 in 2007-08 to only 19,406 in 200809. Since July 2009 there have been only 12,283 penalties, and only 4,353 of them involved the most severe penalty of loss of benefit for eight weeks-‘three strikes and you are out’ is simply not being applied. From1 July some unemployed people will not even have to get out of bed to claim their welfare. The government’s approach means they will not have to hand in their forms in person at Centrelink offices. Instead, Newstart recipients will be able to report online or by telephone. Under the previous coalition government the ‘work for the dole’ time frame was six months of benefits. But now, under Labor, it has been extended from six months to 12 months. Indeed, the number of participants undertaking work for the dole has been cut in half by the Rudd government. As of 7 April there were 12,695 unemployed people in work for the dole schemes, down from 22,362 in April 2005. Whilst the coalition does not oppose this bill, the government should do more to monitor and enforce participation requirements for those on income support. I foreshadow that the coalition may seek to introduce amendments to this bill in the Senate. The weakening of mutual obligation is bad policy from a weak government. (Flexible Participation Requirements for Principal Carers) Bill 2010. I would like to start by saying that this bill, which amends the Social Security Act, will improve the participation arrangement for tens of thousands of families on income support-many of whom reside in the south-west of Sydney, my electorate included-with participation requirements that give them the opportunity to gain more skills and improve their work opportunities. I know that the previous speaker, the member for Menzies, just made a series of criticisms of this bill and said it watered down the former Howard government’s stand. Make no mistake: this bill still has at its core mutual obligations with respect to social security. Those are front and centre in this legislation. But we are making sure that those obligations are constructed in a framework of fairness. As we go through this bill, I want to say that couching an argument based on how tough you can be on people who unfortunately have fallen through the cracks of life is not the way I think you would like to present yourself to an electorate. That particularly goes for an electorate of mine, which has a lot of people who unfortunately do need to be assisted from time to time. These are people we do want assistance to get back into a normal way of life and back into normal society. I get to see the success stories of what we achieve out in the south-west of Sydney as well. I know from speaking with many parents who are on income support that some of them find themselves having difficulty complying with the current job search requirements. They tell me often that the current job search requirements are too rigid, particularly when there are a number of children involved. We are trying to make sure, without removing mutual obligation, that these rules do not act as a block to these people gaining skills to enhance their ability to find work and participate through work in a normal life. It is all very easy to come in here and trivialise the issue by saying, ‘Let’s ratchet it up and see how tough we can be.’ But the truth of the matter is that not everyone out there has been MAIN COMMITTEE",256,Social Security Amendment Flexible Participation Requirements For Principal Carers Bill 2010
260,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (5.44 Pm),"I rise to support the Social Security Amendmentdealt the same hand in life. Sometimes it is necessary to show some compassion in how we go about helping these people back to where they can fully participate in society. As I said, I get to see the other end of it, where people do come back-having had that degree of assistanceand go on. People have with assistance attended the University of Western Sydney and gone on to be teachers. One young woman I had the opportunity to meet some years back-I actually met her at a homeless shelter-for a range of different reasons was homeless. She was estranged from her parents. With a group of people and with the assistance of the local Rotary club we supplied for her tutoring services. One thing she made very clear to me was this. She said, ‘I’ll bet you assisted your kids with their homework when they were young.’ I thought to myself and said, ‘Of course I did.’ She asked, ‘Who helps us?’ I spoke to the local Rotary at the time. Two people who were key in Ingleburn Rotary, Michael and Sandra Kidd, were both retired high school principals. They started turning up at this refuge and tutoring the kids. This young girl-and I will not name her-contacted me at the beginning of this year to say she had been accepted to do a bachelor of social work at the University of Western Sydney. To simply go out and show how tough on people we could be would decry the sort of success that we are achieving out there. I understand that what is also in this bill generally reflects positively on the report prepared by the government’s Participation Review Taskforce. It is important to rehash that a little. My colleague Brendan O’Connor, as then Minister for Employment Participation, in May 2008 established the task force to examine how participation requirements for parents-particularly those who were mature age job seekers-receiving income support could be adjusted to better take into account their family and community responsibilities. By way of background, what was delivered to the government in August 2008 contained some 20 recommendations, including one specifically in relation to mature age job seekers. Importantly, the government has responded to the recommendations made by the taskforce by changes within the bill to make income support more effective by helping parents balance parenting responsibilities with their participation requirements. We know that having a job is a key factor to inclusion. Whether it be socially or economically, it is key in terms of inclusion within our mainstream community. But given the skills and labour shortages we have experienced for a range of reasons, particularly over the term of the last government, which had a significant period of not investing in skills development, we need to assist job seekers, particularly those of mature age, to gain those further skills to re-engage with employment and do it in such a way that it is going to be meaningful. To do this we will be investing $26.8 million over the next four years to improve the participation arrangements for parents and carers of children that will give them the opportunity to gain more skills and improve their opportunities in seeking employment. Under our initiatives parents will be assisted to better balance work and study and their family commitments. Contrary to what the opposition has been saying, indicated very ably before by the member for Menzies, it should be said that parents will continue to be required to meet their participation agreements in order to receive income support. That is not weakening it; that is actually adjusting it in such a way as to look at value-adding, if you like, our human resource, particularly upgrading skills and making their opportunities for work more realistic and more meaningful. The changes are not designed to make it harder, or for that matter easier, for people receiving income support. The aim is to make income support more effective by helping parMAIN COMMITTEE ents balance their parenting responsibilities with their participation requirements. Another key point I would like to make is that there will be no change in the amount of income support paid to parents as a result of these measures, so that is not a cost, as has been alluded to. I would like to make a few brief comments about some of the specific features of this bill. It will extend the existing 12-month automatic exemption for families with four or more children, or where there is home or distance education involved, to be eligible until the youngest child turns 19 and completes their secondary education. The government recognises that parents play an absolutely incredible role and an important role in caring for and supporting their kids through education. It is probably not fair to say just we in government recognise it; I think anyone who is a parent or, as in my case, a grandparent would attest to that. By extending the exemption to current large families and home schooling and distance education, that will clearly permit the concentration of that care and support while a child is completing education up to 19 years of age. The government recognises that responsibility that parents with large families do have and that it does not cease when they turn 16. I have got to say it does not cease either when they turn 31, but that is another story. The changes recognise the role that parents have in supporting their children during the final years of their secondary education and the need for parents to balance their parental responsibilities with their participation in the workforce. The bill will also liberalise the eligibility of the 16-week domestic violence exemption to include parents who remain in a violent relationship, as well as those who have left such a relationship over the previous six months. This is an area which is near and dear to my heart. Through my involvement with the police locally, I get to see that all our crime statistics in the south-west of Sydney are being effectively managed, and we are very proud of that fact. Whether there have been armed robberies or break-ins, the clear-up rates have been very good. The only thing which is remaining stubborn in our crime statistics is the incidence of domestic violence. I mentioned that to a young woman I found in a homeless refuge who was a victim of domestic violence. Regrettably, of all the kids I get to see out there, at least 85 per cent of the young people who find themselves homeless are victims of domestic violence. It is a scourge on modern society. I know that the debate on this bill is not the place to talk about domestic violence but I feel very passionately that we who are in positions of leadership in our community must, at every opportunity, speak up about domestic violence against women and children. It is incomprehensible in modern society that the incidence of domestic violence is at present levels. The liberalisation of the existing 16-week exemption will provide better assistance for parents, regardless of whether they are in or have left a violent relationship. It acknowledges that parents are unlikely to participate effectively in paid work in such circumstances, while still caring and playing a parental role. That is probably a very hard ask. But there is a requirement that the length of the exemption will ensure that parents who experience domestic violence or family violence will have regular contact with Centrelink social workers and will be provided opportunities for referral to other support services. It is important to note that, should the initial 16 weeks not be a sufficient period, the exemption can be extended at the discretion of the Centrelink social worker. That is something I applaud, particularly in the south-west of Sydney-and I have no reason to look closely at any other electorate. If every member were preMAIN COMMITTEE pared to scratch the surface in their own electorate, they would probably see that benefit applying similarly to a lot of people, and deservedly so. The government also recognises an important role played in our society by foster carers, including those who do not have their own dependent children. This bill will introduce a new exemption which will remain in place for the period a child is in a person’s care in a fostering relationship. It also extends, importantly, to up to 12 weeks between foster care placements and, in doing so, it acknowledges that many emergency and respite foster parents find it difficult to participate in the workforce while caring for children, particularly those experiencing difficulties and disadvantage. These changes mean that they will be able to focus on their important role in our society-that is, providing primary care through a foster-caring arrangement. It also means that they will be available to provide emergency respite care after a child has left their care but before that child has been reassigned on a long-term basis. Additionally-and I get to see a fair bit of this in my electorate-the bill will recognise the role of kinship carers through a new exemption for those who care for a child under state and territory case plans. One of the things that, regrettably, I get to see a heck of a lot of is children being put in the care of their grandparents. It is something that is occurring with great frequency. It is a testament to the love and commitment of their grandparents but, in the majority of cases I get to see, particularly through agencies such as Odyssey House and others, it generally involves drugs or other forms of addictive substances as to why a child cannot remain with the original parent. The support base, particularly offered by grandparents, often comes into the equation. Many of those instances are dealt with formally and that is done on the basis of kindred care arrangements. Through the introduction of this new exemption, the government acknowledges the high needs of children in kinship care and the difficulties that these carers often face in balancing their participation in work and caring responsibilities and also maintaining overall connection with the family and family stability itself. These changes recognise that kinship care is commonly an alternative placement of children other than into a child protection system and the importance of this form of arrangement is very much in the child’s interest and in the family’s interest. This bill will at least recognise the responsibility of those principal carers under that arrangement. The second component of the bill will also increase the flexibility for principal carer parents to undertake activities to satisfy part-time participation requirements. These components of the measure will be implemented through the legislative instrument and amendments to the guide to social security law. Some of the notable changes include changes to the rule of voluntary work and the introduction of more flexible arrangements over long school holidays allowing parents to meet their requirements through part-time study of at least 15 hours per week of contract or non-contract hours. It allows combinations of approved activities, part-time work, part-time study et cetera as long as the parent is undertaking 15 hours per week of activity and enables the principal carer parents the participation requirements to participate in the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme on a part-time basis. Finally, the third component of the bill will provide more flexible methods for parents to report their earnings and participation efforts to Centrelink through expanded access to the existing facilities such as telephone based integrated voice recognition and web based chanMAIN COMMITTEE nels. This will reduce the need for people to physically visit a Centrelink office for face-toface reporting. This is a measure which I know that many busy parents will find very, very attractive. It will allow them to continue with their studies. It will allow them to continue with their efforts in terms of securing employment as well as what they need to do to commit to their caring of their family members. I think it is a very significant addition. I am very pleased that the issue has been raised by parents in relation to the participation requirements and I acknowledge that, in the participation taskforce report and subsequently in the measures of this bill, it will go a long way to addressing those concerns-certainly the concerns that have been raised with me as the member for Werriwa but I am sure they have been raised with other members of this place-and making sure that people understand their mutual obligations but by doing so from a position of fairness and one which encourages the development of their skills to assist them to develop a more competitive position in terms of employment by giving them better opportunities. This is something which I think will go a long way towards satisfying those concerns which have existed for some time and have been a considerable frustration for people not being able to participate fully in our economic way of life. Dr STONE (Murray) (6.04 pm)-I rise to speak to the Social Security Amendment (Flexible Participation Requirements for Principal Carers) Bill 2010. This bill aims to extend exemptions for parents who are asked to look for part-time work as part of their welfare eligibility requirements. The parents in particular would be in receipt of, for example, Newstart allowance, parenting payment, youth allowance or special benefit and they would have schoolage children. At the moment they must report at least 15 hours a week of activities to Centrelink, and this new bill that is now before us aims to commence after this financial year. There is no doubt that this bill is well intentioned in giving additional exemptions to parents who are asked to look for work and to work part time as part of them receiving welfare. It is no doubt well intentioned. The problem is that there is not always a direct relationship between parents being exempted from looking for work or finding work and the very best outcomes for their families. In too many families and in too many households children are raised without these being any employment at all for either one or both of their parents. They have no role models. They have no experience-sometimes for generations-of the whole business of someone having an engagement with the workplace. The children have no understanding of what it means to take on an apprenticeship or training and move into a workplace, to be financially independent. They do not have the sorts of choices that all of us in this room take for granted. We know as a fact that in households where there is welfare dependence for very long periods of time and where it is very unlikely that the children have ever observed a role model in work, those children are more likely to be unemployed themselves. They are more likely to be teenage parents. They are more likely to have mental health issues and they are much more likely to experience poverty in their own lives. They are more likely to be exploited by the unscrupulous elements in our communities. So it is not always generous or a great idea to simply say, ‘If you’re a parent, we don’t really think you have to try very hard to find part-time work.’ Sometimes, indeed, we have a situation, in the case of an exemption referred to here for those experiencing domestic violence, where the very issue locking those women into the domestic violence situation and the abuse of their children is the fact that they have no ecoMAIN COMMITTEE nomic or financial independence. They have no idea how they will live apart from the relationship which is causing them to be abused and harming their children. The best way to help a woman out of an exploitative, abusive relationship is to help her become financially independent, help her to rebuild her self-esteem and help her to re-establish her skills or teach her skills in the very first instance so she can stand alone in the workplace and support her children. SoI do not think it is a great shift forward to extend or create a new exemption in this bill to provide that parents who have experienced domestic violence will be given a different sort of treatment when it comes to expecting them to look for work and move back into the workforce. Of course, right now there are exemptions for women who are experiencing domestic violence. Self-evidently, some women are so crippled and abused by that violence they cannot look for work, but I think it is important that each situation is very carefully supported and monitored by a social worker, by an appropriate person who is skilled and professional, and that the woman in that relationship, the relationship she needs to leave, is helped to move out and to join in with a place of work in Australia. I am very concerned that this set of exemptions talks about the parent not having to look for work up until their children turn 19. That is a very, very long time for a parent to be out of the workforce-from when their children are born until the age of 19. When I was Minister for Workforce Participation in the former government, we introduced the new legislation that enabled single parents to remain on parenting benefits until their children reached ‘school age’ rather than 16. At that time, single parents were given an enormous amount of support to reskill, to be taught literacy or numeracy or to have their qualifications upgraded so that they could rejoin the workforce when their children reached school age. I cannot tell you how many single parents-both men and women, but mostly women-were grateful for the opportunity and the increased resources we put into supporting them to get back into the workforce. When you have been out of the workforce for 19 years, there are very few employers who look upon you with much enthusiasm, particularly if you are a middle-aged woman whose skills are downgraded to just ‘housework’ or ‘being a mother’. SoI do not think it is a kindness to say that you cannot do up to 15 hours of part-time work a week until your children are up to 19 years of age. It is too long. I certainly think 16 years of age is more than appropriate, and that is what the current requirements are. Certainly a 19-year-old teenager should not need the 100 per cent attention of a parent at that stage in their life. I am also very concerned about the new exemption to be introduced to support parents providing kinship care for a child who is a relative through a care plan prepared or accepted by a state or territory government. We already have exemptions under the legislation for people who have care of a relative and that care has been recognised through a court order. This is relevant for Indigenous women, particularly grandmothers, in the Australian community, who are increasingly responsible for raising their grandchildren. We already have quite solid and strong exemptions in the system. I am concerned that the Rudd government thinks that by tweaking this legislation they can then walk away from this issue. The issue is significant and serious, and simply naming this group in this piece of legislation does nothing to actually address the problem. The problem for Indigenous grandmothers in particular is that if they have their full care of their grandchildren recognised by Centrelink their daughters will lose their parenting payments. Daughters often threaten to take the children back into what is perhaps an abusive relationship or a dysfunctional situation in order to retain benefits. It might be a MAIN COMMITTEE relationship with a new de facto partner where the grandmother is concerned for the safety of her granddaughters. If we do not deal with the issue of giving the grandmother some financial support for caring for those children which does not require the voluntary stepping forward of the daughter to register the realities of that caring arrangement then we are going to continue to see the grandmothers leaving their paid employment and struggling in poverty to raise their grandchildren. They do not receive a cent in Centrelink parenting payments while their daughter, or sometimes their son, receives that benefit, which is often spent on sustaining a drug or alcohol habit or on other behaviours which in no way help to support the children. This is a very serious issue in our community and I am very concerned that the government thinks that by taking a swipe at this problem with this piece of legislation the job is done. No, it does not address the problem at all. Let me now move on to foster carers. I am very concerned that we could still be imagining that further exemptions should be extended to foster carers to receive, for example, Newstart allowance while they provide emergency or respite foster care for children. As far as I am concerned, foster carers are the unsung heroes of all of our states and territories where we have so many at-risk children who cannot remain with their own families and need foster care. But when the authorities in those different states look for foster carers they find they are a rapidly diminishing number of individuals. In the state of Victoria, for example, the foster carer numbers have collapsed by over 50 per cent. Why are those foster carer numbers collapsing? It is because foster carers are not being adequately remunerated. The legislation related to foster caring is not adequate. When foster carers ask, for example, to remain as carers for a child for much longer than just a few weeks, knowing the interests of the child in their care are best served by a longer placement, they are not listened to. So foster carers see children churn through their care, knowing they will then suffer serious emotional disadvantage and distress and perhaps will be permanently affected by the failure of our system to give them long-term, permanent care and love. This bill refers to extending exemptions for carers while they are providing care and for a period of time afterwards to support their availability for subsequent placement of children in their care. I am saying that this is not the way to handle the crisis in foster care in our country right now. Foster carers need a whole new set of understandings and changed regulations state by state. In fact, I would very strongly urge that we have a national response to the needs of significantly at-risk children and the care options for them. It concerns me that in this bill we simply have an extension of the system and the hope that the problem will perhaps then go away. We are also told that ‘parents will be able to count their study, voluntary work, part-time work-or a combination of these activities-towards meeting their part-time participation requirements’ in order to continue to receive the various welfare payments. When I was the minister under the Howard government, we looked at voluntary work being allowed for the purpose this describes. We found that too often, if a mother, for example, said, ‘I have been working at the tuck shop,’ or ‘I’ve been helping out at the op shop,’ there was a real reluctance on the part of the not-for-profit organisation to monitor that volunteer’s time of volunteer work or level of commitment to that volunteering work. MAIN COMMITTEE I suggest to this government that they really do need to look closely at volunteer work in particular as a substitute for paid work or education or training, because it might sound like a kindness to an individual but it may mean that that individual really does miss out on the chance to rejoin the paid workforce or to be trained so that they can have a much better chance of getting a job in the future. Voluntary work is wonderful. All praise to the volunteers that keep small communities, in particular, in Australia going. But I think there are real dangers in having unsupervised voluntary work regarded as a substitute for part-time paid work or education or training. I also have to say something in relation to those who are doing home schooling or distance education receiving an exemption from job seeking. Certainly it is difficult, for example, for women living in very remote parts of Australia who are distance educating their children to look for work. But I know for a fact that a very significant number of those individuals actually do work in helping to run properties-some of them very large properties. SoI would not automatically suggest that because you are distance educating your children you should have an exemption from participation requirements until your youngest child turns 16. I think we should look at that more on a case-by-case basis. It should not be automatic, particularly when there are others employed in the home as tutors for those children or to undertake other housekeeping and parenting roles. More and more parents are seeking to homeschool, particularly those who are of a particular faith and who do not want their children to be exposed to the educational philosophies found in our state education systems or in independent schools. I think it is important to deal with this case by case. It is not a significant number of parents who offer home schooling but I do not think it should be simply be a blanket case that if you put your hand up and say, ‘I am going to homeschool my children, in the secondary years in particular, so please will you now pay me Newstart allowance or some other special benefit because I choose to homeschool my children for two, three or four hours a day.’ I think it should be a case-by-case matter and we should not lose control of the situation because it is not a kindness to families to have welfare dependency continue and become intergenerational, as is too often the case. If you have four or more children you currently, of course, have a large-family exemption as long as the four children are aged under 16. I think that aged under 16 is a more than appropriate age to cut off the special exemption. Extending that exemption till children are 19 is actually quite ridiculous. This is a well-meaning set of extensions of exemptions but there are dangers among all of the best-made intentions. In Australian we have too much welfare dependency, which affects the lives not just of this generation but of children and grandchildren. Welfare dependency is not a good place to be if you are talking about your financial independence, your choices in life and your ability to maximise the opportunities that Australia presents. I am particularly concerned for families of non-English-speaking background who are newly arrived in Australia and who become dependent on welfare. Those families should not be assisted with further exemptions from requirements to look for part-time work but, rather, should be given special training and job-seeking support and should be given greater experience of Australian workplace culture, rather than simply being ticked off and allowed to stay away from Centrelink. The other day I was told a very serious statistic that 30 per cent of Newstart allowance recipients are now exempted from reporting to Centrelink with diaries or other evidence of their job seeking-30 per cent! I think that is an extraordinary indictment of the laziness of this govMAIN COMMITTEE ernment if that 30 per cent is the case. Those 30 per cent need help to find work, there is no doubt about that. Very often that assistance is quite complex and it takes a long time, but no individual should be allowed simply to abandon the business of looking for work because it is convenient to Centrelink staff, because that person is perhaps a difficult person to communicate with or manage. That 30 per cent being allowed to not participate in looking for work, education or training will become the parents of the next generation of welfare dependent, disadvantaged Australians. I do not think that is fair or right, so I cannot support all the principles in this bill. I understand that it was probably from the best of intentions but, unfortunately, from a government that is naive and not experienced in the realities of the working world. (Flexible Participation Requirements for Principal Carers) Bill 2010. I listened carefully to the member for Murray’s speech and I was not quite sure if she was going to vote in favour of this piece of legislation or against it. I understand she has some reservations, but I do not know if she is Arthur or Martha on this bill. It is all right to have reservations, but you have to make clear in your speech which side of the fence you are on. I am strongly in favour of this legislation. I grew up in a working-class family in Ipswich. My dad was a cleaner at a meat works and my mum was a shop assistant and there were significant periods of unemployment in my family’s life. I went to the Ipswich East State School for seven years and I saw in my local community, which was a really working-class community, real welfare dependency and intergenerational welfare dependency. I was the first person in my family to go to high school, let alone university, so I know the value of hard work and how important employment is. When my father was employed, we had food on the table and we could keep a roof over our heads. These things were personal issues for me, and they are personal issues for many Australians. This is not some sort of intellectual dissertation I am making; this is a speech about what I experienced in my personal life, and I would say there are many people on both sides of the chamber here who experienced similar periods of material deprivation in their lives. What we are doing here is going to make it easier for Australian families to be socially included and also to get back into the workforce. In this legislation there is a bit of compassion, humanity and flexibility, which are needed, and I commend it. In my community, there is social disadvantage. The Ipswich community together with Logan have been designated as areas where the government is appointing or has appointed local employment coordinators. Samantha Wilson has done a terrific job in that regard. We have significant funding under the Jobs Fund for Worklinks, for new services in the Lockyer Valley. There are now Worklinks cafes in Ipswich, at Raceview and Brassall; and a cafe run by Busy Beat, which is a Gold Coast based jobs training organisation, is now located in Ipswich. There is an enormous amount of job training going on. In my community, there is very high unemployment among young people. Traditionally, the Ipswich community has suffered tremendously as industries have declined. It has suffered from the decline of agriculture, which was so important and still makes up 11 per cent of the economy of Ipswich, and the decline of manufacturing, with the closure of the woollen mills and coal mines which used to employ thousands of workers, and the railway workshop which, in its heyday, employed about 3,000 workers. When these industries went, my local commuMAIN COMMITTEE",257,Social Security Amendment Flexible Participation Requirements For Principal Carers Bill 2010
261,Mr Neumann (Blair) (6.24 Pm),"I speak in support of the Social Security Amendmentnity suffered. So legislation like this is not some academic exercise; it really makes a difference to the lives of people in areas like Ipswich, West Moreton and the Lockyer Valley as well as in the Somerset region. Giving a person a job is a way to redistribute wealth. I am not on some sort of ideological white horse that says that we have to socialise all industries. I believe in the market economy and I believe that giving someone a job creates wealth. I believe it creates stronger families and I believe it enhances family values. Family values are not the province of the political Left or the Right in this country; they are for all of us. Reducing welfare dependency improves the self-esteem of not only parents but also children. It gives children the chance and the opportunity to see that they can advance in their lives-materially, emotionally, psychologically and psychiatrically. Showing them that they can increase their earning capacity is very important. They can see the role model of their parents and then say, ‘I can live like that too.’ You too can become a physiotherapist, an engineer, a doctor or a lawyer. That is what this legislation is all about. I also know from my experience as a family lawyer that many parents, women in particular, who have gone through situations of domestic violence and tremendous suffering at the hands of iniquitous partners-particularly male partners, the fathers of their children and stepparents-often end up with low earning capacities. They are in relationships where they are the victims of harassment and intimidation. This legislation shows them more flexibility and compassion as well. I commend the member for Werriwa for his speech in which he outlined in detail important changes in this legislation. I will not go through the changes in detail as he did. The participation arrangements and requirements for about 17,000 families on income support will change. It is estimated that this will improve their capacity to skill and improve their job opportunities. It is estimated that about 100 additional parents will become eligible for extended home schooling, and there will be distance education participation exemptions for many who live in rural and regional areas. I am a strong believer that parents have the right to choose where their children should be educated. We have some wonderful private schools in my electorate. St Edmund’s boys college in Ipswich is a fantastic school. WestMAC over there at Karrabin is a fantastic school. There are two grammar schools-Ipswich Grammar School and Ipswich Girls Grammar School. I personally have sent my children to Raesbury State Primary School and Bremer State High School because I am a product of that state school system and my wife is as well. Parents have a right to choose. But some parents, for religious or other reasons, choose to home school. As someone who is a Christian, I have no problems with that choice. I do have some concerns about some of the curriculum we see in that regard and some of the more fundamentalist approaches in that curriculum. But we live in a democracy and parents have that right to choose. We are making it easier for parents who choose to home school with the more flexible arrangements in this legislation. I think that is the right thing. As of December 2009 there were approximately 506,000 principal carers on parenting payment, Newstart allowance and youth allowance. There were 182,272 parents with participation requirements. So this is not some small piece of legislation that will affect a few hundred Australians. This is important legislation which will impact on the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians and indeed their children. I strongly support the idea of mutual obliMAIN COMMITTEE gation. I think it is right that we require people to look at employment, to seek to participate, because what happens with a person without a job is that they suffer in terms of not just welfare dependency but also social isolation and often ostracism. What is the first question you ask a person? What do they do for a living. And what do they answer? ‘I am just a housewife; I am just looking after my kids.’ That is just wrong. It is just wrong but that is what happens to Australians. If they come from Victoria you might ask which AFL team they support, or which rugby league team they support if they are from Queensland. But this is a serious matter for people. It is a serious matter of self-esteem. I am pleased that we are going to invest nearly $27 million over four years to improve participation arrangements for parents and carers. I am very pleased that we have kept the income arrangements and income payments at the same level. I am pleased that we have parents on income support whose youngest child has reached school age, six or over, but they are still required to undertake 30 hours of suitable activity. I think that is right. I think the Australian public expects that to happen. At times it is a gentle nudge, sometimes a bit of a push and sometimes a bit of a drag into the workforce because there are some people who sadly would like to sit back and not participate in our society. Greater participation in the economy means greater participation in society. People who have jobs tend to get involved in P&Cs, sporting clubs, church organisations, social clubs. They tend to participate in community and that is what is important in terms of social inclusion. There is a flow-on effect. It is not just good for the economy, for economic development and productivity; it is also good for society because it builds community. I think that is really important. In my area we have some great people who are involved in this and we are dealing here with more flexible arrangements for women particularly who are tragically the main recipients of domestic violence. While I am here I want to commend the Ipswich Women’s Centre against Domestic Violence and Gabrielle Borggaard, who is the director there, for the wonderful work they do with the women of Ipswich and not just Ipswich but the rural areas outside-the Lockyer Valley and the Scenic Rim and Somerset regions, because they reach out to those areas. I was pleased last week to be there and to light a candle when we recognised the women who have been the victims of domestic violence in our communities. Tragically, a number of women have been killed by their partners in the last year. I will not name the women here in parliament; it is not the right thing to do. This is horrible and when I was in private practice I saw it. I dealt with thousands of domestic violence cases through prosecuting and defending in the courts in Queensland-the Family Court, the Federal Magistrates Court and the state Magistrates Court. I saw it on numerous occasions and I lived it for decade after decade in my professional life. The work that Gabrielle Borggaard and others do is to be commended and lauded. I am pleased to be a White Ribbon ambassador. I think it is the right thing and that more men should stand up. I was pleased to be at D’Arcy Doyle Place in Ipswich where we lit candles. I was very happy to see the Mayoress, Janet Pisasale, as well as Rachel Nolan, the state member for Ipswich and the Minister for Transport. While we are talking about this issue I also want to commend, because it is in the area of domestic violence, the former director of the Ipswich Women’s Centre Against Domestic Violence, Amy Stockwell. A number of years ago Amy took up the position as the person coordinating community development in the Somerset Regional Council. I have been pleased to MAIN COMMITTEE meet with Amy and a number of those providers, like Lifeline, Austcare and other organisations, who are doing wonderful work with people. The work that these people do is not just about caring for people with mental health issues or people who are victims of domestic violence. They provide encouragement to bring people back into the workforce. The legislation we have here modifies participation exemptions to make them more responsive to a family’s individual circumstances. I think that is a sensible way to go. The provisions in relation to foster care are really important. Foster carers are our unsung heroes and they simply need to have flexible arrangements. Many times children are put into foster care and grandparents, cousins, uncles or aunties who have a kinship role take on the responsibility for children who are the subject of domestic violence orders and who are mentioned on those orders. The children are also what we used to call many years ago ‘wards of the state’. They are subject to case plans or orders made in relation to their care and protection or their care and control. Caring for our kinship carers through this legislation by providing more flexibility is simply the just, humane and decent thing to do. The third component, as the member for Werriwa mentioned, improves the circumstances for families. It means the cost in time and money of travelling, often from rural and regional areas, into a Centrelink office will be gone, because many people can be linked by web based channels and other sorts of facilities. That will improve the lives of people in regional and rural communities in townships scattered all around South-East Queensland and west of Brisbane, which I have the honour to represent. This legislation is about compassion, flexibility and humanity. I have to say that not always did the coalition show that when they were in power. Many times they made changes with the best of intentions, but they did not always show the degree of compassion that they needed to. Certainly accepting the recommendations of the task force chaired by Patricia Faulkner was the right thing to do. I am pleased that the government has listened. Not always do governments of either persuasion listen to the experts and listen to recommendations. We have taken those recommendations on board, adapted the legislation on individual family circumstances and modified the existing participation exemptions to be responsive to those circumstances. Mr Deputy Speaker, this is important legislation that will affect people in South-East Queensland in your seat and mine and I commend the legislation to the House. subject that has been dear to my heart. The changes outlined in the Social Security Amendment (Flexible Participation Requirements for Principal Carers) Bill 2010 follow from the August 2008 Participation Review Taskforce report on the operation of the Welfare to Work reforms introduced to this parliament by the former coalition government in 2006, which sought to move people from pensions to Newstart allowance. Much of that legislation I supported, in particular the commitment of the former government to assist welfare recipients to move from a reliance on social welfare to gaining employment. There are some good reasons for that. An article in the Australian titled ‘Reforms that work’, on Friday, 16 October last year, said: Centre for Independent Studies research has found the number of families dependent on “parenting payments” has fallen by 120,000, or 20 per cent, since job-search requirements were imposed in 2006. MAIN COMMITTEE",265,Social Security Amendment Flexible Participation Requirements For Principal Carers Bill 2010
262,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (6.39 Pm),"I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on aAll of us in this place, for a lot of reasons, want to do all we can to reduce intergenerational welfare dependency. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 5 May this year, written by Adele Horin, said: and forced them to get a job or go on the dole, new research reveals. A typical sole parent with one child aged between six and 12 could be as much as $6700 a year worse off as a result of reforms initiated by the Howard government and introduced from 2006 to 2008. The study, by academics at Murdoch University in Perth, shows only when typical sole parents get a full-time job paying at least $45,000 can they be better off with the new arrangements. But this is unlikely for most as their youngest child is only seven or eight when they have to move off the Parenting Payment and into the workforce. “It’s much more likely these women and children will experience poverty as a result of these changes,” Lisa Young, associate professor in law at Murdoch University and a co-author of the study, said. So there are mixed blessings with this reform. As I said, most of us want to see the end of intergenerational dependency on welfare. There is no doubt that access to the paid workforce provides an independent income stream, greater social inclusion and a sense of self-reliance. The intention is noble in essence. However, entrenched barriers to the workforce remain for many. At the time of introducing the original bill, little was done to remove these barriers. Still, little has been done. Instead, there is a continued demonising of people reliant on social security payments-to attain some perceived political advantage, and now as a justification to balance the budget. Any assistance to help individuals gain a place in the paid workforce is without question supportable. But if we truly want to see more people employed we must recognise the realities faced by those attempting to break the cycle of welfare dependency and exclusion. In my speech to the House during the introduction of the Welfare to Work bill in 2006, I was particularly concerned about sole parents and people with mental and physical disabilities. Given that single parent families continue to increase and that 87 per cent of sole parent families are headed by women, I continue to be concerned about the disproportionate impact such measures have on women in our communities. As an example-one I made members acutely aware of during the drafting of the previous legislation-I drew attention to the negative impact of limiting the time allowed for a person on welfare to retrain or re-educate themselves. I brought into this house a woman who might have suffered the negative impact of these measures. This woman came to speak to members in this place. She had several children. Her husband had left her soon after the birth of her last child. If my memory serves me correctly, her last child was about five weeks old. Her dramatic change in circumstances first forced her onto welfare but she did not want to burden the public purse for long, so she enrolled in university to get a degree in education. She wanted to become a teacher so that she would have more flexible working hours and be able to work to better suit her parenting responsibilities. Of course, she wanted to give her children opportunities as they grew up and to be able to adequately support them financially through that period. In addition to that, she wanted security in retirement. She wanted to be able to contribute to superannuation. Her commitment should be congratulated and supported. But under this legislation-and it has not changed, despite this review-she could only continue to receive welfare if she dropped out of university. I think there were some changes MAIN COMMITTEE made that allowed people already in the system to continue, but if you were coming in new you were only allowed to take up retraining or education for 12 months; otherwise, you would lose your entitlement to income support. I find this completely unacceptable. I see my good colleague the member for Shortland nodding her head. I think all the women in this place would find that unacceptable. So a person could not complete a degree in higher education. Giving people such a short time to undertake training and education before requiring them to move off welfare continues to consign those on welfare-women in particular-to the lowest paid jobs in our community and it entrenches poverty in old age. That is my deep concern about this. Let us genuinely help people move off welfare, but let us not restrict them from taking up jobs and opportunities that truly reflect their capacity. It is important for the development of this country that we allow all people to develop to the best of their ability. Putting these restrictions on people in the welfare system does not achieve that at all. Let me outline some more of the barriers that still have not been dismantled. The electorate I represent encompasses outer suburbs, regional areas and rural communities. Across that spectrum I am acutely aware of the ramifications arising for low-income families and individuals from the triple whammy of the housing shortage, the high cost of rent in inner city areas and an impossible waiting list for public housing assistance-which can be over a decade. As a result, single parent families along with other welfare recipients are driven to outlying areas, which lack transport, childcare services and in some cases job opportunities. But the barriers to becoming employed do not end there. There are those who have mental illness, who face all of these difficulties and, on top of those, poor mental health services. They are almost non-existent in some places. I refer to services that would diagnose and adequately treat mental illness. As well, they have to face the prejudice of employers. In my speech back in 2006, I raised this because there was a study conducted by Professor Vaughan Carr into mental illness and employment. He surveyed businesses and found that about 77 per cent of employers were reluctant to employ people with a mental disorder. We are also informed of similar disadvantages experienced by people who have epileptic seizures. The takeup rate of assistance to people with a disability by business has been extremely disappointing, and this is despite generous government funding and incentives in the past. To add insult to injury, the Public Service figures for employing people with a disability are going seriously south. So government cannot even set an example to the rest of the business community that employing people with a disability-particularly mental illness-may actually provide some advantages in the workplace and certainly would go a long way to helping some of these people to get off welfare. I think it is a disgrace that when Public Service rates are so low we go out there and call on industry and business-private enterprise-to support people with a disability and to support people with mental illness. We even give awards and prizes in the Great Hall in this place. What hypocrisy. Governments are not doing their bit to set the example. We should be the ones setting the pace and setting the example for private enterprise to follow, and we do not do it. Episodic mental illness presents particular challenges, as it may involve periods of inability to work, leading to a lack of continuity in the workforce. The additional cost of medication and treatment, if it can be sourced when needed, and the threat of the loss of a healthcare card-even when a person with a disability takes on a small amount of work and makes a MAIN COMMITTEE small amount of money-makes this a particularly difficult hurdle to full-time or even part-time employment for those on welfare. All these things contribute to entrenching people in the welfare system. They do not help to remove those barriers. The most disadvantaged in society, the disabled and single mothers in particular, continue to face those same disadvantages. How can people with a mental illness even hope for independence in the paid workforce when support is almost non-existent? How can a mother work when she cannot get access to child care? How can she develop her skills when she gets little financial support to do so? How can she get to work when the escalating cost of housing has driven her to the outskirts of town, and how can she pay her ever rising household bills and buy a car to get to work? The facts are that while we speak to this bill providing some exemptions for people for whom work in the paid workforce would not be an option, we are witnessing a government budget which further entrenches hardship for the most disadvantaged. I can understand why the non-government organisations that service this community are so disappointed. Fresh from abandoning its policy to build 260 child-care centres, the government will cut child-care payments for out-of-pocket expenses by $278 a year. The annual child-care rebate will be capped at $7,500, a reduction on the annual cap of $7,778 a child. Families stand to lose $926 a child by the fourth year of this measure. The government has overlooked those factors preventing women from rejoining the workforce. For those with mental illness, the government has removed social workers’ and occupational therapists’ ability to offer mental health services under Medicare. This is apart from the fact that if you need a psychiatrist just speak to any community service organisations that are dealing with homeless people or others with mental disability and it is almost impossible outside of hours to get attention for people having psychotic episodes. So now not only do we deny people; there is no money in this budget for mental health measures. Not only do we deny people mental health services through psychiatrists and through the hospitals but we have now knocked off the Medicare rebate. From July, Australians with mental illness who access these services will no longer be able to claim back the Medicare rebate currently available, which will frequently mean they are unable to afford the service. Some 1,500 doors to early intervention mental health services will be closed at the end of June this year for vulnerable Australians with mental health issues. Along with the already stretched psychiatric services, this is a particular blow to people suffering mental health conditions. The government has removed social workers’ and occupational therapists’ ability to offer mental health services under Medicare, and this move will hurt thousands of Australians and further entrench the welfare cycle of poverty for those people who suffer mental illness. It is a tragedy; it truly is a tragedy. We see many thousands of people-I think somebody quoted 100,000 people-on the streets in this country at night. Some of those people are on welfare. Most of them are on the streets because they have got undiagnosed, untreated mental illnesses. Again, just speak to anyone working in the sector, working out on the streets at night, providing shelter, providing services to this demographic. We are not becoming a very inclusive country; we are becoming a country excluding a large section of our community. It is very unfortunate that the bill before us does not do more to assist people in these categories. There are of course circumstances that would prevent parents of young children moving from social welfare payments to the paid workforce. I am pleased to see that some of the MAIN COMMITTEE recommendations of the taskforce have acknowledged these special circumstances and that many have been adopted in this bill. I pay tribute to the work of the Participation Review Taskforce, chaired by Patricia Faulkner AO. It is a very good report within the scope of what they were asked to do, but it does not go to the heart of many of the barriers that stop people with a disability, single parents and others from actually getting off that welfare cycle and getting into the paid workforce. Some of the recommendations that have been picked up in the bill that we speak to today that I completely support are those under the terms of reference entitled ‘the flexibility of participation requirements’. I had at least one person who was caught in this come to me. If a sole parent-in this case it was a woman-takes up work with a school, for example, in the tuckshop or as a cleaner, he or she then has to go back and meet their work participation test with the department to continue to be eligible for income support. I am pleased to see that one of the recommendations being picked up is: The Taskforce recommends that parents should not be required to meet their part-time participation requirements during the fortnight that includes the Christmas and New Year public holidays. The Taskforce recommends that parents with regular paid work during school term time should not need to meet part-time participation requirements over the long school holidays if they reasonably expect to resume their usual hours of work at the beginning of the next school year. This particular change is a victory for common sense, and I know that it will be welcomed by families in the electorate of Pearce who are affected by this. Other measures in this bill include consideration for large families-that is, an exemption extended to people with large families to care for-those who are engaged in distance education or home schooling of their children and those involved in foster care and kinship care. As we heard the member for Blair say earlier, those who are subjected to domestic violencewhich continues to be a deeply entrenched problem with Australian communities-will now get, instead of a 16-week case-by-case exemption, an automatic 12-month exemption from the work participation requirements. The tests have also been eased for those caring for a child with a disability or a medical condition. There are a number of measures which I do not have time to pursue in total. These are common-sense changes that have been made and they are very welcome. This bill is a sensible furthering of the exemptions first set out under the Welfare to Work provisions of 2006-but, of course, we are still waiting, as I said, to see the true tackling of the issues. It is undeniable that the best way out of the welfare trap is indeed to access a job in the paid workforce. Not earning a wage can have a profound consequence that reaches across society. The 2008 OECD report Growing unequal? Income distribution and poverty in OECD countries commented: Most of the relative poverty in Australia occurs in jobless households where no one is working; in fact, Australia has the lowest rate of ‘in-work’ relative poverty among families in the OECD. That trend has remained quite constant in Australia. In 2001, the Smith Family’s report by Ann Harding of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling found that only three per cent of households with a wage earner were in poverty, compared to 31 per cent of those relying on welfare. MAIN COMMITTEE Employment and lack of employment have a direct bearing on the material well-being of individuals and their families. In 2005, speaking on the Welfare to Work reforms, I quoted the figure showing 700,000 children growing up in households with no job. Two-thirds of those households were headed up by single parents. Professor Stanley outlined some of the problems of that in her book Children of the lucky country? In conclusion, breaking the unemployment and poverty cycle is not just about reducing welfare payments to balance the national accounts; it is about removing the considerable barriers that welfare recipients encounter in trying to find jobs in the paid workforce. We could do and should do much more to support those on social welfare payments to help them break the cycle of poverty. (Time expired) Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (6.59 pm)-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I doubly thank you for the indulgence of sitting in the chair a bit longer so I can get my speech in before I relieve you in the chair. I really appreciate it very much. I want to speak to the Social Security Amendment (Flexible Participation Requirements for Principal Carers) Bill 2010 in particular because as a former teacher I am very, very passionate about the fact that one of the most important things that we can do for people in our community, and indeed expect of people in our community, is to engage in the opportunities for work and education. I do not exempt principal carers from that. I have met too many women in my years teaching in TAFE who have spent years and years out of the workforce, raising a family and doing a very productive activity in our community, but who then through particular circumstances-most often a marriage break-up-find themselves in a situation where they have got to provide leadership to their children in the family and provide income support, and they suddenly realise how isolated they have become from the workforce and, indeed, from the community. There were some good programs that ran at TAFE concerned with getting those women in particular back into skills and training and back into the workforce. SoI am a great supporter of the concept of mutual responsibility through these particular income support payments both for the principal carers and for the children for whom they are a role model. The important part of that principle and that commitment to seeing that people actually engage with education and training and work is for us to do it in a way that does not have, if you like, the counteracting impact to our intention. If our intention in these sorts of bills and in that mutual responsibility is to support and encourage parents to engage and participate in the workforce, whether through training initially or a job, short term or long term, then we should do that in a way that actually enables them to participate given their individual circumstances. Sometimes it is very important, I think, when we put this sort of principle in place through legislation-as has happened across both governments now and it is a principle that has been fairly accepted across the political spectrum-that we also have the capacity to look at the outcomes and ask whether they are achieving the intention. I think that, by and large, those requirements are achieving those intentions and I have worked long enough in the TAFE sector to have seen really good initiatives that enabled principal carers-dads and mums, but mainly mums-to take those opportunities. However, we did see the previous minister, who had the original carriage of this bill, set up a task force to do exactly that-to review how the participation requirement was operating. That task force produced a report. It was under the chairmanship of Ms Patricia Faulkner AO MAIN COMMITTEE from KPMG. It was provided to the government in August 2008 and became the basis for the recommendations that the minister took into the previous budget-and it is interesting that we are discussing it in this budget week. Those recommendations are now enacted in this bill to take effect from 1 July this year. They are sensible changes to the requirements so that people can undertake what we expect of them without being put in a situation where in fact they are worse off, rather than better off, which is our intention. It creates four major changes, and I think it is important to acknowledge those. The first is that the current exemption will extend the existing 12-month automatic exemption to principal carers with existing large families. I think the task force got quite a bit of evidence about this, and many of us can well appreciate that, if you have four or more children, even when the youngest one goes to school the impacts and requirements of the caring role are far beyond a carer’s capacity to carry out those participation requirements in the same way as someone who may have one or two younger children. So there is an acknowledgement that people with four or more children have specific circumstances. There is also acknowledgement that if parents have their children undertaking home schooling or distance education they undertake a part of an educative role as well and so we need to take their situation into consideration. Also, importantly, the bill addresses the issues raised by the task force around the domestic violence exemption. As it existed, it did not apply to people who had stayed in their current situation. While one may well at heart understand how that was created in the first place, the reality is that, through the various ways in which domestic violence is managed and women and men are supported if they are experiencing domestic violence, to not allow them the exemption for 16 weeks in the participation rule because they had not as yet removed themselves from that family home is often counterproductive to what you are trying to achieve. To me, that is a sensible change. There is also a new exemption created for respite and emergency foster carers. People could well understand why that would be in there. That exemption applies for the period of time in which they have a child in their care and up to 12 weeks between placements, enabling them to continue to do that very important work in our communities. Finally, there is also a recognition of kinship carers where they are under the authority of the state or territory case plan. They are sensible amendments to me that indicate that, whilst these principal carers are still required to undertake participation, they will be able to do it in more flexible ways. The exemption will be able to be applied in situations where we would logically think they should be applied but where the hands of departmental officials had been tied under the legislation as it existed. There are important changes also being made through a legislative instrument and amendments to the guide to social security law. They are also about creating more flexibility within that participation. While people are still required to do the 15 hours participation, there are some important changes there to allow part-time study, for example, to be included, including contact and non-contact hours. As a former TAFE teacher, I know that if you are trying to give someone the skills to re-engage in the workforce you may get them into a course that is eight to 10 hours because you want to give them four to five hours of individual support. That might be literacy support; it might be tutorial support. There are a range of vocational subjects that you provide that are not part of formal study that are important to enable them to undertake study. If they are not there then you are setting them up to fail in their studies. So it is MAIN COMMITTEE important to have that in there, as well as the ability to combine activities. They could be doing a bit of part-time study and a bit of part-time work. There is the ability for volunteer work, so long as you can identify that it has vocational aspects, to be included. Then there is participation in NEIS-the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. Lots of women who re-enter the workforce these days do so through home based businesses. I know a lady in my own area with a card-making business who is doing a roaring trade now. She is doing wedding invitations, 21st cards and stationery. She set her business up through participation in NEIS. She has children at school and is a single mum and she is doing tremendously well. In fact, she was nominated for an award at the Illawarra business awards the year before last. I think that is a good initiative and a good avenue for some of those primary carers looking to re-enter the workforce. In summary, I think it is important to acknowledge that the intention of this bill is to say, ‘We think participation and engagement are important. We don’t want to see people make the mistake of staying outside the system for long periods of time and becoming disengaged and permanently locked out of the workforce. We want to make sure that we are achieving that intention by being flexible and sensible about the way in which these requirements are applied so that we encourage and support people and not actually discourage them and give them bad experiences and have them decide that the whole thing is just a punishment rather than an opportunity.’ I commend the bill to the House. Ms HALL (Shortland) (7.09 pm)-I concur wholeheartedly with the comments made by the previous speaker, now in the chair. I think that she really highlighted the issue very effectively. The issue in the Social Security Amendment (Flexible Participation Requirements for Principal Carers) Bill 2010 before us is about modifying the existing participation exemptions and recognising that there are certain circumstances where people need to have exemptions and where the government needs to be more flexible in the way it implements the mutual obligation test that is applied to people who are working. Under the previous government, this test was very harshly implemented and many people were disadvantaged. They were disadvantaged to the extent that the test worked in the opposite way to its intent-discouraging people rather than encouraging them to participate in the workforce. That is what this government is about: creating opportunities for all workers to participate and trying to establish an environment in which that is most likely to happen. This legislation does recognise that there are certain people who need to be looked at in a different light. That includes large families, as has previously been mentioned. Home schooling and distance education are, I think, two very important areas where this exemption needs to be extended-those people need to be exempt from having to seek work or undertake training. The liberalisation of the eligibility for the existing domestic violence exemptions to include parents who remain in a relationship is another area, showing an understanding that special circumstances exist for those people. Also important is the recognition, through a new exemption, of the role of kinship carers who provide care through a case plan. That was an issue that I wanted to touch on and one that I feel very passionate about because, in these times, there are more and more grandparents, aunts and uncles who have the responsibility of caring for their children’s children or their nieces and nephews and who are having to put their life on hold. This legislation includes a 12-month exemption for those people and I think that is a very important aspect of MAIN COMMITTEE the legislation, because the children they are caring for are often children who have very special needs and children who have been through quite a deal of trauma. This bill shows the type of flexibility that you would expect in the legislation. Within my electorate, there is a kinship carer support network. It is run through the Samaritans and I strongly endorse the work that is done through that network. I have visited and met with the carers and they have told me their stories and about the way their lives have been impacted by having to care for their children’s children. It has meant them leaving work and it has meant them changing their whole lifestyle. I met with Karen at the kinship support service that operates at Charlestown. It provides service support for grandparents and extended family between the upper Hunter and the Central Coast. It looks to ensure that those grandparents and other relatives who are caring for children actually have the support, knowledge, information, understanding and backup they need. SoI have been able to see first hand just how important this exemption will be for that particular group of people. The other cohort of people that I particularly want to mention are those people providing emergency foster and respite care. Under the previous government’s mutual obligation regime, those people were punished. I had foster parents that provide ongoing care for young children, older children, children who have suffered the worse traumas, have disabilities or have enormous problems. Those carers were forced to continue to look for work when the work that they were doing was providing so much benefit to our society. I think they are very important exemptions that are outlined in this bill. They are exemptions to put a little bit of humanity back into the legislation whilst, at the same time, recognising that participation is important, that training is important and that for parents and carers to actually obtain the skills and the knowledge that they need to enter the workforce is of great importance. As the member for Pearce was saying, it is only through education and training that people get the skills and knowledge that they need to be able to obtain the higher paid jobs in the community and develop a good standard of living. I know the member for Pearce herself was a single parent who worked very hard to establish herself and she understands the issues that confront carers. It is through education, it is through training and it is through actually participating in getting back into the workforce that you will find that people can get their life back on track. It is very important. I commend the government for undertaking the Participation Taskforce Review. There were a number of outstanding contributions that were made to the task force. The recommendations that were made by the task force have largely been implemented in this legislation. It is important to note that this legislation is about fairness, it is about humanity and it is about providing exemptions for those people that need exemptions and for those people that are most vulnerable. It is about recognising that where you have any participation requirement or mutual obligation requirement you also have to have the other side, the compassion. You need to be able to understand that this legislation is designed around people. This legislation is designed to increase participation in the workforce and it can only do it if it is fair, humane legislation. I commend the legislation to the House. Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (7.18 pm)-I also rise to support the Social Security Amendment (Flexible Participation Requirements for Principal Carers) Bill 2010. This bill is a very important bill and it comes off the back of a Participation Taskforce Review that was commissioned by the previous Minister for Employment Participation and taken up by the MAIN COMMITTEE now Minister for Employment Participation for the actual changes to legislation. What these changes really do, while recognising that there is an imperative for principal carers of young children to be able to maintain continuity in the workforce, is actually ask, are we doing this in the best way possible? Are we actually making sure that our principal carers are involved in work and are a part of work? Really, I think that we can do better. Workforce participation rates were published in the Participation Taskforce Review and it found the participation rates for mothers of school-age children lower compared with other OECD countries. Australian labour force participant rates particularly for single mothers as well as those in the 55-64 year-old group are actually lower than other OECD countries. That shows that there are things that can be done to help, encourage and improve involvement in this area. Part of what we are looking at in this bill is ways to increase flexibility and ensure that parents can transition to work on different paths. The flexibility to allow parents to transition by improving their skills and upskilling is really important, and I will talk about that little bit more. We have heard a lot about increasing the flexibility for sole parents to meet their participation requirements, but we cannot forget that this is about whole families. In fact, what is at the heart of the exemptions and other parts of the participation requirements is ensuring that parents can give the best possible care to their children, especially in situations where children need some specific care. Looking at specific exemptions, we will extend the existing 12-month automatic exemption for families with four or more children or families that are providing distance education for children from 16 up to 19 years if they are currently completing secondary school. This recognises that parents do have a responsibility and are involved in helping children, especially in large families, to get through those schooling years. We have said many times in this place and I have certainly said that finishing a year 12 education is a passport for children for the rest of their lives. SoI see this exemption as one where we are really focusing on parents with large families getting an exemption so that they can make sure their children get the best pathway for the future. In addition we are recognising the difficult role of respite and emergency foster carers through a new exemption that remains in place for the period of time the child is in that person’s care. Again this recognises that these children need more assistance and that having a carer who is absent is perhaps not in the best interests of a child who has been through often traumatic and difficult circumstances. As the previous speaker said, the role of kinship carers is recognised through a new exemption for those who have the care of a child in a state or territory case plan. I know this will be particularly welcomed by the grandparents I have spoken to who often take on the role of caring for their grandchildren, although they do not take on a full formal foster care role. Certainly a lot of people would argue that if a grandparent is able to take on that role that is in the best interests of the child, but there are a lot of complex issues that come with that. Providing that exemption is really important for these families to get back on their feet. But we should not get completely focused on exemptions. While exemption is for the parent, this is indeed also in the best interests of children-and that is really important. A second area of recommendation by the Participation Review Taskforce which is a component of these changes is allowing more flexibility to help people upskill. The government MAIN COMMITTEE wants to ensure that people get the best opportunity for and the best access to training. As part of our education revolution we want people to upskill, and I will give an example from my own electorate. By way of background, the bill will allow carers to satisfy their requirements for 15 hours participation, both contact or non-contact hours, in combination with paid work. I want to let people know what this meant for someone in my electorate. Catherine Jordan of Morphett Vale, a single mother of one, said to me that she was studying aged care at TAFE and working casually. She wanted to work in the aged sector for which she had a real passion-an area where we really need qualified people. Like many Australians, she wanted to improve her skill set and eventually return to full-time work. As part of the previous requirements for participation she had to quit this study and focus on getting casual work. In the end, it defeated the purpose of skilling up someone who wanted to contribute to this very important area-especially as we have an ageing population. The changes in this bill will mean that Catherine can return to study, knowing that between casual study and her work she will fulfil her participation requirements. This is really important. As previous speakers have mentioned, primary carers should be encouraged to pursue the development of their own private businesses if they so desire. I hear many stories of mothers and fathers, single parents, coming up with some very inventive and exciting businesses which they start at home. Under the changes in this bill, carers will be afforded the same opportunity and support as the rest of the population, allowing them to enter into the scheme on a part-time basis, giving carers the skills to go into business for themselves. This is really important. I want to touch on one other very sensible change, which has certainly affected a lot of people in my electorate, which ensures that carers have more flexibility over the Christmas and New Year holidays-a very stressful time for families. It should be a time of joy but it is a time when non-government organisations, church organisations and charity organisations find the demand on their services really goes up. So having more flexible guidelines over Christmas and New Year holidays is really important. Another important change is the flexible provisions for employees who temporarily do not work over school holiday periods-people who work in an administrative role or maybe as a classroom support officer. They may have a very good arrangement with the school where they work during term time, with guaranteed ongoing hours, but they are not needed in school holidays, although they do not necessarily want to work then because they want to spend time with their children. They do not want to leave their children at home alone because they have to go out to work. When talking about school holidays for two weeks, it seems nonsensical to many of the people in my electorate to have to fulfil participation requirements knowing that in two weeks they will be back at their job, yet they have to go through the process which, in fairness, does not improve their long-term sustainable role in the workforce. This is a very important and sensible change which makes sure that people who have good arrangements with their employer and ongoing meaningful employment can continue, rather than chopping and changing jobs just because they go on school holidays. Obviously we have specified that the carer must have the expectation of ongoing employment, but for people assisting in schools it is evident that having a break for two weeks is just about schools closing for school holidays. MAIN COMMITTEE In conclusion, these are important, sensible changes. They do not detract from the fact that we still want to encourage people into the workforce. We want to ensure, if they are receiving welfare money from Centrelink, that there is an obligation, but do it in a way that keeps in mind the children they are looking after and some sensible arrangements so as to ensure that by upskilling and educating themselves they can go even further and have a long-term, meaningful connection to the workforce. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Hall) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 7.31 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Defence Procurement (Question No. 1182) Mr Robert asked the Minister for Defence Materiel and Science, in writing, on 3 February 2010: For sole sourced defence procurement contracts (ones that did not go to tender) in the 2008 and 2009 calendar years, which companies were contracted, what was procured, what equipment was procured and why were tenders not sought. Information on the number of sole source defence procurements is not available. In accordance with the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines (CPGs), Defence collects data on the number of direct source procurements. This has been Defence practice since the January 2005 release of the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines. Direct source is a broader definition which may include more than one supplier and therefore may be a competitive procurement process. Defence would not be able to provide information on why tenders were not sought without dedicating significant resources to the task. I am not prepared to direct the Department to release such resources. However, it is important to note that even when Defence decides to sole source a procurement, such a decision is required to be made consistently with the fundamental obligation set out in the CPGs (and reflected in the Defence Procurement Policy Manual) to achieve value for money. Defence Materiel Organisation Projects (Question No. 1225) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, in writing, on 23 February: Further to his answer to question 1064 (Hansard, 3 February 2010, page 135): (1) For each project in Tables 1(a) to (c): what is the (a) date and sum of the original approved budget allocation, (b) date and sum approved for each adjustment to the original budget to cover (i) indexation, (ii) exchange, and (iii) scope change, (c) actual cost, and (d) original approved completion/delivery date. (2) In Table 1(c), how is ‘around’ budget defined (3) In Table 2, for each project, what is the (a) date and sum of the original approved budget allocation, (b) date and sum approved for each adjustment to the original budget to cover (i) indexation, (ii) exchange, and (iii) scope change, and (c) original approved completion/delivery date. (1) For each project in Tables 1(a) to (c): the (a) date and sum of the original approved budget allocation, (b) date and sum approved for each adjustment to the original budget to cover (i) indexation, (ii) exchange, and (iii) scope change, and (c) actual cost, are provided in the following Tables 1(a) to (c) below. The original approved completion date is not provided as this information has not been historically recorded in the DMO financial system. The majority of these closed projects were approved over a decade ago and would require considerable effort and resources to access to historical and archived data at the resident project level. In response to QON 1064 the answer was based on a set of 239 projects that were closed or approaching closure at that time. Since then one project (JP 2077 PH 2B) has been “re-activated” due to additional work and as such has been removed from consideration in this answer.",268,Social Security Amendment Flexible Participation Requirements For Principal Carers Bill 2010

Minister for Defence Materiel and Science, in writing, on 23 February 2010: Further to his answer to question No.1065 (Hansard, 3 February 2010, page 141): (1) What were the legislative responsibilities of the (then) Public Service Commissioner and the Chief Executive Officer of the Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) when the decision was made to dismiss Ms Jane Wolfe, and were these legislative responsibilities and the requirements of fairness, natural justice and privacy complied with prior to making the decision. (2) Is the use of the Commonwealth Coat of Arms and DMO logo on the Wikipedia website authorised; if so, by whom and when; if not, what action will he take to remedy the situation and will it involve referring the matter to the Australian Federal Police or Privacy Commissioner. (1) The then Public Service Commissioner was responsible for ensuring that the requirements of the Public Service Act 1999 were met before making a decision to issue a certificate which was a precursor to any decision by CEO DMO about Ms Wolfe’s employment. The then Public Service Commissioner was satisfied that these conditions had been met and issued the required certificate. On8 April 2010 the Federal Court reversed the Public Service Commissioner’s decision and set aside CEO DMO’s decision on the basis that procedural fairness had not been applied. The Court Order directed that the matter be referred back to the Secretary for Defence and the Public Service Commissioner for further consideration. (2) A search of relevant records has found no evidence that the use of the DMO logo, which incorporates the Commonwealth Coat of Arms, on the Wikipedia website has been authorised by the DMO. Wikipedia is an online encyclopaedia where information is presented to use and share. I am advised that there is nothing to suggest that the use of the DMO logo, which incorporates the Commonwealth Coat of Arms, on the Wikipedia website is improper, derogatory, or in breach of any legislation. I am advised that the use of the DMO logo on the Wikipedia website does not breach the Trade Practices Act 1974, the Trade Marks Act 1995 or the Criminal Code Act 1995 and there is no basis for referring the use of the DMO logo on the Wikipedia website to the Australian Federal Police or Privacy Commissioner. Hawker Britton (Question No. 1239) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 24 February 2010: (1) Have you and/or your departmental officials met with representatives of Hawker Britton this Parliament; if so, (a) on what dates and at what addresses, and (b) who attended each meeting. (2) Has Hawker Britton arranged meetings with other organisations and you and/or your departmental officials this Parliament; if so, (a) on what dates and at what addresses, and (b) who attended each meeting. Ms Macklin-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) (a), (b) and (2) (a), (b) Responding to this question would require Departmental officials to review calendar and diary entries since December 2007 to identify information about meetings with, or arranged by Hawker Britton. This would require the manual examination of a large number of diary and meeting records, which is an unreasonable diversion of government resources.",280,Questions In Writing
265,Mr Combet,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Conducting the same searches across the diary records of ministers and parliamentary secretaries in this portfolio would be an unreasonable diversion of resources for similar reasons. Hawker Britton (Question Nos 1249 and 1250) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Tourism, in writing, on 24 February 2010: (1) Have you and/or your departmental officials met with representatives of Hawker Britton this Parliament; if so, (a) on what dates and at what address, and (b) who attended each meeting. (2) Has Hawker Britton arranged meeting with other organisations and you and/or your departmental officials this Parliament, if so, (a) on what dates and at what addresses, and (b) who attended each meeting. Mr Martin Ferguson-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Responding to this question would require Departmental officials to review calendar and diary entries since December 2007 for meetings that may have involved or been attended by Hawker Britton. This would require the manual examination of a large number of diary and meeting records, which is an unreasonable diversion of government resources. Conducting the same searches across the diary records of current ministers and parliamentary secretaries in this portfolio would be an unreasonable diversion of resources for similar reasons. The records of former ministers and parliamentary secretaries are considered personal information in many circumstances and no access to those records will be sought. Hawker Britton (Question Nos 1254 and 1255) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Housing and Status of Women, in writing, on 24 February 2010: (1) Have you and/or your departmental officials met with representatives of Hawker Britton this Parliament; if so, (a) on what dates and at what addresses, and (b) who attended each meeting. (2) Has Hawker Britton arranged meetings with other organisations and you and/or your departmental officials this Parliament; if so, (a) on what dates and at what addresses, and (b) who attended each meeting. Ms Plibersek-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) (a), (b) and (2) (a), (b) Responding to this question would require Departmental officials to review calendar and diary entries since December 2007 to identify information about meetings with, or arranged by Hawker Britton. This would require the manual examination of a large number of diary and meeting records, which is an unreasonable diversion of government resources. Conducting the same searches across the diary records of ministers and parliamentary secretaries in this portfolio would be an unreasonable diversion of resources for similar reasons. Perth Airport: Aircraft Movements (Question No. 1267) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in writing, on 25 February 2010: (1) In respect of recent reports of the incapacity of Perth Airport to meet the predicted demand for flyin fly-out aircraft departures between 6.00 a.m. to 8.00 a.m. to service the mining sector: (a) considering approximately 90 per cent of traffic at that time is departures, what is the permissible rate of aircraft movements on each available runway; and (b) can he indicate how this legal movement rate compares with major airports of the world, including Heathrow Airport in London and major ones in the United States of America. (2) Why is Busselton Regional Airport in WA subject to a curfew; how many residences are affected by aircraft noise associated with this airport; what steps, including resumption and compensation, could be taken to resolve this problem; and could Royal Australian Air Force Base Pearce be approved as an alternative to Perth airport. (1) There are currently an average total of 55 movements between 6.00 am and 8.00 am on weekdays. There is no legislated movement rate at Perth Airport. (2) The curfew at Busselton Airport and related noise management issues are a matter for the Western Australian Government’s Environment Protection Authority. There are capacity constraints and operational limitations, both in the air and on the ground, that preclude the use of RAAF Base Pearce as an alternative to Perth Airport. Digital Television (Question No. 1293) Mr Hartsuyker asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 11 March 2010: Can the Minister indicate when vacant digital bandwidth is expected to be allocated to community television operators in regional Australia. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: The Australian Government values community television as an important component of the Australian media landscape. Accordingly it has determined a pathway for community television to make the transition to digital broadcasting. The Government asked the Australian Communications and Media Authority to temporarily allocate unassigned spectrum to community stations C31 in Melbourne, TVS in Sydney, QCTV in Brisbane and Channel 31 Adelaide to simulcast their services until the switch to digital–only television in capital cities in 2013. A new trial community broadcasting licensee, West TV in Perth, commenced digital-only broadcasts in April 2010. The Government has also allocated funding support, totalling $2.6 million, to assist the community television sector to meet the costs of commencing digital services. Other than these capital cities no spectrum has been reserved or identified in licence area plans for digital community broadcasting television services. Further, the availability of spectrum for any new broadcasting television services will depend on decisions by the Government about the use of the spectrum after the completion of digital switchover. Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme (Question No. 1294) Mr Robert asked the Minister for Defence Personnel, in writing, on 11 March 2010: In respect of the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme, whereby members who do not complete 20 days of effective Reserve service within the financial year may apply to the relevant Director General Personnel for an exemption based on special circumstances: (a) what factors determine ‘special circumstances’;",295,Questions In Writing
266,Mr Albanese,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,297,Questions In Writing
267,Mr Albanese,"The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy(b) to 10 March 2010, how many Reservists had applied for an exemption, and how many of these had been approved or denied; and (c) for each application, can he indicate the nature of the ‘special circumstances’. (a) Regulation 20 (Deemed effective service – exceptional circumstances) of the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme Regulations 2008 (DHOAS Regulations) provides that circumstances which are taken to be ‘exceptional’ include, but are not limited to: (i) The member has had an extended period of illness or injury that prevents the member from performing their effective service; (ii) service has been performed but, as a result of a defective decision, is not recognised as service. The Explanatory Statement to the DHOAS Regulations explains that a defect in a member’s appointment, enlistment or transfer, which may be corrected at a later time, may leave some uncertainty on whether a member has completed effective service. The member may have grounds to apply for their service to be deemed effective. The Explanatory Memorandum provides that in circumstances when a Reserve member’s illness is long and serious enough to prevent the member from serving for an entire service year, the member may also apply for deemed effective service. The Explanatory Memorandum states that there would be no exceptional circumstance when a Reserve member is simply not offered service, or where the member is not offered service because the member has applied to serve in a rank or employment category for which the member is not qualified or competent to serve. (b) 36 Reservists applied; 29 were approved; six denied; and one not proceeded with by the member. (c) The nature of the ‘special circumstances’ for each application is as follows: (i) Medical/Health Eight members were deemed effective for medical/health reasons. (ii) Death of serving members The partners of two deceased members were approved deeming in respect of the deceased member’s service for the year in which the member died, because of service performed by the members prior to their deaths. (iii) Mandatory Training/Scholarships/Civilian employment Six members were deemed effective on grounds of mandatory training requirements; overseas studies; or civilian employment commitments. One of these members applied for service to be deemed effective for more than one financial year and was approved for part of the period requested. (iv) Posting Orders/Training Cancellations Four members were deemed to have provided effective service for the following reasons: changes to posting order; accompanying spouse (permanent member) on overseas posting; cancelled training; cancelled unit parade days. (v) Service History Discrepancy One member was deemed to have provided effective service on recognition of a discrepancy in service history data. The member had applied to have more than one financial year deemed effective and was approved for part of the period requested. (vi) Administrative Error",297,Questions In Writing
268,Mr Griffin,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Eight members of the Reserve Forces were deemed effective on grounds of an administrative error relating to notification of their service obligations during financial year 2008-09. (vii) Not Proceeded with Application One member sought consideration for ineffective service to be deemed effective on grounds of specific service requirements. However, the member had decided not to proceed with his application. Queensland Hospitals: Commonwealth Funding (Question No. 1304) Mr Slipper asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 11 March 2010: (1) Will he guarantee adequate funding for Queensland hospitals under the Government’s National Health and Hospitals Network? (2) Will he consider allocating funds to assist the construction of the Sunshine Coast University Hospital; if so will it be provided no later than 2012? (1) Under the National Health and Hospitals Network the Commonwealth Government will become the majority funder of the Australian public hospital system. The Commonwealth will fund: 60 per cent of the efficient price of every public hospital service provided to public patients; 60 per cent of recurrent expenditure on research and training functions undertaken in public hospitals; 60 per cent of capital expenditure, both operating capital and capital investment, to maintain and improve public hospital infrastructure; and over time, up to 100 per cent of the efficient price of ‘primary health care equivalent’ outpatient services provided to public hospital patients. This Commonwealth funding commitment will apply to every service that states/territories and Local Hospital Networks agree to provide. Consistent with my Government’s commitment, no state or territory will be worse off in the short term and all states will be better off in the long term. By 2019-20 Queensland will be better off by around $3.5 billion under the NHHN reform plan. (2) For the first time the Commonwealth will fund 60 per cent of capital expenditure, on a ‘user cost of capital’ basis approach incorporating both depreciation and cost of capital components where possible. United Kingdom: Import Carbon Tax (Question No. 1305) Dr Jensen asked the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, in writing, on 11 March 2010: (1) Is he aware of reports that the United Kingdom Committee on Climate Change has advised that Ministers should consider a carbon tax on imports to help struggling British manufacturers. (2) Would any existing trade agreements between Australia and the United Kingdom be adversely affected by the proposal; if so, what is the likely impact on Australian businesses.",298,Questions In Writing
269,Mr Rudd,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:vided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water is aware that border carbon price adjustments were included in a discussion of possible policy options to mitigate competitiveness concerns in the 2008 report “Building a low-carbon economy – the UK’s contribution to tackling climate change” by the United Kingdom (UK) Committee on Climate Change. The UK Committee on Climate Change is an independent body that advises the UK Government on emissions reduction. The Committee’s discussion of policy options to mitigate competitiveness concerns in the report did not make recommendations as to which options should be adopted, and the Minister is not aware of any formal proposals for a border carbon price adjustment measure being considered in the UK. (2) Other than arrangements under the World Trade Organization (WTO), there are no significant trade agreements in existence between Australia and the UK. Any proposed border carbon adjustment measure would need to be consistent with UK obligations under WTO rules. If a UK import carbon tax were ever proposed, its impact on Australian businesses would depend entirely on its design and purpose. The Australian Government routinely monitors progress of these types of issues and will undertake appropriate analysis of the implications for Australia, including the WTO consistency, of any specific proposals put forward. Egypt: Coptic Christians (Question No. 1316) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 18 March 2010: Has the Government issued any statements: (a) regarding the persecution of Egyptian citizens of the Coptic faith; if so, when; and (b) that have condemned the persecution of Egyptian citizens of the Coptic faith; if not, why not. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: On 13 January 2010 I ( Mr Smith) wrote to Bishop Suriel of the Diocese of Melbourne to express my condolences and deep sadness at the loss of life in the 6 January attack on a Coptic Orthodox Church in Egypt. I noted that the murder of seven innocent Egyptian citizens, including six Christians and one Muslim, was a heinous act, particularly given the murder was committed on such a holy day for Coptic Christians. I noted further that Australia welcomed steps taken by Egyptian authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice, including the direct personal involvement of the Chief Prosecutor in investigating the crime. On 14 January 2010, Australia’s Ambassador to Egypt wrote to His Holiness, Pope Shenouda III, head of the Coptic Church, conveying condolences and deep sadness at the 6 January attack. In February 2010, Australia submitted a written intervention in Egypt’s Universal Periodic Review at the United Nations Human Rights Council. This is available on the website of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Australia welcomed Egypt’s March 2009 decree recognising the rights of adherents of non-recognised religions to obtain identification documents without having to identify themselves as Christians, Jews or Muslims. The intervention asked the Government of Egypt for an update on the status of the proposal of the Egyptian National Council for Human Rights for a ‘unified law’ on the construction and renovation of houses of worship.",299,Questions In Writing
