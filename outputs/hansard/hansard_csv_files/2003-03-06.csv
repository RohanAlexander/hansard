Thursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12451 Thursday, 6 March 2003 ----Family Services: Child Care Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (9.40 a.m.)-I present a petition relating to child care, which has been signed by 1,090 people across New South Wales. I table a second petition, which also relates to child care, which has been signed by 997 people across Queensland. These petitions deal with an important issue. Such large numbers of community members have signed these petitions because of the great concern in the community about inadequate funding in the child-care area. The petition from Queensland relates to a decision by this government to slash $500,000 from the training budget for Queensland child-care workers. It is a cause of great concern that the specialist training that was provided under that program is not going to be available to many child-care centres, particularly in rural and regional Queensland. The Queensland trainers are particularly concerned that they will not be getting the support and information that their colleagues across the country will be receiving. The second petition on child care is signed mostly by parents and child-care workers in New South Wales who are concerned, in particular, about the low status and standing of those working in the child-care field. I urge the House to pay serious attention to these petitions. It is very important that the views of thousands of parents across the country be heard. People believe that, by petitioning the parliament, the matter can be raised further, the government will pay attention to their views, we will be able to move forward in this debate and, particularly in relation to the decision to slash $500,000 from the Queensland child-care budget, the money will be reinstated. We understand that during this budget process there is an opportunity for that to happen. We urge that it does happen. We urge that the government pay serious attention to looking at any way in which it can participate in raising the status, standing, and pay and conditions of child-care workers across the country. The petitions read as followsTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to our serious concerns about the current child care system, particularly the low status and standing of workers in the child care field and their appalling wages and conditions. This is despite numerous reports about this issue that the Federal Government has ignored. Qualified child care workers are needed to run quality child care services for our children our country’s most precious resource and urgent action is required in order to recruit and retain staff in this industry. Your petitioners therefore request that the House turns its urgent attention to addressing the chronic stage of qualified workers in the industry and ensuring they are given adequate recognition and reward for their important role in caring for our children. from 1,090 citizens.

Indonesia: Tourism of the Tourism Industry Leaders Dialogue held in Bali from 22 to 25 February this year. Along with the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Senator Alan Ferguson, and the chairman of the government’s foreign affairs committee, Julie Bishop MP, I was invited to visit Bali by the Indonesian Cultural and Tourism Agency. The aim of the visit was to discuss initiatives to increase visitor numbers to the island, to inspect improvements to safety, security and health services, and for leading members of the Australian tourism industry to experience Bali for themselves. In November, I attended a large Christian service in Bali to remember those who were killed in the bomb blast. I was there in my capacity as President of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. Some 7,000 to 8,000 Balinese attended the service, and it was particularly moving. At that time, the hotel occupancy rate had plunged below 10 per cent. This was evident in the shops and restaurants and on the beaches, which were almost deserted. Prior to the attack, Bali hotel occupancy rates averaged 70 per cent. Since that time, the level of hotel occupancy has risen to 30 per cent, but the impact on the Balinese economy has been severe. Direct foreign tourist arrivals, which peaked in August at 140,000, dropped in November to 30,000. Arrivals from Australia dropped from 25,000 in September to 3,600 in November. The effects on the people of Bali have been devastating. The Indonesian Minister for Manpower has assessed that approximately 130,000 hotel and tourism workers have been laid off in Bali. A continued plunge in tourist numbers will devastate the island resort, where almost the entire population of 3.2 million relies on tourism related activities.

Indonesia’s Minister of Finance reports that the decline in the tourism sector will reflect on at least 10 sectors, including hotels, land and air transportation, restaurants, entertainment, tours, sightseeing, souvenirs, health, beauty and guarding services. Every two dollars lost from the gross income of the tourism sector would decrease the GDP by around $3 million. It was great to work with the Indonesian authorities in terms of looking at ways of restarting the tourism industry there, and we were given a great welcome. My colleagues and I were happy to work with our Indonesian hosts, who were hospitable and welcoming. We look forward to continuing the dialogue with our Indonesian colleagues and we wish them well in rebuilding the Balinese tourism economy. Family and Community Services: Assistance Programs Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.56 a.m.)-As a local member in a Labor-held opposition seat, I tend to have a great deal of difficulty convincing the Howard government that community groups within my electorate should receive funds under specific programs. In particular, a number of groups in my electorate have even been told that they should not put in applications for the Regional Solutions Program, and other groups have struggled to get funding under the stronger families program. Recently, a Central Coast organisation-or nonorganisation, I should say; it did not existreceived a letter from the member for Robertson. The member for Robertson urged the Drivers Against Roundabout Jungles-DARJ-to put in an application under the Volunteer Small Equipment Grants 2003. This was a purely fictitious group which had been dreamed up by a couple of the journalists on the Central Coast Herald. The program that the member for Robertson was asking them to apply for grants under is an assistance program funded through the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy. They were told that they could apply for a grant of up to $5,000. The thing that I find so offensive is that DARJ was never a proper organisation. The Herald ran a campaign about shrubs obscuring vision on the roundabouts but, in actual fact, the group never existed. There is a wonderful group in the southern part of the Shortland electorate-the Northern Lakes Family Centre. It received its initial funding under the Central Coast Area Assistance Scheme. It was funded under that for two years. The funding has now run out, and there is no more funding. Luckily, the Carr government has come to the party, giving it a little funding to keep it going. I have given that group information on the Regional Solutions Program and the stronger families program. This is a group that is providing benefit to the community each and every day. It is supporting families in stress and in need. To date, it has not received one cent from the federal government. Here, on one hand, we have a federal member urging a group that does not really exist to apply for funding and, on the other hand, we have a group that is in dire need.

Cognate bill: Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 February, on motion by Mr Truss: That this bill be now read a second time. Industry Service Reform Bill 2003 and the cognate levy bill Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Dairy) Bill 2003. The legislation proposes change to the delivery of dairy industry services including the privatisation of the Australian Dairy Corporation and its registration as a Corporations Law company known as Dairy Australia Limited; the abolition of the Dairy Research and Development Corporation and transfer of its functions to the new Corporations Law company; authority for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to declare an industry services body for the purpose of receiving and expending industry levy funds and matching Commonwealth R&D funds; the consolidation of three existing industry levies into a new dairy service levy; and the opportunity for levy payers to participate in periodic levy polls on the dairy service levy rate. The proposed model for the delivery of dairy industry services is similar to the model adopted in recent years for other rural industries including horticulture, pork and eggs. That is, it combines in one organisation the delivery function of hitherto discrete industry services such as market promotion, and research and development. During debate in this chamber on similar industry changes, Labor has expressed concern about the consolidation of disparate industry functions into one body. Nevertheless, Labor has maintained that where such a change is desired by industry we will not stand in its way. The reform process was industry initiated and the proposed model is the subject of industry recommendation. That is something that we accept but with one important and responsible caveat. Labor will not agree to a new industry service structure that does not have sufficient regard to accountability for expenditure of compulsory industry levies and Commonwealth R&D funding. It is for very sound reasons that we take this position. When announcing the government’s plan to privatise the Australian Dairy Corporation, the minister said that the new industry services body will manage $35 million in levy funds and $15 million in matching Commonwealth R&D funding each year. It is no small sum of money. The statutory basis of the ADC and the Dairy Research and Development Corporation provides this parliament with the opportunity to scrutinise these organisations and ensure that they properly account for the expenditure of funds, most especially public funds. Of course the parliament’s capacity to scrutinise a private company is clearly more limited. During a second reading speech on the Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill, the minister talked about some of the accountability measures he proposes. These measures include the requirement that an industry services body enter into a statutory funding contract with the Commonwealth before the minister makes an industry services body declaration. The minister must also approve in writing the constitution of the company and the nomination of inaugural directors.",101,Representatives Main Committee

196,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (10.00 A.m.),"I am pleased to rise and address the DairyThursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12455 It is pleasing to note that some accountability measures introduced by Labor in respect to reform of the pig industry service structure have been included in the Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill. I refer in particular to the requirement that a declaration of an industry service body be tabled in each house of parliament and published in the Gazette. During his earlier speech in this debate the minister said the company would receive compulsory levy funds collected by the Commonwealth and matching R&D contributions only ‘so long as it remains accountable for them to both levy payers and the parliament’. In relation to the administration of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Fund the industry services body will be required to present an annual report to the minister and the minister will be required to table a copy of this report in each house of the parliament. But in relation to the expenditure of levy funds and matching Commonwealth R&D contributions there is no reporting requirement to the parliament in the proposal before us. This is a matter of concern to those on this side of the chamber. The opposition received a departmental briefing on these bills earlier this week. The assurances given to this House by the minister were, not unexpectedly, echoed by his department. The department said that the statutory funding agreement between Dairy Australia Ltd and the Commonwealth would impose rigorous planning and reporting requirements. The department also said that the statutory funding agreement would contain limitations on the form of the company structure beyond those outlined in the Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill. But, regrettably, the opposition was advised that the minister had failed to produce, even in draft form, the constitution of the new company and the contract between that company and the Commonwealth. Along with these foundation documents, the minister has neglected to prepare the subordinate legislation that will allow the new arrangements to function properly. In fact Labor understands that the drafting instructions for these regulations have not yet been prepared. Most extraordinary is the fact that the proposed start-up date for the new company, 1 July 2003, is less than 16 weeks away. The constitution, funding agreement and necessary regulations should have been ready at the same time as the legislation. On Tuesday afternoon the minister provided the opposition with a document outlining the key provisions in a yet to be drafted funding contract. Thankfully it is a start, but it is not nearly good enough. Members who were in this place during the last parliament will recall the March 2001 debate on the Pig Industry Bill. During that debate my colleague the member for Corio, Mr Gavan O’Connor, and my Tasmanian friend and colleague the member for Lyons, Dick Adams, noted the failure of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to provide the opposition with a copy of the proposed Australian Pork Ltd constitution and the funding contract between the new pork industry service body and the Commonwealth. Two years later we find ourselves in exactly the same position-same broad restructure proposal, same minister and, unfortunately, the same disregard for the parliament. Members on this side of the House have a legitimate concern that public money not be spent without appropriate accountability. One hopes that members of the government share that concern, but I am confident that the serious and serial offence will not be raised by government speakers on this legislation. I wonder why. The reforms proposed in the bills before us did not evolve overnight. I have little doubt that the minister will seek to explain his failure by reference to the passage of the Dairy Industry Legislation Amendment Bill in the last half of 2002, but I implore him, for the sake of his credibility, to resist that temptation. It is always 12456 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 a mistake for a minister to blame poor timetabling of his own legislation for faults in his administration. Last year the parliament gave the ADC the authority to fund an investigation of an industry service reform model. The proposed model is no surprise to the minister, no surprise to the dairy farmers and no surprise to the opposition. More than six months ago, on 28 August 2002, the minister told the House: ... the dairy industry has approached the government with a proposal for reform which would see the two statutory service providers merge and become one Corporations Act company, directly accountable to levy payer members. Labor allowed the bill appropriating funding for development of the reform model a speedy passage through the parliament. During its passage through this parliament, Labor urged the minister to develop this industry model in a considered way. It is disappointing that the minister has failed to do this. Not only have six months passed since the minister acknowledged the industry’s desire for a reform path; more than 18 months have passed since the dairy industry itself proposed the formation of a Corporations Law company to undertake industry services. I would like to turn briefly to the details of the proposed structure. The Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill 2003 provides for the privatisation of the ADC to a Corporations Law company, Dairy Australia Ltd, and the transfer of all DRDC assets and liabilities to the new company. Dairy Australia Ltd membership will comprise dairy levy payers and peak farmer and industry bodies. Levy payers will not be compelled to join the company, but those who do so will have an opportunity to participate in decision making about its board and the services it provides. All levy payers, whether they elect to join the company or not, will have an opportunity to vote at periodic levy polls on the rate of the dairy service levy. The new company will deliver services similar to those currently delivered by the ADC and the DRDC and some technical services currently delivered by the Australian Dairy Industry Council. Export control, which is currently administered by the ADC, will not be undertaken by Dairy Australia Ltd but will be administered by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. ADC staff will continue to be employed by the new company following privatisation. DRDC staff will transfer to the new company and maintain continuity of employment. Labor is assured by the government that employees have been engaged in appropriate consultation on the impact of the proposed changes which, in relation to employment numbers, is expected to be minimal. This is a matter that we on this side of the House will monitor closely, and we will hold the minister to his word. The Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Dairy) Bill 2003 consolidates the existing corporation levy, promotion levy and research levy into a single levy known as the dairy service levy. The maximum rate of the new levy will be the combined maximum rate of the existing levies. The industry argues that the single industry body and the consolidation of three existing levies will provide the new company with flexibility in relation to expenditure, within the parameters of the statutory funding agreement. It is an argument that the government clearly endorses. The dairy industry levy and the levy paid by farmers to the Australian Animal Health Council will not be affected by the proposed levy changes. However, the new industry services body will administer the Dairy Structural Adjustment Fund currently administered by the ADC, but will do so in the form of a trust. Thursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12457 These bills must be considered in the context of changes to the structure and operation of the Australian dairy industry over the past two decades. The industry has changed considerably over that time. Technology and farm management have improved and market changes have also occurred here and abroad. Labor has been a supporter of the dairy industry and a proponent of reform. The Kerin and Crean plans are recognised, even by many of those opposite, as key events in the industry’s development. I have no doubt that the current Minister for Trade will recall his praise for the efforts of the current Leader of the Opposition-in his words, ‘a hell of a lot of work went into this’-and join with him in acknowledging the work of Labor primary industries ministers Kerin, Crean and Collins in supporting the Australian dairy industry. Thank heavens for 13 years of Labor, I say. Industry change, including deregulation, has not been without cost to many dairy farmers and regional communities, particularly in the old quota states of New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia-and I know all members in this House are well aware of the challenges and costs to those communities. Farm numbers have fallen, herd sizes have risen and the production sector has undergone an inexorable rationalisation. The initial response of the Howard government to deregulation was belated and inadequate. I know my colleague the member for McMillan was in the House as we urged the minister to act on this very important inevitable restructuring that was required, but the minister belatedly reacted. The eventual package was not driven by any general concern within the government about the impact of deregulation on the industry but by the hard work of industry and the urgings of the Labor Party. The program that emerged under pressure, the dairy industry adjustment package, is not funded by the Commonwealth but by an 11c per litre tax on milk. As noted earlier, the new industry services body will administer the fund, out of which adjustment package payments are made. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will be acutely aware of one component of the package, the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program, because his electorate of Wide Bay has been the biggest recipient of funding under this program. By a remarkable coincidence, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has found himself handing out more dairy regional adjustment package cheques than any other member in this place. Even more remarkable is the fact that the value of these cheques exceeds the sum of DRAP grants to any other electorate in the country. As Mel Brooks, as Louis XVI, said, ‘It’s good to be the king.’ This is largesse gone mad-but far be it from me to say it was pork-barrelling! Another matter worthy of note in relation to the Dairy Structural Adjustment Fund is that the dairy adjustment levy is now likely to linger longer than the original proposed end date of 2008. According to the review conducted by the Dairy Adjustment Authority late last year, the levy-that is, the 11c a litre tax on milk sold off the supermarket or milk bar shelves-will need to remain in place until 2010, two years longer than the original commitment given by this minister. I might add that rural and regional Australia hopes that the coalition government will be but a distant memory by 2010. Nevertheless, it is important to note, in the context of a debate on the administration of dairy levies, another broken tax promise by the Howard government. The dairy industry has overcome challenges in the past, and I am confident it will overcome the challenges presented to it in the future. Current challenges include the drought, which has significantly curtailed milk production and export income in the current year. An 12458 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 the dairy industry will recover production lost to the drought but recovery will be slow. We on this side of the House have been justly critical of the minister’s inadequate response to the drought that has gripped much of Australia, including our major dairying regions for many months. Labor again urges the minister to address the shortage of feed grain by conducting a national grain audit and reviewing the protocols that apply to the import of feed grain. It is not good enough for the minister responsible for our rural industries to sit back, look at the sky and hope for rain. Due to the reforms implemented by Labor in the 1980s and the early 1990s and the leadership the industry itself has shown, the Australian dairy industry is an outward looking industry. It is an internationally competitive industry, curbed by the distortions in the international market created by unfair and anticompetitive trade barriers. This week the Minister for Trade announced the government’s negotiating objectives for the proposed US-Australia free trade agreement. Those objectives include the elimination of tariff quota restrictions on Australia’s dairy exports to the United States. Liberalisation of trade in dairy goods is an objective shared by the dairy industry, but not just in relation to the United States. At a time when we are discussing the future of the dairy industry, it is important to note the connection between improved market access and a sustainable future for the industry. The government would best serve the interests of all Australia’s rural industries, including dairying, by putting the Doha Round first. I have outlined some of the concerns held by Labor about the reform proposal and some of the more general challenges confronting the dairy industry. I have acknowledged the fact that the proposal has had a long genesis, is industry initiated and, indeed, is desired by most industry members. Industry initiated proposals, as all in this House would be aware, are terribly hard to get off the ground. The scope of the current proposal is a tribute to members of the industry who have nurtured the reform proposal and dairy farmers who have participated in consultations. Labor is pleased to acknowledge Mr Pat Rowley, Chair of the Australian Dairy Industry Council and long-time industry leader, and the ADC’s Ms Helen Dornom for their contribution to the reform proposal agreed by the government and now before the House. The dairy industry wants the proposed new industry service structure in place and operational on 1 July 2003. Unfortunately, the minister has let the industry down by dragging his heels on key aspects of the industry’s reform proposal. I have referred to the minister’s failure to provide the opposition with important details associated with reform of pig industry services. During the debate on the Pig Industry Bill 2000, the same minister said: I have given an undertaking that documents will be available for the opposition to scrutinise prior to the debate in the Senate. We demand no less on this occasion. The devil is in the detail. The deadline proposed by industry and agreed to by government is just 16 weeks away. According to the minister, the new company will have responsibility for expending $50 million per annum. The very least the minister can do is inform this parliament of just how the new industry services body will work. I advise the House that Labor will move to defer consideration of this legislation in the other place until the minister accedes to our request. two bills relating to the dairy industry, the Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill 2003 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Dairy) Bill 2003, as it again allows me the",102,Representatives Main Committee
197,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (10.21 A.m.),"I welcome this opportunity to speak on the theseThursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12459 time to raise the problems of the dairy farmers in my electorate of Paterson, but first I will speak directly on the legislation before us. The Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill will establish Dairy Australia Ltd as a company limited by guarantee under the Corporations Act 2001 to replace the Australian Dairy Corporation and the Dairy Research and Development Corporation in the delivery of dairy industry services. The Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Dairy) Bill 2003 will establish a new levy called the dairy service levy which will replace the current dairy promotion levy, the dairy research levy and the dairy corporation levy. Dairy Australia will be responsible for the delivery of research and development and promotion services for the dairy industry as well as the administration of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Fund. These new arrangements are the culmination of an extensive legal and financial process undertaken by the Commonwealth and the dairy industry to identify the most appropriate structures to replace both dairy corporations. The arrangement proposed in these bills has the support of the Australian Dairy Industry Council, which has played an integral part in the development of these new arrangements. The Australian Dairy Corporation says: The creation of Dairy Australia is an important step toward dairy producers having a more active say in the future development of their industry. From a producer perspective, a key aspect of the new structure is that the company will be industry-owned and farmers will be responsible for contributing to Dairy Australia and the longer term development of the industry. It would deliver a company that could meet the specific needs of a deregulated industry and provide a clear focus on delivering returns from a dairy farmer’s levy investment. So it is important to note that the arrangements in this legislation have the absolute backing of the dairy industry for its future investment, and the future of the industry is something I am deeply concerned about. In my electorate of Paterson, farmers have been hit hard since deregulation, their situation exacerbated by the current drought. I spoke earlier this year about the plight of dairy farmers in Dungog, Raymond Terrace, Gloucester, Nabiac and the Great Lakes region. The problem they face is that the cost of producing milk far outweighs the price they are receiving for milk. They have also been severely affected by the drought. I met with farmers late last year at a meeting attended by over 300 people at the Dungog RSL Club. I would like to formally thank Bluey Watkins from Dungog and Bob Koopman from Nelsons Plains for organising this meeting. They are absolute champions for the industry and deserve more than they receive. Besides running these meetings, they are running their farms and working extremely hard looking for solutions for their industry. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, in your role as the member for Page you would understand that at the time farmers were getting about 30c a litre for their milk, and yet it was costing them around 50c a litre to produce it. With figures like those, farmers are really struggling to stay afloat. They are eating into their cash reserves, using their overdrafts and selling off the bottom paddock just to stay afloat, but they have also been hit by a crippling drought-the worse in over 100 years. Most of my electorate has been relatively drought-proofed over the years but the drought has still had a severe effect. More recently, dairy farmers have met with the leader of the National Party in New South Wales, George Souris, and this week with New South Wales agriculture minister, Richard Amery. I also congratulate Bob Geoghegan, the Liberal candidate for Maitland, for his work in helping to organise meetings with Bluey Watkins and Bob Koopman. I am also pleased to 12460 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 say that the message from all sides of politics so far has been clear in relation to these farmers. Politicians are saying that milk processors and retailers-in particular, supermarketsshould be passing on more of their profits to farmers by way of a better farm-gate price. Given the current climate with the drought, it is only fair that processors and supermarkets, who are making the money out of the farmers’ products, should be ensuring that their supply line is intact. I advise the House that we have had some rain in parts of the Paterson electorate which has brought a great deal of relief for local communities. I was in Dungog last Friday and it amazed me to see the difference that a little rain can make. But it is important to note that, whilst the fields are green, there is very little depth in the feed in the paddocks. It will probably take months for the feed and crops to recover. As farmers know only too well, one day of rain does not break a drought; we need follow-up rain, and plenty of it, to fill the dams and rivers and provide enough feed for stock. From what I hear in the forecasts, rain should be coming in the months ahead, but unfortunately many farmers could not wait for the rainthey have found the situation untenable and have left the land. I have heard heart breaking stories of farmers who have sold their stock and then the following day the rain has fallen. Some Dungog farmers found that with the drop in milk prices since deregulation and the added blow of a drought their businesses were no longer sustainable. So the suppliers of milk, the very start of the chain, are doing it extremely tough. The effect this has on the community is tough as well. Young people are leaving the land and do not want to take over the family business. It has an effect on local businesses in the towns as well. If the farmers cannot afford to buy goods, the local shops are affected and then more local jobs are also affected. But the milk processors and supermarkets are the ones making a dollar and they are doing it on the back of very hard work from the farmers. I also point out that Dairy Farmers corporation took the decision to close down the Gloucester dry milk factory on the basis of financial unviability. That closure started to cripple the town itself. On the back of that, we have now had deregulation, an increase in feed supply costs and a reduction in the amount paid for milk by Dairy Farmers to their farmers. They should be recognising the hardships faced by many communities, such as the farmers in Dungog and surrounding regions, and the fact that their suppliers are leaving the industry under current conditions. To be fair, some companies have recognised the extraordinary circumstances that farmers are in. Bega, for example, on the South Coast of New South Wales, announced a special drought support payment to dairy farmers for the months of November, December and January due to the drought. Chairman of Bega Cheese, Barry Irvin, was quoted in a December media release as saying: ... it was the Board and management’s view that increases in returns of this magnitude were necessary to ensure the local industry did not suffer long term damage as a result of the current circumstances. Bega Cheese believes that this is an investment in the future of our dairy industry. This is about investing in the future and is an example of a responsible company ensuring the continuation of the supply chain of its product. As those who come from regional electorates know, dairy cows are not something you can put on the back paddock for a month and then bring back on to produce more milk. Once they go dry through lack of feed or lack of milking, it can take up to 18 months to two years to bring cows back on line to produce milk, particularly quality milk. The cost of the feed and the type of feed being given to these cattle Thursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12461 have also reduced the quality of the milk, and that has further exacerbated the price returns that farmers have been getting for the milk. It is tough on the land, but that is a risk that dairy farmers accept. But when additional pressures are brought to bear on them by those further up the line, such as the processors and retailers, then unfortunately the buck is stopping with the farmers. I think that is an unconscionable action by the lions above. This is about the future survival of an industry and the survival of dairy farmers who have been on the land for generations. It is interesting to see in the supermarkets the wide range of prices for various brands of milk. In fact, it is not unusual to see differences between various brands of over a dollar in the price of two litres of milk. It is also interesting to see the price that consumers are prepared to pay for a bottle of water and for coke, for example, in comparison to what they pay for milk. For a 600 millilitre carton of milk, you could pay around $1.10. In comparison, consumers will pay around $2 for a 600 millilitre bottle of coke and around $1.25 for a 600 millilitre bottle of water. It is a sad day when consumers will happily pay more for a bottle of water-when they can readily get water out of a tap-than they will for a carton of milk. It takes a great deal of time and labour to produce milk, yet the producers are getting very poor prices for it. I call on the milk processors and the supermarkets to give farmers a fair go. Give them the prices they deserve and support the industry that supports the jobs and the many families of Paterson. Without the farmers producing the milk, the processors and the supermarkets will have no milk to sell. bate on the Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill 2003 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Dairy) Bill 2003. The dairy industry is no small thing when we talk about Australia’s export performance, the number of people who are employed in the sector and the industry’s importance to certain regional and rural communities which depend very heavily upon the industry for people’s livelihoods. As you would be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, the electorate of McMillan is Victoria’s premier dairy region. We have had a proud association with the industry, which has been to the benefit of the dairy industry, the dairy sector and the people in the electorate of McMillan. With this debate, we always tend to drift away from talking about the people who make it all possible and end up talking about the big dairy corporations and cooperatives in discussions about the tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars that might go through national dairy authorities. But all of that is impossible without the people who are doing the work-the farmers, the people who work in the milk processing facilities and the people who make all of it happen. They are the ones who drive the industry forward. In my electorate, we have seen a number of very important dairy developments over the last five or six years. In particular, we have seen the development of the Darnum Park facility-the Bonlac milk processing plant in West Gippsland-at a cost of, I think, between $200 million and $300 million. It was an incredible achievement by all of the construction workers involved in building it on time and under budget. The work force that they have over there are incredibly dedicated to the work they do on behalf of the Bonlac Cooperative. We have also seen further east in my electorate the development of the National Foods yoghurt manufacturing facility at Morwell. Once again, it was a great achievement by the construction workers to build it also under budget and within time frames. We have seen that fa-",106,Representatives Main Committee
198,Mr Zahra (Mcmillan) (10.31 A.m.),"I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this de12462 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 cility go from strength to strength over the last few years. I was very heartened to see that around about 18 months ago they reduced the number of casual staff that they had there and employed 30 more people on a full-time basis. This is exactly the type of thing that we want to see. We want to see these full-time, high-wage jobs in country districts. We have proved in the McMillan electorate that, when big dairy employers want to do business with us, we will support them, make them profitable, deliver good employer-employee relations and cooperate in helping them achieve their objectives. In return, we expect to be treated decently, to have people employed on decent wages and, of course, to have as many full-time positions as possible rather than a heavily casualised work force. The relationship works well between the companies and the work force in the electorate of McMillan. There have been some great success stories, which are really great examples for the rest of the industry about how to go about doing these things. I heard the member for Paterson talking a little bit earlier about how farmers are finding things right now in the dairy sector. I myself, the member for Blaxland, the member for Braddon and other members of the Labor Party in the House of Representatives talked a lot at the time of dairy industry deregulation about the likely impact on communities and farmers and about the likely consequences. We were not so much concerned for the states that we are from-Victoria and Tasmania in my case and that of the member for Braddon, which have had a very different dairy industry for many years and were better able to cope with the changes brought upon us by dairy deregulation-we were more concerned about how farmers in New South Wales and Queensland would be affected. They had had a very different industry for many years and had come to know the existing arrangements, and we knew the transition would be a difficult one. It was not easy to get the government’s attention in relation to the likely impact of dairy deregulation on these communities. But we did, and we did it with the help of the dairy industry itself. I remember having many discussions-and I am sure the member for Braddon and the member for Blaxland recall this-with people who were in senior positions within the dairy cooperatives in particular and other dairy corporations in which we appealed to them to join us to try to make sure that communities and dairy farmers were not left behind in dairy deregulation. Out of all of that came the range of compensation measures that were put in place to try to offset some of the likely impacts of dairy deregulation. We welcomed that at the time from the government and, of course, supported it as it went through the parliament. One part of that was the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program, which my colleague and friend the member for Braddon made some reference to in his remarks today. We have seen some good projects funded and we have seen some appalling projects funded out of that program. The worse one I saw was a wine appreciation room which was funded at an Anglican grammar school in Queensland out of the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program-appalling, disgraceful, a shocking pork barrel and an inappropriate use of taxpayers’ money, especially taxpayers’ money that was supposed to go towards helping dairy farmers and the communities that depend on the dairy industry to cope with this massive change. At the other end of the scale we have seen some positive things come out of the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program. Some of those things I have been able to negotiate for my electorate directly with the minister-and I place on record my appreciation for the direct discussions I have been able to have with Warren Truss, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Thursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12463 Forestry, in relation to those issues. I have been able to talk to him directly about getting funding for Flavourite tomatoes in West Gippsland which has seen them expand their operation in a dairy dependent community, employ more people and expand their business-a great outcome for West Gippsland. I have been able to talk to Warren directly about getting funding for the Tarago River Cheese Company which has seen them expand their business and employ more people. I have been able to speak to him directly about getting support for Jindivick cheese which has seen them expand their business and employ more people. These are good outcomes, and these are the types of discussions which people in our communities expect us to be able to have with ministers irrespective of what political party they or we might happen to be in. SoI place on record my congratulations to the minister on the open way in which he has been involved in discussions with me in relation to those projects. We do not agree all the time-and it will not surprise anyone in this chamber to hear me say thatbut on these matters he has been a decent man to deal with and I would like to think that, between the two of us, we have been able to do something good for the community I represent. The dairy industry is much bigger than party politics. I think it is the industry in Australia with the most potential to drive our export performance. In Victoria the state government has a target to substantially increase exports of dairy products over the next 10 years. We will not do that without new investment. We will not do it without a focus on bringing in that new investment, much of which we know is out there looking for a place to base itself. We will not do it without a government that is prepared to be interventionist and work with the big dairy cooperatives and companies to make it happen. We in my electorate say to the Murray Goulburns, Bonlac Foods and National Foods of the world, and to other big dairy corporations, that we are open for business. We are very interested in working with those big companies and other companies to try to get new dairy investment in our region. We have in South and West Gippsland and the Latrobe Valley dairy farmers who are among the most efficient in the world. We have people who have demonstrated that they are creative and hard working, and that they can close a deal and make it happen. We have local governments that are engaged in supporting business, and we have a state government in Victoria that is very interested in the dairy industry and very keen to see these types of developments take place in the short to medium term. I know that the state government particularly wants to see this new dairy manufacturing based in Gippsland. I say to these people that, if they have a proposal, we will make it happen. We will make it happen in the interests of our community-the dairy farmers in our district and the people who will be employed in it-and also because it is in the interests of the state of Victoria and in the interests of Australia. So the dairy industry has a lot of potential. It is an incredible industry that is thriving and growing. There is a lot of new development and there are a lot of exciting things happening in it, but it still has so much more potential. I want to spend a bit of time talking about the other part of the dairy industry, which we do not tend to see too much of in country districts: the research and development and the science and technology. Too often, that takes place in settings removed from farms and milk processing operations. That is for historical reasons. A lot of this development is linked to big cities and research laboratories, and all sorts of other historical reasons have meant that it is not based where we would like it to be based: in country regions. 12464 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 I would like to see some interest from the federal government in this. I would like to see them work with the dairy industry and try to get some of this research and development and technology and science based in country districts so that people can get the benefit of having those jobs-those high-tech, high-wage jobs-in our communities. I would like to see people spending money in our towns, investing in our local communities, sending their kids to our local schools, and us getting the benefit of their economic and cultural activities in our communities. It is of benefit to them, too. It is not just a one-way street. It is not about us saying, ‘We want them to come here so we can get all this stuff from them.’ They also get the benefit of being at the coalface. They get the benefit of being right next to the farm and right next to the milk processing facility. I would like to see the federal government engage in debate and discussion with the dairy industry to see what can be done to get some of that science and technology and research and development associated with the dairy industry relocated-or developed, if it is new development-to country districts, next to those communities that depend on the dairy industry for their livelihoods. I turn to the Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill 2003 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Dairy) Bill 2003 more particularly. Labor is broadly supportive of these steps, as they are initiated by the dairy industry itself. We want to see a bit more accountability from the government in relation to what has been proposed here. We want to see a little bit more detail. We think it is reasonable to expect accountability in the types of arrangements we are talking about. We think it is reasonable to expect some details in relation to the constitution of the organisation that is likely to manage the affairs of the dairy industry. We think it is reasonable to expect that the minister should have done a little bit of work in relation to the nature of the contractual relationship between the Commonwealth and the authority that is likely to manage these operations. So we say to the government, in general terms: let us work together, let us try to get the best outcome for the dairy industry-let us try to do a good thing for the people in South and West Gippsland and those other parts of Australia that depend on the dairy industry for their livelihoods. But be up-front with us. Give us the detail we are asking for. We are only asking for it because we are interested in making sure that we have the best possible framework and the best possible arrangements for the dairy industry in Australia. A lot of Labor Party members represent areas with a lot of dairy farmers and a lot of people who are employed in the dairy industry. In the chamber today is my friend and colleague Sid Sidebottom, the member for Braddon, who represents a very strong dairying district in Tasmania. Dick Adams, the member for Lyons, represents a lot of dairy farmers in his electorate. Michelle O’Byrne also represents a lot of dairy farmers in her constituency. We have a number of other members who are passionately interested in the future of the dairy industry. We are interested in working with a group of people who in the dairy industry define themselves as people who bend their back and work hard; people who are prepared to engage in common sense rather than ideological discussions; people who are prepared to get an outcome for the communities in which they live. So we are interested too, and we do not want to see an approach from the government that is all about taking a partisan view and not about working with us and accepting the goodwill that we extend to the government and have extended in the past to the government in terms of Thursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12465 the dairy industry. As I mentioned before, individual members on this side of the parliament have been able to work directly with the minister to get good outcomes for the dairy industry in our local constituencies, and we applaud that. We want to see good things delivered for the dairy industry. We want to see some cooperation between the government and us, and of course between the government, the dairy industry and the people involved in the dairy industry. It is my passionate belief that there is much more to come in the dairy industry for Australia. This is one of those few industries genuinely orientated towards global opportunities. It is an export-orientated industry, and a large proportion of the jobs in the dairy industry is linked to Australia’s export performance. As we know, any industry that is not faced towards the world is an industry that invariably will be in decline. In the dairy industry we have been fortunate to have had a number of visionary leaders-a number of people who have been prepared to see the potential for the dairy industry and to strive to achieve it. Those people have orientated some of the big businesses involved in dairy towards world markets. In the opposition we applaud them. We applaud their guts, determination and hard work in making that happen. We know that this is the future for the dairy industry and, because it is the future for the dairy industry, it is the future of places such as West Gippsland, South Gippsland, the electorate of Braddon and other areas that have a large slab of the dairy industry in them. The government must not sit idly by and allow opportunities, in particular for new manufacturing, in the dairy industry to slip through Australia’s fingers. Because it is a global industry in a global marketplace, we do not want to see investment decisions taken by increasingly global dairy corporations result in Australia’s chances of cementing itself as a global leader in the dairy industry slip through our fingers. We want to see companies make decisions to build new factories and new milk processing facilities and to establish new research and development laboratories in Australia. We particularly want to see those new facilities in country districts-places such as West Gippsland and South Gippsland. We want to see those developments in our communities. The only way that is ever going to happen is if we have a federal government that is actively involved and actively engaged with these companies to try to make sure that that development stays in Australia-and, in particular, that it goes to country districts. We in the opposition will work with the government to try to make that happen and we will work with our colleagues and friends in state and territory governments to try to support those types of initiatives. For too long there has been a hands-off approach taken by the federal government in relation to closing these investment deals. We want to see the federal government actively involved. We think the federal government can play a bigger role in making sure that some of this new manufacturing investment-in particular, in the dairy industry-stays in Australia and goes to regional communities where the dairy industry is strong. We do not want to be just the place that supplies the milk. We do not want to just have our efficient farmers. We want to have our efficient farmers, our efficient workers in these milk processing facilities and our efficient scientists, research technicians, technical officers and people based at universities as well. We want to have all of those people in our communities, because that is what the dairy industry is. We contribute enormously to it, and we want to get the maximum benefit from our association with the dairy industry. We are happy enough to support this legislation. We have made some reasonable requests of the government. I hope that, in the spirit of goodwill and bipartisanship, they will accept our requests. 12466 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 form Bill 2003 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Dairy) Bill 2003 I note that it was quite nice for us on this side to hear the member for McMillan’s effusive praise for the federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss. He noted at one stage that he did not always agree with the minister, but in this case he had worked very closely with him. It may or may not surprise the member for McMillan that we on this side do not always agree with our ministers either. But the fact is that the minister has handled this issue very well. Just before coming into the chamber I met with representatives of the peak body of the Australian dairy industry to go through the nuts and bolts of how they are going to set up this new corporation. For example, they will have nine members on the board, three retiring every year. We also put to them that at some stage we would like them to be looking at voluntary levies rather than the compulsory levies that they have. It was very interesting to speak with them. Ninety per cent of South Australia’s dairy industry is actually in my electorate of Barker. I have always taken a pretty keen interest in the dairy industry; in fact, I grew up milking a few cows. Things have changed a lot in the dairy industry. When I was growing up my parents used to milk four cows and do a whole lot of other things. They had a nice little sideline with four cows-making a bit of butter and scalded cream and selling off the milk and the cream. As there were eight kids in the family, we needed a fair bit of milk anyway. The dairy industry has changed, and there is no doubt that there is no place in the world these days for small dairies. Thirty years ago we had dairies of 30 or 40 cows. They no longer exist. Basically, if you do not have 100 cows you will not exist in dairy farming. In fact, very few dairies are under 200 these days. The changes in the dairy industry have seen some huge dairies with up to 2,000 cows. They have the efficiencies of scales of economy and because of their work force they are not always milking cows every day. They often have one weekend off in two. That makes it much better for family life. So we have seen some pretty big changes in the dairy industry. I noted that the member for McMillan was almost accusing the government of letting chances slip through our fingers. I have to say that the dairy industry has not been letting things slip through its fingers. The industry has had the help of the federal government through export development grants and the dairy restructure program. As I said to the representatives whom I spoke with before I came into the chamber, no other industry in Australia’s history has received a restructure package as big and as generous as what we had with the dairy restructuring program, which was something like $1.8 billion. That is a lot of money in anyone’s terms. Many great things happened as a result of that and it certainly gave a lot of dairy farmers the opportunity to expand their own set-up or make their milking stuff a lot more modern-bring in computers, increase herd numbers and become more professional. It also helped add-on industries. I know, for example, at Jervois, just below Murray Bridge in my electorate, I was able to help in obtaining a grant of $660,000 for the whey-processing plant. As many people would know, whey has basically been a by-product that was thrown away. They used to feed it to pigs many years ago, until they decided that was not a good idea for health reasons. They have been able to build a plant that will employ hundreds of people and produce exports worth millions of dollars each year. It is a $30 million development, and the help of $660,000 from DRAP has been an enormous help. I know they were very pleased about the involvement of the federal government in that.",109,Representatives Main Committee
199,Mr Secker (Barker) (10.51 A.m.),"In rising to speak on the Dairy Industry Service ReThursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12467 In the end, I do not believe that, as a government, we should be telling the dairy industry what to do or holding their hands all the way along. They have to stand on their own two feet. We do help them where we can, but this idea that we have to be actively involved at every step of every development and business deal is nonsense. It shows the big difference between the way some of the members opposite think and the way we think. We believe that the industry should be looking after themselves-that we help where we can, but do not hold their hands all the way. I rise today to join the debate on the Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill 2003 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Dairy) Bill 2003, because, as I said, my electorate of Barker is home to quite a few dairy farmers. In fact, dairy farmers in the lower Murray region of my electorate-which I will talk about a little later, because of some of the problems they are facing there-are responsible for producing 25 per cent of South Australia’s milk and provide some of the highest quality cheese-producing milk. I know the member for Braddon has some very important industries of a similar kind on King Island in his electorate. The south-east of my electorate is also home to some of Australia’s top quality dairy farmers and very large dairy farms. These two regions in my electorate certainly have a huge impact on South Australia’s economy. All in all, 90 per cent of South Australia’s milk is produced in the electorate of Barker. Therefore I think it is understandable that I take a pretty close interest in the issues which impact on the dairy industry. Of course, another reason is my own small personal involvement while I was growing up-hand milking cows. I think I could still squeeze a bit of milk out as well as anyone else in this chamber. form the Australian Dairy Corporation, or the ADC, and the Dairy Research and Development Corporation, which I shall refer to as DRDC, and establish one peak body-that is, Dairy Australia Ltd. Dairy Australia Ltd will be responsible for the delivery of research and development promotion services for the dairy industry, as well as for the administration of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Fund. The company, through the conversion processes, will assume all the liabilities and assets of the current Australian Dairy Corporation and will have the assets-including staff I might add, which is very important in this whole changeoverand the liabilities of the DRDC transferred to it. The Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Dairy) Bill 2003 seeks to establish one single levy-the dairy service levy-to replace the three existing levies. We are getting rid of three levies and bringing in one. The three existing levies-the dairy promotion levy, the dairy research levy and the dairy corporation levy-which are currently being paid in the industry will all be brought into one sole levy. The company will, in keeping with its legislation, maintain a register of all members and levy payers-we are talking about something like 18,000 dairy farmers-and will ensure that a periodic poll of all dairy levy payers is undertaken to determine the rate of the levy to be recommended to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and, of course, ultimately the parliament of Australia. I went through a lot of those issues with the representatives before I came into the chamber. The company will receive levy funds, and it will remain accountable for the funds to both levy payers and the parliament.",114,Representatives Main Committee

201,Mr Secker,"That is right. The Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill 2003 seeks to re12468 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 WhatI have just presented to this chamber is an overview of what both pieces of legislation seek to achieve. This is pretty good news for the whole dairy industry-particularly for the dairy industry in my electorate of Barker, but certainly throughout the whole country. It is a very appropriate time for me to be speaking on this bill, because the dairy industry in my electorate of Barker-in the lower Murray in the north and parts of Fleurieu Peninsula, and in the upper, but mostly lower, south-east and south-is going through pretty tough times at the moment. So it is pleasing to see that this legislation introduced by my coalition colleague the Hon. Warren Truss, the minister, seeks to provide this industry with some stability in these troubled times. Dairy farmers in these regions are facing some very serious sustainability project problems and-I have to say this-are having trouble in getting the South Australian Labor government to provide adequate support to help them through this rough patch. The dairy farmers in my electorate cannot win. In South Australia, we have a Labor government that thinks that real South Australia begins at the outskirts of the CBD and stops at the Adelaide Hills. From the exceptional circumstances application debacle to assisting dairy farmers in South Australia, these mostly urban based politicians simply have no-one to stand for, and they simply do not seem to have any concern or respect for what should be a very strong, rural based industry. It is not only a huge employer in regional South Australia, but it is also a big contributor to the South Australian economy. In fact, we even had the Premier launch the 20-year dairy plan in South Australia. It was a visionary document, but I doubt whether he knew or understood what he was doing and what his government is doing now. For example, the Lower Murray flat dairy farmers are worse off. The former state Liberal government identified that approximately $40 million from the state government was needed for a restructuring and rehabilitation scheme to make the industry sustainable. The scheme was designed to assist in reducing the run-off of cow manure, chemicals and fertilisers into the river, thereby improving the environment in the Murray River, which I am sure we all want to see. It was also about improving the efficiency of the dairy industry with such things as laser levelling for their irrigation. Despite the fact that this is essential to maintaining both the environment and the dairy industry in this region, the state Labor government, in its urban wisdom, decided to cut the allocation of funds to this project by $10 million and only offer $30 million. The dairy farmers in the region accept that they need to change their ways and do things better for environmental reasons and for efficiency reasons in their own industry-they had agreed to meet new water use efficiency and environmental targets. They are willing to do what it takes to get the industry and the environment working together but they definitely need help, and they should get help. It is a wish of the general community to improve the environment, so it is only fair that they be asked to contribute quite soundly to it. There has been a policy-certainly in my state-with the rehabilitation areas all along the Murray River that the funding is 40 per cent federal, 40 per cent state and 20 per cent by the farmers. That has been the generally accepted model. But, because of the cost to change the way things are done and the cost to improve the environment, the Labor government has now, in its wisdom, proceeded to further cut the funding for this project from $30 million to $18 million, with only $12 million actually being made available for work on the ground and $6 million worth of bureaucracy and red tape in the departments. This is turning cost shifting into an absolute art form. We are not seeing the work on the ground and the dairy farmers there will actually be Thursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12469 asked to contribute between 50 per cent and 70 per cent of the total cost-and they simply will not be able to afford it. We are talking about a $100 million rural industry which employs nearly 2,000 rural South Australians, and they are offering just $12 million to rectify this situation. In doing so, they are forcing dairy farmers to pick up more than half of the projected cost of the scheme, forcing them to pay approximately $8,000 per hectare with very little return. The farmers were probably willing to pay $2,000 a hectare for virtually no return because they wanted to see a sustainable industry in the long term, but the idea that they can somehow afford $8,000 per hectare is just so far over the top-and they are not getting any benefit from it. These are the same farmers who have suffered through the drought and have had to pay higher feed costs and operational costs because of the drought, and now the Premier of South Australia, Mike Rann, wants them to pay $8,000 a hectare as well and get virtually no return. This move will force a large number of dairy farmers out of the industry on the lower Murray irrigation flats, and that will leave many unemployed and a large hole in South Australia’s economy. This whole shemozzle-what they are trying to force through-is putting at serious risk the milk processing plants at Murray Bridge, the cheese factory and the new multimillion dollar wheyprocessing plant at Jervois that I spoke about earlier. Unfortunately, these people are not getting any support from their local member, the illustrious Peter Lewis MP, whom I have spoken about before in this House, who hopped into bed with the Labor government after the last state election in exchange for the speakership-not a bad job if you can get it. In fact it has been rumoured, and even quoted in the local newspaper, that he called these farmers ‘whingers who should get out of the industry if they could not hack it’. He has now decided he had better go into damage control about that and is now denying he actually said it, but I assure you that the reporters I have dealt with in the local paper there have never made up stories like that. He also said that there would be a definite funding model of 40 per cent federal, 40 per cent state and 20 per cent farming, only to be told by the relevant minister that that is not the case at all. So he not only calls the local dairy farmers whingers but also does not even know what is going on with the funding model. So much for a great local member! Instead, these farmers have been trying to get some satisfaction by holding public rallies and getting federal politicians involved to try to make the state Labor government see the error of its ways. I will certainly be out there trying to resolve this issue. Yesterday I had a meeting with Environment Australia to try to work out whether anything can be done to help these two regions, and before I came in here, as I said, I had a meeting with dairy representatives on this very bill. I am sorry to have spent so long giving background information, but I feel very strongly about this issue. It makes me mad that a bunch of city based so-called leaders can make decisions on issues on which they have absolutely no understanding-issues which affect the livelihoods of hundreds of farmers and countless more workers. It certainly makes me mad and it makes the industry mad. That is why I am happy to be here supporting the pieces of legislation that we are talking about today. This legislation is designed to provide stability and some simplicity to an industry which is suffering at the moment, but which I believe has enormous potential. Having only one peak body looking after this industry will make it easier to administer it and to monitor its progress. It will enable Dairy Australia Ltd to enter into a contract with the Commonwealth so that it can receive the levy payments and be responsible for the 12470 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 expenditure of these levy payments following the establishment of accountability and reporting requirements. This is good news for dairy farmers in my electorate-and we all know that they need some of that. With the stability that these pieces of legislation will provide, I hope that dairy farmers in the Barker electorate can band together and fight the state government’s mind-set. It will not be easy, but it must be done. I commend this bill to the House. (Time expired) setting up a body that will be responsible for marketing-but I do not know what that means because it has no marketing powers whatsoever. SoI think that is just pollywaffle. The second aspect of the bill is research and development. A body is to be set up to monitor research and development. I have not gone into all the minute detail in the bill, but it seems that the government intends that growers themselves will control it. But when governments talk about ‘grower control’, it usually means that (a) they are going to appoint their own flunkeys from the industry or (b) they will choose elected officials, and the elected officials always seem to be part of the government set-up. It is amazing how unreactive these groups are to their membership base. SoI have some suspicions. An electoral college of the various people in the industry seems to me to be the direction in which we should be travelling. Let me return to the issue of marketing. I spent 20 years of my life in the state house-for nearly half that time as a minister and for a little bit more than half of that time as a backbencher. During such a discussion in the state house in Queensland, the head of the department would be sitting here. In that situation the debate is very meaningful because a major decision maker, the head of the department, is present. If he has done the wrong thing then he must sit there and cop the pain. In this place, the head of the department is hiding out in an ivory tower down the road. He is not here at all. In the state house, the minister is also expected to be here so that he can face up to the destructive elements that he has unleashed on an industry such as this. So he will also have to cop the pain. It seems to me that, compared with the state house, what we are doing here is just making a noise in an empty vessel. The people who really matter are not here listening to this, and they will not listen to this. They will be able to hide because of the procedures in this place. So it is very relevant to this debate that no senior departmental officials are here, let alone the head of the department-and the minister is not here either. Turning to the issue of milk, I had the privilege of listening to Professor Rod Jensen, from the University of Queensland, which has, I think, the biggest economics faculty of any university in Australia-certainly one of the most distinguished. He said that there were three great shames in Australian history: the way we treated the original inhabitants, the way we treated our soldiers when they came back from Vietnam, and the way we treated the dairy producers of Australia in the deregulation of their industry. I put a tick on each of those three items and added the Boer War and the fact that Prime Minister Curtin-the most over-hyped politician in Australian history and a national disgrace, in my opinion-would not allow a significant number of Jews into this country during the period of Hitler’s reign in Europe. Six million Jews died in the gas chambers, and we had the generosity to allow 12,000 of them into this country. SoI added those two shames to Professor Jensen’s list, which I think is a fair assessment of the great shames this country has to bear. To demonstrate what it is like in the dairy industry, after the deregulation I was with one of the Queensland state members, Dr John Kingston, and he said, ‘It had a very bad psychologi-",115,Representatives Main Committee
202,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (11.11 A.m.),"The Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill 2003 isThursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12471 cal effect upon me.’ That was also true for me. The next morning I lay in bed staring at the ceiling until about 11 o’clock. I just could not bring myself to face the day. I thought that, because I had failed these people, it was my duty to go out and face the music. Unlike in this place, where we have the minister and all of the officials hiding out in coward’s castle down the road, I felt it was my duty to go out and face the music because I had let these people down. SoI simply got in my car and went. I had to introduce myself to the people; I didn’t know who they were. I went from dairy farm to dairy farm on the Atherton Tableland, where I have 200 or 300 dairy farmers whom I am paid to look after and whom I had let down so badly. I got to about 10 farms that day and at every one of those farms there was no employee at all. There were a husband and wife-the kids had grown up and left-and the husband and wife did the milking themselves; they did all of the work themselves. They had no employees. Most of them were in their late fifties. These people had got up at five o’clock in the morning to do their first milking and finished at half past seven at night. I know that for a fact because I arrived at two of the places after seven o’clock and had to wait until they had finished working. Of course, they have a break during the day. These people are the hardest working people left in Australia today, and what did this government, this parliament, do to them? It took away their right to collectively bargain. We have damaged the right of the worker in this country to collectively bargain-very badly damaged it. I am ashamed to say that I have voted on a number of occasions for legislation which was a lot worse than I thought it would be. and one of the better members of this place, Mr Sid Sidebottom. That was in the reign of Paul Keating. We are talking here about the right of the dairy farmers to collectively bargain and we are purportedly putting a body in place here that is going to have something to do with marketing, which is just garbage pollywaffle-there are no marketing powers in this legislation at all; they have all been removed. The Australian Financial Review said that Mr Keating and Mr Hawke’s reign, which Mr Keating dominated, was highlighted by the fact that they had reduced wages in Australia. The Financial Review thought this was a marvellous thing and what a wonderful government it was because wages were dragged down during this period-because real wages fell. And they did fall significantly. Ironically enough, they have risen under the current government. There is no doubt in my mind as to why wages went down, because I saw it happening on the ground. The workers’ right to collectively bargain was badly hamstrung. That was not a good thing and it is one of the many reasons why I am sitting where I am sitting in the parliament today. Let me return to marketing in the dairy industry, since that is what this legislation is about. The shortcoming of this legislation is that there are no marketing powers, no right to collectively bargain in it. They should be in this legislation because, when the tariffs were taken off us in the sugar industry, the Australian Cane Growers’ Council-the elected body representing cane farmers in this country-said that they would be prepared to give up the benefits of the tariff if, in return, they were not deregulated. The review said that it was harmful to Australia if this industry is deregulated. So we gave up the tariffs. For the sugar that we sold on the Australian market-about 20 per cent of our",118,Representatives Main Committee

204,Mr Katter,"I appreciate the ‘Hear, hear!’ from my colleague, who is much respected12472 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 sugar is sold on the Australian market-we lost $112 tariff protection, and all we have been getting is about $250 or $260 a tonne in the period since. You can see the enormous value of $112 a tonne when all you are left with on the sugar you are selling on the Australian market is $250 a tonne! With the abolition of the tariff, we lost almost a third of the income that we were getting off the Australian market. We did that because we had an agreement out of the government that we would not be reviewed until 2006-and what happened? In the year 2002, not three years later, a memorandum of understanding was signed by the Queensland government and the federal government which said that they would deregulate the industryclauses 8 and 9. That is the way that not only the dairy producers but also other farmers have been treated in this country. You may ask: who won and who lost? Clearly, the sugar farmers lost-and lost big. They have been on about $260 a tonne and they lost $112 a tonne through the tariff removal. So, clearly, they lost big. But who gained? Did the consumers gain? With the loss of this $112 a tonne, which is 11.2c a kilo, did the consumers gain? No, the price in the supermarketssurprise, surprise-went up $100 a tonne. The people in the middle, who are principally Woolworths and Coles-they have about 80 per cent of the food market in Australia-picked up $212 a tonne. Since about 800,000 tonnes goes on the Australian market, they picked up $170 million in extra profits. Each and every year they pick up $170 million over the broken backs of the sugar farmers. Let me turn to eggs. Deregulation occurred on different dates throughout Australia, but I think it is fair to say-most certainly this is the industry claim-that the price farmers were receiving for eggs pre-deregulation was an average of 117c for a dozen eggs. Today farmers receive around 105c for a dozen eggs. So the farmers have had their incomes reduced by 12c a dozen over a 10-year period-and that is not taking into account CPI increases, which have been massive. They have had their incomes reduced by 12c over that period, but did the consumers benefit? No. The retail price for a dozen eggs went from 180c to 293c. So, once again, the people in the middle picked up an extra 115c a dozen. Since there are 240 million dozen eggs sold in Australia, the people in the middle-again, mainly Woolworths and Colespicked up an extra $300 million out of the deregulation of the egg industry. catalogue 6403 tells me that the average price for milk pre-deregulation in Sydney was 115c a litre. It is now 154c a litre. So did deregulation help the consumers? Clearly not; there was an increase of almost 50 per cent to the consumers once the brakes were taken off by the government. In Brisbane, the Queensland price went from 116c to 159c. So we had an average price rise to the poor, long-suffering housewife of 41c a litre. but let me give you the figures for North Queensland. These are the actual Dairy Farmers figures. They wrote a letter to their farmers and said, ‘You’ll no longer be getting 59c. From now on you will be getting 41c.’ That is a drop of nearly 20c-a drop of 30 per cent in their income for fresh milk. In southern New South Wales on the Murray border, the price went from 52c to 35c. In Taree, it went from 47c to 30c. In South Queensland, it went from 55c to 31c. So we had an average fall for the farmers of 19c a litre. One-third of their entire income was",119,Representatives Main Committee

208,Mr Katter,"Let me come to the farmers. Obviously, the prices are all over the place,Thursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12473 taken off them by the governments of New South Wales and Queensland and by this parliament-this parliament that very regrettably played a very sad and sorry part in the deregulation of that industry. The honourable member for Page is with us, and he was one of the people who stridently fought against the deregulation and told this government to stay right out of it. He said that, if those two state governments were determined to destroy their dairy industry, let it be upon their heads. But he was not listened to. The government proceeded down the pathway of facilitating deregulation, though I exclude the Prime Minister from these remarks because I think that he was most certainly heading in the other direction. But the sad fact of the matter is that the parliament of Australia participated in the deregulation of this industry, and the net result has been that the farmers have lost a third of their income-19c-and the consumers are paying an extra 41c. Without the government intervention that would be an extra 60c. All right, there was government intervention for 11c. Thank you, Mr Government. Thank you for the 11c. But there is no thank you for the fact that, once again, the people in the middle are enjoying an increase of near enough to 50c. Nearly 2,000 megalitres-two billion litres-of milk are sold in Australia. So, if the people in the middle took 19c off the farmers and 40c off the consumer-poor old Mrs Housewife-there is an extra 60c for Mr Woolworths and Mr Coles, who have 80 per cent of the food market in Australia. Even allowing for the 11c, they have made an extra profit of $923 million each and every year, over the broken backs of the farmers. Do you think that this government or the governments of Queensland and New South Wales have learned their lesson? No way Jose. At this very moment, a memorandum of understanding has been signed by the Queensland government and the federal government to deregulate the sugar industry. Have they learned their lesson? No way Jose. ‘We only half wrecked the industry last time. We had better go back and complete the job. The fact that we have flagrantly broken the promises and undertakings given to that industry is neither here nor there. We do not care about promises or undertakings. We are the government. We can do what we like.’ This document is very nice, but it is all fairy floss, it is an absolute waste of time and it is a disgrace, because it contains no marketing powers whatsoever. These poor farmers are not allowed to come together collectively, yet two organisations, Woolworths and Coles, are able to take 80 per cent of the Australian food trade-and their share is increasing at the rate of 2.6 per cent each year. In another 10 years, they will have 104 per cent, or something of that nature, of the Australian food market, yet there is nothing that stops them from doing that. We have a duopoly on one side, met by 10,000 or 15,000 dairy farmers on the other. I want to sue the University of Queensland for what they did not teach me about economics, otherwise I would know how the sellers can avoid being utterly destroyed when you have two buyers on one side and 15,000 sellers on the other side. Of course, that is what has happened here. Within two seconds this duopoly manifested itself, and within two years we have this absolutely disgraceful condition. The previous speaker, who comes from South Australia, got up and said that this industry will now be more efficient. He ran the usual economic rationalist line: we will have big producers producing. He said some farmers are milking 2,000 head of cows-and there are about three or four in that category in Australia. That is how he envisages the industry. He has a vi12474 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 sion for his country of a dozen or so dairy producers making a very sizeable income, and having a whole stack of workers who work for nothing-because they have no right to collectively bargain. There were 15,000 proud little Australians who owned their own little blocks of land and did their own thing in their own time. They worked like dogs, but they were happy. They had their own businesses; they had their own farms. But they will be reduced to slave labourers working for very little, I can assure you, and working very hard for the very little that they will be getting. The other aspect of this is that we have opened our doors to the foreigners. They can now bring their milk and dairy products into this country without being assailed in any way, shape or form. You have long life milk now; it can come in by boat. In an effort apparently to terrify us into deregulation, Mr Rowley told us all that we are all going to be destroyed by New Zealand. (Time expired) low. It is also difficult to stick to the bill when you follow the member for Kennedy, but he raises some interesting points. I am keen to speak on this bill. I have limited time because the minister has an urgent meeting, but he is not here yet-which gives me an opportunity to say a few things. Having been the minister for agriculture in New South Wales for a few years, I suppose I should. There is no doubt that I support the Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill 2003. I congratulate the industry on rationalising the levies and putting forward one single corporation which will deal with the marketing and the research in the dairy industry. They are probably falling into line with a lot of other rural industries that have done it before. It is very important, because there is federal government funding for research as long as those industries contribute as well. Obviously, the dairy industry will make sure that they can take full advantage of that. Research and development is very important. No doubt many of our great rural industries have managed to stay at the forefront of marketing around the world because of the research that has been done and the fact that our products are competitive throughout the world markets. Research is very important to make sure that those markets are maintained and that we are at the cutting edge of technology not just in production but in the manufacturing of products. Research into some of the products that come from these agricultural areas is important. There is a lot of research going into many of our agricultural products and what was normally considered to be the product is no longer the product. In fact, when you break it into its constituent parts you can make very interesting pharmaceuticals and other things out of these products, which can get a higher price. Many of our agricultural industries desperately need that niche market, that higher value market, so that they can obtain a better income than they have at the present time. The member for Kennedy is quite right: the dairy industry at the present time is doing it tough. I do not think anyone will deny that. In any deregulation there is always a time when many of the producers in that industry, unless they adjust, will find it very difficult to continue. I dare say only time will tell the full extent of the deregulation of the dairy industry. But there is no doubt that I do agree on one particular point that the member for Kennedy has raised, and that is the lack of power of the producer in the marketplace. I think it is a very serious situation at the present time because effectively there are only two buyers. You have two large supermarket chains, Woolworths and Coles, and it is really a take it or leave it situation: either you accept the price that they offer or you walk away.",120,Representatives Main Committee
209,Mr Causley (Page) (11.31 A.m.),"The member for Kennedy’s is a difficult act to folThursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12475 The thing that worries me most at present is that if the manufacturers-there are several manufacturers in the industry-continue to miss out on these large contracts, sooner or later they will go under and you will have a lessening of competition in that particular field, which will be of no advantage to the producer and no advantage to the consumer that I can see. I have raised with the Prime Minister before today the need to look very closely at the Trade Practices Act. While there are some very strong clauses in the Trade Practices Act, these two powerful players in the field seem to be able to manipulate the process when it comes to the ACCC. I think that the power of that act needs to be strengthened so that the ACCC does have some ability to put pressure on these players. It seems to me that there is an argument for this, when producers come to me and say, ‘This is what we get and this is what you buy it for on the supermarket shelf.’ There is a huge disparity there and you have to say to yourself, ‘Where is it?’ This applies not just to milk but to many agricultural products. If you look at the beef industry and the lamb and mutton industry you can see these disparities that are very hard to explain. We need to look closely at that, because the industry should not be disadvantaged in that way. I know that the government has moved to try to allow collective bargaining. That is a step in the right direction. There is a need for some power in the marketplace for the producers to help them out in that area. I want to comment on a couple of things the honourable member for Braddon raised. He was rather uncharitable about the minister on a couple of occasions-and that is unlike him. He said that the minister had ‘sat back and fiddled while the drought raged’. That is a little unfair because, as the member for Braddon would know, in these instances the states have to move before the Commonwealth can get involved in exceptional circumstances relief. I have had some involvement in this. In my own state of New South Wales-and I can only speak for that state-the state government has been very tardy in coming forward with the recommendations for exceptional circumstances, to the extent that the Commonwealth minister had to pre-empt it and say, ‘We will give an interim exceptional circumstance across the state until we can get some of these through.’ I think that the minister has done all he possibly could in this drought situation. The Premier of New South Wales has been running around the state talking about drought-he has made some 50-odd announcements about drought-but he has not spent anything. The last figure I had was that that state has spent about $15 million on the drought. When I was the minister we spent a lot more than that on drought, I can assure yousomething like $60 million in a drought of similar circumstances. The Commonwealth has put up something like $560 million for New South Wales alone. SoI think it is a little uncharitable to accuse the minister of fiddling while the drought was raging across the country. Mention was also made of the quota systems in the states. It needs to be put on record that one of the problems in New South Wales is the fact that the state government has refused to recognise quotas as property rights. That was a huge kick in the teeth for the dairy farmers, because that was their asset. The banks accepted it as collateral. Then tens of thousands-up to almost $100,000-of the value of their asset was undermined overnight. All of a sudden the banks were saying, ‘We don’t know whether these people are viable because their asset has just been undermined so much.’ It is absolutely disgraceful that the states run away from their responsibilities. They say that they are not governed by the Constitution, which says that you cannot take away a property right without due compensation; they hide and say, ‘No, we’re an independent state,’ and they refuse to accept that if something is traded in the marketplace it is obviously an asset. If a bank accepts it as collateral, it is obviously an asset. The New South 12476 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 Wales government just confiscated that, and that has caused a tremendous amount of trouble for the dairy farmers in New South Wales. I know the minister is busy and needs to sum up, so I will not take any more of his time. I hope to have an opportunity to speak on some of these issues at a later date, because I think it is important that we put on the record some of the issues that I see as being important in this area. thank members who have contributed to this debate for their wide-ranging comments in relation to dairy industry issues and-in the case of certain other members-other extraneous matter. Nonetheless I can understand that when legislation associated with the dairy industry is before the House it provokes considerable interest. It is an important Australian industry that contributes enormously to our national economy and our exports. I noticed that the comments of one honourable member suggested that amongst our industries it has perhaps the greatest potential for boosting exports. Other industries would contest that claim. Nonetheless it is certainly a recognition of the fact that the dairy industry has contributed and will continue to contribute significantly to our nation. It is also an industry that is going through a period of monumental change, and that is certainly having an enormous impact on individual farmers. Especially now, with the impact of lower world prices and drought, the costs and the returns are putting enormous pressure on many individual operators and the dairy industry. The government is certainly conscious of that, and our drought assistance programs are providing enormous assistance to dairy farmers across the nation and helping them through these difficult times. But, ultimately, the only solution is widespread rain and a return to more normal seasonal conditions. Hopefully world prices, which are moving up a little now, will also continue to move up. Those are the best long-term solutions for the industry. But it has been a tough time. There has been substantial change within the industry. Naturally, that has caused substantial hardship and difficulty for those farmers who are making major decisions about their future in the industry. That is the reason the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program was put in place. Communities were also affected, and that is why the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program was put in place. The last round of projects under the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program should be announced within the next few weeks. I think all of those projects have made a real difference to communities in helping to adjust to the changes in relation to dairy deregulation. I notice that there have been all sorts of attempts to make claims that Dairy RAP funding has favoured particular electorates. It would not be surprising if it favoured dairy electorates, because that is what it was intended to do. It was intended to provide funding for those areas that have been most adversely affected by dairy deregulation. Therefore, those areas that have a significant dairy industry that has been particularly adversely affected by deregulation are likely to have received larger amounts of money. That will be especially true in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia-which were the states that were most affectedand areas where there was a greater concentration on the domestic sector, because that is where a lot of the price impacts have been greatest. There has been frequent reference to my electorate as one that has received funding under Dairy RAP. That is perhaps not surprising, because three out of the five shires in Australia",122,Representatives Main Committee
210,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (11.40 p.m.)-IThursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12477 where the impact of dairy deregulation was identified as greatest are in my electorate. The other two are in the electorate of the honourable member for Paterson. I might add that considerable funding was devoted to the electorate of Paterson when it was held by the other side, because it was recognised as a priority area. I am also told that in my electorate 56 per cent of Dairy RAP applications received have been successful. That is precisely the national average. In fact, there have been a large number of applications from the region. Some of them have been very worthwhile projects and have, therefore, been funded. I will also make a couple of comments about drought funding because a number of members have raised it. I have to say that I am amazed that any member opposite could come into the House and seek to defend the performance of the states in relation to drought relief during the current situation. Indeed, I am sure many of them must be embarrassed about the performance of state governments. How could a Victorian member come in here and seek to justify or defend the performance of the Victorian government in slashing drought aid as soon as the election was over? The Victorian government, to its credit, had put in place the best scheme of any of the states. Yet, immediately after the election-in an appalling exercise in cynicismthe measures were axed for those who were worse affected. In states such as New South Wales and Queensland there have been plenty of announcements but very little real money. Indeed, the overwhelming load associated with helping farmers through this drought is, for the first time, being borne by the Commonwealth. Well over $900 million is already committed, and that number is rising. That compares with less than $50 million-if you add up the total promises of all the states-in measures to provide assistance to farmers through the drought. A number of issues have been raised in relation to this legislation. I note the comments from the opposition that they have not yet got access to the proposed constitution of the new company and the memorandum of understanding. I acknowledge that. I do not have a copy of it either; it is in preparation. As the shadow minister indicated in his remarks, that is the way in which these sorts of measures have progressed in the past-the legislation is progressing through the House while the constitution and MOU are being developed, and that has pretty much been standard procedure in relation to these matters. It is our intention, again in common with previous legislation of this nature, to have the draft of those available to the Senate at the time that they are dealing with their inquiry into this legislation. To the best of my knowledge, there are no significant issues but it is reasonable that the House should have access to those sorts of matters in the context of dealing with the legislation, and it is certainly our intention that that would happen. Issues are being resolved with the industry on a day-by-day basis, and I am not aware of there being any matters that are likely to cause substantial controversy in relation to those issues. The House is entitled to a look at those documents, and it is certainly our intention to deliver in that regard. I noticed some of the comments of the honourable member for Kennedy, who has left the chamber. It was the usual exercise of voodoo economics and distortions of history to support assumptions and outcomes that simply have no credibility whatsoever. Many of the statements he made are simply inaccurate and could not be accommodated with any degree of stretching of a fair-minded imagination. But we have become a bit used to that, and so I will not waste the time of the House in giving a line-by-line critique of his comments, particularly those on economic policy. 12478 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 This bill, as members have mentioned, is to deliver a conversion of the Australian Dairy Corporation into a company under the Corporations Act and for all the assets and liabilities of the Dairy Research and Development Corporation to be transferred to this new company. The new company, to be known as Dairy Australia Ltd, will, in effect, merge the R&D and marketing arms of the dairy industry. Dairy Australia is to be a Corporations Act company, limited by guarantee with membership comprising voting members drawn from dairy levy payers, group A members and non-voting members made up of the peak dairy farmer and processing bodies, who are referred to as group B members. Dairy Australia will be responsible for undertaking functions on behalf of the dairy industry similar to those currently undertaken by the ADC and DRDC. Levy moneys collected by the Commonwealth will flow to the new company. Matching Commonwealth R&D contributions for eligible R&D expenditure will also be directed to Dairy Australia. The intention of this privatisation process is to hand responsibility for these services to the new company, which will be accountable to its members. While these levy payments and matching contributions continue, it is appropriate for the government to monitor the expenditure of these moneys. Therefore, the bill provides for a number of mechanisms by which the government will maintain a relationship with the company, including the establishment of a statutory funding agreement between the Commonwealth and the company. The bill provides for the current promotion levy, research levy and corporations levy currently directed to the ADC and the DRDC to be rolled into one levy known as the dairy services levy. The separate Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Dairy) Bill 2003 imposes this new dairy services levy. The advantage of combining the old levies into one is that the industry services body will have greater flexibility in determining its expenditure breakdown but will remain accountable for this expenditure through the statutory funding arrangement. Combining these levies will also facilitate the conduct of future periodic polls of levy payers to determine the rate of the dairy levy. Therefore, farmers will be able to determine for themselves the amount of levy that they believe should be expended on services to the industry and will in broad terms make judgments about the direction of that levy. Dairy Australia will also administer the Dairy Structural Adjustment Fund, currently administered by the ADC. For this reason, the dairy adjustment levy, which applies to all retail sales of milk, will also flow to the industry services body but will be quarantined from other levy amounts. This is because the DAL is to continue to be used exclusively for making payments into the DSAF for the purposes of funding the dairy industry adjustment package and related matters. Importantly, the DSAF is to be administered by the industry services body in the form of a trust. The bill makes no substantial change to the operation of the DSAF from its current administration by the ADC other than that it is to be kept and treated as a trust. The Dairy Industry Service Reform Bill 2003 is the result of a dairy industry and government process aimed at providing the industry with greater ownership and control over dairy industry service arrangements. I would encourage all dairy farmers to examine the benefits of the new arrangements for them and consider becoming active members of Dairy Australia. It will be important for growers to exercise their rights of control over their new company to ensure that it remains close to their needs and aspirations. I commend the bill to the House.

That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its failures in economic management, and in particular its failings in relation to both income and expenditure policies because: (1) It is the highest taxing Government in Australian history, and: (a) has imposed the highest level ever of income tax; (b) is responsible for introducing the biggest new tax in our history; and (c) is addicted to imposing ever more taxes and special levies; (2) it has failed to deliver on its basic responsibilities to the Australian people, for example: (a) bulk billing has collapsed; (b) there is chronic under-investment in our public schools, TAFE colleges and universities; (c) the struggle to balance work and family life continues to get harder; and (d) entry level housing is becoming even less affordable for struggling Australian families; and (3) despite the record tax take, and in spite of declining Government services, the Government has failed to keep the Budget in surplus after nearly a decade of strong economic growth in that (a) it broke its unequivocal promise to keep the Budget in surplus in 2001-02; (b) future surpluses are dependent on the additional revenue provided by bracket creep; (c) it has presided over enormous waste and mismanagement including billions of dollars of foreign exchange losses and defence procurement losses; and",124,Representatives Main Committee
211,Upon Which Mr Mcmullan Moved By Way Of Amendment:,"12480 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 (d) it has lost control over expenditure necessitating wholesale changes to the budgetary management system”. in the House yesterday and indicating my support for the amendment moved by the member for Fraser, I raised the point of the $350 million being appropriated for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as Australia’s contribution to the International Development Association, as well as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. That money was appropriated once before by this parliament in the 2001-02 budget. When legislation is passed in this place one would expect it to be enacted. We have appropriated this money once. Why hasn’t it been spent? When the parliament approved appropriation bills 1 and 2 in 2001, it voted to spend $350 million on the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. It was a commitment this government made; it was a commitment this parliament approved. Yet we find out some time later that the money was never spent. We find out that the government, in contempt of this parliament-which collectively said that this is what it wants to spend the money on-ignored these wishes and that directive and kept the money virtually in its back pocket. Now the government wants the parliament to approve all over again the spending of the money that the government failed to spend the first time around. Senator Conroy, in the estimates process, raised this issue of so-called rephasing and received an answer that indicated that the great deal of money this parliament approved has not been spent on what this parliament wanted it to be spent on. The issue of rephasing has enormous implications. In the fanfare before an election, the government can make an announcement that it will spend X amount of dollars on a particular project. It can even go so far as to indicate it in the budget papers and say, ‘This is more than just a promise. We’ve already paid for it in the budget; the money is right there.’ The government can turn around after the election and quietly rephase the money to next year and then the year after and the year after so that the project announced with grand fanfare before an election finally gets built-if in fact it is built at all-just in time for the next election. It is mean and tricky. That is how this government has been described-by its own party president, no less. This just goes to show that in stark detail. This is the highest taxing government in Australian history. There are record levels of money pouring into this government’s coffers not just from the GST but from income tax, the Ansett levy, the sugar levy, the milk levy, the Timor levy and any number of other hidden taxes and charges. Since this government came to office in 1996, the household tax bill of Australian citizens has increased by an average of $7,856-a staggering amount for a government that is supposed to believe in cutting taxes. Just four of the government’s new taxes-the dairy tax, the sugar tax, the wharf tax and the Ansett ticket tax-will raise over $365 million this financial year. Each and every household in this country is now paying almost $8,000 per year more in tax than it did under Labor. At the same time we are seeing huge cuts in the services that governments provide. Bulkbilling has collapsed; it is only areas in Western Sydney electorates like Greenway that hold the national figures up to some extent. Without the support of doctors in Western Sydney, bulk-billing figures would be diabolical rather than merely disastrous. The University of Western Sydney has seen cut after cut in government funding since 1996. The enrolment",127,Representatives Main Committee
212,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (11.53 A.m.),"When I was speaking on the appropriationsThursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12481 benchmark adjustment scheme, which even the government could not continue to justify, saw millions of dollars taken from public schools. The government refused to pay its share of the wage increase to community workers in New South Wales-the first wage rise in 10 years for these hard working and vital members of our community-thus leaving many community based social programs in jeopardy. Just one example was in Riverstone in my electorate, where the highly successful breakfast program for disadvantaged young people, run by the Riverstone Neighbourhood Centre, had to be dropped because the funds ran out. One has to really wonder how the government has managed it. There are record levels of tax income, record cuts in spending and a budget that is still $3 billion in the red. Talk about economic mismanagement. There have been failed and costly outsourcing programs such as the whole of the government information technology outsourcing initiative debacle presided over by the former finance minister John Fahey. That has proved beyond doubt that the public sector can be just as efficient as the private sector, if not more efficient, in delivering services. Damned by the Australian National Audit Office on more than one occasion as well as by their own government appointed inquiry conducted by Richard Humphry, these reports show that millions of taxpayers’ dollars have been flushed down the drain. At the same time as this massive waste of money on outsourcing, the pork-barrelling has grown significantly under this government. One needs only to look at the distribution of money in the Roads to Recovery program or the Natural Heritage Trust grants to see how tasty the pork is in some electorates. The allocation of funds under the Natural Heritage Trust is a particularly damning example of pork-barrelling. For example, in Western Sydney there are seven Labor electorates: Greenway, Reid, Prospect, Fowler, Blaxland, Chifley and Werriwa. The total funding allocated to all seven electorates combined over the six years of the program is $337,696. This is barely half the average allocated for electorates in the five Liberal held seats in our region-Macquarie, Lindsay, Mitchell, Macarthur and Parramatta-which received $3,364,432 over the past six years. Five Liberal seats received 10 times the amount of money that the seven Labor seats got. And, of course, that is just in Western Sydney. I do not have time to talk about the $135 million that the top four electorates-all government electoratesgot. There are also ridiculously expensive advertising campaign programs, like the ‘Unchain my heart’ fiasco, and more recently the fridge magnets for salvation-the terror kit that dished out such advice as ‘If a bomb explodes, protect yourself from falling debris’ and ‘If you receive a suspicious package, don’t open it.’ If people followed that advice they would not have opened the terror kit in the first place. The government spent $20 million on getting that piece of advice out to people-reminiscent of the duck and cover stupidity of the 1950s. This government has no clue-none whatsoever. Higher taxation, bigger cuts in services and a deficit-work that one out. There was some $23 million in these appropriations for the Department of Health and Ageing going towards the meningococcal immunisation program-a very important program. This is indeed a good cause, but it does highlight the problems within the department that the government is not facing up to. I am of course talking about the collapse of bulk-billing and the government’s attempts to destroy by neglect the Medicare system. The government is doing this quite successfully, with over 7.7 million fewer GP visits being bulk-billed this year 12482 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 than in 1996-97. If you translate that into the direct cost to the family budget, you can see what a massive financial burden this government has placed on Australian households. The Prime Minister has hated Medicare since before it was born on 1 February 1984. On 24 May 1983, the member for Bennelong rose in this place and said: The Government will waste $400m of taxpayers’ money next year through the needless introduction of the new Medicare arrangements. This Prime Minister believes that Medicare is a needless waste and should never have been introduced in the first place; he says so himself. On 21 August 1986 he promised to abolish bulk-billing. When outlining his party policies for the future government, he said: ... we will allow individual Australians to opt out of Medicare; that is, not pay the levy provided they take out private insurance. Secondly, bulk billing will be abolished except for such people as pensioners who really need it. He backed that up on 20 November the same year when he said: We want no more money wasted on things that are not worth the support that this present Government is giving. We want an end to the enormous waste that is involved in Medicare. We want an end to the waste that is involved in bulk billing. There you have it, from the Prime Minister’s own mouth. He thinks Medicare, particularly bulk-billing, is a needless waste of money and unworthy of the government’s support. I would suggest that a leopard does not change its spots. Of course, he cannot just shut down Medicare-the people will not stand for it-so he simply lets it run down. He ignores it in the hope that it will go away. The Prime Minister believes that, at best, Medicare should be a secondary safety net only for pensioners and the poor-and that is at best. If he had his way it would never have been introduced at all. Since this government came to office in 1996, there has been a marked fall in bulk-billing numbers. As I have said, in my electorate of Greenway we have a fairly high number of doctors who are still bulk-billing-94.9 per cent. While this is very good, the figure is down from 95.6 per cent two years. But we as members in this place must look beyond our own boundaries to see the bigger picture. While Greenway is a bright spot, the rest of the picture is looking pretty grim. I wonder if the member for Indi is proud of the bulk-billing rate in her electorate, which now stands at a paltry 30.9 per cent-the lowest in the country. She supports the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister wants to see the end of bulk-billing. I wonder if she is proud of the low rate of bulk-billing in her electorate. The member for Sturt has seen an 11 per cent decline in bulk-billing in his electorate, from about 70 per cent to below 60 per cent, in the last two years. The member for Ryan has seen a 14 per cent drop in bulk-billing in his electorate since coming to office a little over 12 months ago. Rates in Ryan are now set at 54 per cent. Electorate after electorate has experienced massive falls in bulk-billing rates as a direct result of the neglect of the system by this government. Rates for bulk-billing in my electorate are good, but there is also a concerning trend in the cost for GPs who do not bulk-bill. In Greenway, the average out-of-pocket cost for people seeking a general practitioner who does not bulk-bill has risen over the past two years by a massive 27 per cent and now stands at $16.89. This is the difference between what the doctor who does not bulk-bill charges and Thursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12483 what the patient gets back from Medicare. The charge of $16.89 represents the 11th highest cost in Australia, which is extremely worrying. You have to remember that the Medicare rebate is $25.05. Add that to the average out-of-pocket cost and you get the figure of $41.94. That is what it costs somebody in my electorate to go to a doctor who does not bulk-bill. That is what they have to hand over at the counter at the doctor’s surgery. A lot of people in Greenway cannot afford $42 every time they need a doctor. Even if they are going to get a touch over $25 back, it is still a huge up-front payment for a family budget. Again, all across the country, in electorate after electorate, the figures for out-of-pocket costs have risen over the past two years. They are up by 30 per cent in Cowper, 31 per cent in Gilmore, 20 per cent in Lindsay, 21.4 per cent in Parramatta and 19.5 per cent in Mitchell. These price rises are far in excess of the CPI increases. When you couple them with falling bulkbilling numbers, you realise the ordinary, average Australian family is now paying out substantially more for medical treatment than it did under Labor. There is a direct connection between the falling bulk-billing numbers and the increased strain on emergency wards in our state hospitals. For somebody who cannot find a doctor who bulk-bills and cannot afford the $42 up-front charge, the emergency ward at the local hospital is the next best thing. This increases the strain on our hospitals, which are underfunded by this government to begin with. But then of course it becomes a state government problem, according to the Howard government, and the buck is passed. It is undeniable that one of the reasons that state governments are struggling with hospital budgets and increased demand for casualty department services is the decline of bulk-billing and the lack of support for Medicare by the Howard government. What is this government doing about it? Nothing except making noises about destroying bulk-billing further and speeding up the decline by allowing Medicare to be gutted from within. The core of Medicare is universality: everybody pays and everybody benefits. It is a universal system. When you take away the benefits from one group-that is, anybody who is not a pensioner-you take away the initiative, the incentive and the reasons for others to pay. In other words, you create a two-tier system where Medicare is a safety net and, if you do not have the money, you do not get the proper medical treatment. To support those few statements, I will refer to an article in the Australian this morning by Neal Blewett, who was the health minister in the Hawke Labor government in 1983 and 1987. He was brought into this debate when the Prime Minister referred to him yesterday at question time. In an article, under an editorial introduction of, ‘No, Prime Minister, Medicare was always meant to be universal,’ Neal Blewett writes: Australians, regardless of income. It has also meant that any doctor could bulk-bill any patient – again, regardless of income – at any time. But because of the constitutional provision forbidding the civil conscription of doctors, the Hawke government, which introduced Medicare 20 years ago, could not compel doctors to bulk-bill. We did, however, provide incentives to encourage doctors to bulk-bill. And we regarded it as an achievement that by the time the Labor government fell in 1996, more than 80 per cent of all GP services were bulk-billed. He also says: 12484 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 The Howard Government has already partly achieved a reduction in bulk-billing by allowing the Medicare rebate to fall behind rises in the cost of medical practice. There is no doubt about it: this government stands condemned for the services that it is taking away from the Australian people. It is totally unacceptable, and no amount of misdirection or spin will cover the facts. The Australian people do not want a war, and they certainly do not want it to be funded at the expense of our schools, our hospitals and our Medicare. Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (12.11 p.m.)-I too rise to participate in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. Woolworths is one of Australia’s largest retailers of food, liquor and groceries, and food is its core business. On Monday this week, 3 March 2003, the Australian newspaper published on page 21 an extract from a new book by Robert Gottliebsen, 10 Best and 10 Worst Decisions of Australian CEOs. The article was called ‘Fresh thinking pays off’. Gottliebsen talked in part about Woolworths’s extraordinary financial performance-the fact that in 1996 Woolworths was valued at some $3 billion but by 2002 its market capitalisation had been multiplied by at least a factor of five and it now has a market capitalisation of some $14 billion. This sounds fantastic, and the new CEO, Mr Richard Corbett, was being roundly congratulated. But I have considerable concerns about the impacts of the pricing policies that have delivered such an extraordinary result for Woolworths customers and shareholders. The article states: In a brief, but breathtaking display of market power, Woolies reworked the entire dairy industry in a matter of months by merely conducting a tender for its house-brand milk. It wasn’t a deliberate bid to cripple a $2 billion industry, but the drastic economies imposed on dairy farmers and processors were consequences of the predictable behaviour of two powerful duopolists (Coles joined Woolworths) driven by competition to provide low prices to customers and also to pay maximum dividends to their shareholders. Woolies took $500 million out of the pockets of its suppliers, the milk processors and farmers. It passed some on to its customers and pocketed the rest for its shareholders. For Corbett, milk is a copybook implementation of his original plan, and the share market has cheered him on. He plans to repeat it in other areas. In that same newspaper, the Australian, on the same day-Monday, 3 March-there was another article, this time on page 11, which featured the dairy industry. The headline was ‘Plan to drain swamp too costly, say dairy farmers’. Remember, we have just been talking about $500 million being taken out of the dairy farmers’ pockets as they supplied Woolworths. The article, written by Thea Williams, said: Dairy farmers are digging in their heels against the cost of rehabilitating flood-irrigated land in the lower Murray swamp region, 18 months after appearing to accept they had to do something about it. Irrigators are now saying the cost burden of reducing the run-off of cow manure and fertiliser into the river is too great and might put them out of business. Lower Murray Irrigation Advisory Board general manager Terry Lee ... warned yesterday that the South Australian dairy industry would be damaged and 1300 farmers put at risk because of the cost. “We do have to improve the environment, there is no doubt about it. There are problems there, but it can’t be at the cost of our industry,” he said. So here we have a respected newspaper, the Australian, with two separate articles on the same date, one applauding the behaviour of Woolworths-the power of the concentrated ownership Thursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12485 and the impact of that on the suppliers-and the other spelling out for everybody to see the impact on farmers not being able to afford to do remedial environmental action. In an article of 8 February, in this case in the Weekend Australian, Robert Gottliebsen again made a comment on Australia’s giant retailers, Woolworths and Coles. He said: ... Woolworths and Coles, have the power to deliver enormous profits in the next few years-and change the face of the local food and beverage industry. It will be hard for food and beverage companies to survive. Many are destined to become part of international groups. Further on in the article, he said: Woolworths’ food strategy is to lock suppliers into one-year price contracts that give them volume. If costs rise during the year because of, say, a drought, then too bad. Some suppliers are close to going to the wall. And when the contract ends, if the supplier can’t match the competition, then it’s off the shelves-which destroys the business. Of course, I am most concerned about this because my electorate is the food bowl of Australia, but I am also concerned about it for its environmental impacts. On the one hand we have an extraordinary transfer of dollars out of the pockets of the suppliers-who are the farmersto consumers, who enjoy the cheapest and best food access in the world. We have shareholders also benefiting. However, at the same time our state of the environment report for Australia paints a picture of this continent under extreme natural resource pressure-extreme stress. Urgent remedial action is needed, whether it is reducing high saline water tables through revegetating vast areas of our continent, reducing the nutrient loads in streams by reducing run-off from farms-animal manures, fertilisers or other substances-or addressing the loss of our biodiversity through managing vegetation better, fencing areas and destroying feral pest animals and weeds. All of this requires significant investment. That investment typically falls onto the backs of private land owners. Seventy per cent of the Australian continent is in private hands, whether they be black or white hands. We expect the land managers to do this remediation work. Indeed, some of us say, ‘Of course, it should be the land manager who foots the bill for this work because, after all, it was typically them or their ancestors who set about farming in inappropriate ways 200 or so years ago.’ I have a different spin on that, perhaps because I am a sixth generation farmer myself and the member for Murray. My spin is that, for a population or a community that rejoices in some of the cheapest and best food in the world, there has to be a change of attitude, based on the understanding that cheap food does come at an enormous price. It comes at the cost of the primary producer, the supplier, not being able to do the environmental remediation that is required. The dairy farmers at the mouth of the Murray understood only too well that they had to stop some of that nutrient loss into the lower Murray area. The General Manager of the Lower Murray Irrigation Advisory Board, Terry Lee, knew exactly what the problem was and what his irrigators had to do about it, but he puts it quite simply on the table that his dairy farmers cannot afford to do the job. For example, Bonlac, one of the largest dairy companies in Australia, had a 43 per cent drop in profits in this last year. A lot of it has to do with drought-in other words, their reduction in supply-but a lot of their profit margin also dropped as international and domestic wholesale prices crashed. We have to be smarter in this country in understanding the impact of concentrated buying power in our retail sectors. We must not simply 12486 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 applaud when a pricing strategy transfers income out of the pockets of those who have so much demanded of them and into the pockets of shareholders and customers who, if asked, would probably be concerned about the consequences of that transfer of wealth. I do not think for a minute that Australians sufficiently understand what is at stake. As we speak, we are looking at a loss of vegetation-the death of red gums-along some 3,000 kilometres of Murray River, from Euston to the sea. We are looking at the death of the red gums along 1,500 kilometres on each side of the river bank and of all the red gums in that sector. The drought has been the final cause, but it is really the result of those red gums not getting the environmental flow-or the flooding-that species requires every couple of years. We have known about the needs of red gum forests for environmental flow for at least a generation. At last, something has been done about the Barmah Forest in my electorate but, unfortunately, in the case of these 3,000 kilometres of red gums from Euston to the sea, it is probably too late. We will also lose hundreds of kilometres of red gums from the bottom of the Darling River system. We have blue-green algal blooms that are poisoning our water supplies all along the Murray and Darling system. We know what is causing all of that. The federal government is trying to put taxpayers’ dollars back into the system through the national salinity action plan and the Natural Heritage Trust mark 2. Our federal government has put more taxpayer dollars into environmental remediation than any other Australian government since federation. We are trying very hard to educate the public about the need for every individual to take action. But, when we have this concentration of buying power in a sector such as retail grocery-especially the food and beverage lines-it is almost as if the right hand is undoing what the left is trying to do. We have to be very serious about how we can bring about ethical shareholder contributions to the pricing policies and supply strategies of our companies. We also have to look at better ways for taxpayers’ dollars to be regularly put back into the pockets of those who do the land management in this country. We are going to have to be more committed to programs like the ecosystem or environmental services rendering on farms. I have talked about environmental services like the Bushcare tender in this Main Committee room before. That acknowledges that farmers do not just grow food and fibre, but they also need to sustainably manage parts of their property which might have very important environmental values. This management could be for biodiversity protection, or revegetation for salinity prevention or soil protection. We need to acknowledge that they have to be paid and compensated for not trying to produce food or fibre on every part of their property. So that they can look after the country on behalf of all of us, money needs to be transferred from the public sector into their private pockets as compensation for the income forgone from cash crops or livestock. Australia, as the oldest and driest continent, is vulnerable. The nutrients of the soil are easily washed away. We already have lost so much of the soil nutrition in our country because of the vegetation loss, our farm practice and the impacts of feral animals like rabbits, with the depredation of species like feral cats compounding the problems for some of our smaller native animals. We are coming to a stage in our life as a nation where we have to understand that you cannot simply ignore what is going on in every part of the value chain. If you are going to squeeze farmers so hard with price they are going to spend less on the farm or leave the industry. They are not going to be able to invest in the remediation works that need to be done. Thursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12487 A sustainable environment depends on the existence of economic and social systems which sustain institutions and a culture that delivers a life worth living to the land managers. Not only are so many of the suppliers to Coles and Woolworths being squeezed so hard that they are impoverished and cannot continue to supply, but many are now also facing a life they do not feel is worth living. Their sons and daughters are choosing not to continue to be suppliers and are leaving the farms. The social system needs to deliver generations of motivated, skilled and committed people who can appropriately manage the land for the lifetime it will take for its recovery. The regions with the most degraded natural capital are the places with the least sustainable communities. As the young leave, the local economy shrinks and the community infrastructure deteriorates or is withdrawn. Calling out a greater voluntary or corroborative effort in these circumstances is simply not effective. This is not to dismiss the extraordinary efforts of the volunteer Landcare and other groups trying to protect land and habitat. However, anyone working with Landcare groups, as I know many in this room are, will know that they report their burnout and their frustration at having too few hands to do the work. We can give grants to Landcare groups for fence posts, seedlings and wire-all of which are essential for the survival of the groups-but we have to understand that it is just as essential to give funds for their facilitators, their coordinators or their secretaries so that they are paid an acceptable salary over a reasonable period of time. Certainly our NHT mark 2 and our national salinity action plan acknowledge that community facilitation and coordination are as important as the wire, the trees and the seeds collected in order to make sure that we do have a sustainable future. Addressing unsustainable social systems in regional Australia requires specifically designed programs or adjustments to universal approaches to compensate for the rurality impacts. Some of those impacts are: declining school retention rates; poorer levels of access, participation and completion rates in higher education; poorer health; higher suicide rates; more teenage pregnancies and lower socioeconomic status compared with the total population. If you compound those rurality impacts in areas where farmers face increasingly lower prices and higher costs, you will understand the absurdity of expecting those same people to be delivering a sustainable natural resource future for all of us. I am calling upon companies like Woolworths and Coles to think very seriously about the long-term impacts of two-year tenders for prices for suppliers and one-year price contracts. Think about how you would exist on a one-year price contract if you were a tomato grower. It takes 18 months to prepare a crop from initial land preparation to picking the final product. That means that you are constantly living on a knife edge in terms of your ability to do the additional work that we know the landscape requires. I do not think I would be proud if I were Richard Corbett announcing $500 million going out of the pockets of suppliers and into the pockets of consumers and shareholders. Instead, I would be looking very seriously at the state of environmental degradation in this country. I would be saying to my shareholders, ‘We can produce profits because of the buying power we have; the suppliers are simply price takers. But we are also an ethical company and we want to ensure that the quality of our food is delivered to you in the long term. We are going to take an ethical approach in the future, so we will take on board the full cost of the production for our suppliers, and that will include the price of a sustainable environmental system for all of us.’ within government appropriations. This Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 seeks an addi-",128,Representatives Main Committee
213,Mr Swan (Lilley) (12.27 P.m.),"I rise to speak about an important matter that falls12488 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 tional $94 million in expenditure for the Department of Health and Ageing, so I think it is appropriate to reflect on one of the areas within the department’s scope: health education and awareness. In particular, I want to focus on the activities of Cancer Council Australia, an organisation which receives assistance from both the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing and other sources. In fact, the organisation’s total budget is some $68 million per year. My interest in the activities of the Cancer Council stems directly from my successful fight against prostate cancer just prior to the last federal election and from my participation in education campaigns run by the Australian Prostate Cancer Collaboration in August last year. WhatI have learned from my personal experience is that what I do tomorrow is always much more important than what I did yesterday. The experience not only makes you value your family more, but it also underscores the importance of making a difference in the lives of people. That is why I was so disturbed by the comments about prostate cancer made by Cancer Council head Professor Alan Coates in early February. That is why on 23 FebruaryI called for his resignation. I did this because Professor Coates’s public airing of his personal views about this terrible disease put him directly in conflict with his public duty as head of a partly government-funded organisation dedicated to early detection and prevention strategies. To put it most simply, Professor Coates does not believe that men should actively monitor their health to determine whether they may have prostate cancer. He argues that, if it were found that he had the disease, he would take no action. He says he believes in choice, but his behaviour is designed to limit the choices available to Australian men. Naturally, I do not agree with this view. After my call for him to step down, he called me and we had a discussion. On the basis of our discussion, I took some heart because I had believed that Professor Coates and I had reached an understanding that there was some common ground between us on this important issue and that we could work together promoting knowledge and awareness about it. It seems that I was wrong. I was disappointed to watch the ABC’s 7.30 Report last Thursday and see Professor Coates again repeat his original views-views that I regard as detrimental to the health of Australian men and the wider cause of early detection and prevention of cancer and as incompatible with his public role as the head of the Cancer Council of Australia. For all cancers, early detection is the best protection, but now on two occasions Professor Coates has said that he does not want to know if he has the disease. It is completely inappropriate for Professor Coates, as head of the peak organisation in the country, to give his personal views. To the ears of those who do not follow the literature, those views mean that testing is not necessary. On the 7.30 Report last Thursday he said: I decided that personally I will not be tested and I’ve held that decision for over 10 years, and I believe for me that’s the right decision. For Professor Coates ignorance is bliss. That is fine for him-a healthy, elderly, well educated gentleman with lots of knowledge. Sadly for others, many of whom are much younger than he, ignorance is death. Many men are poorly informed about prostate cancer. That is certainly the case until their diagnosis, and then it is often too late for them to learn that early detection is the best hope of cure. The trouble is that the public are entitled to believe that his personal views, when expressed as the head of the Cancer Council, are backed by the weight of medical evidence. But Professor Coates’s views are not backed by the weight of medical Thursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12489 evidence. His views are a bit like those of Mark Twain. Mark Twain was a lifelong cigar smoker, who would not take medicine and who absolutely loathed exercise. Twain once said: I have achieved my seventy years in the usual way: by sticking strictly to a scheme of life which would kill anybody else. As someone who deals daily with the fears and apprehensions of prostate cancer sufferers and their families, this public policy vandalism from Professor Coates must be exposed for what it is: contempt for men and their families for telling them not to seek the information that they require to preserve their lives and that of their families. His prejudices have caused great anger. A letter I received this week states: Like you I am absolutely appalled at the views on prostate cancer by Prof Alan Coates ... My brother ... had died of the disease aged 63 and from then on my GP checked me out every year until I was diagnosed with it at 62. He then had surgery. It continues: At 78 I am fit and well and am sure that I owe my life to the early diagnosis. These are the views of the medical profession; it is the overwhelming weight of medical evidence. The following are comments on the issue from some eminent doctors in the field. Phillip Stricker, Director of Urological Oncology at Sydney’s St Vincent’s Hospital, says: The anger in my practice alone is unbelievable, and I think Coates may find that support for the Cancer Council will drop ... He went on to say: His underlying message that men shouldn’t be tested could result in the death of many young men, particularly those at high risk, who were considering being tested but are now considering not being tested. As head of the Cancer Council, he should give a balanced view of a complex issue. If he fails to meet the responsibilities of his position, many men will ... die. Anthony Costello, Professor and Director of Urology at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, says that Coates is ‘preaching a very old dogma and that the debate has moved on’. He says that Coates is relying on epidemiology, which is not an exact science, and that there is now enough clinical evidence to show that diagnosing prostate cancer early through PSA testing does save lives. I am the first to acknowledge that there is a debate about the effectiveness of the PSA test, which is used to determine the existence of prostate cancer. However, the larger public health point is that there is also an appalling level of knowledge in our community about the incidence and impact of this disease. It is true that many men do not know or do not want to know-40 per cent of men are afraid or embarrassed to be tested; 31 per cent of men lack awareness and education to allow them to make an informed decision about whether to be tested or not. Professor Coates has stepped out wearing his public health hat and fired off the wrong message-his own personal message-to Australian men. He should have been encouraging these groups who are reluctant to come forward and to take control of their health and ensure they are properly informed. His personal views are built on a judgment about the evidence. Why then would he advise men not to gain a similar level of understanding about the disease before deciding whether to undergo tests? Coates tried to justify his torpedo by arguing that 12490 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 men are better off not knowing. What absolute arrogance! Just consider these two facts. An Australian man of 50 whose father died of prostate cancer faces an extremely high risk and probable death if undiagnosed and untreated. While men diagnosed with prostate cancer who are over 70 are unlikely to die from the disease, men aged between 50 and 70 will almost certainly die from the disease if it goes undetected. So why would anyone, given those acknowledged facts-on which there is complete agreement-possibly argue that they would not be tested for detection? The figures are stark. Every year in Australia around 10,000 new cases are diagnosed and, more importantly, over 2,500 men die from it. Australian men face a one in 10 chance of being diagnosed with the disease. A similar number of women die from breast cancer, tragically, each year. There is no doubt that a handful-and I emphasise, handful-of experts share Professor Coates’s view that early prostate testing is not worth the effort, although I am unsure whether anyone would publicly advise men not to seek more information about the disease and the treatments available from their doctor. There is, however, complete agreement among specialists that prostate cancer can be cured if it is treated while it is wholly confined within the prostate. There is also agreement that, once the disease spreads beyond the prostate, it is very hard for there to be a cure. Death from prostate cancer is almost always very slow and very painful-I have seen it with my own father. It is these facts that often result in diagnosed men making the decision to seek treatment, as, indeed, I did in August the year before last. I want to run briefly through the most common arguments used to support the case for not getting tested for prostate cancer. Firstly, many people hold the view that more men die with prostate cancer than from it. That is completely untrue; it lacks any scientific validity. Men are now living longer, giving the cancer more time to spread beyond the prostate. More men are now diagnosed much younger-even into their 40s-and prostate cancer tends to be more aggressive in younger men. Secondly, the view that you should wait for symptoms to appear before seeking advice is also unhelpful, when the earlier it is detected the better the prognosis. This is particularly the case for men aged between 50 and 70 or aged 40 and over if there is a history of the disease in the family. Thirdly, many argue that tests for prostate cancer give false results. This is simply incorrect. There are two tests: the PSA blood test and the digital rectal examination. Both can alert a doctor to the possibility of prostate problems, but neither can be conclusive. High PSA readings are an indicator that there is a problem, as is the presence of a hardening on the surface of the prostate. It is true that this will not always mean that a person has prostate cancer and it is equally true that a small number of cases will remain undetected due to the fact that they do not produce PSA readings. However, the testing methods are an effective early warning of the disease. Those who run down the efficacy of the tests available also argue that having a biopsy is unnecessarily invasive. The fact is that it represents an effective and accepted procedure for confirming the indications raised by PSA and DRE testing. A further argument-and one that has been emphasised by Professor Coates-is that there are horrible side effects to treatment for prostate cancer. Coates and his fellow advisers to government stress the negative aspects of treatment for prostate cancer-incontinence, impotence-as harms, using those to justify their view that men should not be tested. Why then is he a passionate advocate of breast cancer screening? It has the same consequences in women. It is simply not logical for him to argue this way in this case. Thursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12491 While arguing that the side effects of successful prostate treatment are harms, Coates and his fellow advocates say nothing of the extended suffering of those undergoing treatment for advanced prostate or even breast cancer-not to mention the agonising death that results from a failure to treat early. The final arguments run by those like Professor Coates who do not believe people should be tested are that, if the disease is detected, there is no way of knowing whether it needs to be treated and, if treated, whether it will increase someone’s life chances. That simply runs in direct conflict with much of the evidence. Of course there are no certainties with any form of cancer diagnosis. People should be able to avail themselves of the best possible advice based on the testing they have received. It is critical that men be given the opportunity to make a decision about their health with the best possible information that is available. This will become even more important in the next five years as improved diagnostic tests become available and as treatments become rapidly more effective. Now is the time to lay the education foundation. There are side effects in some cases to treatment and this has to be considered. But it can only be considered properly with all the available information. I believe that any public advocate for the prevention of cancer has a duty to argue for informed choice. In fact, I believe this is central to the Cancer Council’s role in our society. It is for this reason that Professor Coates, who sits at the apex of the bodies that spend every day in the fight against cancer, has seriously abused his role. His repeated claim in the press, on radio and the 7.30 Report that he is in favour of public awareness is dubious. He was responsible for the Prostate Cancer Foundation’s $1.5 million awareness program being cancelled when he threatened the Cancer Council would put out a counter message if they went ahead with their program. He and the Department for Health and Ageing argued so strenuously against any awareness program that the sponsor withdrew. This brings me to the Commonwealth’s part in all of this. The fact is that the Commonwealth government has taken no steps to caution, counsel or condemn Professor Coates. Some action is clearly required given that Professor Coates continues to express his personal view in his role as the head of the Cancer Council, and as yet Minister Patterson has not acted. Mark Twain died in 1910, and 93 years on so too should his head in the sand approach. Australian men cannot afford to be complacent about their health. We should not tolerate people like Professor Coates who hold public positions airing private views that directly undermine the cause for which they are engaged. He should resign and, if he refuses to resign, the government should demonstrate its commitment to the battle against cancer by publicly repudiating his views. He talks about choice but says, as the head of the Cancer Council, the peak body in this country, ‘Don’t bother to inform yourself. I am not going to bother to inform myself.’ If an educated man like that, presumably as knowledgeable as that, says, ‘Don’t inform yourself,’ what sort of message does that send to people in the street? It sends a dreadful message. His decade-old prejudice comes through the personal perspective of an older man and someone who has the luxury of dying in his later years. That is not a choice young men can or should ever contemplate. If they listen to Professor Coates, his choice for many is a death sentence. Debate (on motion by Mr Danby) adjourned. Motion (by Mrs Elson) proposed: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. 12492 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 South Sydney Youth Services Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (12.44 p.m.)-Last FridayI was very privileged to meet a very special group of young people at South Sydney Youth Services. They have done something very brave and very important: they have reached out for help and they have taken charge of their own lives. Last Friday Jane, Matt, Sebastian, Lima, Cornet, Lisa, Vincent, Ben, Alex, Stephen, Tanya, Andrew and Liliana told me just how much the help that they had been given by South Sydney Youth Services had meant to their lives. They told me that with the help of youth workers and their peers at South Sydney they had been able to quit drugs, get help with finding housing and other issues, return to study and even find work. The program that I was invited to see was one set up to help young people with what is called a dual diagnosis-that means an addiction to drugs and also a mental illness. The young people who spoke to me told me that they had approached mental health services but those services were not able to cope with the drug addiction. When they then turned to drug and alcohol services those services were not sure how to treat their mental illnesses. They had slipped through a gap in the provision of services. I met South Sydney Council’s young citizen of the year, Jane, who was one of the original participants in this program and who is now working at South Sydney Youth Services and helping other young people. She told me that at one stage she had been so depressed that she did not want to walk out of her front door. She has now been recognised by South Sydney Council as a leader in her community and she is helping other young people overcome mental illness and drug abuse. I also met Lima, who performed two songs for me. The songs were written by Lima himself. The songs are better than almost anything I have heard on the radio lately. This young man is an incredibly talented musician who sang of things that are happening to him and in his community in the most touching and spirited way. Not only is he a fantastically talented musician but he has overcome a number of disadvantages, including the fact that he is blind. I really cannot speak highly enough of his talent. Matt and Sebastian both told me what a difference the program had made to them. Not only had they managed to stop using drugs but also, with the help of youth worker Karen Wells, they had managed to find accommodation and were planning to go back to study. Like Jane, Matt and Sebastian are now helping other young people at the service. The funding for the dual diagnosis program came from the National Illicit Drugs Strategy. I can really say that I have not seen a better use of the funding from that strategy. Almost 200 people have gone through the program so far. Mostly, they come from abusive backgrounds, they have experienced homelessness and they have often had multiple mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, social phobia and borderline personality disorders. The program focuses on sorting out housing, education and other issues early in the week but sets Fridays aside for some recreation so that the young people can visit restaurants, go to the movies, go to Australia’s Wonderland or go camping-all of the things that help them feel like they are whole people, rather than just being treated as an illness or as a problem. They spoke to me about how much they look forward to these outings. I am very much hoping that they will come down to Canberra some time this year and visit us. The dual diagnosis team of Karen Wells, Julianne Geddes and Suzie Walker, as well as South Sydney Youth Services Director Shane Brown and juvenile justice worker Tiffany Thursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12493 Cootes must be congratulated on their hard work, the success the program has seen and their dedication. It is obvious that they are an inspiration to the young people they work with, several of whom told me that they are returning to study so that they can become youth workers and go on to help other young people in the way that they had received help. There was a young man at that program last Friday who was nine days clean. It had been nine days since he had stopped using hard drugs. He was having a tough day that day. I want to say to him that nothing worth having is easy. I hope he is able to take one day at a time and overcome the problems he has. It really is worth putting in that effort. I know the workers there and his peers were very proud of the fact that he had given up drugs. Moncrieff Electorate: Home and Community Care tional $2.65 million in funding for the Gold Coast through the home and community care package that the federal government recently announced. I am delighted to have played a part in helping to deliver this funding to a number of very deserving and community involved organisations that play a very important role in making sure that older people and their carers, as well as younger people who are disabled, have access to the kinds of services they need to alleviate some of the pressure that falls on carers who are responsible for making sure that those people requiring care are looked after and attended to on a regular basis. A very important aspect of the home and community care funding is the fact that it provides people who are disabled, and the frail aged, the opportunity to remain in their homes and have a notion of independence that is generated by having people come in and attend to them, as well as the opportunities that respite care provides for their carers to have a break from the constant, never-ending demands associated with looking after someone who is frail or disabled. It is very important that the community recognise what an absolutely sterling job carers do. An important part of this additional $2.65 million in funding for Gold Coast City is the fact that the money will flow directly to a number of Moncrieff based Gold Coast community organisations such as the Nerang Community Respite Care Association, the Multicultural Communities Council, St Luke’s Nursing Service in Nerang and the Greek Respite Centre on the Gold Coast, to name but a few. This money will be used to directly assist the organisations. For the Nerang Community Respite Care Association, the additional funding means that, for example, they have $26,900 in additional funding for domestic assistance. They also have $15,000 in funding for modifications to their buildings, $17,000 available for a bus and funding for landscaping in the vicinity of $1,000. Likewise the Multicultural Communities Council, an organisation I have had a great deal to do with that plays a very important role in the community, will receive a significant amount of recurrent and additional funding as a result of this announcement. That includes, for example, $6,200 for domestic assistance, $13,000 for social support, $30,000 towards a vehicle and utilities and $850 for furnitureagain, to name but a few examples. All in all the Gold Coast has been served well by the Howard government. We have a strong belief in the importance of home and community care and I am delighted to see this funding come into my electorate. Howard Government: Regional Services Australian taxpayers have always been sceptical of opportunist pork-barrelling by governments.

215,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (12.52 P.m.),"As the Main Committee appreciates,12494 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 has clearly been a perception-and rightly so-in the Australian community that Howard government held electorates and government supporters are favoured when program funds are allocated. This perception and this scepticism are easily understood, because the Howard government has taken pork-barrelling to an unprecedented level. In essence, it has refined it to an art form. Take my area of responsibility as the shadow minister for transport and regional services. In this area, the Leader of the National Party and his cronies are taking control of vast amounts of regional services funding for their own political pork-barrelling activities. The Leader of the National Party has indicated that he will soon be announcing a new regional program to replace the existing Regional Solutions Program, Rural Transaction Centres Program and Regional Assistance Program. It is interesting to note that these programs together account for more than $52 million worth of expenditure each year. This $52 million, as we all accept, is desperately needed in all of Australia’s regions that are doing it tough, not just in a few seats held by National Party members and friends of the Leader of the National Party. Unfortunately, the minister’s so-called reform of regional development programs has also gotten off to a very sad start. In a recent announcement, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services took it upon himself to accept sole responsibility to appoint area consultative committee chairs. Since area consultative committees were established in 1995 by the then minister for employment and current Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, chairs have been appointed by merit by the secretary of the administering department. Labor put this system in place so as to ensure independence of the area consultative committees and, in essence, to take the politics out of decision making so that regional money was allocated on the basis of need and disadvantage. The minister has clearly thrown independence out. I have recently been made aware that the minister, in order to immediately make his mark, appears to have identified some area consultative committee chairs who were not toeing the party line. As a result of not kowtowing to the local coalition members, they have now been sacked as area consultative committee members. And what does the minister do? He has clearly gone out of his way to axe them in a disgraceful and, as far as I am concerned, unparalleled political manner. He wrote to them or rang them and told them that, after years of dedication and voluntary service, they were no longer required. No reason or explanation was given. That is an indication of what is to come. It is interesting to note that a former minister, Mr Somlyay, has made the same complaints as I have with respect to the appointment of these area consultative committees. All area consultative committees are now on notice that they will face the same fate if they dare to not toe the coalition government line. I simply say that Australians will not stand for the blatant porkbarrelling which seems to be supported by some members on the other side of the House and which is being undertaken by a government that is out of touch with the needs of regional Australia, and Australians will not stand for a minister using his position to further his own narrow political agenda. It is out of hand, un-Australian and unacceptable, but it clearly proves that this government will do anything to shore up its political operations. For what other reason would the electorates of Wide Bay, Gippsland, Lyne, Gwydir, Maranoa, Barker and O’Connor receive more than $6 million each from the regional programs administered by the Department of Transport and Regional Services over the last three years? In the same period, the electorate of Throsby Thursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12495 received less than $400,000, even though it is the eighth most disadvantaged region in Australia. The facts speak for themselves. The coalition government is un-Australian. This is about pork-barrelling, division and, in essence, the government going out of its way to line the pockets of its mates by appointing them to area consultative committees and rorting the regional programs of Australia. (Time expired) Kelly, Hon. Jackie Sport: Rowing very accomplished, popular and, indeed, successful Australian. I had the pleasure of hosting in my electorate of Ryan the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and member for the federal seat of Lindsay, the Hon. Jackie Kelly MP. Her visit was very special because it gave me the opportunity to introduce her to quite a number of residents of Ryan, particularly those with an affinity for and interest in the sport of rowing. Everyone in this parliament knows of Jackie’s sporting background and accomplishments, and many residents of Ryan are also aware of her sporting talents and achievements. Jackie Kelly represented Australia at the under 23s in 1986 and won a national title in 1988. She was awarded a university blue for rowing and has competed in numerous world title and masters games. She is a graduate of the University of Queensland, which is a very esteemed institution in the electorate of Ryan. I want to talk about rowing at this time. Rowing is a sport that is very popular in the community and, indeed, is very popular in the electorate of Ryan. Participation in this sport provides a healthy lifestyle, helps to develop communities and encourages values that I know every member in this parliament shares: discipline, dedication, teamwork and the making of a contribution to the community. It is also very important for school children, because it brings young Australians together so that they can participate in a team environment and gain sporting and social skills. I myself rowed at Cambridge, and I enjoyed that opportunity very much, so I have an appreciation of the dedication and great discipline that is involved in rowing. Jackie had the opportunity to speak to the students of two schools: St Peters College, my old school in Indooroopilly; and the Brisbane Boys College, the BBC, in Toowong-two very successful schools in the Ryan electorate. She was able to talk to the young students who are involved in the sporting teams there-and in rowing, in particular-about what is involved in teamwork, what is involved in discipline and what is involved in making a success of their goals and their dreams. I think the students were very grateful for that opportunity. Rowing Australia has some 40,000 affiliated members. The national championships in 2002 attracted around 3,000 entries. Reliable research shows that some 250,000 people identified themselves as supporters of the sport. In Queensland, there are 30 rowing organisations and 47 schools affiliated with Rowing Australia. Many great associations in rowing include the Centenary Rowing Club, of which I have the great pleasure of being the patron. It is vitally important that young Australians who participate in rowing appreciate what is involved in it and also have the opportunity of being exposed to those who reach elite competition level. I know that bringing someone who has represented Australia to meet these young people impressed and inspired those young people. It was terrific that the schools put on morning tea and afternoon tea, and staff and parents came along to meet the parliamentary secretary and to gain an idea of her accomplishments and achievements. I want to thank those from St Peters who helped out with the visit, particularly Mr Gary Holley; Stephen Rudolph,",141,Representatives Main Committee
216,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (12.58 P.m.),"I had the pleasure last Friday, 28 February, to host a12496 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 Head of the College; Janelle Anderson, Deputy Head of St Peters; and Ron Lyons, the development officer. At the Brisbane Boys College, Jackie Kelly spoke very eloquently about the contribution that rowing makes to people’s lives and the great networks, skills and attributes that come from it. She had the opportunity to meet eight distinguished individuals who are associated with BBC Rowing. There were eight sculls named after these individuals, and I pay tribute to their community service. Through their community service they give young children at the school the opportunity to participate in rowing. I want to acknowledge James Wheeler, Dr Peter Britton, Lindsay Mack, Col Fischer, Jackie Muntz, Rob Church, Sandi Harold, Karen Rogers and Roger Witham. The service and the extracurricular time they give to the school give young people the opportunity to participate in a very popular sport. I certainly salute their contribution to the school. (Time expired) Lalor Electorate: Medical Services Ms GILLARD (Lalor) (1.03 p.m.)-I rise on this occasion to speak again about a matter of concern to my electorate-that is, the critical shortage of doctors and the lack of bulkbilling. On the last occasion that I raised this issue in the House, I raised it from the point of view of our local aged care providers, who were finding it impossible to get a doctor to attend in the aged care institution for the purposes of seeing sick residents and doing prescriptions for needed medicines and even, on occasions, for the purpose of generating death certificates. I rise again on this matter, but on this occasion I want to deal with a few individual examples from my electorate-constituents of mine who have faced severe difficulties because of the lack of access to doctors and the lack of access to bulk-billing. Indeed, in question time yesterday, the problem of two of my constituents, Mark and Michelle from Tarneit, was raised with the Prime Minister. These two constituents had to take their two children to the doctor and, without bulk-billing, they were required to find $80 up-front. When this question was raised with the Prime Minister, he did not know where the suburb of Tarneit is, and there was some exchange across the table in the House of Representatives when I tried to indicate to him that Tarneit was a suburb in my electorate. I am not critical of the Prime Minister not knowing where Tarneit is. It is probably a bit much to expect the Prime Minister to know the location of every suburb in Australia, and, of course, the Prime Minister hails from New South Wales. Less easy to explain, though, was the Treasurer’s reaction-the Treasurer being a lifetime Victorian-who said when the issue was raised about Mark and Michelle in Tarneit that ‘he had never heard of it’. This is very difficult to explain when the Treasurer could come to Tarneit any time he liked by simply driving over the Westgate Bridge and down the Princes Freeway. It is even more difficult to explain in circumstances where the Treasurer would have members of this place and members of the Australian public generally believe that he is a very big wheel in the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party. Someone who was a very big wheel in the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party would know that there is a Victorian state seat called Tarneit, which, of course, is in my electorate. The issue of Mark and Michelle is one example. Another individual example came to my attention. Constituents of mine who recently moved to the area wrote to me and said: Thursday, 6 March 2003 MAIN COMMITTEE 12497 Having recently moved to Werribee, my family is dismayed by the lack of access to medical practitioners in the area. Seeking attention for a medical condition in mid-December, we visited 5 surgeries before we could receive attention as all the doctors’ patient lists were full. Between these two examples-the constituents who wrote to me and the example of Mark and Michelle-we see on display the problems facing the electors of Lalor. No. 1 is that there are not enough doctors, and you can go from doctor to doctor to doctor trying to get an appointment. Many doctors have full patient lists, and they simply will not take on new patients. What does it cause? It causes a spill-over to the casualty department of the Werribee Mercy Hospital. Problem No. 2 is that, even if you do find a doctor who will give you an appointment and put you on his or her patient list, you will find that that doctor does not bulk-bill and not everybody has the money to deal with paying doctor’s fees for perhaps one or two or more sick children. As we know, when illnesses come to families, they tend to go from family member to family member. Statistically, we know that in my electorate the bulk-billing rate has fallen more than nine per cent since March 2000-and that is the statistical verification of the problem that my constituents face. I speak today to call on the government to adopt Labor’s plan to do something about the number of doctors in outer metropolitan suburbs, including my electorate. The government promised $80 million in the last budget to fix this problem. The program that the government has implemented has resulted, as at 1 January this year, in two additional doctors being available in outer suburban Australia. That is a complete failure. The government needs to redirect that $80 million into getting something done. People are hurting now, and Mark and Michelle and the rest of my constituents simply cannot wait. Portman Mining Ltd was cut short this morning and to continue my explanation as to why the Western Australian EPA report withholding opportunity for mining from Portman Mining Ltd should be reversed by the minister for the environment in Western Australia. Portman Mining, as I said, is a very successful mining organisation operating in Western Australia, albeit a small one. It has a very efficient operation operating out of Koolyanobbing in the Yilgarn. It is extracting iron ore and shipping it via rail through my electorate to the port of Esperance. The port of Esperance has just justified some $54 million of expenditure to improve their port facilities to handle this iron ore in view of some 10 to 12 years of operations. A sum of $80 million has been spent on upgrading the Koolyanobbing to Esperance railway on the basis of the continuation of this mining operation. All this will count for nothing if the Western Australian government-specifically, the minister for the environment-will not see the sense of overturning the EPA recommendation that the right to mine be withheld simply because of the existence on a lease of what many have referred to as a weed. It happens to be Tetratheca paynterae, which is listed as a rare flora. It is a rare flora because, with genetic analysis, it proves to be very slightly different from the Tetratheca species that is widespread across the Goldfields. On this particular patch of land, there are some 2,900 of these individual plants, 1,100 of which will be saved under the mining application. However, that influence is enough for the EPA to recommend that mining not go ahead. This will destroy jobs across my electorate. It will put at risk both the expansion of the port facilities in Esperance and the financial well-being of the Esperance Port Authority.",143,Representatives Main Committee
217,Mr Haase (Kalgoorlie) (1.08 P.m.),"I rise to continue my three-minute statement that12498 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 March 2003 It will, therefore, bring into question the upgrading of the Koolyanobbing-Esperance railway, at a cost of $80 million, because the question will rightly be asked, ‘What do we need this upgrade and these facilities for if they are not going to be effectively used by this mining company to create wealth for Western Australia?’ I might add that that wealth amounts to some $10 million per annum in royalties. If approval is not granted to mine, the Portman mine will shut down in less than three years. One of the hurdles that the EPA is insisting be overcome is that the Portman mining operation prove that this species can be artificially propagated and successfully returned to the wild in other areas. Some $650,000 has been spent by Portman already in proving that this species can be propagated in artificial conditions-and that is easily done and it has been proven that it is easily done. However, for the authorities to then insist that this plant be returned to the wild, having been propagated in artificial conditions, and then be seen to replicate by natural process in the wild in new locations is a process that needs a real-time time line. It cannot be shortened in the laboratory or through modelling. Therefore, they need six years to prove that this will happen naturally in the wild. In three years time, the company will have to close down and be history. The jobs will be history. The wealth created by the mine will be history. It is an absolutely horrendous situation to suggest that the Portman mine should be shut down or that those secure jobs should be affected simply because the EPA wants to propagate a weed. Forde Electorate: Rotary Clubs Forde Electorate: Rural Fire Brigades left in this debate to bring to the attention of the House some outstanding achievements by the local Rotary clubs in my electorate of Forde. I was pleased to attend the inaugural Beaudesert Rotary Race Day held on Valentine’s Day. The race was organised by the Rotary clubs of Beaudesert, Jimboomba, Boonah and Tamborine Mountain and it was part of a weekend of ‘passion, power and excellence’ to raise funds to assist Rotary in the worldwide eradication of polio. I am pleased to say that Rotary raised an amazing amount of $100,000 over that weekend. I want to publicly announce that achievement-it is absolutely astounding that a small rural town could raise that amount of money over one weekend. I personally thank the Rotary organiser, Mike Morgan, who did a fantastic job, despite the weather. There were very large turnouts and all events were well supported by locals, as well as bringing hundreds of new visitors to our area. Many commented to me on the very professional organisation of an excellent weekend which was coordinated by the Rotary clubs, and they are looking forward to it becoming an annual event. I would also like to place on the record my thanks to the rural fire brigades throughout my electorate who volunteered to travel to Victoria to help fight the bushfires recently. I especially thank Bernie Savage and Dean Prowse from Jimboomba, Jeff Duke and Paul Williams from Chambers Flat, Gary Marsh from Greenbank and Steve Luckett from Tamborine Mountain. The men were based in Buchan in the Snowy River valley and worked alongside an American fire brigade, the Victorian Country Fire Authority and the Department of Sustainable Environment. I was extremely proud of those men. They did not hesitate to risk their lives to help others, and I am sure you will agree with me, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this is an act of true Australian mateship.

221,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:tation with the Banks Board of Directors, would encouraging the ADB to engage with the SPDC regime extend to that regime a degree of international legitimacy and further entrench the regime rather than encourage pro-democracy reforms as is the oft-stated position of the Government. (1) The framework for developing the human rights training was a poor human rights situation in Burma and the objective of making a useful contribution to advancing an understanding and knowledge of what the international community expects of Burma on human rights. (2) The workshops are assessed each time they are held. This involves participants’ evaluation, a report by the workshop convenors, and an assessment by the Australian Embassy in Rangoon. (3) and (4) AusAID assesses the report provided by the workshop convenor, the Australian Embassy in Rangoon provides its views, and Australian officials observe some of the courses. (5) and (6) The expected outcomes of the workshops are improved knowledge and understanding of international human rights norms and standards among participants. (7) Yes. The Government will consider the appropriateness of human rights training for serving military members during phase two of the Human Rights Initiative. (8) Some internally displaced peoples receive assistance through Australian NGO projects funded by Australia’s aid program in Burma including through activities to address vulnerability to HIV. (9) The Government has urged the Burmese authorities to support an international investigation of the rape allegations.

The second phase of the Human Rights Initiative will have a particular focus on protecting the rights of women. (10) The Australian Government provides assistance to refugees on the Thai-Burma border through funding for distance education, health and relief activities managed by Australian NGOs. Australian aid assistance in the border camps does not differentiate between ethnic groups.
