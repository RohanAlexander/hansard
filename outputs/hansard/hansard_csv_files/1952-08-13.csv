4,Mr Chambers,"Can the MinisterMinister havo this most vexed question cleared np in a manner that will leave no doubt in the minds of ex-servicemen and of the public? has been raised by the honourable member for Adelaide has been considered and is still under consideration. I remind the honourable member that no other forces in. Korea have anything like the leave periods that the Australian Government is happy to extend to' members of the Ih'd ancl 1st Battalions Royal Australian Kegiment, in Korea. After four months -service in Korea, each soldier has five clear clays leave in Japan. After eight months service in Korea, a soldier is given three clear weeks leave in Japan. So other forces in the British Commonwealth Division have leave comparable with that given by this Government, and we grant it with pleasure. Because of the satisfactory supply of reinforcements, an Australian soldier who suffers a major wound is not necessarily returned to the line, but that is a matter which rests entirely with the medical omcers who have to decide whether a man is physically fit for service. When a man receives a minor wound, the first 28 days that he spends in hospital are considered to be part of his service of twelve months, less the leave, that I have already referred to. I believe that the honourable member for Adelaide will conclude on reflection that the Australian forces in Korea are generously treated. are directed to the Minister for Air, they are assured now of a reasonable relate to the number of flying saucers return by a Government guarantee of that are alleged to have been seen in i.4d. per Ih. various parts of Australia during recent months. Can the Minister say whether considered recommendations and suggessuch reports have been investigated by tions that vvere made by the honourable his depa rtment, and if so, will he state the meinber for Capricornia and other honorconclusions that his oflicers have reached? able members and by the Queensland Furthermore, is the Minister in communiCotton Board. Following a recommendacation with the United States authorities tion by the Minister for Trade and Cusconcerning these intruders? Does he share toms, the Government has decided to in the opinion expressed American officials that the flying saucers for seed cotton from a current guarantee may be visitants from another sphere, of !Hd. per lh. to 14d. per lb. in respect of or, alternatively, that they are a novel the crop that is about to be planted. It form of espionage by a potential enemy? is the desire of the Government to secure In reality, are they not more likely to be simply an aerial version of the Loch Ness monster? any report from the Air Force on flying saucers in Australia. I share the view of the honourable member that these reports are probably based on flights of imagination in which honourable members who sit on the other side of the House so frequently indulge. I do not think that the Air Force has been in communication with the United States authorities-on this matter. I shall certainly cause a thorough investigation to be made. If I can ascertain the source of these rumours, I shall let the honourable member have full information about them. I impress upon the House my belief that most of the rumours that have circulated in Australia have resulted from the activities of a particular political party. It is highly probable that that party is flying kites as a new form of political propaganda. Commerce and Agriculture inform the House whether the Government has made any decision on the suggestion that I have put forward that an increase in the guaranteed price for seed cotton to 14d. per lb. would result in a greater production of cotton ? Has full recognition been accorded the saving that would accrue to Australia's overseas balances if more cotton were produced? I ask the Minister these questions because the planting season for cotton is at hand, and I am confident that growers, including new by certain crease the guaranteed return to growers",12,Korea

9,Mr Mcewen,"The Government hasa very substantial expansion of the Australian cotton-growing industry if this can be achieved on a basis of economic production. The advantages, both as an expansion of Australian agriculture and in respect of our balance of payment problems, are obvious. It was on this reasoning that the Government, in 1950, guaranteed a price for seed cotton of 9$d. per lb. for five years. That achieved an immediate and very substantial increase of the acreage planted to cotton. The increase of the guaranteed price for next year expresses a recognition of the general higher level of costs and values which pertain at present. This alteration of the original guarantee does not invalidate the Government's original undertaking that during five years, the guarantee would not be lower than 9^d. per lb. The return to cotton-growers is finally the outcome of the sale of raw cotton, that is ginned cotton, and therefore the costs of ginning are a most important -element in the economies of this industry. The costs of ginning are affected largely by the volume available for ginning, and to a not unimportant extent by the selling price of cotton-seed meal, the by-product -of ginning. Ginning is undertaken by .an instrumentality of the Queensland Government. An aspect of the Commonwealth's guarantee is an expectation that the Queensland Government will take nil steps to keep the costs of ginning down, and to that extent, increase the return to .growers and limit the possibility of the Commonwealth's guarantee being involved. Mr ""WABD I rise to order. I desire to know whether the period allotted by the Standing Orders for questions without notice is to be taken up by obviously prearranged questions asked of Ministers who come into the House with prepared -statements to read. by the Standing Orders for questions. 'There are two types of questions, one being questions on notice, and the other, questions without notice. -On many occasions, very much against my grain, I have allowed considerable latitude in the asking of questions. I think that I have allowed equal latitude in the answering of them. If the Housewishes me to apply the Standing Orders rigidly, I can assure honourable members that I shall do so, and that question time will be over in ten minutes. explanation of the circumstances associated with the guarantee in a few words. The Australian Government expects the Queensland Government to continue it* programme of stimulating the acreage planted and. also to fix a selling price for cotton seed meal which is reasonable, having regard to the points to which i have referred. The price of cotton seed meal definitely affects the final return to growers for their seed cotton. ter is going well beyond the question. of this guarantee, may look forward to a very considerable profit if seasonal conditions are favorable and their cultural methods are efficient.

Will they he expected to pay board in spite of the fact that they have no income? iletails of this matter in my mind. I undertake to have the inatter investigated this afternoon and to furnish the honourable member with, a reply to his question before the day is over. of the Minister acting for the Minister for Immigration been drawn to a report that the sudden recall of the Minister for [mmigration from Vienna to London is a significant indication that his European tour in connection with Australia's immigration programme has ended, and also that German emigration to Australia has been cancelled? Will the Minister inform the House whether the report is true and also whether, as was indicated in the same report, it is true that there is an anxiety in Australia about immigration matters which may result in the return to this country of the Minister for Immigration earlier than was expected, and without his visiting Canada to attend the forthcoming conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association ? MT. BEALE I have seen the report io which the honourable member has referred. It is so grossly inaccurate that present. It was announced in this [ do not .know where to begin to answer the question. The Minister for Immigration is in the process of paying a visit to London during his European tour in connection with immigration -matters. His visit to London has nothing to do -with -immigration, and 'the interruption of his negotiations in .Germany is not to be -taken to mean that those negotiations hatve -been cancelled. They have not been cancelled, and, therefore, the assumption that there is some interruption .of this sort taking place is quite false. [8] Mr QI.YDE CAMERON -It is certainly mysterious. mysterious about it except the thoughts in the fervent and heated minds of some members of the Opposition. As to the suggestion that anxiety on this subject in Australia may cause the Minister to return here instead of going to Canada. I point out that he is the president of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and is to visit Canada for the purpose of attending the conference that will take place there in a few weeks' time. As the Minister is the distinguished head of that organization for this year, and Australia's main representative to the conference, 1 should imagine that he would be very reluctant not to go to Canada to attend the gathering. I am quite sure that he will be going there. Indeed, with the support of his colleagues, of the Government and the tolerance of the House, the Minister's representative in this Ho.use for the time being is getting along quite nicely. unemployment in Australia will the Minister who is acting for the Minister for immigration make a further review of the immigration target for the next twelve months, which is understood to be 80,000 immigrants? Will the Minister seek to hav.e ithe Dutch and Italian Governments decrease their quotas of immigrants in order to .obviate a repetition of the itrouble that recently occurred at Bonegilla -camp ? place any further review of the immigration programme before Cabinet at House only a few days ago that the immigration programme had 'been reduced from about 160,000 a year to 80,000 for the year 1953. The Government has made very drastic reductions in its programme and the honourable member will realize that it is not easy to break engagements that have been .made with other governments and so submit the people concerned to a very serious disturbance of their domestic and business arrangements.

Health indicate the relative merits of the lottery system and the voluntary insurance system as means of financing hospitals? In particular, what proportion of lottery receipts in all the States in which lotteries are conducted is actually made available to hospitals, and what is the net return received by hospitals from hospital insurance societies? conducted in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania. Approximately, from 75 per cent, to 80 per cent, of the total proceeds of those lotteries represents the value of prizes and administrative expenses, leaving from 20 per cent, to 25 per cent, for payment to hospitals. In respect of hospital insurance organizations, the position is exactly the reverse. Approximately from 75 per eent. to 80 per cent., and in some instances even more, of the total inconie of such organizations is made available to hospitals whilst only from 10 per eent. to 20 per cent, of such income is absorbed in administrative expenses. In the Dnited States of America and Canada approximately 90 per cent, of the income ofvoluntary insurance organizations is made available to hospitals. -series nf questions to the Minister for Health. First, were any conditions on hospital administration imposed on the States under the Chifley Government's hospital benefits scheme, and are any conditions being imposed on the States under the present Government's scheme? Secondly, to what extent did Queensland benefit under the Chifley Government's hospital benefits scheme, and to what extent would it benefit uncier the present scheme? Thirdly, did Queensland reeeive any assistance from the Chifley Government towards the treatment of sufferers from tuberculosis and the maintenance of buildings, and is it receiving any such assistance from this Government? Fourthly, for how long have pensions been paid by the Commonwealth to sufferers from tuberculosis, and can the Minister state the approximate amount by which sufferers in Queensland have benefited ? under which pensions have been paid to sufferers from tuberculosis has been in operation for little more than two years, and during that period, approximately £300,000 has been paid to recipients in Queensland. The Chifley Labour Government insisted, despite the protests of the respective Premiers at that time, that conditions be imposed upon the States regarding the hospital benefits contribution. One condition was that all hospitals should forgo the collection of fees from patients in public wards, and, in return, the Chifley Labour Government made, available 6s. a bed daily. That amount was later increased to 8s. The present Government has offered to the States a system of hospital benefits under which no limiting conditions will be imposed upon the institutions. All that, this Government asks is that the State governments shall seek to increase their hospitals revenue. imposed. will be abolished in respect of any person who pays one half-penny a day to insure himself.

Is the Minister now able to give to the House details of that scheme? Will he state the special provisions that he has in mind in respect of chronic invalids and aged people other than pensioners who are in receipt of less income than pensioners? Tf such provision has not been made, will the right honourable gentleman endeavour to treat those persons on the same basis as age and invalid pensioners?

The examination is being made in order to enable all such organizations to function under the scheme. Some of these organizations are associated with the trade unions, some with mining organizations and other big undertakings and some with friendly societies and medical benefit societies. The examination will take several months and the public will be notified well in advance of the actual date of commencement of the scheme. All the major organizations have decided to remove the age bar to insurance in regard to both medical and hospital benefits. They are also willing; to insure uersons wnth such chronic diseases as diabetes or asthma against other illnesses that they may suffer and the Government contribution will he paid in respeot of each disease. Mr W. M. BOURKE -In view of the recent statement by the Minister for Territories that certain complete exemptions from income tax that have been hitherto applicable to residents, of the Northern Territory are to lapse and be replaced by special taxation concessions, will the Minister inform the House whether the Government proposes to take any action, similar or otherwise, in relation to the complete exemption from income tax at present enjoyed by the residents of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea? I point out that that complete exemption from taxation is being taken advantage of by large Australian trading companies which have made themselves eligible for the exemption by the simple expedient of registering a subsidiary company at Port Moresby. Despite the fact that they make very large profits from their operations in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea they are not called upon to make a commensurate contribution to the increasing cost of its administration. part of the honourable member's question relates to government policy, I am not prepared to answer it at the moment.

Was not an undertaking given by the Minister's predecessor in office that such transferred officers would suffer no promotion disadvantage through their military service? Has this underraking been honoured? If it can be shown that certain public servants who transferred to the military forces, and later returned to civilian status, have suffered grave disadvantages, will the Minister give an undertaking that the cases will be investigated, and that the undertaking given by the former Minister will be honoured? any representations on the matter to which the honourable gentleman has referred. However, if such representations are received in future, I shall be pleased to give them every consideration.

Has the Minister taken into consideration the needs of those wool growers who have not actually left the industry and may urgently require their money for a particular reason? Government to distribute in f u l l Joint Organization profits to persons entitled to a share of those profits applies to those who left the industry prior to August, 1949. The decision was the outcome of representations which had heen made to the Government to the effect that aged persons and others not in good financial circumstances should be paid their entitlement in full. The Government accepted the principle as a general proposition. Some months ago I consulted with all the wool-growers' organizations in Australia in order to obtain the benefit of their views before the Government arrived at its final policy decision. Tremendous administrative problems are associated with the engagement to pay out in full a share of the profits to any one who claims that he is in adverse financial period, and who have since circumstances. The broad decision was to those who had left the industry before the recent high prices for wool operated.

Some time ago there appeared to be a shortage of some of these items. As extra production would benefit the industry and imorove the employment position, I should anoveciate the Minister's supplving information concerning any steps that have been taken to meet these essential Service requirements. for Corio has asked .several ouestions on this matter and his interest in it is well known. It is true that some time ago the industry was slow in filling defence orders, hut the la.""' has now heen overtaken. I shall cite figures to indicate the degree of acceleration that has taken nWe. During the last half of 1951. 392,000 yards of textiles were produced in fulfilment of government orders. In the first half of 1952 production was increased to 775,000 yards. During the last half of 1951, 316,000 items of clothing were manufactured for my department, while 871,000 items were made during the first half of 1952. The production of footwear was increased from 66,000 pairs to 100,000 pairs during the same period. Perhaps those figures will encourage the industry by providing it with an indication of the extent to which the Government has assisted it by the placing of orders. External Affairs) -by leave-Honor able members will be most interested to hear that advice has just been received from the Australian representative in Hongkong that three Australian airmen, Ross Sandford Bohm, of Brisbane, John Francis Richmond, of Wollongong, and William Michael Jones, of Adelaide, have arrived at the border between the territory of Communist China and Kowloon, the British territory on the mainland opposite the island of Hongkong. Our Australian representative has reported that the Hongkong authorities are arranging for the transport of these men to Hongkong. I was very pleased to b>: able to pass on this information to-day to the next of kin of the airmen.

The policy that the Government has pursued during the two and a half years that it has been entrusted with the administration of this country has been brought into effect by the means that the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) has described to the committee. The aims of the Government may be summarized under six heads. Tlie first aim is to aid and contribute to a challenge to the Government. He said world peace and security. The second that, by applying the principles of is to maintain the security of Australia Labour's ful l employment policy, the Goagainst aggression and conquest. The vernment could gradually restore stability third is to maintain peace within Aust.o the economy. I am very doubtful tralia. The fourth is to help to achieve that the right honourable gentleman sinand maintain high living standards, incerely looks forward to the establishment cluding the constant useful employment of a stable economy in Australia. I read of our people. The fifth is to develop recently a report of a statement that had the instruments of production. The been made by one of the masters of the sixth is to provide social services of a Labour party. Mr W. Bird, who is the high standard in order that we may mainsecretary of the Seamen's Union of Austain, social justice. The Treasurer has fulfilled his obligations to the Australian people under all six of those headings. Unfortunately, as lie. we have learned from the two speeches that have been made on hehalf of the Opposition so far during this debate, the Labour party, although it has obligations in relation to all of those aims, has failed to honour them. The first three aims that I have mentioned refer to the promotion and maintenance of peace, both inside and outside Australia, and to the fostering of a state of well-being amongst our people. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) sought merely to arouse mass hysteria and engender fear in the minds of the people. I noted various phrases that came from his lips over and over again during the course of his speech last night. He spoke of a fear of unemployment, a fear of economic recession, mass unemployment, a drift towards unemployment, and the commencement of a definite trade recession. Why should he make such statements when they are obviously untrue and without any foundation in fact? The answer is that the right honourable gentleman is trying to gain some party political advantage hy instilling in the minds of the people unjustified fears of unemployment and economic recession. By raising such bogies, he hopes to achieve bis lifetime ambition to become the commissar of Australia. What is Labour's policy? Isi t entirely negative, without any semblance of constructive planning? I trust that we shall learn from speeches hy other members of the Opposition that the Labour party has at least some constructive proposals to submit. Up to the present, we have found no evidence of constructive planning hy that party. The Leader of the Opposition issued tralasia, which exerts a powerful influence upon the Labour party.

66,Mr Peaece,"Mr Bird, who is what happened? The Queensland Goreplied that the wicked Australian Government would not give it sufficient money. ""We replied that the Queensland Government had at least £8,000,000 that it could not spend previously. The Queensland Government replied that Thiess Brothers wanted the work closed down. Thiess Brothers denied that and so the Queensland Government had to look for another scapegoat and it said that it did not have enough money. I pointed out that the Queensland Government had at least £4,000,000 in a post-war development fund for the railway department, and that it could easily afford the comparatively small sum that was required. In the whole period that has passed since the war, it has not spent £1,000,000 of the £5,000,000 that it had salted away, if that is sound Labour administration, heaven preserve this country from it. Attention has been drawn frequently to the need for more wheat because of its importance in the national economy. The people of Queensland rallied to the call and prepared 730,000 acres this year for wheat production. That is a record acreage for Queensland ancl if fortune favours the growers, it will yield 20,000,000 bushels. One would have thought that the Queensland Labour administration would seize the opportunity to do something about the wheat crop in the interests of the nation. Buti t has done nothing ahout it. ""We asked the Queensland Government to build railway sidings. It is not too good at building railways. If honourable members review the 30 years of Lahour administration in Queensland, they will discover that there are five miles of railway line less now than there were 30 years ago. However, we thought that we could ask it to build a little siding so that we could get our wheat away, but the Queensland Government has steadfastly and absolutely refused to have anything to do with the work. As a result there will be no railway siding at which trucks can be loaded to carry wheat to the seaboard. The Queensland Government fixed the ceiling price of sorghum at £21 a ton. That price is below the cost of production of freight. The honourable member for Herbert (3f"". Edmonds), has informed the committee that the Australian Government is subsidizing imports of coal from overseas. The Queensland Government could make some contribution to Australia's coal supplies. The coal from overseas, which is being subsidized, is gas coal. I recall that in 1949, when the Victorian Government was anxious to obtain gas coal, its representatives went to Queensland and to other States searching for it. They found at Selene a huge bed of gasproducing coal. It is bigger than any other deposit of gas coal in Australia. The Victorian representatives asked the Queensland Government for the righi to get the eoal. They offered to supply the capital, the railways, and the roads, to develop the whole of that mighty field for the Queensland Government and to take every ton of coal that was produced there for Victoria. That would have been a great contribution to the economy of the nation if the Queensland Government had accepted the offer, but it did not do so. It rejected the offer and announced its intention to burn the gas coal from Selenei n locomotives, although there is plenty of steam-producing coal at Blair Athol and other .fields. If that is a sample of Labour administration, Australia would be better without it. ""Wherever Labour governments are in power, it is evident that Labour does not know where it is going, because it is being pulled by the nose by the socialists and the Communists inside Australia who are its masters. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that the Government should tie the pension rate to the cost of living. He made quite a song about it. glad that the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr CalwelJ) agrees that the right honourable gentleman made such a statement, because I want to take his mind back to another statement that was made by the right honourable gentleman in this House when he was Attorney General and Minister for External Affairs.

The bank, by reason oi! its world position, is aware that the economy of Australia is most stable. In the budget that was presented by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) last week taxation has heen reduced, land tax has been aholished and provision has been made for the extension of the uranium industry to permit it to become a great dollar earner, a bastion of our defence and a great potential provider of employment and power. Under the legislation introduced by this Government the State governments receive more money than they ean expend. Graziers ancl business men have been gratified to learn that rho provisional tax, which has had sueh drastic effects upon them in the past, has been modified. If we examine the great basic industries upon which the economy of Australia is based we shall see that they, too, have progressed as the result of the policy of this Government. For the first time for very many years we have 1,000,000 tons of coal at grass. This reserve has been made possible by a jioverament which, we were told in 1949, : could not govern ancl would not get an additional ton of coal out of the ground, liy its efforts and by the force of reason brought to bear upon the trade union movement, the Government has been able to win more coal than has ever before been won in this country. Similar progress has been achieved in the steel industry. The annual statement of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, which was reported in to-day's press, reveals that despite the fact that a strike occurred in its works during the year, it achieved a record production of pig iron and steel ingots, and that the company will be able to supply the whole of Australia's future steel requirements. The budget ushers in a new era of prosperity for Australia. There is no need to fear a recession or mass unemployment. Our horizon has never been brighter than it is to-day. The glow of promise reaches out beyond this generation and covers the generations to come. This year we are laying the foundations upon which our future prosperity will be built. Future generations will learn with amazement that Opposition members in this Parliament endeavoured to engender in the minds of the people a fear that Australia, instead of going ahead, was going backwards. They will learn with regret how some honourable members endeavoured to gain political advantage from the difficulties that have faced this Government. Our future is very bright. In the words of a verse that was written, not about this country, but which may well apply to Australia to-dayOh! if this country in the making Would only stand its ground, And for those whose hearts are quaking A new spirit could be found; They'd write again a story Of a noble vig-Vous land, And feel again the glory: "" I made this with my hand "". On the sixth day of this month the people of Australia received the greatest shock they have had since the previous tragic budget was introduced by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden). On that day the people were led to believe that in the National Parliament at Canberra, the huh of Australia, the Treasurer would present a document which would be of the utmost importance to the development of Australia and would guarantee their security and happiness. When, on the following day, the press reported the contents of the unhappy document, it brought disillusionment to honourable members who sit behind the Government, notwithstanding the fact that they had applauded it on the preceding night, and they, too, joined with the majority of the people in characterizing the budget as a mockery and a sham. The document provided for neither the defence nor the security of Australia now or in the future. Thc Treasurer made no attempt to balance the accounts of the nation. The contents of the document were dictated, firstly, by fear of the electors, and, secondly, by fear of the masters of honourable gentlemen opposite. Mr Eitic J. HARRISON -Nonsense! that the financial policy of this Government is dictated by those who sit in high places in the land. Is it any wonder, therefore, that the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) should characterize my statement as nonsense. Undoubtedly, he, too, is hurt by the budget. He well, knows",24,Fiuidkss

74,Mr Luchettl,"It is well knownthat what I have said is true. If the policy of the Government were not dictated by its masters would it not pursue a consistent and sound financial and economic policy and not rely upon what the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has described as "" fits-and-starts measures"" to extricate itself from its difficuties? By what criterion should the budget be judged? Those who have regard for the welfare of the nation cannot applaud the Government's action in bringing immigrants to this country, herding them into compounds and when they become dissatisfied with their lot here, threatening to use military tactics to quieten them. member well knows that that is untrue. perate position which now exists in this country as the result of the Government's maladministration, and the sooner that it is ejected from office the better it will be for Australia. Supporters of the Government know that it is only a matter of time before the people will make that change when they are given the opportunity to register their vote at a general election. Whilst thousands of our native sons and daughters are now urgently seeking employment, we are continuing to bring thousands of people from other countries to these shores. All of those people could be employed gainfully on the necessary public works, yet the Government, which professes to be so concerned about the nation's welfare, does nothing to utilize their services. That is a shameful state of affairs. I trust that honourable members who sit on the back Government benches will heed the warning, of their supporters in their electorates and will censure the Government by voting for the amendment that the Leader of the Opposition has moved and thereby give to the people an opportunity to pass judgment upon it. The honorahle member for Capricornia ( Mr Pearce), who, in the main, dealt with matters that are not related to the budget,, referred to the elections for the 1 Brisbane City Council. Recently, the Labour party candidates, ousted the old non-Labour council which was bankrupt aatd discredited. Labour's candidates were elected' to that council on federal issues and because of the bad record of their predecessors. The incoming council found the city's coffers empty, and I have no doubt that when Labour is elected to govern in this Parliament at the next general election it, too, will find a bankrupt treasury. This Government professes to be opposed to the use of treasury-bills and bank credit in government finance. Nevertheless, when it finds itself facing bankruptcy it is prepared to resort to financial measures of that kind and to hand out a few palliatives in order to gain party political advantage in preparation for the election for the Senate which is to take place next year. I recall conditions that existed in this country in other days when Australia enjoyed stability. At that time my predecessor had the privilege of leading this nation, and a happy people, delighted with his leadership, returned his government to office with thunderous majorities. In those days, Labour balanced the budgets and undertook important public works such as the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme. Works of that kind should be undertaken to-day. In the view of the man in the street, this country has hardly yet been scratched. Recently, I visited the Northern Territory where I had an opportunity to gauge the tremendous amount of work required to he done in order to exploit the extraordinary wealth that exists in that part of tlie Commonwealth. If this Government would do the right thing, such work would now be in full swing. However, the Government is content to do nothing. It allowed immigrants to remain idle in compounds until they threatened to riot; and then it merely handed them brooms and sent them round the country doing practically nothing. Thatwork force could be emntoyed in the construction of urgent public works such as the construction of a railway from Dajarra, in Queensland, to Newcastle Waters to provide a link with Darwin. Such a railway would be of incalculable value in developing the pastoral, mining and agricultural industries. iTt would make possible the development of rice-growing in the Northern Territory. That crop would be of great value to the Australian economy. It could also be used to help feed the starving millions to the north of Australia and",25,Fiuidkss

However, the Government is prepared merely to place youngmen on the parade ground and to march them around in equipment which, as the honourable member for Adelaide costs from £40 to £60' for each trainee. The Government has adepressioncomplex. To-day, members of all sections of the coram unity,, including Government supporters, exchange, pastoralists and tlie man in the street, are obsessed by the feeling that a depression is not just around the corner but has already commenced in this country. Share values te.1T the story of our present economic position. The Government, under its last budget, which was correctly described as a horror budget, imposed taxes totalling £472,000,000. On this occasion, it has magnanimously reduced overall taxes by £49,000,000! But to whom w ill the remissions be, made ? How much of that relief vvill he given to the average worker? Opposition, in his telling and forceful analysis of the budget last evening, made it clear that the average, workerwill be worse off under this budget than he is at present. As the foundation of the basic wage is the cost of keeping a f a m i l y unit, it automatically increases as the cost of living rises. But every increase o i the basic wage renders the worker subject to higher rates of tax. Thus the great majority of employees will not receive any real benefit from the proposed tax remissions. I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Leader of the Opposition for his masterly analysis o? onr present economic situation. He showed that the budget would cause disillusionment and despondency. time, however, he indicated the course that Labour w ill follow when it is given rhe opportunity to extricate Australia from the morass in which it nowfinds itself. This budget, which the Government claims to he an incentive budget and under which overall collections of taxes \f tn hereduced hy £49,000,000, is nothing > 237 but a mockery. Eveni n the difficult post-war years the Chifley Labour Goveitnment reduced taxes, by no less tlian £2SO,00.0;000 and, at the same time, wa,& able to make monetary giftsto the people of the United: Kingdom to sustain them in tlieir fight for freedom and. democracy. This budget is a depression budget. 1: offers no realrelief, or benefit, to any section of the community. The president o£ tli.e Chamber: of Manufactures ha? criticized it most trenchantly, particularly in respect of the payroll tax. T-ba! tax was introduced during the war year -; in order to discourage employment in non-essentia! industries. A t that time, btvestors on the stock man-power was rigidly controlled. T h i , country was then fighting for its existence. A total of approximately £40,000,000 a year is collected in respee.t. of 51,000 workers. Every employee costs his employer about 6s. a week. If that impostwere removed from industry there would be an incentive for the employers to engage extra men. But thjs Government, which claims to have introduced' an incentive budget, has overlooked the necessity to abolish the pay-roll tax. The Government has beencaught up The Leader of the in the toils of its own false promises and of the absurd and ridiculous promises which are still being made on its behalf. Honourable members on this side of the chamber recall, very clearly, the promises that were made by supporters of the Government during the last general election campaign, but honourable members opposite seem to forget their glib promises. I refer particularly to the promises that were made to the people by the Prime Minister( Mr Mehziesl. the Treasurer ( Sir Arthu r Fadden), the and other spokesmen for the Government, rather than by the back-benchers and campaign workers. The leaders of the Government parties boasted that they would put value back into the £ 1 , reduce taxaA t the same tion, abolish controls, and apply an excess profits tax. But what do we find ? Profits by large companies have continued to mount day by day and year by year The BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited and General Motors-Holden^ Limited continue to disclose colossal profits because the Government has don* nothing to control profits. On the other",26,Fiuidkss

78,Minister For The Rjavy ( Mr Mcmahon),"band, it has intervened in an application that is now before the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The workers of this country are righting to retain conditions that they have gained after continued struggles down the years. There can be no doubt of the attitude of this Government towards the working people of Australia. The present tide of unemployment has emerged not by accident, but by design. The advisers of the Government have consistently advocated that a pool of unemployment should be established. Tliey beiieve that by pursuing a policy of attrition the workers will do what they are told to do. They believe, also, tliat the appearance of large armies of unemployed people at the factory gates will obviate difficulties on the labour front. It is odd that members of the Oo vernment should have denied this assertion from time to time, although the Minister for Commerce and Agri'Professor Hytten and Professor Copland have advocated the theory that there should be an army of unemployed numbering about 10 per cent, or 11 per cent, of the workers. That is all very well for the Government, but it is no good for the people who will be unemployed. The Frankenstein monster of the Government's creation now shows signs of destroying it, and honourable memhers opposite would like to know how to steady it down. The truth of the matter is that the Government cannot do so. The Government has given no indication to the nation of the extent to which it intends to use bank credit. It has lost the conassertion. Immigrants who have come fidence of the people, who will not now lend their money to the Government. Because of the depression complex that has been deliberately engendered by tha Government the yield of the pay-roll tax has fallen and will continue to fall as unemployment mounts. Eevenue from customs duties and sales tax also will continue to fall. This decrease of revenue will bring about a situation that undoubtedly will result in next year's budget being much more fearsome and unsatisfactory than is the present budget. We have heard quite a lot about what the Government, intends to do in relation to food production. Statistics show Mr TMchetti. that there are fewer people on the land! to-day than there were formerly. Ourrural areas are becoming denuded of population. The Government appears to have no constructive policy to put moremen on the land in order to boost primary production. This is apparent from the following report which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 9th August:The Minister for Agriculture ancl Gammerce,. Federal Government, last year' had increased sales-tax on non-essential goods deliberately with the intention of depressing those industries which made them. It had done that to force men back to the land and into the iron, and steel and agricultural implement industries, he said. "" The people we hurt hate us like hell, but please remember that it has been done to get lahour bank to the farms,"" he said. The Government has set itself out deliberately to depress industry and tocause mass unemployment. Women ancl elderly people in country districts have been thrown out of work. In manyinstances they are unable to go to other districts to seek employment. The country people resent this action by the Government. They like a balanced economy. They like to see factories in. their own country towns, and they resent the Government's policy that has interfered so greatly with the economy of many districts. Although the Government has destroyed many secondary industries in order to promote primary industries, it has refused to employ selected immigrants on the land. The recent incident at Bonegilla is proof of this to this country in search of rural work have found that Australians who formerly worked on the land are now carrying their swags in search of jobs. If the Government is sincere it should provide immigrants with work on the land, and it should also encourage additional numbers of our owu people to settle. It remains to be seen whether the immigrants will remain in compounds or be placed in the jobs that the Government has promised them. This budget has failed in all directions. The honourable member for Capricornia referred to the production of coal. Credit, for the faet that coal is now",27,Fiuidkss
79,Culture ( Mr Mcewen) Has Not Denied It.,,28,Fiuidkss
80,,"Mr J. McEwen, said yesterday that theavailable in abundance is due to a former Labour government which established the Joint Coal Board and organized the coal industry of this country. At that time the representative for the Division of Macquarie ( Mr Chifley) was Prime Minister. That Government, by its decision to purchase dollar equipment to increase coal production in Australia, made possible the present surplus of coal at grass, although the surplus exists only because the railways are incapable of handling all the coal that is being produced. It is only on rare occasions that honourable members opposite say a kindword for the miners who go down into the bowels of the earth to win coal. Supporters of the Government are benefiting from the efforts of the previous Labour governments and of the coal-miners. I put it to the committee that we should hear no more of the nonsense that the Government has been responsible for an increase of coal production. Such an increase cannot be achieved overnight. It can be gained only by long-range planning. The plans were not made by this Government, which has profited from the actions of previous governments. Let. me refer in passing to national development. initiated one new developmental scheme? The Burdekin Eiver Valley scheme is crying' out for attention. I am glad to know that the Government 13 permitting work to continue upon the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme and that there is to be no interference with that scheme, but I should not have been surprised if this Government, which has destroyed most of the other valuable undertakings that were created by Labour governments, had ordered a suspension of work upon it. there is a very good reason why the Government has not destroyed the Snowy Mountains scheme. The international bankers who visited this country recently had a word to say about it. They reprimanded the Government for its failure to spend dollars upon worthy projects such as food production, and, among other things, insisted that work upon the Snowy Mountains scheme should be continued. Therefore, the continuation of the project reflects little or no credit upon, the Government. In the Northern Territory we need railways and efficient machinery witb which to treat the ore that is being won from the earth, but nothing is being done to provide them. The rich tin-fields at Maranboy are being wasted. Only a section of them is being worked because the Government will not provide the batteries that are required. The same unhappy state of affairs exists in the gold-fields. The honourable member for Capricornia referred ecstatically to what has happened at Burn Jungle, but all that has happened up to this stage is that a pioneer in the person of Mr Jack White found uranium there, that tests were made which, apparently, were highly successful, and that a portion of the uranium is to be sold to the United States of America. Very little development is taking place at Eum Jungle. What has taken place so far leaves much to be desired. If that is the best for which this country can hope, it is a most unhappy position for the Northern Territory, Eum Jungle and Australia generally, because we could earn millions of dollars from that uranium-copper project. Local governing bodies in this country are vitally interested in water conservation and irrigation projects. The honorHas this Government able member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) has referred to the unhappy plight of local authorities that have ordered equipment for such projects but have no money with which to pay for it. Water is available, people want the water and pipes are on hand. All that requires to be done is to bring the water to the people by pipes. Local authorities would derive an income from the supply of water, but, despite those facts, the necessary money cannot be found. This Government talks of work, and gives brooms to immigrants Honourable members know that so that they can fill in their time on full pay. I hope sincerely that the people of Glen Davis who have been sacrificed will be assured of a future in this country. They have lived in Australia, and have helped to build it. Many of them are practical miners and others are technicians, such as chemists and engineers. I hope that the Government will not overlook them. There is much more that I could say. This budget will not ensure the happiness of the people Oi keep prices down. 1 1 If the £6,000,000 that is to be remitted to wealthy city interests were used to provide cheaper food, for the people of Australia, it would be used to do something worthwhile. It would help the family people of this country and, by so doing, would establish a basis for the future happiness of the nation generally, becaiise I believe that the future of Australia depends upon family life. 14.15] -The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) closed upon the note that there should be cheaper food for the people of Australia. I say that the cheap food policy that was encouraged by ,the last Labour Government is responsible for the lack of primary production in this country to-day. I suggest to the honourable gentleman that he keep to subjects about which lit' knows something! I have been a primary producer for all of my working life. I know that that cheap food policy is wrong, and that we shall never get increased food production until wo give primary producers an incentive to produce more food. This Goveniment is doing that. I congratulate the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) upon the budget. In my opinion, having regard to the difficulties that face the country to-day, it is"" a masterwhat I advocated in my maiden speech in piece. Despite what honourable gentlemen opposite have said; it is an incentive budget. It will give an incentive to the people of Australia to go ahead, aiid I believe that they will respond to it. The budget contains many concessions. The 10 per cent, levy upon income tax is to be abolished, aiid concessions are to be granted to pensioners anrl ex-servieemen. The previous budget was designed to drain surplus money from the people to combat the inflation that was running rampant in the country-. Last year, the Treasurer budgeted for a surplus of over £100,000,000* but. Unfortunately, there was not a surphis at the end of the year because the Oommonwealth underwrote loans for the States. A lot of that loan money has been dissipated by the StatC3 i.i pon works that are not altogether useless but are not absolutely necessary in the circumstances of to-day, when people are talking continually of the need to increase production. The Queensland Government is expending about £24,000,000 to electrify railways and to build bridge* round the City of Brisbane, but the back country of Queensland is not getting any assistance. I do not say that some of tha i work would not have had to be done eventually, but at present the crying need is for more essential works. The concessions that are to be given to dur primary industries will help those (Maranoa) industries very much. I am glad thai the Government has thought fit to remove the land tax, about which there is much misconception. It was introduced, not as a revenue producing measure, but as a means of making big land-holders break up their estates. It has not done that. 3 do not think that the federal land tax was ever necessary for that purpose, because tlie State governments have a sovereign right even to take land from landholders if they believe such action to be necessary. That has been amply demonstrated by the acquisitions of land for soldier settlement. The federal land tax was never just. I have always opposed it and I am pleased indeed to see it abolished. I congratulate the Government upon its decision to give primary production the same priority as defence work. That is this chamber. I said that if primary pre duction were given top priority, improvements in our economic position would follow automatically. Those words have proved to be true. The nation now realizes that without primary products to pay for our imports, our economy would become bankrupt. Our exports of primary products pay for about 80 per cent, qf our imports. At the last meeting in Canberra of the Australian Agricultural Council a programme for expanding primary production was announced. I remind the Opposition that the proposals were agreed to by all the State Ministers for Agriculture, Labour and Liberal alike. They all approved the targets that were set by the Commonwealth Minister for ComThe target for tobacco has been set at .1.6,000 acres in the coming season. At present, only 5j000 or 6,000 acres are devoted to the cultivation iof tobacco",28,Fiuidkss
81,Mr Brimblecombe,,30,Fiuidkss
82,Merce And Agriculture ( Mr Mcewen).,"throughout the Commonwealth. Queensland's target is 10,000 acres, ""Western Australia's 5,000 accres, and the other States together, 1,000 acres. That is a big programme, and we all hope that it fan be carried out. The Commonwealth's first move to eniMvurage growers to cultivate more tobacco sliould be to increase the minimum proportion of Australian leaf that has to be Wended with the imported product. That would help, hut alone it would not be i.'no ugh. I see no reason why the proportion of Australian tobacco should not be at least 20 per cent. I am not a tobaccogrower, but I am acquainted with farming practices generally, and I think I have a little bit of common sense on agricultural subjects. I have smoked 100 per cent, north Queensland and south Queensland tobacco, and I say without hesitation that most of it is better than the imported leaf. I cannot see any reason why the proportion of Australian tobacco should, not be increased. Assistance could, be given to the industry also by reducing rhe excise oir locally grown tobacco purchased by small manufacturers who are making their products from Australian leaf only. The Commonwealth could go even further and finance the purchase of machinery by small manufacturers of pipe tobacco and cigarettes. An expansion of tobacco-growing in this country would help to keep young people on the land. The older tobacco-grower who has his money invested in the industry is unable to turn to another occupation probably because he knows only tobaccogrowingj and would not be competent to undertake other forms of primary production ; but in the area in which I live in southern Queensland, where there are i'OO or 400 tobacco-growers, the younger people are leaving the farms and seeking work in adjacent saw-mills or in the cities. ""Why are they doing that? They have been reared in the tobacco-growing industry, but they are leaving it because tobacco-growing is not profitable. Until it has been made profitable, the young people will not return to it. The inadequacy of water supplies presents a serious problem to tobaccogro'wers, particularly in southern Queensland. The Queensland Labour Government has made many promises to the growers about damming creeks and rivers; but, in the last fifteen years, only one small weir has been built, and that has not eased the problem to any appreciable degree. The growers are prepared to give their own labour free of charge to build weirs if the Government will provide the engineers and supervisors for this work, but it has refused to do that. In these circumstances, how can the growers be asked to produce more tobacco? 1 realize that this is essentially a. State matter, but I have mentioned certain aids that could be given by the Commonwealth. In the absence of some such incentives it is most unlikely that the target of 10,000 acres will be reached in Queensland. That would be a great pity, because Australia is ideally suited to tobacco-growing. Scientists and tobacco experts from overseas, and even oflicials of the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock, say that the soil is suitable and the climateis good. The only uncertain factor is the water supply. At the present Brisbane Exhibition there is a beautiful display of the varieties of tobacco that can be grown in the various parts of Queensland. Departmental men agree that the quality of tobacco produced in Queensland this year is the best for many years. The season has been favorable, but the price that the tobacco is bringing on the market is not sufficient to encourage growers to expand production. AgainI urge the Government to increase the proportion of Australian tobacco in the blended product to 20 per cent.; to reduce the excise on tobacco bought by manufacturers who are using 100 per cent. Australian leaf in their products; and to provide finance on long terms to manufacturers who are prepared to install machinery. I refer particularly to cooperative organizations, as most of the manufacturers in north Queensland are at present. The honourable member for 'Capricornia ( Mr Pearce) mentioned the Queensland wheat crop this year. The acreage is the biggest that has ever been planted, and the prospects are that a good crop will be harvested. The-Queensland ""Wheat Board !has asked the Government of that State -to -provide facilities to .enable the crop to be handled quickly and economically. Wheat Board is very worried about how rhe estimated crop of between 15,000,000 and 20,000,000 bushels is to be transported co the sea-board The Queensland Government will not provide siding facilities estimate of the cost of building the railtor handling the wheat. It is asking tbe wheat-growers to install their own sidings. Can that be regarded as a fair request? The growers are asked to hold the wheat in the sidings and dumps for a year for the benefit of the consumers; in other words, so that the people will not be short of food in the next year if the harvest is small. That policy is justifiable, but the State Government takes all the credit, whilst the growers are asked to hold the whole crop and handle it themselves. As a member of the Queensland ""Wheat Board, I know vvhat I am talking about. The honourable member for Capricornia is perfectly right when he says that the Queensland Government is letting the wheat industry down in that State. I now propose to refer to the beef cattle industry, particularly in the northshall be able to export any meat next west of Queensland. which I represent is keenly interested in tiie prosperity and development of north-west Queensland, and particularly in the beef cattle industry, because a part of the channel country stretches down through the western part of the electorate of Maranoa and is one of the best fattening areas for cattle in the Commonwealth. I agree with the statement of the honourable member for Macquarie that a railway should be built from Dajarra to Newcastle Waters and that the "" missing link "" should be constructed from Blackall to Charleviile. Doubtless some honourable members will contend that the construction of those lines is the responsibility of the Queensland Government. That responsibility undoubtedly devolved upon the State some years ago, bnt the difficulty .to-day is that the this Government. We realize that .more State, because of lack of finance, appears to be unable to undertake such projects. I believe that we should accept that -explanation. The position at present is most serious. Had proper rail communications existed in the fattening areas, many of the stock that have perished in the drought could have been -saved. According to estimates, 1,250,000 ssheep and 250.000 cattle have already Mr Brimblecombe. The Australian perished, and the losses are continuing. Had the railways been built, approximately 90 per cent, of the cattle could have been saved, and the country would not have lost millions of pounds. One ways is £17,000,000, which is approximately the value of stock lost in a prolonged and severe drought. If Australia is to fulfil its meat contracts with the United Kingdom, assistance must be given to the beef industry. The Commonwealth and Queensland must take definite action in that matter. Even when I was a boy, people talked of the western country, why it should be developed, and what it could produce. We know what it can produce. The Commonwealth and the Queensland Government should forget what has happened in the past, and ignore state barriers and petty political jealousies. This problem, because of its urgency, must be approached from the nationa.1 stand-point. The position is so bad at the present time that I doubt whether we The electorate year. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has announced that the Commonwealth proposes to provide £200,000 this year for farm promotion. T congratulate the Minister on that decision, because I believe that much good can be done by the farm extension work to assist men on the land to increase production. . The value of farm extension work has been proved in the United States of America, and it can be of great advantage in Australia by bringing direct to the farmer scientific ideas and methods to increase production on land that is now in use. I hope that similar grants will be made in future years. Thero is another aspect of increasing production that should be examined by land should be made available for settlement. That is a State responsibility. But I believe that if some State governments would revise their land laws, progress would be expedited. Some of thos-""' laws are out of date, and, in my opinion, are too socialistic to do any good. Production could be stepped up on existing properties if the Government were to introduce a system of easy finance to unable producers to purchase modern farm machinery. That policy has been adopted in other countries with conspicuous success. Denmark is an outstanding example. In 1950, approximately 14,000 .persons left the land in Denmark, but the authorities immediately sized up the situation, and made modern machinery available to primary producers on easy terms. The growers immediately res-ponded hy maintaining production. That system could be introduced with great advantage in Australia. It ia all very well for the honourable member for Macquarie to urge primary producers to employ immigrants who have been in concentration camps. Primary producers do not want their properties to be the centres for training those people. Asi matter of fact, the majority of the immigrants are no good on the land. Many of them are. most willing workers, and probably they are good citizens, but they take too long to learn. To-day, time means money to the man on the land. He must keep moving. Primary produci ion is not the "" game "" that it used to be many years ago. When I listen to Opposition speakers, I get the impression that they speak of conditions in the primary industries as they existed 50 or 00 years ago. Farming is a business proposition, and if it is not conducted as such, the primary producer will go "" broke "" auick and lively. I invite the Government to give serious consideration to my suggestion that farming machinery and up-to-date appliances be made available on easy terms to the man ou the land. Some losses would be incurred under that policy, but the additional production that would result from its adoption woidd more than compensate for tliem. It behoves the people to try to justifv remains a part of the Australian Labour the Government/s belief that reduced taxes will restore the nation's energy and give it greater determination to overcome inflation by working harder and increasing production. Our main troubles arise because some people take everything that comes their way, and are not prepared to give anything in return. The solution is to work a little harder and a little longer. If that remedy be applied, it will not be long before we shall solve most of our difficulties. I wish to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) on his masterly exposition last evening. His superlative analysis of the budget demonstrated to the people of Australia the nature of the impact which it will have upon them. The great Australian Labour movement was established by our pioneers. It? objectives, which have been preached by its disciples over the years, are to make decisions in the interests of all the Australian people. In direct contrast to the policy of the Australian Labour party, the present Australian Government is determined to legislate only in the interests of the wealthy section of the community. Its sole objective, apparently, is to make the rich richer and the poor poorer. Certainly no elector who voted for the Liberal party and the Australian Country party candidates at the 1949 general election could have foreseen the sorry state to which the nation would be reduced, in less than three years, by an anti-Labour government. Realization of that fact no doubt accounts for the melancholy expression on the faces of the young Liberal and Australian Country party members opposite. They know that tlieir doom is sealed and that at the next general election the Australian people will show, in no uncertain terms, wliere they stand. As a war-time pledge to the Australian people, the Australian Labour party promised a new social order and an expanding economy, with full employment together with higher living standards which are essential to the development of cur nation and to the assured welfare of our people. We all know that Labour fulfilled that pledge and that it still party platform. It is proof positive that the Labour party always functions in the interests of the people and of no one but the. people. Full employment is the first essential in this country. The Australian Labour party desires that the people should be healthy, happy, well fed, well housed and contented. I think that most Australians ask for no more than that. The desire of this Government, if the present budget is to be taken as a criterion, is to prevent",30,Fiuidkss
83,Mr Curtin (Watson) [4.40],"First,the people from attaining those objectives. Above all, the Australian people should be removed from the possibility, however remote, of loss of security in rhe future. Our children must be protected from any such fear. Thc greatest destroyer of morale is the spectre of want, which is already evident in the Australian economy. Those of us who know the bitterness of an economic depression appreciate that its bush fire tendencies cannot be contained in limited proportions. That is why I have chosen unemployment as the subject of my contribution to this debate. Unemployment is rife in the community to-day, despite all the endeavours of this Government to disguise the fact hy referring to it by many other names. For instance, it was referred to some time a.go as ""disernployment"". That term has now been abandoned because the so-called ""disernployment"" was supposed to be only temporary. The Government appreciates that the unemployment position is becoming dangerous. It has therefore decided to refer to thi -s the world, at a price. During the war, no period of unemployment as a ""transition "" period. I suggest that when the Government tells a worker, who has been unemployed for two or tliree months, rhat he is in a transitional period, the worker will tell the Government what he thinks of it. The worker and the man in the street have already had enougli of this so-called transition period, and they do not propose to put up with it much longer. Despite the need for more homes, food, equipment and every other kind of commodity, not all those who were available for work before ""World ""War II. broke out were able to find employment or to enjoy a sense of security concerning their future. The war-time Labour Government improved that position, and when the war ended the people were looking forward to what the late Prime Minister, Mr Chifley, referred to as a "" golden age"". Until 1949 we were well on thc road to such an age, but, unfortunately, by means of a blast of propaganda over the radio and in the press, and because of promises made by that political Ananias, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), the people were lulled into a. false sense of security. The result is that they find Mr Ovrtin. themselves in an awkward position to-day. They no longer believe the promises, whatever they may be, of this Government. Whether the Prime Minister speaks of a transitional period, or of a 10 per cent, reduction of taxation-whic h is really illusory, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out last evening-n o longer will the people believe him. The right honourable gentleman is known and despised throughout the CommonweaUh as a prevaricator. On an average, during the twenty yearbetween 191.9 and 1939 more than one-tenth of thc Australian men and women who were able to work were unemployed. At the worse period of the depression, more than 25 per cent, were left in unproductive idleness. ber still is! member for Corio( Mr Opperman) ever did in the way of a productive effort for Australia was to push a bicycle around financial or otlier obstacles were allowed to prevent the need for increased production to be satisfied to the utmost limits of our resources. That position must again apply. The Australian Labour party has a solution of our present economic problems and, when returned to office, will put its policy, which includes full employment, into effect. We need happy and contented people. I am amused when I hear honourable members opposite speak of what they arc pleased to call an "" incentive"" budget. How their wealthy supporters, including the big companies, must smile at the incentives which are being offered to them, despite the huge profits which they are making. The wave of unemployment in pre-war years taught us valuable lessons whicli we must apply to the problems of peacetime in order to achieve full employment. It is the responsibility of the Australian Government to provide the general framework of a full employment policy and if the Government cannot do that it should get out. If it does not get out it will be unceremoniously booted out by the people. Everybody calls this Government "" the Government of fits and starts "". During the last three years we have had",33,Fiuidkss

85,Mr Curtltst,"Al l that the honorablean exhibition of the great ability of the business men who form this hesitant Government which side-steps all issues. The Government is afraid to face the issues because it knows that it cannot fulfil the promises that it has given to the workers. is determined to destroy our heavy inThe members of the Government are afraid of what their financial supporters may say if they try to legislate in the interests of the people. The Government has failed to heed the warnings that have been given by Opposition members concerning the dangers that confront this country. Members of the .Labour party know what is going on in this country from day to day and they are not afraid to speak their minds in putting forward the claim of the people as a whole. Tlie honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) referred to members of the farmers' and graziers' organiNational Service( Mr Holt), who is zation as great Australians who were responsible for the productivity of the nation. Nothing is further from the truth. However, the Treasurer has disregarded all and. sundry and has introduced a budget Avhich has made no provision whatever to counteract the unbalance in our economy. I see the pattern unrolling as it unrolled before the Australian workers in 1929. I have very bitter memories of those times. AlthoughT was a skilled worker I had nine years of a. soul-destroying dole. ber's interjection is another indication of year amounted to £600,000 and that the intelligence of the members of the Australian Country party. The Government has embarked on a programme which is aimed at the destruction of secondary industry in the interests of the Australian Country party-thi s rump of the coalition, that has dictated policy to members of the Liberal party. The young Liberals know that their party is dictated to by the Australian Country party but they are afraid to retaliate. That is demonstrated by the fact that they all were induced to cheer the Treasurer when he was about to present a budget which would destroy their chances of returning to the Parliament, after the next general election. When the Minister for Defence( Mr Army fully equipped with tanks. I do McBride) made his statement on the subject of employment he said that sooner or later a price would have to be paid for the expansion of secondary industry. Hi3 remarks revealed in no uncertain manner that the Government dustries. The Minister referred also to the field of light manufacturing. If we destroy our secondary industries where shall we get the machinery or equipment needed to produce food? Shall we barter ourselves for the almighty dollar? The Prime Minister is very fond of quoting members of the American Congress. Are the Australian people to be sold to American financiers? The Minister for Defence made an inspired statement which was written for him by a top-level public servant who is closely associated with the Minister for Labour and overseas but who left this public servant to dictate policy to other members of the Government in regard to the destruction of secondary industries. ' Nobody can accuse the Minister for Defence of liaving any knowledge of secondary industries. He would have no sympathy for the working man who is employed in those industries. A full employment policy is necessary as a means of providing people with bread and butter. Although this is a bread and butter issue the Minister for Defence could hardly take time off from his commercial interests in order to give thought to the plight of thousands of unemployed. I understand that his wool cheque last his otlier investments have shown very good returns. Unemployment is growing daily to frightening proportions. One hundred thousand unemployed are now walking the streets, not including the 6,000 at Bonegilla and other holding centres. The people at Bonegilla ask only for work but the business men who compose this Government are so incompetent that they cannot provide work for those 2,000 immigrants. Tbe Goveniment decided to make a display of armed strength in order to show the immigrants that they must accept the conditions that the Government chooses to lay down, which are no work and 5s. a week.

A highly paid economist said that. Apparently he went to a university to learn things like that. The trade union movement has played >i great part in our national life. This country would not have been able to function during the tragic years of the last war without that movement. The trade union movement has now become a target for the attacks of the employer, who is ably abetted by the daily press. This Government intends to intervene in the wages and hours case now before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. It intends to supply some data to the court. It possesses no data of any more value than that collected by the trade union movement throughout its years of suffering and struggle. It intends again to interfere in industrial matters, in the interests of its wealthy supporters, to try to lower the standard of living and rates of wages, and to increase hours of work. I predict that the court will not interfere with wages, because they fluctuate, but that it will interfere with the 40-hour week. A 44-bour week is now on the horizon. The Government, ha.rkening to the demands of the Australian Country party-the "" cockies"" who are always squealing whether times are good or bad-intend s to ensure that a 44-hour week shall be re-introduced. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr the community. He does not seem to Bowden) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Honorahle members are certainly in excellent humour after having listened to tlie entertainment provided by the honourable member for ""Watson( Mr Curtin) ; but the honourable member said nothing that was worthy of a reply. I am sure that he spoke chiefly for the purpose of giving entertainment and not in the serious expectation of persuading people that there was any truth in his statements. I shall concern myself first with some of the statements that were made last night by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), who set the stage for the Opposition's assault upon the budget. That speech was the most amazing conglomeration of inaccuracies, false theories and calculated political propaganda that I have ever heard. The right honourable gentleman, according to his own statements, has two cures for our economic ills. The first is to issue limitless credit. The second is what he called economic stabilization, which is only a fancy description for the imposition of rigid prices control and all the other controls that the people want to avoid. Those two policies influenced his entire speech. 1 assume, therefore, that the Labour party would adhere to them if it were elected to power at any future date. The right honourable gentleman stressed throughout his speech the importance of undertaking more and more government works and of bringing to bear more and more government interference with the economy of Australia. At no time did I hear him suggest that the economy should be freed, that private enterprise should be given a go, or that the people should be given the opportunity to work themselves oui of their diflSculties unhampered by government interference. The Labour party always preaches class hatred, and the Leader of the Opposition adhered to that custom when he directed attention to the proposed abolition of land tax. The object of the Labour party in such matters is to divide the people and the right honourable gentleman said that the Government's intention to vacate the field of land tax was evidence of its desire to play up to the rich members of appreciate the fact that the land tax is utterly unjust. Are we to assume from his statements that the La'bour party is prepared to support unjust legislation? Land tax was increased by over 2,000 per eent. as a result of increased valuations. Does not the Labour party realize that land tax is triplicated in most States? Municipal and local-governing bodies levy land tax, as do all State governments except that of New South ""Wales. Does it not realize that costs of production are adversely affected by this unjust and iniquitous tax? The Government's decision to abolish land tax is evidence at least of its eagerness to reduce the multiplied costs of government. There is no need to maintain an Australia-wide organization for the purpose of Commonwealth land tax.",35,Fiuidkss
88,Mr Cramer (Bennelong) [5.10],"The Leader of the Opposition spoke of increased production, but he mentioned it only in a very vague way at one stage cf bis speech. He said that increased production depended on the use.of new machinery. Production certainly can be influenced by the employment of new machinery, but hard work is the most important factor and the right honourable gentleman overlooked it altogether. 1 do not know how we can increase production unless the people are prepared to work. Only through work can we achieve good results. Only once during the right honourable gentleman's speech did his expressed views accord with my opinions. He said that he did not like the pay-roll tax and I found myself in agreement with him. Nevertheless, I suggest that he raised this issue only because he thought that it would be a vote catcher. am sure that, if he were to gain power to-morrow, he would have no intention of abolishing that tax. I advise the right honourable gentleman to stick to the law and not to dabble in economics and accountancy, because his treatment of figures during his speech disclosed a serious weakness on his part. purported to show that taxation had increased, but his example was misleading because he took as his first comparative figure an income of £500, but then referred to taxes in the following year on an income of £600. A child of ten could have seen that his figures were faulty. Yet he expected the intelligent community of Australia to be impressed by his statement! I realize that this Government was subjected to widespread criticism because of its 1951 budget. Everybody in the community was affected by that budget, anrl criticism of it was inevitable. However, honourable members opposite should note that there was nothing in the nature of class distinction in its provisions. If anything, its effects fell most severely upon the supporters of the Government. In such circumstances, one could not expect it to pass without criticism. The real test of the merits of a budget is not its popularity. The questions that we should ask are whether a budget of that kind was necessary and whether its effects will ultimately benefit Australia. I say that the 1951 budget was necessary, and Mr Cramer. I believe that the people, even though they suffered individually, are now beginning to realize that the policies to which it gave effect will eventually benefit the nation. The Leader of the Opposition last night prefaced his remarks by saying that it would be necessary to go back a few years in order to obtain a proper perspective view of the present budget. I agree with him but I propose to go back ; beyond the point that he chose. In 1949, when this Government came to power, Australia was reaping the bitter reward of Labour's socialist policy. To judge from the speech of the Leader of the Opposition, that policy has not changed. His proud boast was that Labour had maintained f u l l employment. I say at once that this Government has I made clear to the people the fact that it stands for ful l employment. But it stands for full employment of a different kind from that which is advocated by the Opposition'. It stands for a condition of full employment under which workers can choose their own jobs and the dignity of the individual will be preHe served. It opposes the demoralizing kind of full employment that the socialists want to impose upon the people. Because of the conditions that prevailed after the war, money was plentiful wbile the Labour Government was in office, and the policy of full employment resulted in there being five jobs offering for every person looking for employment. The trade unions were appeased time after time until finally they obtained a stranglehold on industry. They would go on strike at the drop of a hat, and the Government refused to do anything ahout it. Working conditions were improved, and the working week was shortened. Now we have to pay for all that. The youth of the country was encouraged to take unskilled work for high pay, and that was one of the most diabolical things that could have been done. Now, many young men are feeling the effects of that policy, because they lack training and there is no demand for their services. The Communists were allowed to white-ant the key trade unions, with no hand raised against them by the Labour Government. Only when the present Government came into office was anything done to root out the Communists. The State governments were encouraged to waste money until they became important contributors to the growing inflation. flourished in petrol, potatoes, tea and building materials. The Labour Government encouraged the cost-plus system, under which building operations were spun out to an inordinate length. Many -buildings were started, but few were completed, and the skeletons of half-finished buildings were to be seen everywhere. 'Great power stations were commenced but not completed. Under the Labour -Government there was full employment, but no one had to work. There was blackmarket competition for labour, and industry, in an effort to survive, competed for the irresponsible labour that was available. Even governments were a party to the black market in labour. Mr ""WAKD -That is untrue. -know from my own experience. At that time, I was chairman of the Sydney -County Council, and we were trying to build the Pyrmont power station. It was originally estimated to cost £5,000,000. If is not yet finished, but the latest estiresulted in a terrible depression in which mate is that the final cost will be over £20,000,000, and the additional cost is largely a result of Labour policy. According to the legislation under which local, authorities operate, the Sydney 'County Council waa not allowed to pay more than award wages, but on those terms we were unable to get the labour we needed. We tried to "" scrounge"" building materials wherever they could be obtained, and we found it extraordinarily difficult to get labour. Indeed, the labour turnover exceeded 125 per cent, fn desperation, we approached the Labour Government in New South Walea, and I interviewed Mr Cahill, who was then Miniater for Local Government, and who is now Premier. When I put my case to 'him he replied, "" Well, you will, just have to do what other employers are doing; you will have to pay the excess price for labour"". That was the advice I received from the present Premier of New South Wales. We had to tear up the contracts that we had made, and enter into new ones which gave to the contractors liberty to engage labour at black-market rates. Much of the excessive coat of the Pyrmont power-houae ia due to that. During the period of ful l employment of which we have heard ao much, producBlack marketing tion steadily declined. Notwithstanding full employment, the payment of high overtime rates and the fact that a great deal of work was done during week-ends, the production rate fell until production per man-hour in Australia was the lowest of any country in the world, and that at a time when the people of Australia could not obtain many of the necessaries of life. Mushroom businesses sprang up all over the country, but hundreds of thousands of people could not get houses. Young people, because they could not get houses, bought motor cars. The people were encouraged to be irresponsible, and the national morale was seriously affected by over-full employment. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) invited the people to spend their money. would this policy have led the country if the present Government had not come into power? Any one with common sense knows that this mad policy would have all those with any stake in the country would have risked the loss of all their possessions. There would have been extraordinary currency inflation, or if that were to be avoided there would have to be absolute government control over labour, prices, and all forms of commercial -activity. In short, at that time, the liberty of the people w as at T stake, as it still is, insofar as there is any prospect of a Labour government getting into power again. The Labour Government, during the time of which I speak, gave no thought to defence preparations. This year, the present Government is providing for the expenditure of £200,000,000 on defence. I know that the individual hates giving up easy profits and black-market gains. The salesman hates to see the passing of condi tions in which no effort was required to sell his goods, but most people in their hearts realize that the conditions which prevailed when the Labour Government was in office were not in the national interest. They know that the policy of the present Government is tbe right one for Australia. As a result of the sacrifices required in the 1951-52 budget, tbe",37,Fiuidkss

91,Mr Cramer,"That is so. Wheremorale of the nation has visibly improved. A change has taken place and individual responsibility is returning. There has been a return to honest and efficient work. Management is pulling up its socks, and becoming more efficient. Buying has become more discriminatory, young persons are training themselves for jobs and prices are being stabilized. This Government will take the honest action that is needed to meet existing circumstances. I admit that it has not reduced taxation as much as it should like it to have done, but it has building industry adversely. If all contaken a step in the right direction. By reducing taxation, it has passed back to the people about £50,000,000, although ii; will expend this year £200,000,000 on defence. The Government knows that if it had reduced defence commitments by £50,000,000, it could have doubled the reduction of taxation, but would it have been justified in taking such action? I kuow that there are honourable members opposite who would urge the Government ro reduce the defence vote and make further tax concessions, but the Government has a sense of responsibility. It knows that unless Australia is prepared for defence, it will face a terrible possibility. ""We must be prepared so that we -sliall not be in danger of losing this country. If the Government did not provide the largest sum possible for defence, it would be recreant to its duty. It asks the people to understand rhe need, and to meet it by accepting a lesser reduction of taxation. The budget is well balanced. One section of the community is not treated more fairly than another by its provision?. Some persons may argue that this or that sliould havo been clone, but broadly it is a well balanced budget through which the people are to be treated with justice and fairness. AVhat are the Government's aims? ""When all is said and. done, the Government accepted a. big task when it took over the legacy thathad been left to it. The Government aims nt a free economy in which individuals will be given a chance. It seeks to restore rhe rights of individuals and of private enterprise so that people will get an adequate reward for their services and will be able to hold up their heads once more. It aims to remove arbitrary controls. The present generation knows nf Mr Cramer. little else but controls. The Government plans ultimately to remove those controls completely. In particular, I advocate the lifting of controls from the building industry. That would be one of the best contributions that could be made towards solving the problem of unemployment. Although some controls have been lifted, capital issues and central bank controls still affect the trols were lifted, the building industry would be free to solve its own problems, ""We should not always look to the Australian Government to provide all the money that is required. We should try to reduce the cost of government, which bas reached astronomical figures. They are beyond all reason and, in the end, will bring about a socialist State if the trend is not curbed. In 1938-39 the Australian Government expended £7S,7S8,000. Last year, expenditure from revenue totalled £655,563,000. In 1938-39, the States expended £128,764,000. Last year the States' expenditure had risen to £305,747,000. Of all government expenditure, only the cost of local government has not increased very much. The total cost of government in Australia rose from £33 10s. a head of population in 1939 to £123 a head last year. The number of government employees in Australia has risen from 418,341 in 1939 to 692,200 in 1952. This Government is aiming to reduce those figures. The Labour party was responsible for most of the increase and this Government has not made the numbers grow. In 1939, defence services cost £7,464,706. Last year the expenditure upon them from revenue was £148,067,44S. War and repatriation cost. £19,256,S12 in 1938-39, compared with £129,635,371 last year. Capital works and services in 193S-39 cost £6,565,268, compared with £123,4!6S,1SS last year. The cost, of social services rose from £1C,52S,396 in 1938-39 to £132,679,853 last year. I ask honourable members to consider where Australia is heading in relation to the cost of government. Some corrective action must be taken or we shall drift into a socialist State. The purpose of this Government is to unravel the socialist tangle which was caused by its predecessors over a period of nine years. The Government has the support of the people in seeking to achieve this purpose. I know that some sacrifice will be required, but I am sure that the people will understand the need for it. If a Labour government pledged to rhe principles that were enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition last night, displaces this Government, Australia will have nothing but a completely socialist State. .1 am sure that the people do not want that. I ask them to study current problems. The occasion is not one for catch-cries which are designed to mislead the people. The main question is whether the people are to live free lives in the future or whether they are to be hounded . and bounded by a socialist -State. The latter is what this Government is trying to avoid. I believe that the people will stand by the Government -at this critical stage when it has had to -<lo unpleasant things for the ultimate -good of the nation. -The budget tabled by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) last year, if properly analysed as presented, -could be said to have been designed to allay the effects of inflation in the Australian economy. About twelve months have since elapsed, ancl it is evident that inflation is still with us and that there is now aJso something new in the community-unemployment , insecurity and lack of confidence in commerce. I believe that the Treasurer accepts that as a fact, for in his budget speech last week rhe right honourable gentleman saidThere is still inflation. also been some loss of business confidence leadhonorable members opposite is that a ing to hesitancy about investment, and some transitional and sectional unemployment has appeared. In order properly to evaluate the effect of this budget we must examine the conditions that now exist in the Australian community. The first feature that we observe is that, despite the avowals of honourable members opposite, thousands of peopleI use the word "" thousands "" advisedly-wh o are able and willing to work, are not in employment. The second feature is that the immigration programme, which was initiated in a most humane way by the Labour Government and was administered by the former Minister for Immigration, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), is likely to be sabotaged because we cannot have an immigration programme and unemployment, at one and the. same time. If we endeavour to do so we arouse discontent in the community. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) said last night, the Labour party has sufficient confidence in the future ancl in the capacity of the Australian community to believe that we can and should have full employment and a successful immigration programme. At present there is unemployment of a very large order in the community. The third feature that we observe i? that business people and wage-earning sections of the community generally have lost confidence and that employers are suggesting that the wage increases have got out of hand ancl are' responsible for the evils that beset us. In order to provethat reasoning of that kind may be a little too glib, I point out for the reflection of honourable members opposite that although the basic wage increase made ir. April last was 3s., the following increase, made in July, was 12s. If increased prices result from wage increases alone, how can it be claimed that the increase of the basic wage by 3s. in April justified a further increase of that wage in the July quarter by 12s.? I mention these matters as a point of logic to those who suggest that the real nigger in the wood pile is the wages bill. It is true that food prices are increasing and that those increases are reflected in the basic wage, There has but the story that is bandied round by reduction of wages would provide the sole cure for inflation. The fourth feature to be observed i.» that the programmes of public works that are so necessary for our national development are in danger of being prejudiced by the wrangling that is going on between the Commonwealth and the States over the allocation of tax collections. What, is of more importance than the allocation of finance is whether the works that are included in the programmes are necessary for the development of Australia. These programmes should be. re-examined in view of the fact, that, for the first time",39,Fiuidkss
92,Mr Creak (Melbourne Ports) [5.39].,"for many years, we have idle resources of persons in the community. Finally, due to credit restrictions imdefence forces was 43,600, or a total of posed in the last budget, the supply of many important requirements of the community has been prejudiced. The most important of them in my view-the housing of the Australian people-is prejudiced by the fact that those who need houses are no longer in a position to buy them. Their need still exists but, for the rime beiug, the demand has been tapered uii' because the people who need houses have not the wherewithal to purchase them. It is all very well for the Government artificially to restrict incomes and then to say to the people, -'' If you have not the money with which to purchase a house, you do not need one "". That is not the sort of approach that -hould be made to the problem, in au enlightened community. Those who are without incomes do not derive much solace from the fact 'that this year taxpayers will not be asked to pay the 10 per cent, supertax on incomes, imposed last year. i\ or can they derive consolation from the r fact that the extraordinarily high rates of sales tax that were unjustly imposed in the last budget are to be slightly lowered. Honourable members opposite glibly claim that the members of the Labour party are calamity howlers because they allege that there is grave unemployment in the community. We .say unhesitatingly that the degree of unemployment is greater than the Government will, admit it to be. In a statement on the unemployment situation in the House last week the Minister for Defence members could ascertain for themselves the degree of in the community by reference to the official publications of the Commonwealth Statistician. I have accepted his invitation and shall cite some figures concerning unemployment so that honourable members may obtain a true conspectus of the impact of unemployment on the Australian community. official publications of the. Commonwealth Statistician show that in May, 1951. excluding employees in rural industries and private domestic servants, the number Ur. Crean. of civilian employees in Australia was 2,629,400, and that the number in the 2,673,000 persons, and that by May, 1952, the number of civilian employees had declined to 2,602,000 and that the number in the defence forces had increased to 67,700, or a total of 2,670,500 persons. Honorahle members opposite glibly interpret these figures to mean that the number of employed persons has dropped by only 2,500. Other factors must be taken into consideration in a community such as ours which believes in an expanding economy. Our population is increasing by natural births ancl by the arrival of immigrants, and consequently more people needed to be employed in May. 1952 than in May, 1951. It is of no use for honourable members opposite to sav that as many peonle are in employment to-day as were employed twelve months ago. The number employed to-day should be greater than the number employed twelve months ago. During the last twelve months employment has fallen by 2,500 and the decrease of civilian employment has been more or less absorbed by the increase that has taken place in the defence forces. Apparently, those who lost their employment were able to join those forces. At the moment, I shall not argue whether that is an ideal way to recruit our defence forces. The Commonwealth Statistician's figures show that during the same period Australia's population increased by 110,000 as a result of immigration. Assuming that approximately from 45per cont. to 55 per cent, of those immigrants were employable we can say that as a result of immigration the work force increased by 55,000. Next, the Commonwealth Statisunemployment tician's figures show that the number of males in the 15 to 65 years age group, plus 20 per cent, of women, which is the proportion of women in this group wbo usually work during periods of full employment, increased by from 15,000 to 20,000. I estimate that the work force has increased from that source The by approximately 18,000. Thus, on the most conservative estimate, Australia's labour force increased from May, 1950, to May, 1951, by approximately 75,000. Allowing for the fact that. 2.500 fewer",41,Fiuidkss
93,( Mr Mcbride) Said That Honourable,"persons were in employment in May, 1952, compared with tbe number employed in Mav. 1&51, the figures that I have cited indicate that the number of persons now unemployed in Australia would be of the order of 300,000, which approximates the estimate that the Leader of the Opposition made in his speech last evening. Eonorable members who represent industrial electorates will recall that the layingwas over-employment in some spheres off of employees was particularly heavy in June last. Factories at Fishermen's Bend, including many motor car organizations, put off from 200 to 300 employees in that month. If tlie number of unemployed in May was 75,000I have arrived at that figure on the most conservative estimate jn order to give to the Government the benefit of the doubt in this matter-it is safe to say that the number unemployed to-day is in the region of 100,000. Relating that figure to Australia's total lahour force, which the Minister for Defence in his statement on employment fixed at approximately 3,250,000, the order of unemployment in this country approximates the figure that he cited in respect of unemployment in Canada and the United States of America, that is, about 3 per cent, of the available labour force. Although unemployment may not appear at present to be substantial, all honourable members recognize that it has a tendency to snowball. Therefore, the Government should reflect move seriously upon this matter. The assumption made by the Minister for Defence that the function of the Commonwealth Employment Service is merely to supply the worker who can do the job vo tbe employer who wants the job done is altogether mo simple. Much more tha.n that is expected from an employment service. What is required in this respect wns reflected in the white paper on full employment that was tabled by the Leader of the Opposition in this House in May, 1945, when he was Minister for Rxterrial Affairs in the Chifley Government. The Government says that any unemployment that exists at present is only transitional. My colleague, the honourable member for Watson( Mr taken as the average for the threeOurtin) aptly pointed out that a person who ia unemployed does not derive much comfort from being told that his unemployment is transitional. The present so called transitional unemployment will rapidly assume far greater proportions if the Government remains inactive in this matter. The Government announced certain plans by means of which, it claimed, it would maintain employment to the maximum, but it has done nothing to implement them. It suggested that there and under-employment in others. The Government, by its policy, has certainly caused many persons to lose their employment, and it has made noattempt to place those persons in. other employment. One can only conclude that it has not in hand any proper plan to facilitate the flow of personsfrom places where their services are not required to places were, from the standpoint of the economy, their servicesmay be required. As a result the volume of transitional unemployment will increase at an uncontrollable rate and., consequently, the flow of purchasingpower in the community will decline.. This trend will be reflected in anincreased lack of industrial activity. Sitting suspended from 5.56 to 8 p.rri. of the sitting I outlined some statistics gleaned from official sources, which indicated that, after taking into account theflow of immigrants into Australia in the last twelve months and new entries into our labour market of people between 15 and 65 years of age, the true level of unemployment in Australia was something of the order of 75,000 at the end of May, 1952. Since then the position has deteriorated. It would not be an exaggeration to suggest that unemployment in Australia now is of the order of .100,000 persons, or about 3 per cent, of"" the labour force. We must take into consideration that Australia is not a static community. It is a growing country.. The Monthly Review of Business Statistics for Mav, 1952, contains a table in relation to the employment in factorieein Australia from the year 1936-37 onwards. The index figure 1,000 is years ended June, 1939. That tablegives a good indication of thelevel of employment generally in.",42,Fiuidkss
94,Mr Crean,"Prio r to the suspension!Australia. The index for July, 1950, was 1,410. For June, 1951, it was still 1,410. ForA p r i l , 1952, however, the index was 1,332. That shows that there has been a much greater decline of the level of employment in Australia than the Government has stated, and that the period of transitional employment is likely to be of long duration because of the failure of the Government to take the necessary measures to correct the trend. It indicates, also, the pragmatic approach that has been made by the Government to finance matters generally. The Government has no fixed views, and it does not know precisely where it is indicated clearly that the Government going. When the Treasurer introduced the budget last year, he also"" statedIn current circumstances, resort to such methods of finance would on all counts be thoroughly unsound and the Government has irrevocably set its face against it . The right honourable gentleman was referring to the expansion of bank credit. The term "" irrevocably"" was a rather foolish term for the Treasurer to use, in view of the frequency with which he has since changed his course. One thing that can be said about ""the presentation of accounts by the Government is that they are not presented in a for m to make Commonwealth Bank, where it ought to it easy for members of the Parliament, or people outside, to find out precisely what the Government has done during the year. The Australian Financial Reviewa Sydney Morning Herald publication-state s in its issue of the 17th July, that during the last financial year the Government did, in fact, expand credit by the use of treasury-bills to something of the order of £45,000,000. Despite that fact the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), in a speech that he delivered at the Brisbane CityH a l l recently, is reported in the same journal to have statedSome of the State Premiers say the answer supposed to be in existence, and the steps is to compel the Commonwealth Bank to write that are supposedly being taken by the out cheques to create new money for long-term public works. In other words, what these Government to redirect employment gentlemen say to us is: "" You give up the from where it is not wanted to fight against inflation. Go and create a few where it is wanted, many people are hundred million at the Central Bank. That experiencing difficulty in finding jobs, will satisfy us. It will do infinite harm to [t is time some of the mumbo jumbo, n? the people but it will satisfy us"". If they are not saying that, they must be saying: it were, that shrouds the presentation to "" Increase the taxes. Bring in more millions the Parliament of the accounts of the so that you may give them to us so that we nation was removed. Now, the budget is may be satisfied and won't go round saying the central point of the nation's economic the Commonwealth is cutting the works proifr. Crean. gramme and is creating unemployment"". The answer to that is: "" Increased direct taxation and inflation (which is a flat rate tax on everybody's money) are alike to be avoided"". However, in his budget speech the Treasurer statedWe consider it justifiable . . . that loan raisings for essential works of a truly developmental and productive kind should receive some special assistance from bank credit. Although the right honourable gentleman made no mention of how much or how little bank credit should be expanded, his words were indicative of the turnround that has been made hy this Government in its financial policy. They does not know precisely where it is going'. Consequently the people outside in the community, also, are not too sure about things. This is reflected in the so-called money market. It seems to me to be a contradiction for the Treasurer to talk about the expansion of credit, on the assumption that at some time during the next twelve months money may become tight, and at the same time to commit the people to a policy of dear money. The right honourable gentleman also foreshadowed an increase of interest rates. By transferring money from the be, to the private banks, the Government is virtually handing over the control, of interest rates to the private banks. I agree w i th the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition last night that f u l l employment and cheap money stand or f a l l together. F u l l employment had come to be regarded as the right of the Australian people. We have .seen that principle destroyed during the past twelve months. Now the Government is saying, in effect, "" The position is not too bad "". It is very bad for the men who are out of work. Despite the agencies which are life. This budget deals with the means by which the Government will handle roughly £1,000,000,000, or one-third of rhe national income. In a community siieh as ours, no government can thrive unless it takes the people into its confidence and tries to explain to them, without thought of political advantage, precisely what it is doing. ""When a budget is presented to the Parliament of Great Britain, there is presented also an analysis of the estimated economic progress of the nation, not for the past, twelve months but for the ensuing twelve months. There is published, for the use if thc man in the street, a popular version of that document, which, by means of graphs, charts and simple explanations, tells the story of the role that the budget is playing in the life of the community. It would be very difficult for this Government to do tliat, for the simple reason rhat it does not know what will happen. The last budget got out of focus because the Government failed to predict the way in which our balance of payments would move, and how Australian trade would flow during the ensuing twelve months. This budget also may get out of focu.= because the Government has no conception of the extent of unemployment in this community, and is taking no steps to a liny its effects. It does not matter how much a government reduces income tax or decreases sales tax if there arc people in the community who have nr i neome ancl, consequently, have no interest, in the prices of goods in the shops. In the long run, the level of employment in this community and the spending power of the people determine the economic tempo of the nation as a whole. The majority of the people in this country are wage-earners. Therefore, employment is the central fact of their lives. Employment is vital to them, not for the sake of .the job itself but for the sake of rhe wage that they derive from it, because with that wage they purchase the goods and services that they desire for themselves and their families. The business of budget making is more important i,o-day than it was ten or twelve years ago. The present budget deals with about £1.000,000,000, whilst seven to ten years ago the sum involved was £100,000,000. Prices have not yet increased tenfold, although they may do so if this Government remains in office for a little longer, but the increased rate of expenditure does indicate the central role that the Government plays in our economy. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Bowden) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. ister) [8.13] I begin by saying that it is no part of my function to-night to state the policy of the Government. That has been brilliantly stated, if the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) will allow me to say so, in the budget speech. I think I should not lose the opportunity to say that I congratulate the Treasurer of this country upon having, for twelve long months, survived a constant campaign of criticism, and sometimes of abuse, and then having brought down a budget that undoubtedly commands the overwhelming support of this Parliament and of the people. The real function that I have to-night is to deal with one or two of the issues that have heen isolated for us by the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). Anybody who reads the budget speech and the speech of the right honourable gentleman will, without too much trouble, discover the real points of conflict between the policy of the Government and the policy of the Opposition. BeforeI deal with those issues in a comprehensive way, I shall deal with two or three points of which the Leader of the Opposition made a great matter in the course of his speech last night. Honourable members will remember that he advanced an ingenious argument. I think that is not an unfair description of it. As I understood it, and I have read it carefully since, it was designed to show that the abolition of the 10 per cent, income tax levy, which I shall call roughly and not quite accurately a 10 per cent, cut in the personal income tax, is so illusory, to use his own word, that it will leave many or all of the taxpayers in the lower and middle income brackets worse off. He resorted to a mathematical procedure to establish that point. Not for the first time in my life, I thought that the best answer to a somewhat refined",43,Fiuidkss
95,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Prime Minuiathematical argument is a bit of horsesense. If the right honourable gentleman is so satisfied that the repeal of the 10 per cent, levy is actually injurious to the people in the lower and middle income brackets, will he restore it if he comes back into oflice? No question could be fairer than that. If he really believes that they will be worse off as a result of the repeal of the levy, obviously he would restore it. He cannot have it both way3. I ask another question, about which I should like every taxpayer in Australia to think. ""Would the taxpayers of Australia, or any of them, like us to continue the 10 per cent, levy? I am certain that if a Gallup poll were taken on that issue there would be a 100 per cent, vote in favour of what we are doing. Under those circumstances, the right honourable -gentleman will he a little hard put to it to satisfy people that the repeal of the 10 per cent, levy, so far from being of .advantage to people in the middle and lower income brackets, will actually be injurious to them. I describe that approach to the subject as a piece of horsefield with honourable members opposite. sense. Issues of that kind can be very -clearly understood. The next portion of the speech of the -right honourable gentleman that lends itself to some '.separate treatment was that sion, a new Commonwealth loan was in which he adverted to the Loan Council and to the works programme. He made -a couple of statements which were, quite inadvertently I am sure, utterly inaccurate. First, he said-referring to myself, I believe-that gentleman contended to the State Premiers that the works programme had to be limited to the amount of money that -could be raised from the public in the loan market. from the leader of an alternative government, deserves some consideration. The Leader of the Opposition said that I told the State Premiers that the works programme had to be limited to the amount that could be raised from the loan market. If he had said that about the Government of which he was a member., he would have heen right, because until this 'Government came into oflice the works programme was so limited. But to make :a statement of that kind about this Government, when he knows that last financial year not only did it not limit thc MT. Menzies. States to the amount tbe loan market would produce, but it actually found from its revenues £155,000,000 for the States works programme, is, I believe, as barefaced a piece of effrontery as I have ever experienced in this chamber. The fact is that the Treasurer and I said to the Loan Council that we did not propose to limit the works programme to the yield of the loan market. In other words, we said exactly the opposite to that which is now charged against us. In point of factand this is worth repeating over and over again-i u the last financial .year, had we not underwritten the State works programmes, and provided the States witb £155,000,000 more than the market was able to produce for them, we .should not have had to increase taxes in this country as we did. Then, warming up as the result of that extraordinary statementI say nothing more harsh than that about it-the right honourable gentleman went on to speak of the vacillation of the Government. That is now a favourite He said that this vacillation was shown by the fact that when a -semi-governmental loan was being raised in Victoria for the State Electricity Commisannounced at a higher rate of interest. 1 do not know how that demonstrates vacillation. The fact is that the Victorian Government had secured the underwriting of a loan for the State the right honourable Electricity Commission, and during that time, a new Commonwealth loan had to be raised. The Commonwealth loan did not have to be raised during the currency of the State loan, but it had to That statement, coming be discussed by the Loan Council before -the period of the semi-governmental loan had ended. The Loan Council determines the rate of interest on Commonwealth loans. That is not the function of the Victorian Government. The State Premiers, by virtue of their six votes at Loan Council meetings, determine the rate of interest on Commonwealth loans, and until, the occasion to which I am now referring, it had always been understood tliat, while communications were being exchanged between the States and the Commonwealth on the subject of interest rates, the matter was of the highest order of secrecy. I need only tell the House that the disclosure of the proposed rate of interest Sydney. It is a little odd to me to be told that the disaster to the State Electricity Commission of Victoria which was occasioned by that disclosure, was due to our vacillation when, in fact, it was due to a gross breach of faith by the Government of New South Wales. I shall not be able to refer to all the points that the Leader of the Opposition made, but there are a few that should be disposed of at the earliest possible moment. The right honourable gentleman summoned up his spirits sufficiently to say that the Commonwealth's decision to return to the States their taxing powers was the result of mere political pique with the State governments. The right honourable gentleman himself comes from New South Wales. I have always understood that, disunited as we of the Liberal party and Australian Country party may be, members of the Labour party are as close as brothers. Therefore, L suggest that I can assume that members of the party that the riglit honourable gentleman leads in this Parliament, and of the Labour party in New South Wales are as close as brothers. I wonder whether the Leader of the Opposition knows that, at each conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers that has been held during the three years that have passed since I came back to oflice the Premier of New South Wales who, I remind the committee, has always been a Labour Premier in those years, has invariably begun proceedings by saying, "" We want our taxing powers back"". Does the Leader of the Opposition know that a similar proposal has been put forward by the Labour Premier of Queensland, and the Labour Premier of Tasmania, although, in the latter instance, not with very much heart? Does the right honourable gentleman know that this demand has been made alsoby the Premiers of the other States?' Is he going to tell me that all the Premiers have been sneaking with their tongues in the'r cheeks? Is he going to fell me that the Premiers were just engaging in political propaganda? Is he going to offend them by saying that they did not mean a word of what they said, and that when we took them at their word they almost dropped dead? Is that the right honourable gentleman's proposition ? There need be no mystery about it. The truth is that the Premiers have been howling for the return of their taxing powers and, if I may say so, howling quite rightly. Probably some of them are not quite so sure about the matter now, but I think they were right in seeking a return of their taxing powers because I believe that, under a federal system, if there is to be responsible government, those who spend the money ought, as far as possible, to have the responsibility of raising it. It is ridiculous to have the State governments saying of various projects within tlieir own borders "" Yes, it is a splendid show"", "" It is a beautiful irrigation scheme"", "" You should have this hospital "", or "" You should have this school, and we would love you to have it "" , and then for them to add "" But we cannot get the money from the Commonwealth because the Commonwealth has stolen our right to control our own revenues "". There is a simple answer to that proposition. It is that the States should have the right to control their own revenues. For the State colleagues of the Leader of the Opposition to be saying "" Give us back our taxing power "", while the right honourable gentleman himself says to the Government ""Don't you dare give them back their taxing powers, because I am sure you would only be doing it to embarrass them "" must be one of the most remarkable pieces of cross-trumping in the history of debate. The Leader of the Opposition made a great issue of unemployment. In fact he made the issue. That, perhaps, showed shrewd judgment on his part. He knows that everybody in this country wants maximum employment, and that everybody hates the idea of people being without the means of earning a living. Therefore employment is a good point; but it does not become any better when it is bolstered up by a series of propositions that' will not stand examination. For instance, the right honourable gentleman said that the Commonwealth Employment Service, which, after all, was established by a government of which he was a member, bad been sluggish. I shall not",45,Fiuidkss
96,Came From Mr Mcgirr's Cabinet In,"endeavour to quote his exact words, hut his complaint was that the Commonwealth Employment Service had been lacking in activity, had been much too passive in dealing with the problem of employment, and should have been finding jobs for people. In view of that charge against a great body of public servants, I thought that I should ascertain the facts and I did so. I found that, so far from merely recording employment figures as the right honourable gentleman suggested, officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service have been successful in obtaining well over 4,000 new jobs every week for workers in this country. Since the drive to place immigrant and Australian, workers in food production commenced some months ago, the Commonwealth Employment Service, which has been criticized so harshly by the Leader of the Opposition, has found more than 3,000 farm jobs. I mention those facts, which are by no means overstated -the figures might easily be extended by taking other factors into account-to show how wrong it was for the Leader of the Opposition to seek to bolster up his case against the Australian Government by suggesting that the Commonwealth Employment Service, by direction or otherwise, I do not know, had failed to do its duty. Of course, it is not surprising, because the right honourable gentleman, quite early in his speech, set out to prove, by what he called an official statement but which turned out to be an anonymous one, that the policy of this Government was to create unemployment. It may be that there are people in this country who, in their discomforts and their troubles, will be tempted to believe that statement. I want to say at once that I do not believe that one could find in this Parliament, or in any political party here, any twenty men to form a government who would deliberately set out to put people out of work. I think that it is a foul allegation of simple inhumanity. That is all! It does not deceive anybody, except the wildest partisans or the most irresponsible of the right honourable gentleman's supporters. May I continue to say a few words on body to tell me that fact. But I say the subject of unemployment? My right that those figures have always shown the honourable friend, in the course of his trends pretty accurately, because of all the speech, indicated, little as he may organized bodies of labour, the trade Mr Menzies. like it, that just as in our budget last year we set out to strike a blow against inflation and took some political risks in the course of doing so, this year we have said that we have now reached the stage at which we must pursue a studied and balanced course. I venture to believe that most sensible Australians want us to do so. It is a course in which we continue to oppose inflation by such means as we have, and in which we watch the symptoms of unemployment, and are alert to deal with them as they arise. I admit that it is a delicate task and a balanced task. Nobody ever supposed that the business of government was easy. Nobody except a fool ever supposed that one can take something out of a bottle of patent medicine and pour it into the body politic, and that all will be right. Of course, we have a difficult task, but this budget is, I believe, a splendid example of how such a difficult task should be attacked. Naturally, it is not the business of the Leader of the Opposition to think that this is a good budget, or even that it has any merits. I understand that point of view. I was the Leader of the Opposition once, and so I do not quarrel with that view as a piece of technique, but he gains nothing in his argument by overstating it. He gains nothing in his discussion of unemployment by endeavouring to create the impression that this country is already a howling wilderness of unemployment. There is only one way in which mass unemployment can be created in this young country at this time, with all the jobs in front of us that have to be done, and that is by howling about it and creating a psychology of depression. I have not the faintest doubt that that is the new Opposition technique for this sessional period of the Parliament. There was a time when we used to ascertain the volume of unemployment by looking at the trade union figures. I am familiar with the argument that those figures are not complete and exhaustive, and that they apply to only a limited number of persons. I do not want anyunions are in the best position to know what is happening to their members, and, therefore, the trends that are appearing. I bave not the up-to-date-statistics, but I .notice in the trade union figures in th« -Quarterly Summary of Australian Stal-is-lics, published in March, 1952. which is the latest issue that I have been able to obtain, that the position is not quite so good as it was: but -! also notice that thf percentage of trade union unemployment reported in 1947, a year which the Leader of the Opoosition should recall, since at that time he was a very senior Minister in the then Government, was 1.2, and that in March of this year, it was 1.1. I quite agree that there have been fluctuations and movements downwards-of course there have-bu t for the right honourable gentleman to set out to create a scare in this country on a figure strictly comparable with a figure in 1947, when he was using his eloquence on every platform to say that a marvellous job was being done by his own Government and that the economy was never better, seems to me to be, in the homely phrase, a little over the odds. That is not the only statement that can be made. I asked for the figures showing the number of persons in receipt of the unemployment benefit. That is a pretty close figure, because the delay, in point of time, is small. I obtained thosefiguresso that the people of Australia may put these statements in tlieir proper context, for they are quite illustrative. We were not in office in July, 1946. A great and powerful Labour government was in office at that time. On its own admission, it was the best government that the world had ever seen. In July, 1946, 32 workers in eveisy 10,000 were in receipt of the unemployment benefit. That is not a bad form in which to put the position, because it gives a clear picture. When people start to talk about percentage. , 3 it is, perhaps, a little confusing. However, in July, 1946, 32 workers in every 10,000 were in receipt of the unemployment benefit. In July, 1947, eighteen workers in every 10,000 were in receipt of the unemployment benefit. In June nf this year, 23 workers in every 10,000 were receiving the unemployment benefit. Ou the 2nd August this year, which is and certainly within the last twelve very up to date, 45 workers in every months, when the right honourable gentle10,000 were in receipt of the unemployment benefit. I have been long enough in this Parliament, and long enough immersed in the problems of this country, to remember the kind of subject that we had to discuss in the bad days of the last depression, and, in common with everybody else in this country, I do not want to see those bad days come back again. But to exaggerate the current problem of unemployment when, in point of fact, it is a degree of unemployment, is either to display a terrible ignorance of the economic facts, or to set out on a deliberate campaign to promote unemployment for political advantage. The right honourable gentleman said, on the dubious authority of some anonymous oflicial statement to which he referred, that we had deliberately planned unemployment, and I have dealt with that matter. I merely .return to it to say that it is poisonous nonsense. The rigbt honourable gentleman does not believe that about this Government. Yet he says that we deliberately planned unemployment. When he came to develop that theme he said that he knew that we had deliberately done so because we had adopted capital issues control and credit control, which were designed to transfer the weight of employment from the less important industries to the more important ones. Does he really quarrel with the idea that when the economy of a country is out of balance one should encourage employment in important things and not in unimportant things? If he does not quarrel with it, then it must. involve people moving from one form of employment to another; but if he does quarrel with it, then he must do so on the basis that all is lovely in the garden, that we have no economic problems at all, and that he is quite content for people to go along doing trivial and irrelevant tasks when vital industries in this country are being starved of labour. If that is what he means, let him say so. I never mind what the right honourable gentleman says if I think he means what he says. But why should he not come ""lean on this matter ? There was a time, not so very long ago, man and some of his more thoughtful supporters were talking about inflation and challenging this Government for not dealing with it. Indeed, just as their '-in-rent catch cry is ""unemployment"", so iheir catch cry six months ago was "" What are you doing, about inflation?"" As I have the greatest respect for the integrity of their approach, I must assume that i hey meant what they said and that they >vere concerned about inflation. If they were, it might be interesting some day to know what they would do about it. I 4iall come shortly to the. right honourable gentleman's formula, which is to inflate the way out of inflation. I shall come back to that subject, because it deserves close examination. Do not honourable gentlemen opposite appreciate that inflation is going on? The Leader of the Opposition obviously does, because he made it the whole basis of his argument ou incoine tax. But for the fact that there is inflation, his income tax argument would have been foolish. He, therefore, cannot deny that there is inflation, nor, for that matter, can anybody else. Certainly, no housewife in this country would deny that there is inflation. Do the right honourable gentleman and his -supporters realize that because of inflation of costs in this country, we can ultimately price ourselves out of our overseas markets.? Do not they realize that ro some extent we have already done so? ! r. is all right for the right honorahle i-'entleman to show, as he did, a complete disregard for the primary industries, but 1 wish to remind him that the primary commodities, a profitable market for which is so vital tp Australia, provide the overwhelming hulk of our overseas income II nd are the chief prop of our existence us a trading nation. Does he display any anxiety to know whether, because .of rising costs, we shall ultimately he put of the business of exporting meat or, perhaps some day, wool, except under subsidy? These are tremendously vital ipiestions to this country. Any government which displays an indifference to the effect of rising prices ancl costs on the export interests of the country does not deserve to be a government for two minutes. To come back again to the cities, does not the right honourable gentleman appreciate that rising costs in Australia can Mr Menzies. price many people put of .& job.? I hear a good deal about the building industry, and I could not agree more that that industry is one of the great barometers of employment in Australia. It is of the utmost importance. But would anybody d eny that one of the factors in the slackening demand for buildings has been the fantastic prices to which houses have risen, or the fantastic costs which are involved to-day in building a. house? Therefore, will anybody deny that if one allows tbe inflationary process to continue-as the right honourable gentleman would allow it to do-it is possible to price every builder's labourer out of a job? At a certain stage of his speech the right honourable gentleman -came to the conclusion that w.e had gone wrong on import control. I am very indebted to him for his criticism which, I must say. I heard for the first time after we had taken our decision. Therefore, it is a perfect example of hind sight. When the right honourable gentleman was thinking about this matter and developing his theme, he said something to the effect that we should encourage the production of more commodities in Australia and also encourage the export industries. It is a very easy matter, indeed, tp stand on a platform and to make a pretty speech about encouraging export industries. It is easy tp use these rather desiccated phrases of the study, or the somewhat less desiccated phrases of the soap box; but it is a different matter to put into effect, actual financial proposals which are designed to operate as an incentive to the man on the land. I merely wish to say, without labouring anything, that in the present .calendar year this Government, so far from paying lip service to primary industry, has done at least eight things of value to the man on the land as an incentive to him to increase his production by increasing the means of production. It was not this Government which produced provisional tax. There was a stage last year when I mel a number of my erstwhile friends who seemed to think that we had invented it. I reminded them that we had not done so, but that it was invented by a government of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member. What we did in March this year was to defer .provisional tax in respeot of primary producers, other than wool-growers, who had suffered loss through drought, hush fires or outbreaks of stock diseases. The wool-growers received a. general deferment because of the lapse of prices, which cost us £50,000,000, in 1951-52. In March of this year we introduced, for the first time in the history of this country, a special depreciation allowance of 20 per cent, per annum in respect of farm machinery, accommodation for farm employees, buildings for fodder conservation, and certain irrigation materials. allowance of 20 per cent, for five years is one of the finest depreciation provisions ever made for a primary industry anywhere in the world. It was in May of this year that we announced and brought in our scheme of self-assessment for provisional tax for the financial year 1952-53, which is a tremendous boon to people such as primary producers whose incomes are so likely to fluctuate from year to year. This month w'e have abolished, to the great regret of the Leader of the Opposition, the 10 per cent, income tax levy. We have, in this very budget, introduced a concession to parents for education expenses which will be appreciated by thousands of people. The Government, has proposed to repeal the land tax law. 'I.'he Leader of the Opposition does not like that proposal very much. The Government also has undertaken to make substantial reductions in sales tax, partition of this tax. If they are, they will, cularly in the case of goods used by primary industry. It has proposed to spread insurance recoveries on live-stock over a period of five years for income tax purposes. That is not a bad record, for one year of practical incentives to the man on. the land. The right honourable gentleman cannot refute that fact by stating, in effect, that the primary indusimputed to the Leader of the Opposition tries do not matter, and that only the factories are important. Just as my interest in the right honorBank to provide that money or, to be able gentleman's speech was beginning to flag, he said that he would put forward a positive policy. As this proposal had all tbe charm of noveUy for honourable members we listened to see what it would be. I did not hear the right bonorable gentleman propose a reduction in expenditure. I assume from the general text of his speech that he is aware -of the problems associated with defence and that he therefore does not propose that defence .expenditure should be reduced -during this financial year. But he did propose an increase of othsr budget expenditure. He proposed .increases of social services and repatriation payments. He did not say by how much they should be increased, but I am certain that the right honourable gentleman would not take up our time by talking about trifles. Presumably he would That make a substantial increase in those votes. Perhaps we could assume that he would recommend another £20,000,000 for this great group of services. That seems to be a modest estimate. The right honourable gentleman then alleged that the proposed reductions in'taxation were not great enough. Apparently he would eliminate the pay-roll tax or reduce it. He said that the proposed reduction in income tax would be no reduction. If I had alleged that a 10 per cent, reduction amounted to nothing I should think that I would have to support a reduction of at least 20 per cent. Such a reduction in taxation would amount to £40,000,000. The right honourable gentleman stated that he opposed the repeal of the land tax. Therefore, I ask him, if his party is returned to oflice in 1954, will it reimpose the land tax ? It would be very interesting to know whether Opposition members are really opposed to the abolito use a common phrase, have to "" stand up and be counted "". Do they intend to re-impose this tax? I have never known the Opposition to be more silent than it is now that I ask that question. The increases of expenditure and the reduction of taxation revenue that I have would result in a budget deficit of about £60,000,000. On the basis of his own remarks, he would ask the Commonwealth more accurate, he would order the bank to provide it. .Sixty million pounds of new money would be created. The right honourable gentleman could search the civilized world without finding one responsible financial authority who would support the proposal that a government should incur a deficit such as that during the progress of what he himself has described as an inflationary spiral. The £45,000,000 worth of treasury-bills which the Government issued last year were a mere trifle compared with the amount of new money that the right honourable gentleman would issue and which would not represent the product of anything but an order by him. Then, warming to his work, the Loader of the Opposition proceeded to deal with public works expenditure. Australian Government and State government loan works programmes for the current financial year, excluding semi-governmental works which are enormous, and will cost £190,000.000. That amount is at least three times as great as the average amount ""provided by the previous Government for this purpose during tbe last three years of its existence. The right honourable gentleman knows perfectly well that the Government has supported these works programmes because it knows, as the State Premiers know, that the loan market will not produce £190,000,000. It was estimated that the market would furnish about £50,000,000 plus £5,000,000 in domestic raisings by the States, so the Australian Government undertook to find an additional £135,000,000. second greatest contribution that has ever been made by the Commonwealth to the States. times as much as any contribution that the previous Government ever made to the States. But these facts do not satisfy the Leader of the Opposition. If he had told the Government that it must be ready to increase oublic works programmes if grave unemployment occurred, I should agree with him. But that is not what he has said. He has said that at least £270,000,000 must be provided for public works at fhe very first, slight, symptoms of unemployment. I warn Opposition members that if , in tbe immeasurable wisdom and compassion of Providence, they get into oflice again, they will have to think about some of their leader's proposals. A government cannot borrow money from the people unless tbey are wi'ling to lend it. The loan market in Australia has been ^fr. Menzies. tremendously strained in modern times. It is ill and many people have told the Government that if it wants to borrow money it will have to pay a price for it. Oddly enough, one of them is the Labour Premier of New South Wales, a colleague of my right honourable friend. Another is his colleague, the Premier of Tasmania. During the last week or two each of those gentlemen has successfully raised money for a semi-governmental purpose by offering £4 10s. and £4 12s. 6d. per cent. They apparently have none of the inhibitions suffered by the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition about interest rates. They said-poor , simple, uninformed fellows-to their advisers, "" We want money; what is the price of money to-day, Tom ?"" The advisers probably said, "" You will get it if you pay per cent, or 4} per cent."" They accordingly went out into tbe money market and got it. I understood the right honourable gentleman to say that the bond rate should be pegged at 3f per cent. per cent. stating his argument, but I do not need to exaggerate when dealing with a matter such as this, so I shall call it 3f per cent. That was the Has the right honourable gentleman an; conception of what happens in the loan market? Has he no information about It is exactly 135 the activities of the Central Bank if the market is to be kept at a reasonable level? Does he not know that he cannot have his way-unles s something completely unforeseen happens-excep t by putting more into the money market than he gets from it? When he talks about pegging the interest rate, at a time when the market yield is much higher than the loan yield and when every State Premier has offered far more than he considers should be offered, he is adopting the attitude of not desiring to borrow public moneyand that is his true position. He wants £60,000.000 for his deficit, and £270,000,000 for public works. That is £330^000,000, so far, that he intends to order the Central Bank to produce. I venture to describe that proposal as depression finance at the very first sign of unemplovment. It is a proposal to abandon altogether counter-inflationary",47,Fiuidkss
97,Mr Cramer,Thre e and one-eightli,52,Fiuidkss
98,Mr Menzies,"Perhaps I am overaction. It gives the whole show awav. It says quite forcibly, "" We are now ia the depths of a depression, we are now 'n the depths of a deflation, therefore let us inflate our way o u t If that is statesmanship, then, to use the homely phrase, I ' l l eat my hat. However, the right honourable gentleman's argument does not end there because he wants the system, of uniform taxation to remain and he wants the States to continue to use moneys raised by the Commonwealth, tf the States have expensive ideas like his, and Lord knows two or three of them have, then State deficits would be involved, and special grants would have to be made to the States out of central bank credit to the tune of £30,000,000, £40,000,000 or £50,000,000. That proposition, that the right honorAustralian people that the Prime Minisable gentleman has put before the Parliament as a constructive programme in an admitted period of inflation, contemplates a treasury-bill issue of anything between £350,000,000 and £400,000,000. He has put that forward against a balanced and flexible programme to counter inflation, to assist employment and to exercise constant watchfulness over our economy. The right honourable gentleman's crazy programme-becaus e with great respect 1 must describe it as such-of wild inflaPrime Minister has misquoted and mistion would have two results. First, there would be a cessation of borrowing and investment from abroad because people do not invest their money in foreign countries that are unstable. If the right honourable gentleman wants his programme to be put into effect let him forget about borrowing from outside Australia to help to finance it. Secondly, he has forgotten that £400,000,000 of new treasury-bill money could not be thrown into the banking structure without increasing the liquidity of the banks so greatly and so suddenly that there would be, as tbe late Leader of the Opposition, whose name he is so fond of invoking, said, "" Secondary inflation of great danger to the country"". His late leader feared that kind of secondary inflation, and because he feared it be established the whole system of special accounts for the trading banks and tbe system of giving the protection of the central bank to the trading banks. Both of tliose matters were referred to by the right honourable gentleman-in the hope of getting a vote from somewhere-as harsh, cruel and unnecessary. Any speech made by a leader of an opposition deserves consideration, and when it is made in a budget debate it deserves extra consideration because such a debate deals with the vital finances of the nation. I say that the policy of the Opposition, if it is the policy of the Opposition that its leader has put forward is one of the most disastrous, the most irresponsible and the most unreal policies that has ever been presented to the people of Australia. [9.6] -On some similar occasions in the past it has been necessary to warn the ter ( Mr Menzies) is a word-spinner, but that his words cannot be relied upon. That warning is not necessary to the people to-night, because the melancholy fact is known to every one. The great promiser has become the great deceiver and to-hight he has endeavoured to escape the wrath to come by assuming the role of the great distorter. He will not get away with that, because the people are no longer in a mood to be fooled. The stated some of the arguments of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), and he has totally ignored other arguments of the right honourable gentleman. Therefore, he has not produced a real answer to any of the arguments put forward by the Opposition. The Prime Minister, in this critical hour of our history, has used this occasion as another opportunity for jokes and for arousing the laughter of his supporters. What a fatal mistake for him to make! What extraordinary egotism blinds him so much to the realities of the economic situation that has been created by himself. In this chamber we are warm, well clothed and fed;' but there are aged and invalid people, unemployed men and women in this community who are not in that happy state. They lack suflicient food, fuel and clothing because of their reliance on the pledges given to them by this Prime Minister who has joked",52,Fiuidkss
99,Mr Allan Fraser (Eden,"Monaro)and fooled his way through this debate. Those people will take it ill that the man who has deceived them should think the occasion one for laughter. They will not see the joke. Perhaps they have not that particular kind of humour. Now, when public confidence is an important factor in the economic crisis, the difference in the attitude of the two leaders who have spoken is notable. All honourable members in this House will agree, whether they subscribe to his views or not, that the Leader of the Opposition spoke seriously and constructively. His arguments were clear and honest and they were not overstated. He did not seek at any stage to score an unfair point. He put to this committee and to the nation a consistent, logical, clear and courageous programme for the improvement of the economic position of Australia. To-night the Prime Minister has indulged in extraordinary distortions of the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition. remarkably foolish distortion that was obvious to everybody who had heard the Leader of the Opposition speak last night, and tried to pretend that the right honourable gentleman had said that the repeal of the 10 per cent, tax levy would be injurious to taxpayers in the tower and middle income groups. He wound up hy challenging the Leader of the Opposition to say that he would restore the 10 per cent. levy. What the Leader of the Opposition said last night was clear beyond all doubt. He pointed out that the man who received £600 last year now receives £700 a year solely because of cost of living adjustments. That man to-day obtains for £700 the same basket of goods and services for which he formerly paid £600 but, because the Govermnent has not correspondingly altered the tax rates, it now takes, at the have needed to impose one penny of addi£700 rate, a larger share of that basket of goods and services than it took at the €600 rate. That is a comparison over a period of twelve months only, if the illustration were extended back over three years, it woud be even more startling. This has been an insidious and backdoor method of imposing tremendous taxation increases. That is what the Leader of the Opnosition pointed out last Mr Allan Fraser. night. He also produced completely accurate tables to show that, because of this method, every taxpayer in Australia who receives an income of £2,000 or less this year will, despite the repeal of the 10 per cent, levy, pay more in actual income tax than he was required to pay last year on the same real income. That is the substance of the argument that the Prime Minister endeavoured to distort. Every argument that he used to-night is suspect in the light of that attempt at misrepresentation. The right honourable gentleman talked about the loan market. The difference between this Government and the former Labour Government is that the Labour Government could raise money in the loan market because it held the confidence of the people. The Prime Minister falsely accused the Leader of the Opposition of having said that he had told the Premiers that their works programmes must be limited to the amount that could be raised in the loan, market. That is not what the He began with a Leader of the Opposition said. He said something entirely different, and the difference lies in one word, which the Prime Minister was careful not to use. The statement by the Leader of the Opposition is on record. When he was talking about the Government's refusal to use bank credit for public works in a period of developing unemployment, he said that the Prime Minister had told the Premiers that their works programmes had to be limited by the amount that could be raised in the loan market. That fact disposes of another distortion of tiie truth by the Prime Minister. The right honourable gentleman then went on to make the most extraordinary statement of all, which, in my opinion, damned him completely. He said, that, if the Governmenthad not had to provide £150,000.000 from revenue for State works last year, it wonld not tional taxation for 1951-52. That was not theexcuse that the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) used last year for the imposition of additional taxes. I point out that the Government this year does not propose to provide from revenue any portion of that amount of £150,000,000 for State public works. Then why, on tbe authority of the Prime Minister's statement, does not the budget for 1952-53 provide for a reduction of taxation by £150,000,000? The right honourable gentleman has defeated himself utterly out of his own mouth. He went on to make many similar distortions. It is impossible for rue to follow him through the whole Vise. He said that unemployment figures to-day were strictly comparable with those of 1947. That is not true. statement he made. I have here the official figures of registrations for unemployment benefit for each month of 1947 and for the week ended the 2nd August, 1952. That figure was 15,391. In 1947, the figure in various weeks were 3,400, 2,500, 4,300, 6,200, 4,391, and so on. Why does the Prime Minister try to mislead the Parliament and the nation in this way? The fact is that the rate of unemployment benefit to-day is so low that the Government has recognized the need to double it, and even that will not restore to it the purchasing power of the benefit in 1947. Unemployed workers to-day do not register for this miserable relief payment until all other hope has gone and their savings have been exhausted. The Prime Minister said that the Leader of the Opposition had proposed that we should inflate ourselves out of inflation. I wonder that the Prime Minister dares to speak to this nation of inflation ! He is the arch-priest of inflation, the man who assumed office three years ago on a promise to defeat inflation but who has allowed inflation to reach such record heights as to endanger the whole economic situation of the nation. He purported to quote the Leader of the Opposition as having said that primary industries did not matter. Is there anybody within my hearing to-night who does not know that what the Leader of the Opposition said last night was the exact opposite of that? He reproached the Government and charged it with liaving shown, in its budget, ""no proper concern for vitally important primary industries. The Prime Minister talked in fantastic terms about the proposals of the Leader of the Opposition for the use of bank credit and, as he went on to put crazy notion on top of crazy notion, inventing his own interpretations of the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition, my mind went back to exactly similar statements that were made by his predecessors in 1929 and 1930, when wise use of bank credit could have saved this country from terrible depression and great suffering. I suggest that we leave the Prime Minister to his arrogance, his insolence and his personal malevolence as he sinks towards the defeat to which the nation undoubtedly will condemn him. But, before we do so, I remind the committee of a betrayal that I consider to be of tremendous importance. I refer to the one pledge which, above all others surely, should have been honoured by the Government, the pledge that the present Prime Minister and the Treasurer mouthed to the recipients of social services. They declaredThe value of all social services will be at least maintained; indeed, it w ill be increased. Pensioners can rely on us for justice. Here are the sorry facts. The budget of 194S-49 provided for age and invalid pensions at the rate of £2 2s. 6d. a week. The basic wage was then £5 16s., so that the pension rate was 39 per cent, of the wage rate. The budget of 1951-52 provided for a pension rate of £3, which represented 31 per cent, of the basic wage, which was £9 9s. The present budget provides for a pension rate of £3 7s. 6d., which represents 29 per cent, of the basic wage of £11 7s. For the purposes of this comparison I am using the basic wage average for the six capital cities, which is the fairest figure from the point of view of the Government. 'The basic wage has increased by £1 18s. since the budget of 1951-52 was introduced. The pension rate has increased over the same period by 7s. 6d., or only 20 per cent, of the demonstrated increase of the cost of living over the same period. In order to provide pensioners to-day with the equivalent of the 194'8 pension, in terms of the promise that was made by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, the rate of pension would have to be increased to £4 9s. a week. The payment of £3 7s. 6d. instead of £4 9s. constitutes robbery of",53,Fiuidkss
100,Mr Mcbbide,He did not say that.,55,Fiuidkss
101,"Mr Allan"" .Fraser","That was thethe pensioners. The Government has thrust them lower in the social and economic scale than anybody -with any sense of justice, humanity, or personal honour, having made the promise that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer made, would even contemplate. Let us consider child endowment, in respect of which equally glowing promises were made. .The rate of endowment, when this payment was introduced by an anti-Labour Government in 1941, was 5s. a week. That represented .6 per cent, of the basic wage of £4 6s. a week. The rate of child endowment in 194S was 10s., or 9 per cent, of the basic wage of £5 16s. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer promised at least to maintain the value of child endowment, and, indeed, to increase it. But to-day, the rate still remains at 10s., which represents only 4$ per cent, of the basic wage of £11 7s. The equivalent in purchasing power of the 1948 rate would to-day be 20s. 5d. We come now to the means test. This was the promiseWe propose to abolish the means test. We appropriate use of community revenues will introduce our plan in 1952. Meantime, for social purposes. It is the only tax existing means test limits will at least be which in no way discourages productive maintained and their true value increased. And here is the performance, which I set effort but, on the contrary, encourages out in the following table:l'ermissible Income. £ «. December, 1949 , 1 10 August, 1951 August, 1952 1 10 0 11 7 0 13 Equivalent of 1919 rate would now he £2 12s. The property bar against full pension has remained unadjusted, until to-day it constitutes the most savage penalty on thrift that was ever imposed, because the reduction of the pension rate operates as soon as the value of the property owner reaches £110. In that respect, the pensioner's standard of living has been forced to a lower level than was thought proper at the very inception of the pensions scheme in 1909, when the pension of 10s. a week, plus a permissible income of 10s, was 45 per cent, of the then basic wage. Surely there is only one permissible excuse for a strong man breaking his Mr Allan Fraser. pledged word to the weak and helpless who have trusted him. It is that the pledge was given in good faith but that, despite every endeavour to fulfil it, circumstances have made it impossible to do so. That excuse is not available to the Prime Minister. Actually, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer found themselves with money to spare. They could have used it to honour their pledge to the pensioners. Instead, they have preferred to abolish the land tax, and their action represents a £7,000,000 share-out among a few thousand big city and rural landowners. It is no wonder that the Government has lost the confidence of the people. The Leader of the Opposition has clearly shown that the abolition of the land tax is entirely unjustified. The Government was under no obligation to abolish the tax. No promise in respect of it had been made in the policy speech. If any promise was given it was a secret promise, one not known to the people. Such a tax on the unimproved value of land is a proper social use of the taxing instrument, and represents an entirely and assists it. Yet, at the very time when increased production is a claimant need linse Percenthis is the one tax the Government has Wage. tage. chosen to e l i m in a t w h i l e leaving all taxes on productive effort still at oppressive heights. d. £ 8. d. o/fit 0 0 9 0 23 -It is especially wrong that the tax 1 10 0 9 9 0 16 should be abolished at this time when the basic need of the nation is increased food production. It will impede the resumption of land on just terms, and will tend to prevent the bringing into production of large areas of suitable land already served by ports, harbours, transport, roads and other amenities. At the same time the withholding of money needed for the continuation of the State works programmes in rural areas will prevent the opening up of new land. If the Government wishes the farmer to increase food production it must first get off his neck. The farmer needs no elaborate governmental organization, He needs mainly access to land, profitable prices, assistance in obtaining equipment, basic community facilities for his family, and an assurance that he will be permitted to retain at least a reasonable share of the wealth which he has produced by his own efforts. Given those assurances, the farmer will do the rest. The situation is urgent for two reasons-first , because the world is hungry, and population is outpacing food production. misery and hunger, and thousands of tons of explosives cannot win the battle in such a case. The struggle with communism, one in which Australia must play its part, is a struggle for the minds of men, and violent courses make their appeal to men whose children's stomachs are empty. Secondly, there is urgency because the time is approaching when Australia will not even meet its own food needs and, in the words of Bishop Young, famine can starve to death every one of our institutions-social , political, economic and cultural. The Treasurer, in a rallying call towards the end of his budget speech, urged us to look once again across the face of our country. When we look across the face of our country, we see a steadily spreading paralysis of effort. Where there was full employment there is now increasing unemployment. Where schools and hospitals and roads were being built a halt has been ordered. Where factories were operating full time they are now operating half time. Where shops were formerly thronged, goods now remain on the shelves. Where there was hope there is fear, where there was faith there is doubt, ancl where there was certainty there is now uncertainty. In these circumstances, the need is truly for an incentive budget, and the incentive given must be of two kinds. There should be physical incentive and psychological incentive. One without the other would not be enough, but this budget provides neither. The physical incentive needed is a very substantial reduction of taxation spread justly and evenly over all the people. The Leader of the Opposition has .shown that the budget provides no real reduction of taxation for the great mass of the people. It is a "" horror "" budget, as was the last one. . Taxation as now imposed has become a monstrous and an evil thing. To-day, the total Commonwealth Government '-' take "" is just over £100,000,000 out of a total national income of just over £3,000,000,000. It is proposed to reduce the amount collected by £50,000,000, of which £20,000,000 is to be shared by companies and big land-owners, whilst the remaining £30,000,000 is to be Communism thrives on divided amongst the mass of taxpayers. There has developed among the Australian community what is at best a dulled acceptance of these colossal imposts; at worse, an anger reaching to the point of rebellion. I do not mean armed rebellion or violence, but there is a widespread rebellion that expresses itself in refusal to make a real effort, refusal to take production risks, refusal to do more than the minimum. Taxation totals £112 a year for every man woman and child in Australia. For a man, his wife and three children this totals £9 10s. a week. For every adult male in the 16-65 age group, it amounts to £400 a year; that is, spread over the normal male work force, nearly £8 a week. A few years ago, we wouid have regarded such imposts as incredible. We. should still regard them as incredible, but it is still -more incredible that honourable members opposite should cheer a budget which makes such shocking exactions from the people. Last year, the Government imposed over £200,000,000 in additional taxation. Now it proposes to remit £50,000,000, and says that all is well. A government, by placing too much reliance on the advice of economists, betrays its trust. It ignores human relations and the working of human nature, factors which find no place in the textbooks on economics. The Government is producing smouldering resentment, and the widespread defeatism which undermines the national spirit and national effort alike. The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out that no details of the proposed £200,000.000 expenditure on defence and war preparation are provided. He has shown that this is unsatisfactory and that the real question which should be before the Honse is the form and content that Australia's contribution to defence should take now. The Leader of the Opposition ha« emphasized the importance of Australia's defence role as a food producer and the need for expenditure on development, particularly of transport and communications, as a dfefence measure. r snailindicate the questions that must expenditure with the essential requirebe faced'. Is unlimited armaments expenditure advisable at the costof suspending developmental work that is needed to expand rural production and to absorb additional population ? Should Australia's contribution be all guns before butter? Es not increased' food production our basic task? Should armaments expenditure require' a cruel lowering of pension Irving standards? Should it compel reduction by half of the value of endowment payments to mothers to assist them in raising native-born new Australians? Is total taxation so high and so harsh as to cripple the productive effort? I believe that, to the extent that the Government proposes, military expenditure at the expense of the factors that I have mentioned is utterly wrong. The Labour party stands whole-heartedly for adequate defence expenditure, but it must be related to the developmental needs of the nation, to our proper role in combined defence and to our population needs. It is folly for us merely to ape the United States of America in mili-' tary preparations when our problem, as an under-developed continent, is entirely different. The crucial argument against this Government's policy isfound in its own announcement halving the intake of immigrants. tration of the consequences of a disastrous policy. Above everything, we must have additional white population absorbed into a full employment economy. That intake of immigrant's has had to be stopped because of the Government's disgraceful mismanagement. ment will have to go further still in reducing the intake of immigrants because it has destroyed the conditions in which fhey could be absorbed. The task of a future government taking over the treasury bench will be to restore conditions the Australian people can have faith and of prosperity and full employment in which Australian people once again will welcome a great intake of white population that is so urgently needed. If the things that I have mentioned have been done by the present Government in the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr name of defence, it is a travesty of Allan Fraser) spent much time in Mr Allan Fraaer. defence and a shocking misunderstanding of the nation's real need. There is imperative need to equate our arms ments of national development. The present Government cannot give a psychological incentive to the people because it has lost their confidence. The fact is that the people, to use an expressive term, have "" had "" this Government, and once that stage is reached, nothing that a government can do can restore its position. Nevertheless, the Australian people are as ready as ever to respond to an appeal to their hearts and minds: Give them a physical and a psychological incentive, and they will respond. Under honest leadership, with united effort, we can, in a few short"" years, surmount our difficulties, advance our living standards and build this nation to the internal Strength which alone can preserve us from attack. Faith*-the substance of tilings hoped for, theevidence of things not seen-is essential to this task. Faith is 1 one thing that the present Government cannot give to the Australian people, because it has so completely broken faith with them on every aspectof its election policy. Faith cannot berestored until this Government and this: Prime Minister are removed from office. Mr Curtin and Mr Chifley in turn gave to this nation honest and consistent leadership. Even those who disagreed with them respected them and had faith in That is a tragic demonsthem. I believe that the speech that was delivered last night by the Leader of the Opposition is accepted by the people as further evidence that, in. a year of crisis, the Labour party again, has such a leader for the Australian people. Even those who disagree with some of the views that The Governwere expressed by the right honourable gentleman must recognize that his speech was an utterance of greait intellectual honesty, constructive^ clear and courageous.

Who actually supported in the courts the reduction of the working week to. 40. hours t The Chifley Government. Who denuded the rural areas of much-needed labour forties in a mad campaign to build np secondary . industries with disastrous results to Australia's exports and to the whole economy? Again the answer is: the Chifley Government. .This Government inherited the results, of these colqss&l economic blunders when it assumed office in 1949. t t was because .of. the high eost of 'socialism given effect by the Labour Government that value slipped out of the £1.

Certainly there is nothing in the budget that -will result in the displacement of a single man from his job. The budget has been widely hailed as an incentive budget. The incentives given in taxation concessions over a very wide field will result in increased production and give a great impetus to manufacturers and businessmen to increase their activities. made by Opposition the which -have not been curtailed by this Government. The Government has undertaken to maintain employment at a constant level. Tbe Minister for statement on the unemployment situation, promised that the position would be very carefully watched. To-night, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) made it clear to the Parliament and to the people that neither this Government nor any other humane Government would want to put one person out of work. The Leader of the Opposition and other Opposition speakers have made much of the subject of full employment, but the sort of unproductive full employment that they envisage was bound to break down under its own weight. Opposition members would put people on the pay-roll whether or not they are prepared to work. Wo one knows better than does the Leader of the Opposition that such o policy could not be continued indefinitely. unemployment position is as grave as Opposition members would have us believe it to be, they should co-operate with the Government in its attempt to still further imurove industrial relations. tbe financial year ended tbe SOth June Such co-operation would be a constructive act on the part of the Opposition. If we can achieve greater efnciencv in top management and -imurove still further the relations between employers and emSfr. Itclcwick. ployees we shall be able to solve nearly all our economic problems. I am glad to be able to say that, in proportion to its work force, no country in the free world has less unemployment than has Australia. The Leader of the Opposition has done this nation and its people, especially the unskilled workers, the 'greatest possible disservice with his calamity Why should there be? howling. Nothing could do more harm to this community than will the gloomy forebodings of tbe right honourable gentleman in his speech in this chamber last night. The Opposition tactics in relation to this budget nave been criminal to the degree that they have caused some people to fear the onset of another depression. The more the people fear the onset of a depression the greater the danger of such No mention was a calamity. Depression talk of "" the kind members of indulged in by Opposition members national development schemes discourages industrial and business enterprises, unnecessarily contracts spending, and forces manufacturers and distributors alike to reduce staffs. That is purely the psychological effect of gloomy forebodings of the 'kind indulged in by Oooosition members. There is no need for a fear complex to develop in' the minds of the people because there is no possibility that in the foreseeable future we shall experience another depression. In order to dispel the impression that may have been caused by depression mongering and the awful gloom of the Opposition I shall quote a few brief references from newspaper reports that indicate the unbounded confidence of the peonle in the future of Australia. On the 19th July the Launceston Examiner, in a report under the heading "" Big Rise in New Capital Expenditure"", stated that new capital expenditure by private businesses in Australia during tbe first If the half of this year had been estimated at £110,700,000. On the 30th July the same journal under the heading "" Record Year for Retail Traders"", reported that the value of retail trade in Auatra'ia for last had reached an all-time record of £1,031,700,000. Both these figures have been suunlied by the Commonwealth Statistician. The° London Financial Times recently commented on the Australian economy in a leading article under",59,Fiuidkss
105,"Defence ( Mr Mcbride), In His Recent","the heading "" Little 2seed. for Anxiety "". r On the 31st July the Launceston Examiner published an article under the heading "" Textiles, Clothing Import Record "". On the 14th July that journal also published a statement on the housing position under the heading "" Expects New Record for Housing"". On the 16th July the Melbourne Sun News-Pictorial reported the formation of a £15,000,000 company to build an oil refinery. I could quote dozens of other newspaper headlines to dispel these Opposition lies ahout the likelihood of a depression. ployed. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Ryan) -Order! The honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin), who is interjecting from a seat other than his own, is distinctly out of order. observed the honourable member in his place. In view of the Opposition talk about unemployment it is significant that State Labour governments, particularly the Government of Tasmania, have put men out of work solely for the purpose of attempting to embarrass this Government. Although there has been very little, if any, shrinkage of the funds available for public works-the amount being spent in Tasmania from both Commonwealth and State sources for this year is £30,000,000 compared with £25,000,000 last year-Stat e Labour governments are dismissing employees from government works to comply with the political demands of the great Labour movement. In an attempt to embarrass this Government they are playing the game of party politics at a very low level. The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro advocated the unrestricted use of bank credit. In order to iustify the u»e of bank credit in peace-time, they told the old story about plenty of money always being available for war purposes. But they omitted to say that such war debts would have to be repaid or that bank credit finance was highly inflationary, and that the worker won'd need a wheelbarrow to cart his weekly wasres home. Such would be tbe case if unrestricted credit were used. It would take thousands of notes even to pay for a pound of butter. But that is the sort of finance the Opposition advocates. Dealing with the Government's proposals to reduce income tax, the Leader of the Opposition produced a fantastic table from which he tried to prove that the greater the reduction of tax rates the more the average taxpayer would have to pay in tax. One can safely depend on the intelligent worker to decide such matters for himself. During the course of his dreary speech, which occupied an hour and a half, the Leader of the Opposition did not advance one constructive idea. He offered as an alternative to the Government's proposals something that he termed Labour's policy. The people of this country know only too well whither that policy would lead them. It is interesting to recall that one of the principal planks of the Labour party's platform is the reduction of working hours to 30 a week. That, of course, would only cause more severe inflation. Yet. Labour confirmed that plank of its platform as recently as this year. Obviously then if Labour were returned to office this country would witness inflation on a grand scale. Just as the introduction of the 40-hour week resulted in ,i decline in production and an increase of costs, the introduction of a 30-hour week wonld further aggravate present economic evils. Yet, the Leader of the Opposition offered that policy as an alternative to the Government's budget proposals. It is clear that Labour's policy appeals to the basest human instincts. It is a policy of more pay for less work and a policy of class hatred. The late Mr Chifley was noted for his espousal of class hatred. I disagreed violently with his utterances in that respect. Members of the Opposition, almost to a man, continue to advocate wretched class hatred, whereas the object of the Government is to unite all sections of the community in an effort to overcome the grave problems that confront the nation, juaoour policy also advocates tbe destruc-' tion of private ownership. Such a policy would destroy individual initiative. rJo nation could possibly build upon sucb a foundation. Yet, that is the alternative that the Opposition has offered to the Government's budget.",60,Fiuidkss

107,Mr Kekwic K,"I have rarelyHaving dealt with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition-that apostle of gloomI turn to the principal features of he was Prime Minister, even refused to the budget itself. Every taxpayer will welcome the all-round reduction of tax by 1.0 per cent. To-day, even before that proportion of tax is remitted, Australians are the lowest taxed people in the free world. A very welcome feature of the budget is the allowanceof educational expenses as a concessional deduction. The proposed tax reductions will give an incentive to business and industry to increase production. Those concessions will be enjoyed by both public ancl private companies. Under the Government's proposals an aged couple will be permitted to have an income of up to £507 a year before they become liable for income tax. Sales tax is to be reduced in respect of articles in all the current schedules, the pensions. The proposed increases of number of which will be reduced from six to four. Many articles will be completely exempt from sales tax. I am particularly pleased with the Government's decision to abolish land tax. Members of the Opposition, gay that they would not reduce but would increase that tax. Such an attitude is further proof of class hatred. They claim that land tax is a class tax. 1. have already referred to tlie Governof housing during the last financial year ment's defence policy. I am pleased to note that, while making these liberal tax concessions, the Government has made adequate provision for the defence of this achieve improvements in the supply of country. Expenditure on defence this year will be £30,000,000 more than the amount that was expended on defence last year. honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr other primary products, such development Clyde Cameron) would like to see this country left exposed to attack, particularly by his friends in Kussia. An underprogramme would be sound in every taking has been given that defence contracts will be placed according to a plan to assist in the maintenance of employment. The proposed increased provision for all scales of pensions is most gratifying. I point out that the three increases of rates of age and invalid pensions that this Government has made since it assumed office in this connection, because no oreviousamount to no less than 25s. a week, But what is the attitude of the Opposition much for the primary producers of thiswith respect to social services? I recall that Mr Chifley, on one occasion when receive a deputation of representatives of pensioners. [Quorum formed^] I am sure that the proposed increase of repatriation benefits will be acclaimed by all ex-servicemen in this country. This Government enjoys a veiy proud record in the manner in which it has dealt with ex-servicemen's problems. The proposed increase of the general rate of pension by 10s. a week, and of wives' and children's allowances by 5s. and 2s. 3d. a week respectively are most generous, in view of the Government's commitments. Proportionate increases are to be made, also, of the rates of other educational allowances for the children of ex-servicemen, and of living-awayfrom-home allowances for Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme trainees, are commendable. In addition, the Government intends to proceed vigorously with a programme of national development. It is expected that the Government's record in relation to the provision will be exceeded iu this financial year, despite the gloom that permeates the Opposition benches. It. is hoped to power and transport facilities, as weU as better industrial relationships, which will guarantee a prosperous future for this country. Our main objective on tbe economic front is to develop food production to a I know that the vast extent. Together with wool and should be built up into a vast and comprehensive export programme. Such a respect. rJot the least of its benefits would be the increased demand for 1 labour in the country areas. The Government has already devoted considerable time and energv to the assistance of primary producers.

109,Mr Kekwick,"country as has the preseut Government. Although former Australian governin en ts did little to increase the return of the primary producers, this Government has ensured that all primary producers shall receive fair prices for their produce. In consequence more people are now going onto the land, and slowly but surely increases of primary production arc becoming evident. Most of the unpoular economic measures that the Government has had to apply during the last twelve months were rendered necessary as a result of a severe hang-over from eight and a half years of socialism. I warn the people of this country that an even more severe hangover will he experienced if there are any further excursions into socialization. This Government was confronted with the very difficult task If the honourable member were to make inof restoring economic stability. Former Labour administrations devoted much time to the preparation of blueprints and plans for developmental projects, but did little to increase production. The resultant economic chaos nearlv brought country to ruin. I believe the Aushas overlooked the fact that there is a't tralian people now feel very grateful to Hi is Government for the courage with which it tackled most realistically the problems with which it was faced. Because it has not shirked unpleasant and unpopular tasks it must be conceded that ir has been patently honest, which is more than can be said of some State governments at present, and of some former Australian governments. I commend the budget for its overall soundness and for the attempts that are made in it to deal with the inflationary problem. Tax concessions will provide an incentive for increased production which, in turn, will increase employment. honourable member for Bass( Mr They now seek to fasten the blame for the Kekwick) has stated that the people of Australia should be grateful for the bold action that tbe Government has taken to deal with Australia's economic problems. The results of recent by-elections prove that it was 'criminal of the Leader of the that the people do not appreciate the deeds Opposition (Dr. Evatt) to indulge of the Government. The honourable memin calamity howling, and that the right ber warned the Australian people that honourable gentleman's gloomy forebodings there may be another period of socialism about the imminence of another depresin this country if Labour is returned to sion would have an adverse psychological oflice at the next general election. I am confident that the majority of the people of this country would welcome a return to the conditions that were enjoyed under the Curtin and Chifley administrations. The honourable member for Bass need have no fear about the. wishes of the Australian people. In the past, the honourable member ha 3 referred to the evils of class hatred, and has stated that certain sections of the community endeavour to foment industrial trouble. It is evident from his reference to class hatred this evening that he, himself, is keen to foment industrial trouble. He claimed that very few persons in Australia to-day are doing a fair day's work. Although that observation may be true of those with whom he associates I am sure that it does not 'apply generally to the workers of Australia. quiries he would find that workers who are unwilling to perform a fair day's work soon receive their walking tickets. The honourable member spoke about'good employer and employee relationships. He present an application by employers' organizations before the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for a halt of basic wage quarterly adjustments.' If the employers sincerely wanted to improve their relationships with their employees tbey should have asked the Government to reintroduce prices control which, in itself, would stabilize the basic wage. If they were not prepared to go that far, at least they could have offered that if the trade unions would agree to a temporary suspension of basic wage quarterly adjustments, they would consider indicating to the Government their readiness to support the reintroduction of prices control. As usual, the employers want to have matters all their own way. present inflationary condition onto the workers of this country. 'The honourable member for Bass stated",62,Fiuidkss
110,Mr Galvin (Kingston) [10.5],"Th eeffect on the workers. I remind the honourable member that men who are out of work are fearful of another depression. I do not know whether the honourable member had to walk the streets looking for work during the last depression. He may have to do so after the next general election. If he did have that experience I am sure that he would not talk idly about the subject. He would be worried and would be striving to eliminate unemployment in this country. I do not know what the position is in his electorate, but it is safe to say that the persons whom he says are not doing a fair day's work and the unemployed people in his electorate will, between them, answer him effectively when they are given an opportunity to do so. The honorwith a dependent wife and two children able gentleman said that thc Leader of the Opposition did not give expression to one constructive thought. The decision upon that matter will be made, not by the honourable member for Bass, but by the Australian people, who, I am sure, welcomed the speech of the right honourable gentleman last night because they realized that in it he advanced constructive suggestions and enunciated a policy designed to place the Australian economy again upon a sound basis. This budget can be described as a budget of false pretences. The people of Australia waited patiently for it to be presented because they hoped that the Government would, at long last, enlighten them about what it intended to do to halt inflation. Business men and manufacturers who are just able to keep their works going, and who have suffered much from the actions-perhaps it would be more appropriate to say the inactionof this Government, waited for the bud.sret additional £100 a year that wage-earners in the hope that the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) would indicate to them, that, at last, he had evolved some policy. earners also waited for the budget, because they expected to be told about the plans of the Government to grapple with the threat of unemployment. The greatest fear in the mind of workers today is that they will join the many thousands of people who are alreadv out of work. people in this country hoped to be told Mr Qalvin. in the budget speech of some plan by the Government to get them back to work and into production again. Unfortunate pensioners and people with fixed incomes waited anxiously to he told what the Treasurer proposed to do to assist them to live in these difficult conditions, for which, at least to some degree, this Government is responsible. What has the Treasurer promised to do for those people? First, he has attempted to make them believe that income tax is to be reduced. On paper, that may be so, but the Leader of the Opposition proved conclusively last night that it is a confidence trick. Last year, the basic wage was about £10 a week, and a basic wage earner paid £9 l is . income tax. Under the previous Labour Government, a basic wage earner with those dependants paid no income tax, but under this Government he is taxed heavily. In the quarter that began this month, the hasio wage in Adelaide was increased by 13s. a week, and it is fair to assume that, before the end of the year, it will have increased by at least another 27s. a week. Then the basic wage will be £12 a week, and a basic wage earner with a dependent wife and two children will pay £18 16s. a year income tax, or £9 5s. a year more than he is paying now. It is idle to say that, the Government is reducing income tax. It is true that it appears to be doing so, but in fact it is not. The wealthy people who are staunch supporters of the Government parties may derive some benefit from the Government's action, but wage and salary earners will discover that they will be required to pay next year more income tax than they paid last year. The will receive as a result of quarterly adjustments of the basic wage will he given to them as compensation for rises The wage and salary of prices that have already occurred, but the Government will take about £9 of it, and they will be further behind than ever in their race with rising prices. The Government has juggled with the sales tax. It has taken off a few per cent, here and there, in the hope that Thousands of unemployed people will believe its story that taxes are being reduced, but those reductions will matter but little to the general public. It is a matter of history now that the Government has failed to honour the promises to reduce taxes that it made during the general election campaigns of 1949 and 1951. In its budget of last year, it increased taxes to a large degree. Even if we were to he charitable and say that it is now reducing them, the rate of taxation will still be greater than it was when the present Government parties faced the people in 1949. The increases of sales tax that were imposed last year still bear heavily upon the Australian people. The Treasurer has increased thc social Liberal government, we have experienced services payments made to unfortunate water restrictions all the year round bepeople who are unemployed. Those cause of the inadequacy of reservoirs. increases will be greatly appreciated by ""We also need better transport. Our railthem; they are needed badly.

The policy of the Government urgent developmental projects in South has caused chaos and fear in the comAustralia, which have had to be abanmunity, but the budget contains nothing doned temporarily because of lack of that will rectify that position. The Treasurer, because he has been completed. unable to bully the State Premiers at meetings of the Australian Loan Council, has decided to abandon unifurther assistance is to be granted to form taxation. That can be described the many ex-servicemen, in South Ausas the act of a coward who is running tralia at least, who want to purchase away from his responsibilities. The their own homes.

Ex-servicemen have received a late Mr Chifley, said in one of his last fair proportion of houses constructed by speeches. His words were as follows:As Prime Minister and Treasurer, the Premiers gave me great co-operation and I never the position to-day is that many ex-serfound a State, whatever its political flavour, vicemen wbo are being allotted Housing tliat would not give necessary co-operation. Trust dwellings are unable to take posThere is room to cut down non-essential prosession of them because, last year, this duction but not developmental works as they help employ the resources of this country and Government decided to class such houses as help the country to go ahead. Of course, in the days of the Chifley Labour Government sound governmental policy was always evident. Ben Chifley was oneof a team. He realized that every State government had a vital role to play. He was prepared to treat the State Premiers as partners and not merely as school children. The present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Treasurer must be made to adopt the same attitude. Australia is a large, undeveloped country with great possibilities, but if we are to succeed we must develop our natural resources. Now is the time to embark upon such a programme. In South Australia, under a funds, shall be given the assistance that is necessary to enable them to be The budget does not indicate that any the South Australian Housing Trust; I think that the figure is 60 per cent. But existing dwellings, although in fact they are new buildings, soundly constructed, aatd arei comparable with the bousesthat are. erected hy theWarService Homes Division itself. Unfortunately, many ex-servicemen are not able t.o. obtain homes directly from the WarService Homes DLvisiom,, thebuilding activitiesof; which are not soextensive, insomeStates as one weather airport for aircraft of all types. would like them, to be. Certainly there is a substantial, lag; in South. Australia. Because houses built by the South Aust2-a.ldazi Housing.

That leaves them perhaps £1,000 short of the purchaseprice* An ex-serviceman who finds himself in this position, has either to reject the offer and resume his dreary wait until the War Service-.

It is. an. everlasting disgrace to this Government that it is not honouring itspromise) to ex-servicemen to provide, thefinance?necessary to enablethem to purchase their own homes'.. I never thought that anygovernment of this.country would! force ex-servicemen: to buy houses OIL second mortgage. Thefirst requirement, of any worker is a home f o i himself and hisi family. That is> his first stake iai the country. The Government should reverse its policy and agree to a maximum advance of £2,750 for the purchase by ex-servicemen of houses built hy the South Australian Housing Trust. Another vital undertaking in South Australia has: been delayed hy the action of this Government. I refer to the West Beach airport. In November, 1949, the forecast: was madethat, by the end of the following year, the new airport would have reached such a stageof development that heavy airliners would beabie to touch down in all weathers on an obstruction-free area larger than that of Adelaide. No airliner landed at West Beach in 1950 or 1951, and none will land this year. The, blame for that lies with this Government. Honourable members will, recall that, last year; the Government decided to retrench the Public Service: The employees subsequently dismissed included a large number of men engaged on the construction of the vital West Beach airport. Work at the airport progressed well at the early stages. Mr Galvin. One runway has been completed, and another is two-thirds completed. Ample material is; available to-day. Men are < nt of work in South Australia, and the airport could be completed, very quickly. Adelaide has long, been the only capital city in Australia that has not an. allWest Beach will be able' to take the largest aircraft, including even the Comet jet airliner. The talk of indefinite delay in the completion of the job should give place to definite, ancl dynamic action. Last year the necessity for airliners to be diverted to Gawler because Parafield was unserviceable due to bad weather cost the airline operators huge sums. To land' one aircraft at Gawler instead of at Parafield '-ost £60. Last year thiswasdone on 3'ffc days, with a daily average of twenty aircraft. In other words-., about 720 aircraft were diverted at. a cost of £60 a time, making a total of considerably more than £40;000. The completion of West Beach air-port is a vital necessity. It is so vital that the work should be financed out of the defence voteif necessary. There is no excuse for inaction. The jobshould, begiven a high priority ancl should be speeded up so that the new airnort will become, serviceable at an early date. I had hoped that the Government would grant new concessions to community hospitals. In my electorate,, there are two hospitals which, although they arckeeping their heads above water, are encountering financial difficulties. Some assistance in the form of relief from payroll tax would be greatly appreciated hy them. I urge the Treasurer to give further consideration to that matter, and to recognize that such hospitals are carrying out the responsibilities that are normally borne by the Commonwealth and the States. Persona who give their time, in an honorary capacity, to provide these hospitals for the. community should be given every possible encouragement by the Government^ and, in particular, they should be granted relief from pay-roll tax and income tax. That, thought brings meto a matter that came to my notice recently while I was visiting one' of these institutions. Many patients in hospitals, and, indeed, patients, in. thei'r own homes,. sometimes require, brandy for medicinal' purposes. I ' was astonished todiscover that the excise payable' on abottle of brandy is 9s. 6d. Such an impost is s severe* tax on the. sick.. I . amnot very much, concerned about, the excise payable on. abottle of. brandy purchased by a person who drinks, thatliquor for. pleasure, but. relief from the severe, impost should be granted to people who .produce a doctor's certificate showing, that tliey require brandy for medicinal purposes. Many pensioners, m South Australia are in a deplorable plight.. For the first time formany years, a radio station inthat State is presenting a weekly session called "" The Open Door"", and' it is heartbieaking: to hear appeals from aged pensioners and. other persons in necessitous', ci-reuanistances. for blankets for the Opposition has not yet offered its -their beds,, and appeals from unemployed men forclothes* for their children. Those -conditionsrepresent a return to thebad old daysof the financial and economicdepression, of. the 1930's. I budget does not mean very much to the people generally. Their worry to-day is unemployment, and if this 'Government fails, in. its obligation to provide work, for them, there is no hope for it, or for itssupporters on the back benches, in. this chamber. During, the last couple of years the Gogathering, the honourable memher provernment has been busily engaged in pounded the theory that 100^000 persons carrying, out a spring-cleaning of the were unemployed in this country.

111,Mr Failes (Lawson) [10.33],"passa<*e from a newspaper that was published to-day. It is as follows:In his 95-minute attack on the budget last night the Leader of the Opposition, Dr. Evatt, rambled over a lot of ground. He harped on unemployment. . . . He made repeated references to the former Labour Prime Minister, Mr Chifley. . . . When Government members became restless as his speech dragged on, he turned increasingly to his own party and seemed to be addressing them as much as the House. . . As time ran on his delivery became more and more dreary. i recall that the Leader of the Opposition described the budget as dreary. newspaper report indicates that some of his chickens are coming home to roost. The report continuesOnce five Ministers were tying back on the carpenters and 30 painters, plasterers and Govermnent front bench with their eyes plumbers were advertised. In all, 56 closed. . . . Dr. Evatt described the remission of the 10 per cent, surcharge on income jobs were offering for men of the callings tax as "" a sham, a snare and a delusion"".

For any Ur. Failes. honourable member, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, to spread a. scare about mass unemployment is both, dangerous and wrong. Honourable members w ill recollect that approximately a week ago one of the daily newspapers published a report of an interview which a reporter, disguised as a carpenter, held w i th oflicers of the Commonwealth Employment Service. Thereport was to the effect that the reporter had found that the Commonwealth Employment Service could offer no jobs for carpenters or bricklayers. The Strangely enough, in the "" positions vacant"" columns of the same newspaper,, on the same day, no fewer than fourteen jobs for bricklayers and labourers, twelveto which the reporter referred. Lacking evidence, therefore, we must doubt the after having heard the Opposition that mass unemployment has Minister (Mv. commenced. Whilst we must be cautious I am sure that the people will that. The right honourable gentleman also his stated that sales tax causes increased costs of it. The right honorand lower incomes. In addition, he "" I say"" which is at variance w it h the facts. The The first was to the effect that statement of national income, included in Apparently, he considered £3,238,000,000. The total personal in into the ring and to say, from £2,875,000,000 in 1950-51 to At a later stage, indicate that the reverse is true. has The right honourable gentleman conI suggest tended that the budget offers no incentive, either to the primary producer or to the wage-earner. Again, true to form, he did unless he is not produce evidence to support his contention. The facts set out in the budget If mass unemployment papers indicate that the reverse applies. The Prime Minister has already refuted many of the charges made by the right honourable gentleman, and the only other statements to which I wish to refer are, that the primary producer is entitled to just prices for his commodities, that much planning is needed, and that productive land is not being used as it should be used. Let us weigh the real implications of the statement that the primary producer is entitled to just prices. I point out that this Government has advocated that principle for many years. In particular, the Australian Country party has always been a strong supporter of the contention that primary producers, wbo enjoy an intimate relationship with the rest of the community, should be justly treated. The Australian Country party appreciates that it is on the primary producers that the country towns depend. On the country towns, in turn, depend the cities. Nations depend on all three, as we have learnt to our cost during the last year or two when we have attempted to purchase commodities from overseas considerably in excess of the value of our exports which, to a great degree, come from primary producing sources. Consequently, it is in the interests not only of the manufacturer and the employer but also of the wage-earner that the primary producer shall receive just prices for his products. I do not wish to delve into ancient history, but honourable members w-ill surely agree that over the years the primary producer has not received just prices for the commodities he produced, such as wheat, butter, and sugar. It has beeu necessary to bludgeon from at least two States the prices to which the primary producers are entitled. Since the assumption of office by the present Australian Government a change of scene has been noticeable. By means of a bonus, we have been able to bring the price of wheat for stock feed into closer relationship with the price received by the primary producer for his export wheat. Through the constant and forceful efforts of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture obtain something like a reasonable price for our butter. During his visits overseas he has been able to obtain vastly increased prices for our primary products because of the representations which he has made concerning overseas contracts. A ll these things can be laid to the credit of this Government. They represent innovations as far as primary producers are concerned. It is, therefore, redundant for the Leader of the Opposition to say that the primary producer is entitled to just prices, as though this Government does not already recognize that principle aud is doing everything in its power to give it effect. The statement of the right honourable gentleman that planning is needed suggests planning which might not be to the benefit of the primary producer and which might enable the Government to control the prices of primary commodities, according to the pressure brought to bear on it. His contention that productive land is not being used as it should be used is on all fours with the recent statement of the New South Wales Minister for Lands to the effect that if farmers did not use their land to its full productive capacity it would be taken from them and given to those who would so use it. In other words, a socialization objective would be achieved. That is the inference I draw from the statement made by the right honorahle gentleman. Let us examine the budget in order to see what incentives it offers. Congratulations are due to the Treasurer on the early presentation of the budget, a welcome innovation and one that has received scant praise from the newspapers which, a little while ago, demanded that it should be produced earlier than is usual. The Treasurer worked untiringly and achieved this result. I remind honourable memhers that this budget is also the people's budget. If the Government proposes to expend £200,000,000 on defence, it does so in the interests of the people who, no doubt, appreciate that it is looking ahead and does not intend that Australia shall be caught unprepared, as so many countries were caught at the outbreak of World War II . In passing, it might be said that the Government has received, in its defence effort, the greatest co-operation from the youth of Australia. The youth of Australia have responded magnificently to national service training schemes, which are working very smoothly. Despite the fact that the Opposition is not prepared to co-operate",67,Fiuidkss
112,"( Mr Mcewen), We Have Been Able To","witli the Government in defence schemes the Government has pressed on with them successfully. One Opposition member complained that the Government had not treated ex-servicemen fairly in regard to war service homes although it has expended over £27,000,000 on such homes, which is more than has been expended by any other government in Australia for this purpose for many years. It is a record among records. The Government has proposed to proceed with the building of aerodromes throughout the country. The honourable memher for Kingston( Mr Galvin) complained that the Government had not proceeded with the construction of an aerodrome in Adelaide. The construction of that aerodrome has been commenced and as time goes ou it, a3 well as otlier aerodromes in the capital cities of Australia, will have the latest equipment and will be capable of receiving aircraft in any weather conditions. The Government has also proposed an increase of repatriation benefits. During tiie last financial year those benefits were increased in respect of those people who needed them most-the permanently disabled ex-servicemen. Now the Government has proposed au increase of the general rate not as greatly as it would have liked to increase it but to an amount not contemplated by the previous Government. The Government initiated the payment of educational allowances, which were quite novel in Australia and were favourably received, particularly in the country districts. An increase of age and invalid pensions also is to be made. The public is quite satisfied with the way in which the Government has assisted these pensioners, as well as tubercular patients and others who come under the provisions of its medical benefits scheme. The Government has given assistance to .the superphosphate industry by enabling producers to convert their plant from the old type whicli uses pure sulphur into plant which can use Australian pyrites. All these things the Government has The contention that the Government has done on behalf Of the people. It has not given any incentive to the primary expended their money with their approval producer is without foundation. The ilr. Failes. and has been able, -at the same time, to reduce taxation. The extra 10 per cent, imposed on incomes last year is to he abolished. The Leader of the Opposition complained that this would not be satisfying to people on lower incomes because increased amounts of tax would he payable, due to rises of the basic wage. Does the right honourable gentleman contend that whenever there is an increase of the basic wage the Government should reduce tax rates? When the basic wage was rising during the years before this Government came into office did the previous Government reduce tax rates ? No! It is ridiculous to contend that when a man receives more inconie his rate of tax should be reduced. The Government has proposed a reduction of 2s. in the £1 in respect of the first £5,000 of company tax. The proposed discontinuance of advance payments of company tax will be an added advantage. Under the Government's proposals private companies will be permitted greater retention allowances which they will be able to place in reserve for the better conduct of theiT businesses. Sporting clubs ancl non-profit-making associations are to be freed from payment of tax. Sales tax is to be reduced and eliminated altogether on some items. The land tax field is to be vacated entirely by the Oommonwealth. That proposition will not meet with the approval of Opposition members because they consider that those who have higher incomes should pay higher rates of tax and they look upon anybody who owns land as having a large income. They regard him as fair game. The Government considers that the land tax is particularly inequitable. In many cases the employee has had to meet the increase of costs that have resulted from its imposition. If the land tax is to remain, the tenant must be prepared to pay more rent. It has been found that in some cases, because of the incidence of the land tax, it did not pay to own and rent a property. The Government 'has given careful consideration to the subject of provisional tax and has already introduced legislation to deal with anomalies in this matter. primary producer was already entitled to considerable taxation deductions before this budget was introduced. Expenditure incurred in the year of income by a taxpayer engaged in primary production is an allowable deduction for income tax purposes if it has been incurred in the eradication or extermination of animal or vegetable pests from the land; the destruction and removal of timber, scrub or undergrowth indigenous to the land; the destruction of weed or plant growth detrimental to the land; the preparation of the land for agriculture; ploughing and grassing the land for grazing purposes; the draining of swamp or lowLying, lands where that operation improves the agricultural or grazing value of the land; preventing or combatting soil erosion otherwise than by the erection offences; the construction, of dams, earth tanks, underground tanks, irrigation channels or similar structural improvements, or the sinking of bores or wells for the purpose of conserving or conveying water for use in carrying ou primary production; and the construction of levee banks or similar improvements having like uses. Such expenditure has been an allowable deduction for income tax purposes for some time. The Government now proposes to allow a deduction for depreciation of 20 per cent, of the value of plant such as farm machinery, motor lorries; bulldozers, windmills, irrigation piping, and fire-fighting equipment in each year forfive years. On the same basis the Government has also been pleased to announce, as a deduction from income' tax, expenditure on fences, buildings, hay sheds', machinery sheds, silos shearing sheds,, dairy buildings and employees homeSj to a limit of £2,000 for each home. It may be said that these concessions wereintroduced before the budget, but they should be considered as a . part of thebudget because their cost to the. country must be borne in thisand future financial years, and consequently will becomeadirect charge: on revenue. The only unfortunate aspect of the Keon)' alleged that details of the Budget budget is in connection with the money were made available to theMelbourne that the Commonwealth must provide for Herald before they were presented to' the the States. Under our federal system the Parliament. Normally, one would ignore States have the responsibility of using foolish charges' made so obviously for the money properly, but the Commonpropaganda purposes, but in this case wealth is' not able toensure that the they were made with that irrational States so use it. The Labour Government of New South Wales was recently challenged, by the leader of tiie Country party in the Legislative Assembly, upon its use of £188,000,000 of loan money that had been advanced to it by. the Commonwealth in six years. The leader of the Country party challenged the New South Wales Labour Government to give one instance of its having completed a public work of a productive nature in that six years. The New South Wales Government produced a list of works that it said it had completed. These completed works were the Menindie-BrokenH ill water pipeline estimated to cost £2,000,000, the first stage of the Oberon Dam for Lithgow, Wallerawang and the Blue Mountains water supply extension, the cost of which was not stated, although the fully extended scheme -was said by the Premier of New South Wales to be likely to cost £535,000, and Lake Brewster storage, at. a cost of £414,000. The total sum. expended on completed works was £2,949,000 out of a total loan expenditure of £18S,000,000 in six years.

114,Sir Arthur Fadden (Mcpherson,"vehemence that ig characteristic of the honourable member for Yarra. It is necessary, therefore, to state that there is not member's party was in office, the Mela fragment of truth in the charge. The arrangements for the distribution of budget documents to newspapers were identical with those that have been made for many years, often when a Labour government was in office. In accordance with this practice, copies of the budget documents were available to the press in Canberra and in State capitals for several lation, not only on a national but also on hours prior to my budget speech in this chamber, so that the press representatives could prepare their reports on them. However, the pressmen concerned were in locked rooms under the supervision of treasury officers, so there was not the slightest possibility of any information extracted from such documents being published in the afternoon press on that day. I have studied the reports in the Meldays in advance of their announcement bourne Herald referred to by the honorin the Parliament. able member. First, it is quite apparent that nothing published there, even if accepted as fact and not speculation, ( Sir Arthur Fadden) cite examples? could have been used either on the stock exchange or in any other commercial tainly will do so.

The newspaper before the budget was even formulated. mentioned, incidentally, that these Lt is noticeable that no mention was made schedules had been circulated to memof various leading features of the budget bers of the Labour caucus on the previous such as the abolition of federal land tax, night. I remind honourable members that the granting of concessional income tax a budget such as the present one, which deductions for educational expenses, the is so generous in the scope of concesvariation of the basis of the taxation of sions granted, could well have been used goodwill, the reduction of the rate of advantageously for propaganda purcompany tax and the increased retention poses by a discreet disclosure of even allowances for private companies. Obviously, any newspaper which had However, this Government firmly believes in fact been in prior possession of in adhering to the proper traditions of budget documents would not have contbe Parliament, ancl even its own party tented itself with merely forecasting supporters were informed of the contents what had been so widely surmised already, of the budget only one hour before it was but would have referred to at least one, presented to Parliament, and even then if not all, of the unexpected features only in general terms. That was long that I have mentioned. The suggestion after the stock exchanges and business of a leakage that miarht be used for houses had closed. speculative purposes comes badlv from the side of tbe House on which the lowed by the last Labour Government, Sir Arthur Fadden. honourable member for Yarra now sits. We all recall that when the honourable bourne Herald was able to announce the decision to depreciate the £1 sterling, which the British Government had by then conveyed to the Labour Government, nearly five days before the decision was officially announced in London. We know of no prior disclosure which could lend itself more than this to specuan international scale. Moreover, it happened during the term of office of a Labour government. Contents of Labour budgets and financial statements were published regularly, completely and exactly, days before presentation to the Parliament. Forecasts often went beyond the broad general principles of the budget, and sometimes precise details of new tax schedules appeared in the press Secondly, practically all the tax schedule showing the rates that some of its more favorable features. This contrasts with the policy fol-",71,Department Broadcasting Bucka Eunyajl Camp

116,Sir Arthur Fadden,"I cer-whose Treasurer used to present financial proposals to party members many hours, and in some cases days, before they came before the Parliament. In the light of those facts, it ill becomes the honourable member for Yarr a and his colleagues to make such charges. They -are absolutely devoid of truth and -substance. Treasurer ( Sir Arthu r Fadden) has denied that the press had any foreknowledge of the budget ancl has said that the items that were published were purely the result of speculation. I ask the House to listen to some of the speculation that was published in a newspaper in Sydney before noon on the day on which the Treasurer delivered his budget speech at 8 p.m. I quote from the DailyM i r r o r of Wednesday, the 6th AugustThe highest category of sales tax-a t present <S6S%-wil l be reduced to 50% in the 1952-53 Budget. Tbat is speculation No. 1. Honourable members w ill admit that it was good guesswork. The minimum sales tax rate of 12}% will remain. That is speculation No. 2. Another good guess, I suggest. Other features of the Budget will be: A 7s. 6d. increase in age, invalid and service contained the following report:pensions. That is speculation No. 3. A record peacetime defence expenditure of £200,000,000. That was the exact figure that appeared iu tbe budget papers. H a d the writer of the article guessed £201,000,000, £203,000,000 or £204,000,000, perhaps we could have said that it was mere speculation. But that did not happen. The exact figure was published. The next guess was as follows:Abolition of the 10% special income tax levy, saving taxpayers £35,000,000 in the current financial year. I ask honourable members to consult the budget papers in order to see wliether those facts do not coincide exactly. Another guess was as follows:Expenditure of £950,000,000 in 1952-53. That was the exact sum specified in the budget papers. Does the Treasurer seriously ask the House to believe that six items of information, some of which included the exact figures stated in the budget, could possibly have, been predicted accurately by guesswork? Surely not! No intelligent person would believe that the information could have been obtained so precisely without reference to the budget papers. Those details obviously could have come only from somebody who had access to the budget papers. There cannot be any doubt about that. The Treasurer has said that a premature announcement of the items that I have mentioned could not have led to stoek exchange speculation. 1 refer bim to the Sydney Sun of the 6th August, the day on which the budget was presented to the Parliament. That newspaper, prior to the budget speech, published an interesting item under the heading: "" SuddenL if t in Share Prices "". It statedGrowing confidence that to-night's Federal Budget will provide taxation and credit relief brought a sudden change in the tempo of share trading to-day. Business expanded and prices advanced in the most active market for several weeks. On the day after tbe presentation of the budget, the Financial Review, which is published by the Sydney Morning Herald, Share trading was dull and prices eased last week as investors awaited the budget. But activity brightened yesterday as speculative elements entered the market in the hope of purchasing stocks at what might prove to be bargain prices. Elsewhere in the same journal the following item appeared:share prices continued their easing tendency until yesterday. More spirited bidding yesterday gave the markets a brighter tone. This evidently was the result of re-entry of buyers who expected favorable reaction to the budget, and took early opportunity to acquire shares at recently reduced prices. All of that might have been the result of the normal activity of gamblers on the stock exchange attempting to anticipate the budget, but every honourable member w ill agree that also it could have been the result of the release of advance information, which obviously was available to certain newspaper men early on the day",72,Department Broadcasting Bucka Eunyajl Camp

I thought that I had 'made a definite and specific charge. That charge is liliat the evening newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne, from the reports 'that 'they published before the Treasurer delivered his budget speech, must obviously have been given direct advance information about the provisions of the budget. I 'have made that .charge -definitely and specifically. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison.') did .not hear me make it previously,, I reiterate it now. It .must be obvious to -any intelligent person that no newspaper could .have obtained .the .details that were published before the budget speech was made unless its representatives had access either tp the budget papers or -to some person who had that information. Tbat leads naturally to this question: If the newspapers had the information, .as obviously they did, where did they get it ? I suggest that the number of possible sources is limited. First, the newspapers could have obtained the information from treasury officials wbo broke the'ir trust. The Treasurer has informed us fhat representatives of newspapers were locked up with treasury officials while .fhey studied the budget before it was presented to the Parliament. Therefore, secondly, some of those representatives might bave found a way of breaking the'ir trust and sending the information to their newspapers. Thirdly, the 'information could bave been released 'by a member of the Cabinet, other than the Treasurer, who had access to the budget. Fourthly, it could have been released by the Treasurer himself.

The honourable member's time has expired. have listened to this discussion with keen interest, and it has become evident to me that the bonorable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) is trying to make a comeback, as the race-horse, Old Rowley, did. I have noticed the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) doing a good deal of lobbying, with the idea, apparently, of getting the honourable member for Yarra to reinstate himself in the eyes of the Labour party, and so assure him of the party endorsement for the next election. I am convinced that he is making the present attack on the Treasurer because he feels it to be necessary to rehabilitate himself after failing tocampaign in ta vour of the "" No"" vote in the referenbefore the budget speech was delivered in dum on communism. Pressure has been put upon him by this so-called Labour party, which is. in fact, nothing more than a collection of socialists. Tbe honourable member for Yarra complained that budget information bad been disclosed which might enable gamblers on the stock exchange to make money. I believe that the honourable member spoke on this subject last night and to-night only because he is gambling on again getting tlie party endorsement for the electorate of Yarra. The budget necessarily passes through the hands of a considerable number of public servants. I do not doubt the'ir document under the surveillance of treaintegrity, but I know that the honourable member for East Sydney has quite a number of stooges in the Public Service, and that be seems to be able to obtain information that even the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) himself cannot get.

The honourable member compared the figures published in the Herald with the budget figures, and showed that the information published in the Herald was accurate in all respects. The Treasurer must accept responsibility for what has happened. I do not suggest that the Treasurer himself gave the information, but tha information was in his custody. It was in his sole control until the document was presented to the Parliament. He and he alone had charge of it, and if information leaked out through his carelessness, whether by allowing newspaper representatives to see the sury officials or otherwise, he must accept responsibility in accordance with constitutional practice. He cannot throw the responsibility on to some one «lse. It is not sufficient for him to say: "" We locked",74,Department Broadcasting Bucka Eunyajl Camp

That will not satisfy any one. .Speaking in his own defence, the Treasurer said, in effect, "" Well, the newspapers did not publish anything about the land tax, or ahout the concessions in respect of education"". That is true. If the newspapers had published all the information contained in the budget there would not have been any need for honourable members to come here to listen to the budget speech. We could have read it all in the newspapers. The Treasurer must put himself right with the Parliament and the people. If the information got into the newspapers hours before the budget speech was delivered, the opportunity certainly existed for persons to benefit financially as a result. Treasurer has been guilty of gross carelessness through his agents, or through somebody else to whom he gave possession of budget information. The right honourable gentleman claimed that other Treasurers had clone precisely as he did. That is not true. When the late Mr for Yarra indicate that it was possible Chifley was Treasurer in the Labour Government, he never disclosed anything so vital or in such detail, either to his party or to the press, before he presented the budget to the Parliament. I was a member of the Cabinet that discussed the question of devaluation, and it was the best-kept secret that I know of. After we had discussed the pros and cons of devaluation as against maintaining the value of our currency in relation to the dollar, we said to Mr Chifley, ""Well you make the final decision "". He made the final decision with Dr. Coombs on a Sunday night and it was announced in the press on Monday morning. was not made five days before the announcement, as the Treasurer has said. As evidence of the fact that no information about the decision leaked out in advance, I cite the fact that not one goldment not that there was a leakage, but mining share on the stock exchanges in Australia or anywhere else varied in value from the time that we discussed the matter until the decision was announced. It ill becomes the Treasurer to besmirch the reputation of Mr Chifley by saying that the information leaked out five days before the decision was announced. Ilr. Cahoell. There were never any leakages when the Labour Government was in oflice. We did not need to buy the support of the press for our budgets by giving the newspapers advance information. What Mr Chifley did was to hand the documents over in the way that the Treasurer has said that he did. In that, the present Treasurer followed the usual practice. But when Mr Chifley was Treasurer, the newspapers were not allowed access to the budget papers until a telegram was received from the Prime Minister's office announcing that the Treasurer had actually begun his budget speech. Then, the Sub-Treasury officials in the various States made the documents available to newspaper representatives. No charge was ever made against Mr Chifley while he was alive that he had disclosed information improperly or unAt the very best, the fairly. It has never been alleged that any Labour Minister, during the whole eight years that the Labour Government was in office, ever disclosed information from which any one might have made financial profit. But the disclosures that have been made by the honourable member for somebody to have disclosed something from which financial gain could have been made.

131,Mr Beale,"The honourable memberMr ""WABD -The honourable member for Yarra did not say that. he was carried away by his own eloquence and said that there had been a leakage. He based his statement on the fact that the press made an announcement, some hours before the budget speech was made, that there was to be a cut of 10 per cent, in taxation. Is the honourable member for Yarra asking the House to believe that that announcement is proof that there was a leakage? The dogs were barking that forecast for three months or six months before the budget was presented or even considered. That was the most obvious piece of speculation. In the previous year tbe Government had put a 10 per cent, levy on taxation and any tyro in the press gallery would have had uo difficulty iu speculating that that levy would be removed this year. Apparently a statement was published, in the afternoon of the night on which the budget speech was made, that the defence expenditure would be increased to £200,000,000. That is a nice round figure and one that was easy to reach. Maybe that is why the Government arrived at it, but a member of the press gallery does not need to be a giant in intelligence to say to himself, "" Last year the defence vote was £160,000,000. They might try to make it £250,000,000, but times are hard and probably it will be £200,000,000 this year "". That is just the way the gentlemen of the press speculate. Then there was the increase of 7s 6d. in pensions. A member of the press gallery might well say to himself that pensions were increased by 10s. last year. An increase of 5s. would be rather mean. The difference and increase pensions by 7s. 6d. Apparently that is how the minds of the pressmen work. On such a basis, honourable members are asked to assume one of two things. Either one of the twenty members of the Cabinet betrayed particulars of the budget to the press in breach of his oath of office, or one of the very high officers of the Government-because , apart from tbe printers, only high officers know the facts-divulge d those matters to the press, also in a most outrageous breach of his obligations. Nobody has had the temerity to suggest that the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) did it. honourable gentleman as an alternative. ber thinks so, he should, stand up in the House and say it. I shall return to the point that was made by the Treasurer. If the information leaked out from one or other of the two sources that I have mentioned, why did not the press of Australia publish the juiciest bits of news? The abolition of the land tax would have hit the head-lines anywhere in Australia, and details of the education concessions would also have been topline news. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) suggested that the clever, cunning press, or the considerate press, did not disclose those juicy details because if it had done so, honourable members would not have had to attend the Parliament to hear the budget speech. That is applied reductio ad ahsurdum. The honourable member's alternative implication was that the press r did not release those attractive and juicy details because it wanted to conceal the fact that it had obtained the news improperly. There is a moral that has not been drawn hy any speaker who has participated in this debate. In recent years, some sections of the Australian press have entirely lost a sense of responsibility about budget matters. I believe that some honourable members opposite will agree with me on that point. Ever since English parliamentary institutions were established, budget secrets traditionally have been sacrosanct. The press of the Government might split the English-speaking world, certainly the English press, has accepted that responsibility and acted on it. But in Australia in recent years, it seems to be regarded as within the province of pressmen to speculate or present to the public, months or weeks ahead, as gospel truth, comments which are pure speculation. Cabinet discussed the budget this year only a week or two before it was presented to the Parliament, yet weeks or months earlier, the gentlemen in the press galleries were writing for the newspapers and",76,Department Broadcasting Bucka Eunyajl Camp
132,Mr Beale,"He did say it, but then",77,Department Broadcasting Bucka Eunyajl Camp
133,Mr Keon,I suggested the right,77,Department Broadcasting Bucka Eunyajl Camp
134,Mr Beale,"If any honourable memthe editors were publishing statements on the budget which, to the uninformed public, appeared to be gospel truth. The moral to be drawn is that there is a responsibility in this matter, and it rests upstairs in the press gallery as well as on the floor of this chamber. [ hone that the moral will be drawn by all concerned. If it is not accepted, this Parliament will have to take some special measures, in order to protect its own honour,, and the public, to ensure that that sort of assertion and speculation does not take place. It can appear in the newspapers some hours before the budget is presented and somebody can then suggest that there has been a leakage. Quite clearly no member of the Cabinet, no honourable member of this Parliament and no responsible member of the Public Service whose members serve this Government as they have served others, have been guilty of a deliberate leakage. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr no fewer than six instances the press Keon) quoted the press as having been accurate in six respects on a published statement relating to the budget. At least the Minister for Supply( Mr involved in a disclosure of budget secrets, Beale) dealt with some of those respects and that is more than I can say for any other honourable members on the Government side who have spoken in this debate. Let honourable members concede to the Minister for Supply that £200,000,000 is a good round figure; that 7s. 6d. is the difference between os. and 10s. and that 10 per cent, would be an obvious reduction in income tax. But does the Minister suggest that £959,000,000 as the total of budget expenditure is a good round figure, and that in all the possibilities £1,000,000,000, which might be within the scope of press speculation, the press arrived at £959,000,000 by coincidence? The Minister has said that the juiciest details would have been education concessions and the abolition of the land tax. ,T grant that land tax may matter to speculators, although there cannot be rapid transactions in land. Obviously education would have no significance to Speculators and neither, for that matter, would the total of the defence budget, but a reduction in the maximum sales tax from 66§ per cent, to 50 per cent, clearly is of concern to every luxury industry which bore the 66f per cent, sales tax. Further, the definite statement that the minimum rate would be 12-J per cent, mattered to every company and to every person who thought that the minimum rate might be reduced. Such a statement would put an end to speculation in that direction. Members of the Government cannot deny that the press report was absolutely accurate in six particulars. They say that that was a coincidence. Why should the public accept that statement? Now that this matter has been raised, an inquiry should be held to discover whether publication of those points was due to a coincidence or to a leakage. A Government supporter has spoken of "" despicable elements "" in the Public Service. A Minister has told us of nests of traitors in the Public Service. To-night we have had evidence that information has been given to the press or, at least, that in has correctly forecast the details of the budget. If we accept the Government' statements that no Minister has heen we can only come to the conclusion that the Government does not put any trust in its own servants. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon), who has been insulted to-night, has established an unanswerable case for an inquiry, and an inquiry should be held. I desire to refer to a matter which 1 regard as of some interest and importance to members of this Parliament. I understand that instructions haVe been issued between £900,000,000 and to officers of the Department of the Interior, particularly those who are associated with the Federal Members' Rooms, to record all trunk-line calls made by members of the Parliament and also the names of the persons to whom the calls have been made. I should like to know the reason for the issuing of such a direction if, in fact, it has been issued. It is rather peculiar that the Government should desire to check the number of trunk-line calls made by members of the Parliament. However, sucb an inquiry may be regarded as proper",77,Department Broadcasting Bucka Eunyajl Camp
135,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [11.38],,78,Department Broadcasting Bucka Eunyajl Camp
136,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [11.41],"in the view of the Government. But I am particularly interested to know why it seeks information about the persons to whom calls are made. I should like the Ministerf or the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) to give us some information on the matter, and I leave it there. The second matter to which I wish to refer concerns the Postmaster-General's Department, and, in particular, the representations made by the Ministerf o r Health( Sir Earle Page) on behalf of certain of his constituents. received from a correspondent at Ewingar a letter which reads as follows:I would like to bring to your notice the plight of our own isolated community where the Postmaster-General has seen fit to curtail our mail delivery from tliree times weekly to twice weekly. We now get our Sunday papers on Thursday. We live on a dead road and the mailman is our only connection with the outside districts. No cream carriers or -otlier transport passes through and we depend on the muil contractor for the delivery of our bread and meat and medicine supplies &c. I am referring to tlie Tabulam-Ewingar mail runa distance of twenty miles mostly roadside mail boxes which serves between 50 and 60 adults. On protesting to the Postmaster General through our local member ( Sir Earle l?age) we were told the run did not pay. But what country mail run does pay? If some city areas can 'have a twice da'ily delivery wo think we are at least entitled to -a triweekly service. If (he Government wants to keep people producing in these outlandish areas they should at least keep up the existing amenities which are few enough. I raise this matter at this stage in the hope that the Postmaster-General w ill take some action to remedy the defect to -which .my -correspondent has referred. Surely, the financial position of the Postmaster-General's Department is not so grave that these services, which my correspondent has described as amenities, -cannot-be maintained. Surety the difficulties of those who live in country districts are ,gre.a.t enough without .unnecessarily adding to .them in this way. Every possible assistance should be rendered by the 'Postal Department to the people in country -areas. The Minister 'for Health evidently made some representations in regard to this matter, but 'they were rejected by the Postmaster^General on the ground that ""the ""Tabulam-Ewingar mail service was not a -paying proposition. I agree with my correspondent that many -mail services cflannot possibly [101 be paying propositions. On the one hand, the Postmaster-General claims that insufficient funds are available to maintain these country mail services, but, on the other hand, he has treated commercial country radio stations generously in the matter of landline charges for news relays. Becently, the following instruction was issued by the Postal Department :The annual change to any commercial station, irrespective of its location for a landline used to transmit news for a period not I have exceeding 15 minutes on each occasion for any or all of the sessions at or about 7.45 a.m., 12.30 p.m. and 7 p.m. on week-days and S.40 a.m., 12.30 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Sundays will be only £52 a year. We should ascertain the value of those concessions to the country radio stations. The instruction continuesThe effect of the concession on the financial operation of many stations will be substantial seeing that in sonje cases, the application of standard rates for news relays (on the basis of the actual radial distance) has involved a yearly payment to the order of £2,000 a station. The Postmaster-General .says to the unfortunate country residents, in effect, "" You cannot have a tri-weekly mail service, notwithstanding the fact that you are dependent upon the .service not only for mail deliveries but also for food and medical supplies "". But he also says to the country radiio .stations, "" I am prepared to reduce land-line charges for news relays from £2,000 .to £52 a year "" . I shall be interested to hear the comments of the Minister for Health .about the matter. for Health) '[11.47] I did .not know that it was fhe custom for honourable members of this chamber to intervene in matters that concern the electorates of other honourable members. During the whole of the time that I have heen a member of this Parliament, I have in variably found ""that correspondence sent to an honourable member by a resident of another electorate is invariably referred to the representative of that constituent. Consequently, I was astounded that the honourable member .for East Sydney( Mr. Wai'd) should raise a inatter that concerns my electorate without having first acquainted me of his intention to do so.",78,Department Broadcasting Bucka Eunyajl Camp
