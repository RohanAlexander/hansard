Can the Minister inform me whether any action can be taken to ensure that master plumbers and other persons in South Australia, who require these water supply fittings, shall be able to obtain them? thero is any way in which the Commonwealth can assist in the matter that the honourable member has raised. Since the referendum on the control of rents and prices, the States are responsible for the administration of prices control, and the Commonwealth is unable to fix prices in such a way as to ensure that at least fair quantities of water supply littings shall be available, in South Australia. As to whether a direction should be issued to South Australian manufacturers to reserve a certain percentage of their output for uso in that State, the position is that the Commonwealth has no control of water supply fittings made of brass, but until recently it endeavoured to control steel products. Again, because tha defence power is no longer valid for that particular purpose, the Commonwealth eannot interfere with the existing position and promulgate new regulations relating to the allocation of supplies of that kind. Therefore, I cannot see that the Commonwealth is able to assist in the matter in sny way. COAL. ter is reported to have told the annual conference of the New South Wales branch of the . Australian Labour party at the week-end that the coal-miners would be guilty of base ingratitude if they decided to strike on Thursday, and thus deprive fellow citizens of urgently needed coal. Will the right honourable gentleman take ths logical step and follow the example of the British Minister for Labour by telling the miners that those who support the threatened strike will allow tliemselves to bo used as the dupes of the Communists, by 'allowing them to take control of the affairs of their union out of the hands of Australian trade unionists? In. the light, of the right honourable gentleman's castigation of the miners, what will the Government do if the threatened strike takes place? recapitulate ell that I said on Sunday about coal. ment going to do? ber can answer hia own questions if he interrupts as soon as I start to speak If the honourable memher desires to know what I said, I shall arrange for a cop; of my speech to be forwarded to him. The threatened stoppage is a matter for the Coal Industry Tribunal, Mr J. H . Gallagher. I understand that he hat already taken certain action. A meeting of the coal mining unions council was held this morning. The members of the council were to have met the Coal Industry Tribunal at 2.30 p.m. to-day, but I have been informed that a postponement of the meeting has been requested. Nothing would be gained if 1 made statements about the matter whilr conferences are pending.

If it did, can the Minister give an indication of the nature of its deliberations regarding religious and electioneering broadcasts ? Broadcasting Control Board meets regularly. As a matter of fact, like the French parliament during tbe years of the Erench revolution from 1789 onwards, it is in constant session. It is considering tbe matter to whicb the honourable member bas referred, and quite a number of other matters as well. In due course, it will report to the Postmaster General upon them. If the Postmaster General considers it necessary to make any submissions to Cabinet, he will do so. The honourable member can rest assured that in regard to political, religious and controversial broadcasts generally the board and the Government will, as usual, deal out even-handed justice.

""Will the Minister for the Interior inform me whether that position has been filled ?

At the moment the applications are witb tbe Public Service Board. fact that between 30,000,000 and 40,000,000 super, feet of exportable timber is awaiting shipment on Tasmanian wharfs mainly because of tbe difficulty of obtaining sufficient shipping their stock.

That would help to ease the position in Tasmania. quantities of timber are awaiting shipment from Tasmania to tbe mainland but I do not think that shipping delays will result in Tasmanian merchants losing their markets on the mainland. Tbe demand for timber is now, and will be for a long time, very strong. It would probably be difficult to arrange for oversumption of milk in Sydney and Newseas vessels to call at Tasmanian ports to castle has increased from 28,000,000 galload timber before calling at ports on the mainland.

MEAT A ND BUTTER. attention of tbe Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to the fact that official trade figures show that Australian shipments of butter and beef to the United Kingdom during the last ten months were 15,668,700 lb. and 26,285,300 lb. respectively iower than the corresponding figures for last year. Will the honourable gentleman state the reason for that decrease? Does Britain now need meat, butter and fats more urgently than any other food product? Has the Government taken any steps to secure an immediate increase of exports of butter and meat to the United Kingdom? siderable time to answer the question fully. One reason for tbe decrease of the quantity of meat exported to the United Kingdom is that seasonal conditions have been very favorable and producers have shown a strong tendency to hold be accelerated. With regard to butter production, tbe Australian Government bas instituted guaranteed prices for producers of dairy products and has negotiated a Will the Minister represeven-year contract witb tbe United Kingdom at handsome prices. Every possible given to the dairy-farmers of this country. It is hoped that as dairy herds increase, the production of butter will also increase. It must be remembered that the population of this, country is now considerably larger than it was before, and that there bas been a considerable increase of the quantity of dairy products that is consumed in Australia. If the honourable gentleman examines the figures showing the overall production of whole milk, including milk used for making butter, he will find that there has been practically no decrease. As an illustration, the conlons annually before the war to 54,000,000 gallons annually. It must be obvious that, if consumption has increased in all big cities at that rate, we cannot expect to export the same amount of butter as we exported previously.",12,Northern Territory Supplies Of Bore Casing And Fencing He Proposes To Do In Such Matters How

Under its war-time powers, the Commonwealth conducted oat pools and provided guaranteed prices for oats for several years. However, with the disappearance of those war-time powers, it is not constitutionally possible for the Government to conduct oat pools now unless the respective State Parliaments enact complementary legislation. This matter was discussed at a recent meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council, but the representatives of the States did not show any enthusiasm about the proposal to arrange Commonwealth pools validated by State legislation. In those circumstances, it would be quite outside the jurisdiction and competence of the Commonwealth to conduct pools for oatgrowers. If the States see fit to raise the matter again and are prepared to enact complementary legislation on lines similar to that which authorizes the wheat scheme, favorable consideration will be given to helping oat-growers by the operation of pools.

They claimed that they were losing heavily on existing rates. I do not remember that they gave reasons for the losses, but I think reference was made to increasing casts.

NEW TOWNSHIP OF LAE . eigbteen months ago, I was shown a plan of the proposed new town which was to be situated in a certain district fronting the beach, and every one concerned believed that that plan was to be followed. Can the Minister acting for the Minister for External Territories say whether that plan, after having been exhibited for so long, has now been scrapped in favour of a new proposal to build a town about a mile away from the position marked in the first plan? What has been done to meet the convenience and wishes of residents, and to ensure that they will be satisfactorily accommodated under tbe new proposals ? original surveys and plans for the new township of Lae were prepared it was not realized that so much land would be lost to the sea because of the falling away of the beach. For some time it has been understood that the new township be constructed on higher lands. A fresh plan was prepared when it was decided that it would be unwise to build on the former township area. The new plan was approved some time ago, and individuals who desired to acquire areas for the erection of hotels and premises in tbe business section of Lae have been aware of that decision for some time. I do not believe that loss has been sustained by any of the citizens of Lae, who have been well aware of the circumstances which necessitated the utilization of the higher reaches of the area. When I was at Lae about six months ago I spoke to several business people, and they were quite satisfied",16,Defence

Proposed vote, £725,950. the ISth May, I asked a question relating to the number and tbe speed of ships that transport coal from Newcastle to South Australia. The Minister for Shipping and Fuel (Senator Ashley) gave a ful l reply, but I bope that tbe Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman), who represents bim in this chamber, will ask him to impress upon the Combined Traffic Committee, whicb allot*, vessels to the coal trade, the urgent need to ensure that only the fastest shipp are allocated to the long journey from Newcastle to South Australia. Frequently, the industrial and domestic life of that State is disrupted because the class of steamer that has been carrying coal there has been too slow. Had a fast obip been made available for the voyage, the inconvenience would bave been averted. I hope that the Combined Traffic Oommittee will allocate faster steamers to that trade in future. other field of government control and activity does the method and experience of socialism show up so badly as it doec in the Government's record of tbe control of shipping and waterfront activities in recent years. The people of Australia should thoroughly examine that illustration for some indication of what our future experience is likely to be under a socialist programme. At question time to-day, I indicated some facte which have led me to the conclusion that control of shipping activities by governI asked the Prime ments in Australia has brought results which amount to a national scandal. There can be no worse advertisement for socialist enterprise than the history of government control of shipping in recent years. No matter how we examine the problem, the record is black. An examination of the efficiency of the shipping services, the speed with which cargoes are unloaded or loaded, the industrial record on the waterfront, and freight charges discloses a serious drift from bad to worse. The more controls that are imposed, tbe more impossible the situation becomes. I shall cite a few illustrations of what I have in mind wben. I make those charges. Let us consider freight rates. Costs have risen throughout Anstralia since the beginning of the war and it is natural that shipping charges should have increased also, but it would be difficult",19,Capital Issues

77,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [3.58],"In noto turn to any other field of industrial activity and find increased charges equal to the increase of shipping charges. Whereas the freight rate between Melbourne and Sydney was 27s. a ton in 1939, it has now, as the result of the latest increase that has been adopted by tbe Australian Shipping Board and the private shipping companies, jumped to 82s. a ton, which is more than three times the pre-war rate. That, in itself, is serious, for it has an important bearing on living costs and upon the goods that can be supplied from one State to another. It bas an important influence on relieving tbe shortages that press so acutely upon industries and consumers in Australia. I illustrate what the increased shipping charges have meant in Victoria. A report issued at the week-end by the Victorian Chamber of Commerce reveals that the volume of interstate cargo handled through Victorian ports in 1947-48 was 526,000 tons less than in 1938-39. We are constantly told by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) about the level of prosperity in Australia. Yet we find that, far , from increasing, the volume of freight passing from Victoria, one of the most important industrial States of Australia, to other States declined from 3,657,000 tons in 1938-39 to 3,131,000 tons in 1947-48. In 1947-48, 112,000 tons less coal was handled in Victorian ports than in the pre-war years. I have merely given an illustration of the traffic between Melbourne and Sydney. Freights between other ports have increased sensationally, too. The volume of cargo handled has declined seriously. This is not because of fewer ships being available. As the bonorable member for speech earlier in this sessional period, the to monopolies and the evils associated tonnage available to shift cargoes interstate is more tban 40 per cent, greater tban it was before the war. Yet ships are shifting less cargo than they were then. On the one hand, we have increased freights and more ships to handle tbe cargo, and on the other hand a declining volume of cargo handled. The Government has sought to improve the shipping position in various ways, but it has looked primarily to the method of government control and Mr Holt. government. direction in order to bring about the improvement. The Stevedoring Industry Commission, -which was to bave brought peace to the waterfront and improve the conditions of the waterside workers, has not had the desired results. In the three-year period from 1937 to 1939, the average discharging rate was 804 tons a day, but, in the three-year period from 1945 to 1947, the average discharging rate was only 355 tons a day. charging rate per vessel throughout Australia. Wbat has been the effect of the Stevedoring Industry Commission? Has it brought industrial peace to the waterfront? Has it brought about more consistent work on the waterfront? No! The Government is so dissatisfied with the way in wbich it has operated that we were told to-day by the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) that it intends to bring down legislation to abolish the commission and set up another authority, which, it is hoped, will bave a better result. Let me give another illustration of what we can expect from socialized enterprises and of the evils associated with socialism. Admittedly, work on the waterfront bas not been satisfactory. The domination exercised by the Communist leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation so accentuated these difficulties that the Government, at last, was goaded into expelling from the Stevedoring In dustry Commission Mr Healy and Mr Roach, who were the two representatives of tbe federation. But curiously the Government bas given to tbem and to tbe federation a monopoly of employment on the waterfront. It is remarkable that tbe Government, which professes opposition with monopolies, has placed that union, whicb, on its own admission, is dominated by Communists, in tbe position of monoabout 7£ per cent, polizing employment on the waterfront. From time to time, when it is decided that more waterside workers are needed, the Government turns to tbe Waterside Workers Federation and says that 300 or 500 more men, as the case may be, are needed. The federation then opens its membership books and accepts as members tbe necessary additional waterside",20,Department Of Shipping And Fuel

The"" r e t t in g "" ia done not by the Government or its representatives, the port committees, which might usefully be employed for that purpose, but by the Communist-dominated Waterside Workers Federation. Therefore, unless a man in the port of Sydney is approved by Mr Healy and his colleagues, be cannot become a waterside worker. That is a most remarkable state of affairs. Is that what the Australian people intended when they gave the Government the powers that it exercises? Was it intended, for example, that a man who wants to work on the waterfront can be prohibited from doing so by the Waterside Workers Federation because he is not acceptable to it, or because his political views and philosophy do not accord with those of Comrade Healy and bis associates? Is that what the people of Australia stand for? I assure the Government that that is what is happening. The appropriate course in engaging waterside workers would be for the Government to call for applications ancl make the selection. It may be that, under the legislation, preference in employment is given to members of tbe Waterside Workers Federation and that, once a man has been selected for employment on the waterfront, he should be told that the federation attends to waterfront employment matters and that it is desirable for bim to become a member cf it. It is, however, most improper that a trade union should have the right to select the men who are to be engaged in an industry and to refuse to admit to that industry persons that it regards as being unacceptable.

If the board has incurred a loss of £8,000,000 during this year, it is safe to assume that it would have been forced to increase its charges in any event. The committee should be told whether the increase of 15s. a ton will be sufficient to cover tbe operating losses that are now being incurred by the board. The disastrous results to which I have referred are attributable in part, if not entirely, to the governmental control that has been exercised over shipping operations by the Australian Shipping Board and by the operations of the Maritime Industry Commission and the Stevedoring Industry Commission, whicb determine conditions of work and rates of pay for seamen and waterside workers. No satisfactory explanation bas been given of the removal of the maritime industry and the stevedoring industry from the jurisdiction of tbe Arbitration Court. Those industries may have special problems, but many other industries also have special problems. No two industries are alike, but that fact h^s not prevented tbe Arbitration Court from dealing successfully with a variety of industries. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Sheehan) -Order!

[ have some knowledge of tbe conditions r hat prevailed in Port Adelaide. Before the waterside workers there erected their ->wn hall in which they could take shelter while waiting, the two pickingiiri places were on the footpaths outside the Customs House and the Wharf Hotel. The men had to wait at those places in all kinds of weather. No provision was made for a proper picking-up ulace, and finally the men provided omthemselves. At one time, wben tbe waterside workers in Port Adelaide knocked off at 12 noon for their midday meal, the doors of the sheds in which cargo Ls kept were locked, and the tally -Jerks went away. Many of the wharfs were a considerable distance from tbe nearest eating hpuse. The men wbo were working on the ships at those wharfs had -jither to make arrangements to bave cheir meal brought to them at the wharf or to take it with them when they left bome in the morning. At midday they had to find a. place in which to shelter from the wind or the rain wbile they were eating. Nothing was done for them by the shipping companies or tbe stevedoring companies. Now that the Stevedoring Industry Act is in operation and port committees bave been established, '-afeterias have been provided in which rhe men can obtain a reasonable meal and enjoy some of the amenities that are available to employees in other industries. It would be jumping out of tbe frying pan into the fire to bring tbe industry again within the jurisdiction of tbe Arbitration Court. I agree with the bonorable member for Fawkner that we ure not getting all that we should get in return for what has been done for the waterside workers, but if we abandon the present system, under which the men take part in the control of the industry, . and institute a system under which decisions will be made by a judge of the Arbitration Court, conditions will be created that will cause further strife in the industry. Tbe bonorable member for Fawkner has referred to tbe increase of freight rates that are charged by shipping companies and has suggested that the increase is due to a reduction of the amonnt of oargo that is handled by each waterside worker. I admit that the man-hour quantity of cargo handled has fallen considerably since tbe war, but the samething is true of all other industries. The waterside worker is no worse off than thpotber fellow. means that we are worse off. the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) now receives considerably more money for less work than he did before tbe war, although I do not know what tbe bonorable gentleman gets now and what he received then. That is common to most people, and does not apply only to waterside workers. I do not know whether the honourable member for Fawkner had any experience of the stevedoring industry in the ""good old days "" of whicb he speaks, when the industry came within the jurisdiction of tbe Arbitration Court and when there was no guarantee that a man would get a fair share of the work that was available. I do not know whether tbe honourable gentleman has ever heard of what were called the "" bull gangs"". That term was a very apt one. In the ""good old days"" there were more men than jobs. No appearance money was paid. If a man wanted to keep his job he had to maintain, if he could, the pace that was set by tbe bull gang. Tbe average output of a bull gang wae usually much above tbe average output of tbe same number of men working at normal pressure. The men knew that, when work was scarce, only those who set the pace in the bull gangs would be employed. Some members of the community, not members of this Parliament, would like to return to the conditions under which men who did not set the pace would lose their jobs.

Shipping hold-ups do not appear to bave been occasioned so mucb by any desire on the part of wharflabourers and seamen to secure higher rates of pay and better conditions as by a general determination to delay the transmoved by the Government, were deterportation of supplies and interfere witb industry, for, as in the case of the coalvent a faster turn-round of ships and miners, all reasonable claims have been granted. In the district whicb I represent, the towns of Maryborough and Bundaberg are dependent upon river boat services, but there has been increasing delay in tbe shipment of essential supplies by river boat service. At one time, both towns enjoyed a weekly or even a better service. Tbe present time-table provides for monthly visits instead, but. in practice, ships sometimes arrive at intervals of several months. This has a serious effect upon the development of the area and upon the prosperity of industry generally. Contractors have great difficulty in providing constant employment for their men, especially in the building trade. The iron and steel industry, engineering concrete construction work and road building have been seriously affected. It is very difficult to establish any new enterprise because of the shortage of essential supplies from manufacturers in New South Wales and Victoria. The honorab'e member for Capricornia ( Mr the eountry districts of Queensland should Davidson) and I bave endeavoured to assist local chambers of commerce by urging the Government to take action to overcome the difficulty so that developgoods transported by sea. Private enterment can proceed unhampered. However, nothing has been done to help the community. I know that the services are conducted by private shipping firms, but they cannot be held to be entirely responsible for the delays. We have had all kinds of experiments by this Government in respect of control of the shipping industry, but all of them have failed. As a result, the Government has been forced to return to the control of industrial conditions in the industry being exercised by a judge of the Arbitration Court. But it does not matter who controls the industry if the Government does not stand behind the controlling authority. I do not say that the Stevedoring Industry Commission, which the Government has abolished, did not try to do its best in the interests of Australian shipping and of the community generally. There is no doubt that Mr Healy and Mr Roach, who represented the waterfront employees on the commission, and who were recently remined to do everything possible to prethe continuity of supplies to areas that depended on the southern States for tbeir needs. I have strongly supported the request made by the towns of Bundaberg and Maryborough that the last ship delivered to the Government from Walker's Limited be placed in service in the river trade by its being made available to the shipping company responsible for the carriage of goods to such ports. That should be done, and if the shipping companies do not desire to increase the number of ships that they are now using to serve tbose districts the Government should ensure that the additional ship is made available. Our first, consideration is tbe supply of goods to those areas, l f the shipping companies are unable to supply establishments, their needs adequately then we ask that the Government step in and do so through the medium of the expensive Australian Shipping Board. It is forecast that the Government's direct interest in shipping will cost the taxpayers £8,000,000 in tbe coming year.

Later, the dispute spread to another ship in Brisbane. The delays in the sailings of those two ships occasioned a loss that has never",24,Department Of Shipping And Fuel

There aTe shiploads of products required for country districts in Queensland lying around in southern ports, particularly Newcastle and Sydney, awaiting shipment. It appears to be impossible for tbe Government or any controlling authority to have those commodities shipped promptly to the places where they are urgently required. Some cargoes get as far as Brisbane and lie at the wharfs there for long periods. The result of sucb delays is an 'increase in freight costs. The consumers have to pay this increase, and will still have to pay it in addition to the latest general increase of 115a. a ton recently approved by the Governmenit. I do not agree with .tiie honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr overseas shipping is controlled by thf Thompson) that all the trouble connected with the dripping industry arises from past grievances that were caused because tie employees of tihe industry considered that tbey had not received their full due. That is nonsense. Every sectiwn of the community has a past, and considers that it has not received all that it was entitled (to. This is especially true of the primary --prodncers. That feeling, va fact, is 'genera! throughout the world. Waterfront employees and seamen in Australia have been given just about everytihing that Chey ihave asked for. The real trouble -with the industry has 'been the determination of Communist-controlled -anions to upset its stability and create 'controlled unions have already achieved the latter, 'objective among carpenters, iron and steel workers, sugar industry workers and otber tradesmen. I nrge the Government to control industrial unrest on the waterfront and to make more -ships available for river and coastal traffic in 'Queensland. I do not know wJaether the 'last ship delivered from Wialker's Lirnrtwl has been lying idle since itfhe occasion t'hat I boarded it in Maryborough, but I do 'know that although it bas been banded over to the Cornmonwealt'h it cannot be allocated to any trade 'until tlie Australian Shipping Board is 'constituted. I understand that applications (Eor the position of chairman of that board have been invited in other'countries, «o T -suppose we shall not get adequate -shipping for 'Queensland river and coastal ports until the board 'has been properly constituted, if ever. Whether that is so OT not, I urge the Government now to remove obstacles that have prevented th* free flow of goods to country districts in Queensland. Mr O'CONNOB (West Sydney) [4.37]. I am not hopeful that tbe contributions that have been made to the debate by the two honourable members who have so far spoken from tbe Opposition side of tbe committee will help in solving problems related to shipping. Those honourable members bave taken advantage of the debate to attack, first, the Government and, secondly, the men engaged in the industry. It is well to point out that Australian Shipping Board but that coastal shipping was handed back to its owners some considerable time .ago, and also that the first thing that happened after its return to the owners waa an increase of 15 per cent, in freight rates. Therefore, coastal freight charges are primarily the responsibility of private enterprise, and the Government has no responsibility for that increase of 15 per cent, in freight raies. Private enterprise, .so far as coastal shipping is concerned, has all tbe initiative and freedom that it previously had. 1 bave read some of .the balance-sheets of snipping companies from time to time. They make fhe usual attacks on the Government, predict all nnenj/ployment. Commnnistkinds of shortcomings for the future and wind up by informing the shareholders that they bave just ended one of .the most properous years of theii history. That goes on from time .to .time. Notwithstanding the tale of woe that has been unfolded by the Opposition I say unhesitatingly that the .shipping companies of Australia harce em'oyed an era of prosperity unprecedented in tbeir .history. Their balance.sheets show that tbey have gone from strength to strength. In addition to paying dividends of between 7 per cent, and 10 per cent, tbey have established large reserves. A survey of the 'balance-sheets of the private shipping companies -shows that thair reserve holdings 'are higher today than ever before. There has been considerable development in transportation in this country during the last ten years. Airlines are to-day 'handling a considerable volume of traffic that, prior to 193S, was the monopoly of the shipping companies. Tbe competition now offered by the airlines is considerable. An attack has been made by the Opposition on the Stevedoring Industry Commission. I point out that that tribunal did an immeasurable amount of work to improve the conditions of workers on tbe waterfront. Until 1938 conditions in that industry were comparable with those in tbe coal-mining industry in this country. The conditions of the workers bad been neglected by those whose principal concern was the making of profits out of those industries. In view of the appalling conditions under which the waterfront employees laboured prior to the establishment of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, it is no wonder that the background of the shipping industry is clouded in an atmosphere nf bitterness and turbulence. -be proud of that the conditions in this inintend to authorize an increase of the dustry were allowed to deteriorate to sucb a degree prior to the establishment of the commission. I am pleased, that the -Stevedoring Industry Conimission contributed so substantially to the improvement of conditions on the waterfront. The honourable member for Fawkner{ Mr Holt) attacked the federation for having a monopoly of employment in tbe .industry. There is nothing unusual about she union covering tbe calling of waterside employment. In other industries, also, the position is tbe same. So far as the waterfront is concerned, the members of the federation do a specific task in accordance with the will of the Arbitration Court. The members of other unions engaged in the industry also do specific tasks allotted to them by tbe Arbitration Oourt. All that tbe members of the federation bave done has been to carry out the work allotted to tbem by tbe court. Inasmuch as theirs is the union that -covers that industry, there is nothing unusual in. tbeir having a monopoly. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr O'Connor) has said that the shipowners increased freights by 15 per cent, when the Government relinquished control of the industry. It has already been pointed out to bonorable members, and I tbink that it sbould be pointed out again, in case the bonorable member seeks to persuade people to draw a wrong inference, that that 15 per cent, increase was made witb the consent of tbe Maritime Services Commission of tbe day. I do not intend, however, to embark on a discussion with the honourable meniber or answer his hymn of bate about the private ship-owners. Last Monday the Full High Conn of Australia declared that liquid fuel rationing regulations were invalid, and as a result the public became entitled to buy petrol witbout having to surrender petrol ration coupons, and without any limitations except the availability of supplies. The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has said that only a limited quantity of petrol can be brought into Australia because most of that commodity comes from dollar sources. The right It is nothing to honourable gentleman said that he does not quantity of petrol that may be brought into this country. In view of the observations that were made recently by the Leader of the Australian Country parly ( Mr Fadden), I should have thought that it would be very difficult for the Prime Minister to maintain that attitude. The arguments advanced b> the Leader of the Australian Country parly were most impressive and persuasive. However, I am not going to canvass that. Following the court's judgment the Prime Minister said that be intended to ask the States to take over petrol rationing control. The right honourable gentleman did not do what a real national leader sbould hav* done. He entirely failed the people of Australia on a great issue and a great occasion. The Full High Court of Australia bad struck off some shackles that had been around the people for a good many years, and returned to them some of the freedom and liberty of action that bad been surrendered by them during the wai' period. Instead of the Prime Minister saying to the people of Australia, "" Th<law now is that you are as free as you were in 1939 to buy and sell and come and go in this field, and I as the leader of the Government will do what I can to assist you "", be suggested that chaos would result. One would bave thought that",25,Department Of Shipping And Fuel
92,Mr Beale (Parramatta) [4.451,"he wonld devise ways for the people to make the position simpler and easier for themselves. The Government failed the people because the Prime Minister adopted a doctrinaire attitude. It was obvious that he did not want this control co go; he did not agree that the return of an essential freedom to the people was a <yood thing for the people. It was an occasion for leadership and we did not get it. f t will be a tragedy if petrol rationcontrol. There is a psychological factor ing is re-imposed on the people because it will mean that once again the shadow of sharp practice, dishonesty, and tbe black market will come back into tbe commercial and private lives of tbe people. Lt will not merely mean that once again ordinary freedom of action will be taken it way. experience of petrol rationing in Australia over the last few years knows that many people have resorted to tbe black market. They claim that they were driven to break the law of the land in an effort to satisfy themselves in tbeir own particular way. justify the breaking of the law, wben a law is ont of touch with public opinion, HS this law was, and drives people into committing breaches, that law is bad and should bo got rid of as soon as possible. That is why it would be a tragedy to re-impose rationing. The bonorable member for Perth( Mr Burke) asked what wonld happen if rationing were not restored. During the week-end, I took time off to go round my electorate and speak to garage proprietors and distributors in an endeavour to learn what was their reaction, and that of the public, to -he abolition of petrol rationing. It is somewhat early to speak dogmatically, but one might say that, with tbe exception of tbe holiday week-end, when one would expect oonsumption to increase, there has been no notable increase of buying. Some distributors put up notices, *' Bring your drums, no restriction on sales "". That was unwise and greedy; but the reputable distributors, who are in a great majority, did not do mything of tbe sort. Tbey supplied the ""ustomers as they came, and to the few who wanted extra petrol, they said, "" We have plenty of petrol in our tanks. Do not. buy more than you want"". After a day or two, in the area wbicb I represent, things had settled down. Tbat is likely to be the position everywhere if distributors and the public are wise, and exercise restraint, instead of giving way to panic. That is what tbe Prime Minister should have told the people. He should have given them a lead, instead of talking of chaos. Obviously, his nose was out of joint because tbe High Court had taken away tbe Commonwealth's power of involved in a matter of this kind. When a thing is hard to get, people want it. When meat was rationed, people bought to tbe limit of the ration. When rationing was abolished, purchases fell off, and meat is available to-day in a way in which it was not available when rationAnybody who has had any ing was in force. The same may be said of clothes rationing. If the petrol distributors are given a chance, and not interfered with, and if tbe public exercise a reasonable amount of restraint and common sense, there will be no shortage of petrol, and we sball be in no worse AlthoughI do not attempt to position than when rationing was in force. Tbere will be the great advantage that we shall be saved tbe expense of administering the rationing system, and relieved of the cloud of illegality and chicanery whicb has surrounded petrol rationing for tbe last five years. honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) seems to have a strange idea of the qualities of leadership. He attacked the decision of the Prime Minister( Mr Cbifley) to call a conference of State Premiers to discuss tbe position arising c-ut of the decision of tbe High Court that the Commonwealth no longer has power to ration petrol. He then went on to say that the Prime Minister was adamant in his decision that no more petrol would be imported. A little later, he said that, even if rationing were nof restored, no more petrol would be consumed. That seems to justify the stand taken by the -Prime Minister, who has said that the Government will not neree to a greater quantity of petrol being imported. It is clear that when mow cars, some locally made and some imported, go on tbe road the consumption of petrol must increase, even if the consumption per car remains the same.",27,Department Of Shipping And Fuel
93,Mr Burke (Perth) [4.55],"Tb eFO if rationing had continued. wasdesigned to keep consumption, particularly of petrol from dollar areas, as low as possible. It is obvious that tbe abolivices for ports in northern Australia, tion of rationing must result in increased consumption. The increase may be great or small, and it may be true that, in the long run, consumption will settle down to something only slightly more tban it is at present, but we have no way of knowing. If consumption does not in-, crease materially, it will only be because petrol is dear. Certainly, if petrol were cheaper a great deal more would be used. Tbe honourable memher for Parramatta repeated the argument of the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr four vessels from the eastern States have Padden) that enough petrol was available from non-dollar areas to enable rationing to be abolished. We beard the Leader of the Australian Country party say that Britain was supplyingpetrol in large quantities to other countries, but we know the reason for that. The Prime Minister pointed out that Great Britain, because of tfey economic position, was forced to barter petrol for meat and other foodstuffs from Argentina. The Leader of the Anstralian Country party said that the proceedsof the sale of petrol, eveni f converted ultiTerritory require the delivery of freight mately into dollars, would in tbe mean1 time be held' as a sterling balance. We must take a long-range view of thisproblem. Britain has a huge dollar deficit. £n a few years,, it will have torepay the loan to the United' States of America, and meet the liabilities; represented by the great trade credits that were established in London by variouscountries during, the war. I do not know what tbe real position is*, but I assume that. tbe abolition o<f petrol rationing in Australia would ultimately affect Britain's ability to obtain dollar credits. The Prime. Minister bias imfo'rmation. on this subject wbicb is not available to us, but it is to be given to the Premiers when they confer, withi him. If tbe States agree to. ration petrol i i will; not. be because tbey like doingi t amy more tban we do,, but because the pressure, of circumstances, and the dire needs of British economy demand that we should assist the British by retaining petrol rationing in some form[5.1] -Sinc e the committee is discussing tbe proposed vote for the Department'of Shipping and Fuel, I emphasize tbe need to provide more adequate shipping serand particularly for Darwin. Although the Minister for Shipping and Fuel (Senator Ashley) promised last year that a service would be provided to Darwin every six weeks, no improvement bas taken place. Indeed, the shipping situation bas deteriorated considerably, and the local chamber of commerce unofficially placed its case before me and Senator O'Sullivan, who is a member of the Public Works Committee, which recently visited Darwin. Since March, 1948, only brought freight to Darwin. Tbe dates of their arrival were the 27th March, tbe 27tb July, the 3rd November, 1948, and Uie 29th March, 1949. Although the Government may contend that the deficiency was compensated for by the visits of the steamship Koolinda, which carries freight from Western Australia, and made fourteen visits during that period, I point ont that the rebuilding programme of Darwin and the needs generally of the people of the Northern fromi tbe manufacturing areas of southern and eastern Australia. Since Western Australia has not yet become a highly developed industrial State, vessels from that State cannot supply bore casing, barbed wire, windmills-,, fencing materials, cement, and all the other materials required for housing. While returning to Canberra frommy electorate I was invited by the people of Townsville, Queensland, to join tbeir local movement of revolt against what they term "" Brisbane government"". I took, tlie opportunity to stress tQ' them the lack of facilities provided i&s north Australia, and, in conseqiHienee, I . was asked to move a motion that tke Australian Government should be called upon to construct railways to connect the. Northern Territory with the east eoast. of Australia as well as with. Alice Springs. Al thongh one of the local eouneiUors, who voiced the general resentment against the lack of proper shipping services i m Townsville, strenuously criticized the ""Brisbane, g & v e r n n i e n t . I believe",28,Department Of Shipping And Fuel
94,Mr Holt,That would have been,29,Department Of Shipping And Fuel
95,Mr Burke,"Perhaps, but rationing",29,Department Of Shipping And Fuel
96,Mr Blain (Northern Territory),"that he should also have included the Commonwealth Government in his condemnation. I point out to the Government that both Townsville and Darwin would be much better served if smaller vessels of, say, 3,000 tons, were sent to north Australia from the eastern and southern States. Such vessels bave a much quicker turn-round, and instead of Darwin receiving four sea deliveries a year it would probably receive at least eight. The necessity for frequent deliveries is underlined by the humid climate which prevails in Darwin. To take as an example the requirements of the local baking industry, I point out that very few of the bakers can afford to purchase 60 tons of flour at a time, and that even if they could do so, most of the flour would become mouldy because of tbe climate. An improvement of the Darwin shipping service would also save the Government considerable money by avoiding the payment of expensive road freights on the haulage of goods required for consumption in service messes and canteens. At present the inadequate sea deliveries of stores for service messes have to be supplemented by stores hauled by road from Alice Springs to Darwin, a distance of approximately 1,000 miles, at a cost of £25 per ton, to say nothing of the additional freight of approximately £10 a ton charged for haulage from Adelaide to Alice Springs by rail. Prior to the war, ships carted freight from the south at approximately £3 a ton, and I feel sure that the present sea freights are not more than £5 per ton. I was approached by representatives of public servants in Alice Springs who complained that the cost of living has risen substantially because of an increase of 25 per cent, in freights from Adelaide to Alice Springs, which bas taken place within the last three months. Those who are receiving only tbe basic wage and a little more are at their wits' ends to pay their way, and they have decided to approach the Public Service Board for a special allowance to offset the very considerable local increase of the cost of living. In addition, I point out that the recent substantial increase in the freight rates must also have an adverse affect on the supply of food for the people of Darwin, as the 130] increased rail freight will be passed on to consumers. Two members of tbe Opposition urged that tbe Stevedoring Industry Commission should be abolished, which would mean, of course, that the commission would no longer control the ports of northern Australia. I do not agree with that contention. In consider it highly desirable that a governmental authority should be retained for tbe port of Darwin. Incidentally, tbe press must bave received some advance information of the Government's intentions, when it stated that the Minister for Transport ( Mr ""Ward) was most eager to retain the commission in existence so that Communists and other undesirables would not take charge of tbe waterfront industry. Apparently the press was right when it stated that the Minister fought vigorously for the retention of the commission. I compliment the Government on having, in tbe first place, appointed a representative of the Stevedoring In dustry Commission in Darwin, and my only regret is that the gentleman appointed, Mr Maguire, who is a very able man and understands tbe industry thoroughly, should operate in Darwin only on a part-time basis. For years the people of Darwin urged me to press the Government to appoint an industrial authority for Darwin who could conciliate the parties and prevent major disputes from developing out of small incidents. Some time ago I approached tbe Minister for the In terior ( Mr Johnson), explained the situation to bim, and suggested that a certain individual whom I named should be appointed for that purpose. Although the Government did not accept my suggestion, it sent Mr Barry to Darwin to examine the situation on the waterfront last July, and he recommended the appointment of Mr Maguire on a part-time basis. Mr Barry was unable to obtain the services of any one on a full-time basis, who knows all there is to be known about the work. Mr Maguire pointed out that for a person to be in a position to consider the problems of wharf labourers he must virtually live with the men. He must know their problems, and, at the same time, be something of a student in psychology. If the representative of the Stevedoring wharfs in order to see at first hand tht Industry Commission be withdrawn from work being done tbere.

In reply I was informed by the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Fuel that the instruction merely meant that the men were to collect tbeir final pay on dismissal.

Because of the publication of that paragraph I take the opportunity to say now what I could not -tay when framing my question. I had been informed that occasionally men on the waterfront were told to take their time because there was no great burry about the unloading of a certain cargo. The waterside workers told me that they believed that the employer wbo was concerned in this matter bad an ulterior motive, which was to discredit tbe water*ide workers and the Commonwealth Government. Tbey knew that if the turnround of the vessels was slow, the Government would get the blame. able inember that? Mrs. BLACKBURN -Tb e men on the waterfront told me.

The honourable member rather took me to task for my advocacy of the abolition of rationing. I shall not restate the case that I have already presented on this matter, but I sball bring to tbe notice of honourable members and of the country the latest information on tbe world petrol position. The following article appears in this afternoon's Sydney Sun:NK W YORK -World oil markets which havs been in American hands almost since th* inception of the industry, are now definitely parsing to Britiah interests. This is stated by the New York Times after a survey by the US. International oil executives. The trend was emphasized a week ago when the British Government reached an agreement to supply the petroleum needs of Argentina I am not as simple for the next five years, according to the Americans. Under the arrangement, Britain w ill supply I asked tbe 6ome ] 00,000 barrels daily of o i l products from the sterling area in exchange for meat and grain. While some of this oil may come from Venezuela, the consensus in the trade is that the bulk will Mine from British oil concessions in the Middle East. Americans believe that the drive being made by the British for the sale of additional oil is being aided by funds made available under the Marshall Plan. They say that, in the first place, the cost of bni'ding refineries in Europe ia being supplied largely from Marshall Plan funds. These refineries are being built to process oil from the Middle East, and with the completion of the nro^ramme in the next two or three years, Britain and the European countries tied to sterling will have a refining capacity capable of meeting not only local needs but a sizable export demand. Another phase of this situation manifests itself in Sweden, according to the New York Times story. In .that country there are three United States companies and two British organizations competing for the oil business. Recently the Swedish Government reduced sharply the amount of dollars available for oil importations, which meant that the United States companies had to curtail their sales. A t the same time, the British companies stepped in and took over the business that the United States companies had to give up. They could do that becau«e the British companies had been relieved of earning dollars as a result of tbe Marshall Plan aid to England. Conditions in many European countries are similar to those in Sweden. Every country there is anxious to conserve dollars as much as possible for the purchase of goods and materials that may be had only through their use. With oil in increasing quantities becomStates oil concerns operating abroad w ill experience steadily increasing competition. "" This competition may be so keen that thc only alternative left for the Americans w ill b* to withdraw from many markets or sell oil.",29,Department Of Shipping And Fuel
97,Mr Mobrioe,Who told the honor,32,Conserving Dollars
98,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"Leade rfor sterling and take the chance of converting it later into dollars,"" says the New York Times. "" While exports of oil from the United States now are confined largely to specialty products, domestic companies are experiencing difficulty in competing with a British firm operating from this country in the foreign markets. "" An example is furnished by Uruguay and also Argentina. B'ecause payment for exports would not be met in dollars, lubricants processed here by a British firm were sold to these countries for'payment in sterling. In turn, the British firm took the sterling and converted into dollars under the Marshall Plan. *' In the trade it is feared that this method of the British firm in disposing of locally processed oil products in the export market may assume rather large proportions. It is understood that a circular letter giving full details of the operation hae gone out to oil distributors throughout Latin America and to other areas and that, as a result, United States firms have lost some of their importaut foreign business in specialty products. "" Despite the fact that Britain has socialized because the communication was likely to many industries, oil executives here declare that foreign business still is being carried on most aggressively in the old capitalistic way and in such a manner that the United States firms are finding it increasingly difficult to compete "". The point I make is that while, according to the Prime Minister's figures, which I consider to be greatly exaggerated, Australia needs only another one-third of a million tons of petrol annually to end rationing, the resources fro m which that comparatively small quantity would be drawn are now to supply 5,700,000 tons a year to Argentina for the next five years. As an Australian, I am impelled to ask, why one-third of a million tons of that 5,700,000 tons cannot be diverted to this country to obviate t.he need for rationing. The treaty that has heen made between the United Kingdom and Argentina for the supply of this huge quantity of petrol is sufficient reason, if no other existed, for tbe Australian people to feel disgusted and discontented with tbe deal tbey are getting. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale), quite rightly, has pointed out that the Government decided some time ago what action it would take in tbe event of the High Court failing to uphold the validity of the petrol rationing regulations. the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has taken the same action as be took after Mr Fadden. the rents and prices referendum. He haa thrown tbe baby into the lap of the States, and has summoned a meeting of State Premiers to discuss the position. Surely, he should have given a lead and appealed to petrol consumers in this count r y not to be stampeded into purchasing petrol in excess of tbeir normal requirements pending consideration of the position. But what has happened? I have before me a telegram that was sent by the New South Wales manager of Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited, Mr. Leask, to distributors of that company's brand of motor spirit throughout tbe State. As honourable members are aware, 51 per cent, of the shares in Commonwealth O i l Eefineries Limited are Commonwealth-owned, and therefore the Commonwealth can control tbe affairs of that organization. The despatch of that telegram reveals an appalling state of affairs, encourage the panic buying and use of petrol after the decision of the H i gh Court had been announced. The telegram, which, I am informed, every C.O.R. agent received on the 10th June last, readsTrust you realize that all possible means ol gaining maximum motor spirit sales result* mu t be pushed to utmost under present unrationed conditions. While good results from some centres', country sales generally disappointing notwithstanding stock difficulties. All depots telegraphed similarly arrange Saturday bulk deliveries if gallonage obtainable. Tax-free road permits available until 26th June. Signed LEASK. Mr Leask, who signed tbose instructions to C.O.R. agents, is no less a person tban the New South Wales manager for Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, a company in whicb the Commonwealth holds 51 per cent, of the shares, 51 per cent, of the interest, and 51 per cent, of tbe control.

A Labour government would never bave entered into sucb an",32,Conserving Dollars
99,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Prim earrangement. The Commonwealth, it is true, holds the majority of the shareholdappoint the manager? ing in Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. The conservative government that drew up the agreement was quite satisfied with the position. Although it held the majority of the shares in the company, it did not enforce its right to have a majority of the directors. Recently, I raised the matter with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which is the real controller of Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited and has the right to appoint the general manager of that company even without reference to the Australian Government. I shall not discuss the details of that agreement, but t have raised tbe matter witb the Australian representative of AngloEranian Oil Company. have carried tbe matter even a little farther than that, and have referred it to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Honourable members generally may not be aware that the United Kingdom Government also has shares in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. PerhapsI should qualify that statement by pointing out that, whilst the United Kingdom Government has certain directors in that company it has no control of the organization. In other words, the United Kingdom Government has not sufficient directors in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to influence the policy of that concern. In turn, tbe Anglo-Iranian Oil Company has the dominating voice in the control of Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. I have not been happy about that matter, and, I say quite frankly, since the leader of the Australian day that they' would not encourage the Country party has raised the subject, that I have suggested that if the activities of Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited are to be expanded, the Commonwealth sbould have more representation in respect of the control of the company. Some time ago, the general manager of Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited reached the retiring age, and the first intimation that the Government received about the appointment of his successor was an announcement that AngloIranian Oil Company had appointed a new general manager. The company had not consulted the Government when making a selection. not! I advise the honourable inember for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) to peruse tbe agreement. I can only describe it as an extraordinary agreement. It was made by a conservative government. Although tbe Commonwealtb holds the majority of the shares, it has absolutely no voice in tbe general management and control of the company. I shall not discuss that aspect, because tbe agreement is a long one. As I have already explained, I have referred the matter to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. I hope that honourable members will understand that I am not complaining about the administrative ability of the present general manager, Indeed, I Mr Lloyd.

[5.37] -Tb e reply that the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has made to the speech by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Eadden) pin-points once again the impossible position in whicb the Commonwealth is placed regarding certain companies in which it owns the majority of the shares, but has a minority of directors. Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited is not the only company in that category. The Prime Minister has stated that Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited was established by a conservative government. I remind the right honourable gentleman that since be has been Prime Minister and Treasurer, Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has been reconstructed. That is another of those company reconstructions which, if the prices realized for the shares on the stock exchange tbe day after reconstruction became public are an indication, is nothing short of a downright scandal.

It is not my responsibility to answer it. sibility of tbe Government. From tbe viewpoint of the petrol-users in this country-and I speak with ^oine feeling on behalf of petrol-users in country districts-that answer has not been given. When we compare the petrol rationing in New Zealand with tbe petrol ration that was available here, we have a bad enough example; but when we go to the European countries, which were under foreign control for a number of years, until they were liberated in 1945, and find that in tbose countries tbere is no petrol rationing and that for three or four years they have been dependent on aid from tbe United States of America for tbeir daily bread almost, we are entitled to ask why petrol rationing is necessary in Australia and New Zealand and wby countries that have been conquered and occupied are able to carry on without petrol rationing. There has been no effective answer to that question, but in country and city alike, industry, business and pleasure and everything else in Australia, are awaiting that answer. I bope that after the conference between the Prime Minister and tbe State Premiers next Friday, from which I do not think the Prime Minister will get much satisfaction, we Bhall be given a clear statement of the actual position by tbe Prime Minister. I agree with the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) that before the Australian people will accept further regulation of petrol supplies tbey will want more information about tbe availability of petrol.

Tbis is not the first occasion on whicb tbe Prime Minister has shown pique.

They are the people who really use petrol in any considerable quantity. Rationing of private users of petrol has not resulted in any real saving. It is likely that the future will soon show that petrol rationing was not a really effective method of saving petrol. Throughout the currency of petrol rationing, there was an extensive black market. I confess that I did not actually come into -contact with it. However, I think its operations were so widespread that petrol consumption will henceforth be very little is excess of what it was wben rationing operated. An important aspect of the matter is that for the first time since governmental control of the use of petro] operated, motorists are able to have placed in the petrol tanks of their cars worthwhile motor spirit witb a high octane rating that ensures better performance",35,Conserving Dollars

116,Mr Hutchinson,"Despit e petrolby motor vebicles and more miles to the gallon. Parenthetically, I point out that the lifting of the hand of bureaucracy -from the oil and petrol industry, with a Tesultant improvement of the industry's products, once more proves the deterioration that sets in when an industry is socialized or quasi-socialized, as the oil and petrol industry was for a long time. The few extra gallons that may be used as the result of the lifting of petrol rationing will not absorb enough dollars to be worth worrying about. references of the Prime Minister to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps, leave me unmoved. We have had as much as we can stand of Cripps, as we have had of Chifley. If there is any one in Australia who can lessen the drain on the Empire dollar pool, it is the primary producer. The Australian Government bas shown an utter lack of wisdom by coming down so heavily on the Australian transport system. The country districts have been heavily penalized, particularly by unnecessarily high transport costs on meat and butter and other primary products that Britain sbould buy from Australia to feed the people of Great Britain, instead of halfstarving them. If the Government wishes to check the drift from the country to the cities and to develop the beef industry in north Australia in order that -Great Britain may be able to save the dollars that it has to pay for beef in Argentina, it clearly must cheapen transport means that it must cheapen motor transport and ensure the availability of fuel. The Government ought to let well alone. The few extra dollars that may be involved in the discontinuance of petrol rationing in Australia will be amply compensated for by an assured transport system, happier people in country districts and increased primary production. Another argument that the Government may use if Cripps remains unconvinced of the wisdom of the lifting of petrol rationing in Australia, is that one of Great Britain's greatest export lines is motor vehicles. If Australian motorists, even private motorists, are allowed insufficient petrol, the Australian market for British motor vehicles must be curtailed. That is something that can Mr .Hutchinson. be well said to Cripps. The Australiaa motorist is as fed up to the teeth with Cripps as he is with Chifley. ing to honourable gentlemen opposite on the subject of petrol rationing, one cannot help being struck by the fact that they bave lost appreciation of the economic plight of the British people. It is difficult to reconcile their views on the genuine effort to assist Great Britain to conserve dollars by means of tbe saving The of petrol with their constant attitude on the public platform that Australia must give greater help to tbe British people. The Prime Minister( Mr Cbifley) clearly stated, in regard to petrol, that the Government did not wish to ration the supply of any commodity to tbe Australian people. Honourable members on this side of the chamber are as mucb aware as are honourable members opposite of tbe possible political repercussions of restrictions upon tbe activities of tbe people, but, unlike honourable gentlemen opposite, when it is necessary, in the interests of the community, to institute a rationing scheme to secure the equitable distribution of a scarce commodity, the Government is not afraid to do so. Like many otber members of the community, I am personally pleased thai petrol can now be obtained, at least temporarily, without coupons, but I am afraid that the abolition of petrol rationing may prove ultimately to be just as detrimental to the welfare of the in Australia, and that Australian people as bas tbe defeat of the rents and prices referendum. Honourable members opposite have spoken of the necessity for primary producers to have more petrol. Now that petrol rationing is not in operation, the position that obtains in relation to tobacco may very soon obtain in regard to petrol also. We can now get our supplies of tobacco only from dealers in the areas in whicb we live, and it may not be very long before the people of New South Wales, foi instance, can obtain petrol only from distributors in the areas in wbich tbey reside. Many country people and primary producers may find that if they go by car from, say, Gundagi to Bungendore they will be unable to go back by car because the petrol distributors in Bungendore will supply only their own customers.",36,Conserving Dollars

It may be that soon petrol will be available to primary producers only if they are prepared to pay inflated prices for it . It has been said that tbere has been no rush on tbe petrol filling stations in the country districts. On the 8th June, the Junee Southern Cross, a well known country newspaper contained a report stating that petrol sales in Junee on the 7th June, immediately following the publication of tbe decision of the High Oourt, had reached an "" all-time h i g h t h a t there had been panic purchasing of petrol, that senseless hoarding was taking place and that orders for 44-gallon drums by the dozen had been whittled down considerably. There has been a great rush on the suburban petrol filling stations. Some people have bought huge quantities of petrol in order to store it and sell it later at black-market prices. Common sense demands that, because of the dollar shortage and the necessity to assist the British people in tbeir economic struggle, we should restrict imports of petrol into Australia. If no more petrol is to be imported than was imported wben rationing was in force, the supplies that will be available will go to tbose people who have the most money. The abolition of petrol rationing will not make larger quantities available. Although the permit system for American cars has been abolished, people cannot obtain American cars, because not enough of tbem are coming into the country. If only a certain quantity of petrol is allowed to be imported and if no rationing scheme is in force, petrol distributors will supply users in the areas to wbich it is easiest for them to send their supplies, and primary producers will not get the petrol that they require because it will be more economical for the distributors to send it elsewhere. AlthoughI share with other members of tbe community a feeling of pleasure at being able to obtain petrol without coupons, I cannot help but think that we approached may ultimately face the chaotic position in regard to petrol that we now face in relation to prices and, to a less degree, It is tobacco. Ex-servieemen who wish to start businesses are unable to obtain quotas of tobacco because the control of distribution has passed out of the hands of the Government. extraordinary propositions have been adv vanced by Government supporters ini attempts to answer the arguments against petrol rationing that have been put forward by the Leader of the Australian, Country party ( Mr Fadden), and otherhonorable members on this side of thechamber. One of tbe most farcical of' those propositions was that honourable members on this side of the chamber, by their criticism of the retention of petrol rationing, have acted in an anti-British manner. I have been a member of the 1 Parliament for many years, and during that time. I have listened to the arguments that have been used by members of the Labour party in opposition to suggestions of greater Empire co-operation. It is ironic that honourable gentlemen opposite should now charge us with being antiBritish. The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has said that the Government desires to retain petrol rationing in order that Great Britain may be able to purchase meat from dollar areas. I remind tbe committee that this Government abolished meat rationing in Australia. Great Britain is desperately in need of meat. If the Government is determined to do all it can to supply greater, quantities of meat to the British people, why has it abolished meat rationing here? What is the Government doing to increase the export to Great Britain of foodstuffs from Australia, for the purchase of which sterling is used? We have pressed the Prime Minister to initiate or encourage the holding of a conference of countries of the British Commonwealth to discuss economic problems, but the right honourable gentleman has said that it will be futile to bold a conference of that kind owing to the diversity of the economio interests of those countries.

If tbe spirit of tbe Ausment on the waterfront, and the Maritralian Government is willing and the Attlee Government desires to co-operate, Australia and otber British Commonwealtb countries could do a great deal to ease the economic difficulties from wbich Great Britain is now suffering. Honourable members on this side of the chamber are not convinced that petrol cannot be made available to us in the quantities that we require to abolish petrol rationing here, because the figures that have been given by tbe Prime Minister reveal that approximately twenty times as much petrol as would be necessary to enable rationing to be ended in Australia is now being made available to tbe Argentine. It is highly debatable whether there will be a greater consumption of petrol by individual consumers in Australia now that rationing is inoperative. It may be, as the honourable member for Perth( Mr have come to regard them as being almost Burke), bas said, that because more cars are coming into the country there will necessarily be a greater over-all use of petrol, but I have not heard it suggested by the Government that if the rationing system had been maintained the ration of the ordinary consumer would bave been reduced. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. the committee is now considering is that of the Department of Shipping and Euel. This is one of those war-time departments which had a mushroom growth, and, for reasons best known to the Government, has found a continuing existence in the period of peace. It provides for us Melbourne and Sydney was 27s. a ton. one of the most interesting illustrations of socialist enterprise under government control that we can discover in our Commonwealtb administration, and. I say at once that it is a shocking advertisement for socialism. Not only have we this considerable government department, but also we have at least four additional instrumentalities that deal with different matters relating to shipping and waterfront activities. There are the Australian Shipping Board, which supervises shipping operations generally, the Australian Shipbuilding Board, wbicb supervises tbe construction of vessels, tbe Stevedoring Industry Commission, wbicb was intended to regulate employtime Industry Commission, which regulates conditions of employment amongst seamen. As the result of painful experience over many years, wben a government maintains socialist control of any phase of industry, we could expect that these would be coetlj controls from the point of view of the taxpayers. This has proved to be tbe case. Eor example, tbe Australian Shipping Board incurred an accumulated loss of £11,000,000 in the three years that ended in 1948. We are given to understand by to-day's press that the preliminary estimate of the loss that will be incurred by the board in the current year is about £8,000,000, whicb will make a grand total loss of just under £20,000,000 for the last four years. We expect that losses will be incurred. We inevitable, particularly since the Commonwealtb monopoly of post and telegraph services has at last disclosed a loss which must be met by means of increased charges. However, governments occasionally justify these burdens that they place upon the taxpayers by saying thai the enterprises confer upon the community benefits that more than counterbalance tbe costs. Therefore, I ask, in the first place, whether this control of shipping by the Government bas given us a better or a cheaper shipping service. Once again, tbe facts do not provide a very good advertisement for socialist enterprise. In 1939, the freight rate for general cargo between The current rate is 82s. a ton, or more than three times the rate of 1939. What is true of tbe rate between Melbourne and Sydney is true also, to a lesser or greater degree, of freight charges on other routes. So this form of control . has not given us a cheaper service. I do not think that anybody will claim that we have a better shipping service to-day despite the fact that the tonnage operating in Australian waters is about 40 per cent, greater than in 1939. In the second place, I ask whether",38,Conserving Dollars

The total last year was 3,131,000 tons, compared with 3,657,000 tons in 1939. That decrease has occurred despite the fact that we bave 40 per cent, more tonnage available now than we bad then. Thus, it would scarcely appear that trade has been promoted. In fact, tbe increased freight costs bave discouraged many manufacturers from shipping their goods from one State to another. In tbe third place, [ ask whether this control bas assured industrial peace and regulated satisfactorily the conditions of employment in tbe industry. he claimed for Commonwealth control of shipping and our maritime services generally, it certainly cannot be claimed in honesty that it has given us industrial peace. We bave had a continuous experience of disturbance and turbulence on the waterfront which has goaded even this lethargic Government to a point at wbicb it has decided to abolish the Stevedoring Industry Commission that it appointed to deal with problems of employment on tbe waterfront. From tbe outset, the commission has been affected notoriously by the Communist-controlled Waterside Workers Federation, and even the Government at last has become so dissatisfied witb that state of affairs that it bas Defence and Minister for Post-war discharged Mr Healy and Mr Eoach from the commission and has decided to abolish it. But despite the dissatisfaction caused by tbose Communist union executives, the Government has allowed tbe Waterside Workers Federation to exercise a monopoly of employment on the waterfront. Thus, we have a curious state of affaire in which a government, which claims that it is opposed to monopolies and gives to citizens the opportunity to seek whatever employment they desire, restricts opportunities for employment on the waterfront to those who are prepared to join the HereI turn Waterside Workers Federation and gives Far a monopoly of engagements to that union. That bas not justified tbe heavy costs that have been incurred. In the result, we bave paid dearly for this socialistic enterprise, not merely in terms of money, but also in terms of continuity of employment on tbe waterfront. The experiment of government control, government ownership and government direction bas been tried to the full in this highly important industry. The experiment has been costly, it has resulted in an impaired service, it has caused less trade instead of more trade, and it has caused industrial chaos rather than industrial peace. It is remarkable that although honourable members on both side9 of the chamber bave discussed this subject to-day, we have not yet heard one word in reply from any Minister. We have not been told whether the Government has any alternative proWhatever else may posals to make or whether it contemplates taking any remedial measures to deal with a situation that is undeniably unsatisfactory. I hope that, before the committee disposes of this proposed vote, the Minister for Post-war Beconstruction ( Mr Dedman), who represents the Minister for Shipping and Fuel in this chamber, will recognize the disgraceful and disastrous condition of affairs which has developed from Commonwealth control of the shipping industry and will indicate whether 1 the Government has in view any programme that will place a better ano cheaper shipping service at the command' of the Australian public.

It will be seen, therefore, that the items of dollar expenditure that I have cited are very important to the economy of this country. I desire now to state the position as it was in the year 1947-48. In that year, our total exports to the dollar area were worth £40,700,000. During the same year we imported from the United States of America goods to the value of £83,400,000, thus sho.wing a deficit of roughly £40,000,000. That figure must be adjusted in relation to the value of what are known as "" invisible exports "". For example, we had to pay in that year the sum of £3,000,000 as interest on our debt in New York. Freight on imports amounted to £13,600,000; insurance to £1,000,000; and packages to £1,800,000. Expenditure by Australian tourists totalled £1,000,000, against wbich there was a set-off of expenditure by overseas tourists in Australia of £300,000. Other invisible exports included film remittances £1,400,000 and profit and dividend remittances to companies whose headquarters are in the United States of America, £2,400,000. obtain these figures? tracted from government documents, and if the honourable member questions any of them. I am willing to make available to him the sources from which I obtained them. I have given these figures merely to show how much this country's economy is in deficit as far as dollars are concerned. During the year 1948, there was a large actual expenditure, as distinct from an estimated expenditure, on the dollar component of petrol and oil imported from outside the dollar area. It has been said time and time again in this chamber that petrol from outside the dollar area involves the expenditure of dollars because, in some instances, it reaches Australia in American tankers. In many other instances the companies ( Mr Chifley) said that there would be a which sell such petrol in Iran, Iraq and 20 per cent, increase. otber eastern countries pay their staffs in dollars, and naturally want to be a Commonwealth authority, I think, themselves paid in dollars, even though the Commonwealtb Statistician, wbo has The success of that prothe petrol was produced outside the dollar area. dollar component of such petrol ? much in dollars petrol cost Australia in the year 1947-48. In that year the dollar component of petrol from outside the dollar area, which entered Australia, was £3,900,000, or nearly 12,000,000 dollars. The amount of petrol brought into Australia every year costs Australia about £30,000,000. tralian currency? mately tbe cost of the petrol coming into Australia in a year. Last year one-sixth of that petrol came from tbe dollar area, at a cost to us of about £5,000,000 Australian. In addition, one-sixth of the petrol whicb does not come from the dollar area has a dollar content. Honourable members can see, therefore, that the amount we need to provide in dollars to obtain sufficient petrol for Australia, even under a rationing system, is considerable. not we have rationing. country cannot afford to buy petrol in excess of tbe quantity we bave been consuming in recent years. Several honourable members opposite have said that there would be very little increase of the consumption of petrol if rationing were not imposed by the States. Of course tbe Commonwealtb now has no authority to ration petrol. It is interesting to note such estimates by people connected with the petroleum industry generally. I do not refer to the governmentofficials. They consider that the abolition of petrol rationing will, in all probability, cause an increased consumption of between 10 per cent, and 12 per cent.

If Australia bad more dollars to spend it would be better to spend them on more tractors for primary producers and on machinery of a specialized kind for new industries which would enable us to save large dollar expenditure in the future. co pay a bit more it would be worthwhile importing machinery so that we could put an end to tbe power black-outs in New South Wales. che black-outs in New South Wales is to produce more coal. The shortage of coal is not due to the fact that the miners are not producing as mucb coal as formerly. In large measure, it is due to the tact that people 'to-day are in possession -)£ electrical appliances which create a tar greater demand for electric power than ever existed before, which, in turn, requires more coal than ever before. Tbe consumption of electricity has increased by 75 per cent, since before the war. Unfortunately, we bave not the coal co enable us to produce enough electric power to prevent black-outs. I agree that if we had more dollars it would be better f.o spend them on machinery for producing coal rather than on petrol. We aro doing the best we can do. A sub-committee of Cabinet is watching the situation all the time. We have fixed a ceiling for dollar expenditure, taking into account the fact that if we were to go above the ceiling figure we sbould really be stealing dollars from tbe United Kingdom. to Argentina. be stealing dollars from tbe more needy people of the United Kingdom. Therefore, the Government does not intend to follow a course of action that would result in our dollar expenditure going above the ceiling figure. If more dollars were spent on petrol, then inevitably fewer dollars would be available for expenditure on other and more important commodities. think the kindest thing would be to allow the Minister for Post-war Eeconstruction ( Mr Dedman) to wallow in the bog he has created. I did not hear a word from him to-night that answered in any way tbe criticism advanced from this side of tbe committee, particularly hy the Leader of tbe Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden), regarding sterling petrol and dollar petrol. Tbis afternoon, I initiated a discussion on petrol by offering tbe opinion that, after the High Court had declared petrol rationing to be invalid, it was tbe duty of the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), if he were a statesman and not a party politician, to give the people of Australia a lead on the use of petrol. I said then, and I repeat, that he must have known perfectly well what the verdict of the High Court was likely to be. Any one who followed tbe arguments before the court, and the Prime Minister must have been kept informed of tbem. could not fail to be impressed by the argument of the appellants. The Prime Minister must bave been aware of the arguments that were advanced day by day. Some weeks elapsed between the end of the hearing and the giving of judgment by the court. Therefore, the Prime Minister bad plenty of time in wbich to formulate a policy and prepare a statement offering 8 lead to the people on how tbey should act. It was his duty, wben the verdict of the court was given, to say to tbe people: "" The High Court has decided this matter. It has returned to you the freedom you enjoyed as citizens before petrol rationing was imposed. The court has defined tbe law, and the Government will abide by the law. We shall suggest to you and to the trade how normal distribution can be made to work"". However, the Prime Minister only mumbled something about chaos, and said that he would call a conference of State Premiers with the idea of persuading them to reimpose rationing on a State basis. Of course, the Premiers will not touch it with a 40-ft. pole. Thati i obvious. Froan the indifferent way in whicb the Prime Minister approached this matter it would almost seem as if he wanted chaos to ensue. His behaviour has not been that of the bome-spun Lincoln, which i9 the character that bis supporters are trying to establish for him.

151,Mr Beale (Parramatta) [8.33],"Ithe desirability of continuing petrol rationing. tbe Leader of the Australian Country party made tbe point that, far from the Prime Minister and the Government doing anything to bring about an easy transition from government control to private distribution of petrol, something has been done by a government instrumentality which was precisely calculated to produce chaos. He read a telegram sent by Mr Leask, New South Wales manager of Commi on wealth Oil Refineries Limited, a government corporation in whicb the Government owns 51 per cent, of the shares. The telegram, which I shall read again, was sent to all agents of Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, and is in these extraordinary termsTrust you realize that all 'possible means of gaining maximum motor spirit sales results must be pushed to utmost under present unrationed conditions. While good results from some centres, country sales generally dis. anpointing notwithstanding stock difficulties. All depots telegraphed similarly arrange Saturday bulk deliveries if gallonage obtainable. Tax-free road permits available until 2Gth June. If anything was calculated to encourage undue consumption of petrol and to influence the public to consume petrol after the fashion of a drunken sailor spending his money, it was that telegram. Mention of the telegram, which was signed by Mr Leask, brought the Prime Minister to bis feet, and he tried to make some kind of excuse for tbe despatch of the telegram, although he did not deny its authenticity. However, he attempted to defend the Government's action by stating that, although the Australian Government owns 250,001 of the total share capital of £500,000, it was restricted, because of an agreement made some years ago with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited, which is now the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company from doing anything more than appointing three of the seven directors of the company. He said in effect, ""We have only three out of seven directors, and therefore the action taken by the company is not our responsibility"". Prime Minister was sincere and if his argument meant anything at all, it meant that the Australian Government had no power or influence to prevent Mr Directors: Mr IJealc. Leask from sending out sucb a telegram In support of my views, or to restrain any of the company's agents from acting in tbe manner suggested in the telegram. It is necessary, therefore, to examine the statute under whicb the Commonwealtb Oil Refineries Limited was establisbed. The Oil Agreement Act 1920 bad appended to it an agreement under which the Commonwealth Oil Refineries corporation was establisbed, and that document included a provision that tbe Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited, wbich has now become the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited, was to supply all the petrol for Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. I shall not burden the committee by referring to the subsequent acts of 1924 and 1926, and I shall cite only those sections of tbe act of 1920 that are obviously relevant to the Prime Minister's assertion that the Government is not responsible for the acts of the directors of the company, annexed to the Oil Agreement Act 1920 as a schedule is the agreement made by the Australian Government with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited, which provides that the Australian Government sball bave a controlling interest in the share capital of Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. Tbe Commonwealth owns 250,001 of the total shares, which number 500,000. It does not need a lawyer to point out that that provision clearly gives to tbe Commonwealtb, and therefore to tbe Prime Minister, some power to control the policy of the company. Furthermore, Article3 (ti!) of the agreement providesThe Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Refinery Company and any alteration thereof shall be subject to the approval of the Commonwealth and shall provide (inter alia) :(iv) that no action or question or decision relating to or affectingLimited, (b) any proposed sale of refined products on long contracts or under circumstances which might .endanger the ability of the Refinery Company to meet requirements for consumption within Australia; If the shall be taken determined or made without the consent of the Commonwealth as expressed through its representatives on the Board of L should have thought that the wordsany proposed sale . . . under circumstances which might endanger the ability of the refinery company to meet requirements for consumption within Australia; would have amply justified the intervention of the Australian Government in this instance. However, if it be asserted, the action, and even more so immediately by a lawyer's quibble, that those words are of doubtful meaning, I invite the attention of tbe committee to certain other matters which cannot be disputed. In the first place, if the Government's view of the correct legal construction that sbould be placed on those words was challenged, tbe matter could have been arbitrated in the usual way. It is clear, therefore, that the Commonwealth could bave contested any action which it was thought was wrongfully taken by the other directors. Furthermore, Article 16 of the agreement gave tbe Australian Government power to acquire the company outright if it did not agree with tbe policy of its directorate as constituted at any time, and the Government bas enjoyed that power since 1935. Labour has been in office since 1941, and it could bave exercised power to acquire outright the business of the company, upon giving two years' notice to the company of its intention to do so, and it could issued an advance direction to the Gothen have operated the business as a national concern. That is obviously a complete answer to the Prime Minister's assertion that the Government did not like tbe idea of possessing only three seats on a directorate of seven, although it owned the majority of the shares. If either the Government or the Prime Minister did not approve of the directors or of their policy or administration, why did not the Prime Minister exercise the Government's undoubted power to take over the company? He did not do so for the obvious reason that the company was functioning admirably and the Government had no desire to interfere with its operations. When he was challenged concerning the company's operations, the right honourable gentleman sought to shelter behind certain alleged technicalities in order to evade responsibility for the despatch of the telegram which the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) so rightly brought to the notice of the Parliament in such a powerful fashion. . It is also obvious that during tbe interval wbicb elapsed between the bearing of the action on the legality of petrol rationing and the delivery of judgment, when the Prime Minister must have had some inkling of the possible outcome of after delivery of judgment, the right honourable gentleman should have acted. In deed, had he done his job as the prime minister of a national government and as a statesman and a real leader, he would have intervened in the matter as early as possible. He could bave said to the Government's three nominees on the board of directors of Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited: "" I want you to ensure that supplies are distributed only in a normal fashion; that nothing is done to boost sales; that no action is taken that might cause panicbuying ; and that petrol is not thrust upon people who do not actually need it. You must assist the community by encouraging people to continue to conserve petrol, and to discourage abnormal consumption "". I reiterate that the Prime Minister could reasonably bave been expected to foresee the consequences of an adverse judgment of the High Court. He could easily bave vernment nominees on the directorate of Commonwealtb Oil Eefineries Limited before judgment was delivered by the High Court. Suppose, for a moment, that the other four directors of the concern proved recalcitrant. It was within the power of the Prime Minister to direct his nominees to summon an emergency meeting of shareholders of the company and he could have compelled the acquiescence of tbe directors in any one of a dozen ways. No attempt whatever was made to do so. To summarize what I have said, all the Prime Minister bad to do was to caution the directors of tbe Government's own company to ensure that moderation was exercised when the rationing of petrol was discontinued. The Prime Minister did not do so, and his attempt to shelter behind the oil agreement made by tbe Government with tbe Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited is a piece of hairsplitting humbug which will deceive no one. The plain fact is that at a time wben leadership required that he should anticipate the consequences of the restoration by the High Court to the community of its freedom in this matter, and at a time wben every obligation devolved upon bim to exercise his power to encourage moderation in tbe consumption of petrol, be lid nothing but mumble about chaos and summon a conference of State premiers. As1 bave already pointed out, one needs only to peruse the terms of the oil agreehe has termed lack of leadership. Thc ment to realize that the Prime Minister atands condemned. Of course, tbe provision of the agreement to which tbe right Prime Minister's conference with ths honourable gentleman referred bad really nothing to do with this attitude and was only put forward belatedly as an excuse for bis inaction. All that was required of sent the telegram, is the head of the him, as leader of the Government, was s few words of caution; be did not utter those words. -The honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) has just made one of the most despicable statements I have beard from him. To tell the committee and the people of Australia wbo may be listening to the broadcast of these proceedings, that the issue. the Prime Minister( Mr Cbifley) did ao thing at all but. summon a conference of State premiers, and not to make the slightest reference to the statement made by the Prime Minister this afterooon, is absolutely contemptible. The Prime Minister's statement was made in response to tbe allegations of tbe Leader of the Australian Country parly ( Mr Fadden) concerning a telegram despatched by Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. The Leader of the Australian Country party mentioned the date of the telegram, which was last Friday, the 10th June, and I notice that he now nods his head, apparently in assent. In the course of tbe statement that Government should say to the direche made this afternoon, the Prime Minister stated quite definitely that on Thursfineries Limited: "" Do not accelerate day last, the 9th June, he conferred with all the controllers of the petrol companies anything about this matter. in Australia, and that they assured bim that no increased sales of petrol would be made. day, the Commonwealtb Oil Henneries Limited, which is largelythe Government's own orgaEii^a&LesJ smut out the telegram. the point made by tbe honourable member for Parramatta by referring to the cleai and unequivocal statement of the Prime Miuister that on Thursday last he conferred with representatives of tbe oil companies, who agreed not to accelerate tbe bale of petrol. In spite of that tht honourable member for Parramatta hat condemned the Prime Minister for what telegram to which reference has been made was sent on the day following the representatives of the oil companies. The right honourable gentleman has made it clear this afternoon that Mr Leask, whe company's organization in New Soutb Wales and not the managing director of the company. The managing directoi of Commonwealtb Oil Eefineries Limited and not the Government should take action against Mr Leask. I observe that the Leader of the Australian Country party agrees with me. The honourable member for Parramatta has merely attempted to side-track His statement that the telegram was sent out by Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited, in which the Commonwealtb owns the majority of the shares, is "" playing it pretty low down"". I have yet to learn that the three government nominees on the directorate of the company could out-vote the other four directors. Eveni f they were able to do so, how could their action aflect the other oil companies? Honourable members opposite are continually attacking government instrumentalities for competing with private enterprise. The honourable member for Parramatta, who is a great protagonist of tbe rights of private enterprise, contends that the tors of the Commonwealth Oil Reyour sales of petrol.

They are well aware that tbe only action tbe Prime Minister could have taken was to approach tbe State Premiers and request tbem to continue some form of rationing. The right honourable gentleman has already done that. Honourable members opposite have spoken about the chaotic conditions that may result from the abolition of petrol rationing. Tbe honourable member for Parramatta spoke about the Prime Minister leading the Premiers on, but, he said, thcy would not touch petrol rationing with a. 40-ft. pole. Evidently the honourable member is anxious that the Premiers shouh' do nothing about it. I :hhik that I can see as far into tbe future as can the average honourable member. Eonorable members opposite are making a political issue of this matter with an eye on the coming general election. They are determined to make it a political issue simply because they bave no policy to place before the people. Because they have no worthwhile policy to put before the people they endeavour on every possible occasion to throw suspicion on the Government. In respect of every proposal put before tbem they endeavour ro convince the people that there is a nigger in the woodpile and that the Government is seeking to put something over tbem. Tbey are employing those tactics again to-night. I was amazed to hear tbe honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) repeat to-night a statement which he made this afternoon about tbe waterside workers. He also repeated figures which he had cited this afternoon about the tonnage arriving in the port of Melbourne. answered tbose statements. oers opposite are merely endeavouring to srain a petty party political advantage. Obviously tbe honourable member for Fawkner regards such statements as good political propaganda. He contended that the Australian Shipping Board had been operated at a loss. We aro well aware that the private shipping companies were able to make large pronts solely because of the subsidies tliey received from the Government. He also said that tbey cannot now continue to function unless freight rates are further increased by 15s. a ton, and that tliey oannot raise the freight rates unless the rates on ships operated by the Government are raised likewise. Such statements are made purely in an attempt to convince the people that the Government should not compete with private enterprise. The honourable member even had the audacity to say that the Australian Shipping Board bad lost £7,000,000 in three years. £8,000,000 this year. gentleman said that the loss this year will amount to £8,000,000. He knows quite well that but for the subsidies paid to the private shipping companies, which enabled tbem to make large profits, the losses on the government's operations would have been negligible. He said that the Government took money from the pockets of taxpayers to finance these losses. I remind him that many millions of pounds were taken from the pockets of the taxpayers to subsidize the private shipping companies. Honourable members opposite do not complain about subsidies if the money is paid to persons or companies in wbom they are interested. If , however, a government-operated instrumentality which competes with subsidized private enterprise makes a loss, (he loss is invariably blamed on this so called incompetent Government. I return now to tbe subject of petro) and oil. The honourable member for Parramatta may read ' as much ae has not he likes from the oil agreement. In my opinion the statements made by the Prime Minister count for much more than anything whicli the honourable member for Parramatta may read from a book.

I suggest that he should read the oil agreement. If he does so, be will understand tbe opinions and particularly Sir that bave been expressed by the Opposition. Let me recapitulate what has happened.

The the Prime Minister into the debate because Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited is a government-controlled organization. The Prime Minister's statement that, subsequently, be called a conference of representatives of the oil companies and got tbem to agree to a certain line of action does not absolve Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited of its responsibility to the Government, and through the Government to the country. Let us examine the allegedly despicable statement which the honourable member for Hindmarsh says was made by the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale). The honourable member for Parramatta read portions of the oil agreement and drew certain conclusions from them. All the noise that has been made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh cannot detract from the logic of those conclusions.

163,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [9.5],"the agreement. It provides in Article3 (d) ( i v ) That no action or question or decision relating to or affecting(5) Any proposed sale of refined products j j ability of the refinery company to meet requirements for consumption within Australia; shall be taken, determined or made without the consent of the Commonwealth as expressed through its representatives on the Board of Directors. That means clearly that certain action cannot be taken witbout the consent of the Commonwealth. Would tbe Prime Minister and tbe honourable member for Hindmarsh bave us believe that the Government would not be aware of decisions made by the board of directors about the distribution of petrol ? Are we to believe that the government-appointed directors were so recreant to their duty that they did not advise the Prime Minister of the company's intention to boost sales of petrol throughout New South Wales as soon as rationing was lifted? authorize the sending of that telegram? down the policy of the company. If the Prime Minister was not informed of the company's proposed sales campaign, the Government's representatives on tbe board of directors were recreant to their duty, and should be called upon by the Prime Minister to explain their position. I maintain that the only conclusions that the honourable member for Parramatta could draw from tbe remarks made by the Prime Minister were that the right honourable gentleman was quibbling, that he must have been aware through the government-appointed directors that certain action was contemplated, and misled the country when he said that, as the Government could appoint only three directors out of seven, it could not be claimed that Commonwealtb Oil Refineries Limited was government controlled. The Prime Minister must be aware that a clause of that nature is contained in the agreement, and that three directors appointed by this Government to watch the Commonwealth's interests must report to him any departure from policy, particularly such a departure as is likely to affect the distribution of petrol throughout the Commonwealtb. However, we recognize the technique. on long contracts or under circumWhen the High Court declared invalid stances which might endanger the the Government's original banking legislation, the Prime Minister immediately took action to nationalize banking. When the rents and prices referendum was defeated, the right honourable gentleman withdrew the subsidies. When petrol rationing was declared invalid by the High Court, the Prime Minister blinked at the government-controlled company, Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, forcing up the sale of petrol in order to create the very chaos which, he said, would result from the abolition of petrol rationing. So, we see the technique, and I recapitulate. When tbe High Court declared the Government's banking legislation invalid, the Prime Minister, out of sheer pique, attempted to nationalize the trading banks. When the Government lost the rents and prices referendum, the right honourable gentleman, again out of sheer pique, withdrew the subsidies. Now that the High Court has declared petrol rationing invalid, he has connived, or winked, at the government-controlled organization endeavouring to boost sales of petrol so that subsequently he can say, "" Aha, what did 1 tell you? Supplies of petrol are short. I told you what would happen if the Commonwealtli lost the right to control petrol rationing"". All the time, the Prime Minister knew that the government organization, Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, was endeavouring to bring about the conditions for which he has blamed the judgment of tbe High Court. Knowing the technique of this that he deliberately Government, honourable members must admit that I have arrived at the logical conclusion. The precedent has been established in regard to banking and the control of rents and prices, and the Prime Minister has followed that precedent slavishly in respect of petrol rationing.

169,Mr Williams,"As I have oftentdo,ounders overnment of this country, as the of the Constitution meant it to and the High Court now has upon its own head the responsibility in regard to the abolition of petrol rationing. The Ohifley Government, in continuing to ration petrol supplies, was actuated by pw tri otic motives, and a desire to help the accept its responsibility in the matter. people of Great Britain. For some time, I held the view that there was sufficient petrol in the country to justify the abolition of rationing. One garage proprietor has informed me that, since the disappearance of rationing, he has not experienced a great rush by motorists for extra petrol. He ai*' -tated that before the end of last mouiii, his customers asked him to hold 500 gallons of petrol for them for this month and banded him the unused petrol tickets. 1 know that the black market must have absorbed many millions of. gallons of petrol. I have never met any prominent man in the community who wanted to drive his motor car to Melbourne, Adelaide or Brisbane bnt was not able quickly to get hold of sufficient petrol tickets to enable him to go. Petrol rationing can be abolished as the control of the prices of second-hand cars was abolished. It was a law that bad no effect because the people despised it and would not take any notice of it. That applies equally to the control of property values in New South Wales. Realization of that fact will be forced on the people in charge. The law is useless, because 99 per cent, of the vendors and purchasers are disobeying it. The High Court made its decision on the ground that, although the Australian Government had power in war-time, for defence purposes, to control the sale and distribution of petrol and, although it had the power to wind np the war effort and then to unwind it the time must come when the unwinding process must cease. The Chief Justice said long ago, "" You do not cut off the war power with a guillotine; it must end gradually"". It was argued that as the war had ended in 1945, petrol rationing, in the view of the Hight Court was no longer required and we were back again in the halcyon days of peace and, therefore, the Australian Government no longer had authority, under its defence power, to ration petrol. I daresay that we can bave some doubt about the validity of butter and tea rationing. If butter rationing goes, can the Government bf blamed if the people of Great Britain get less butter? That will be the responsibility of tbe High Courti f it terminates such rationing, and the High Court must I do not tbink that the High Court's decision on petrol has any political significance whatever. We continued petrol rationing for patriotic reasons. The High Court has decided against us and petrol rationing falls to the ground. I am not displeased. On the public platform before the 1943 general election, 1 said to the people that when the war was over, all the war-time regulations must end. I thought the best policy for the governments of Australia to apply was to end the war-time regulations as soon as they could do so. Of course, the Australian Government found itself in the matter of petrol rationing on the horns of a dilemma. Had it ceased petrol rationing and done what it had promised the people it would do, it would have put tbe British people in the position of having to spend dollars to give us the extra petrol that we wanted. If tbe decision of the High Court results in more petrol being brought into Australia, tbe Government cannot be blamed. However, I am not sure that more petrol will have to be brought into Australia. We shall have to wait for a few weeks to see what tbe position is before we sball know whether any more petrol will need to be imported. On the public holiday in Sydney yesterday, 1 bought petrol at a garage that usually has a big sale of petrol. The proprietor informed me that it had been a very dull week-end and that, far from having sold more petrol, he had not sold' as much as he had sold on the occasion of a previous public holiday. I cannot understand it. Perhaps people bave petrol hoarded in 44-gallon drum9. They may have been using that petrol. tbe roads in Sydney. traffic on the roads.

A great deal has been said by the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Parramatta about the Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited and the telegrams that were sent on tbe 10th June to its petrol distributors. It has been said that tbe company was encouraging people to use more petrol. Those telegrams were confidential messages to the distributors. They were not intended to be published. I would remind the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Parramatta that tbe evening newspapers in all capital cities of Australia on the day or the day after the High Court announced its decision carried half-page advertisements on behalf of tbe petrol companies. I directed attention to that at the time, and said that tbe or two from the oil agreement, but I ask petrol companies were losing no time in advertising their products., Commonwealtb Oil Eefineries Limited is a business organization.

178,"Mr Ttirnbull (Wimmera) [9.30],","with that proposition. Later, the High Court ruled that petrol rationing by the Australian Government was invalid. It may be that, without rationing, no more petrol will be consumed in Australia than was consumed under rationing; but, on the other hand, consumption may increase, if the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) is right, by 10 or 20 per cent. If more petrol is used and imports remain at their present level, some Australian people will have to go without petrol. What does the Prime Minister intend to do? Does he intend to adhere to what he said when tbe Leader of the Australian Country party argued that petrol rationing could be abolisbed and keep petrol imports at tbeir present level? Does he intend to thus allow a chaotic position to occur if consumption increases, or does be intend to permit greater quantities of petrol to be imported ? The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction gave some figures to the committee in an endeavour to show the drain upon our dollar resources that is caused by the importation of essential articles from the United States of America. He said that in 194T-4S importsof machinery including motor chassis cost £5,000,000. tractors £3.000,000 and spare parts £5,000,000. While tbe honourable gentleman was speaking, I asked, by way of intenection, "" What amount in dollars, did the Convair aircraft cost ? "", and he replied that he did not want to deal with that subject then; but he was, in fact, dealing with it at that very moment. The cost of the Convair aircraft had been camouflaged by their inclusion in tbe figures relating to machinery. When the honourable gentleman dealt with tractors, which are just as much machines as aeroplanes, he referred to them by their correct name. He has said that he would rather we imported tractors than the :goods that honourable members on this side of tbe chamber are always wanting to be brought into this country from America. What are the goods that we require? They are farm tractors. When the Government announced its intention of importing aircraft into Australia, I immediately objected and pointed out that in the wheat-growing .areas in my electorate and throughout tbe Commonwealtb more and more tractors were required. The Government has argued that if we import an extra few million pounds' worth of petrol into this country we shall be robbing Great Britain. Can the Government calculate the value of the assistance of which it has deprived the British people by not importing ""sufficient numbers of tractors? If primary producers had tbe tractors that they required, the production of primary products would be greater than it is. If more petrol were brought into this country and properly used, Great Britain would be helped and not hindered by the consequent increase of the production of foodstuffs. It has been pointed out that Great Britain wants meat from the Argentine. Australia could supply all kinds of things if the Government would assist our primary producers to achieve greater production. We want tractors and not aircraft.

SurelyI can do that in a great free country such as this. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has spoken of the propaganda in which he suesests that honourable members on this side of the chamber are indulging and has said, that that is the stuff that we want to give to the people. Petrol is the stuff that we want to give to the people. If more petrol were made available in Australia production would be increased, and we could then help Great Britain more effectively than we are doing now. I have revealed to tbe committee the way in which the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction concealed the figures in relation to aircraft imports by describing aircraft as machinery. Why did not the honourable gentleman come out into the open and admit that the aircraft which have been brought into this country will not produce a pound of wool or a bushel of wheat? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The honourable gentleman must connect",53,Conserving Dollars
179,Mr Turnbull,"I am answeringhis remarks with the department that is nnder discussion. Post-war Eeconstruction has said that we are getting all the petrol that we can get from non-dollar sources. On what ground does he base that statement ? The Leader of the Australian Country party has produced evidence that more petrol can be obtained from non-dollar sources than is now being obtained from tbem. We know that New Zealand bas a better petrol quota per capita tban Australia has. [ do not wonder that Great Britain is not getting all the foodstuffs that we '-""iild send tbere and that the Australian people are dissatisfied with the adminisrrn i ion of this Government. >visli to refer briefly to a matter r,hat seems to be agitating honourable gentlemen opposite. I believe that all che discussion on the subject of petrol which has occurred this afternoon and this evening is really futile. The recent decision of tbe High Court is that the Australian Government no longer has power to ration petrol in Australia. The effect of the decision was not, as honourable gentlemen opposite are attempting to suggest, that petrol rationing is not necessary. Is petrol rationing necessary? The Prime Minister bas said that be believes that it is necessary in order to ensure the safety of our economy and that ->f Great Britain, which are linked together. of tbe High Court was given, the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) and his satellites were going up and down the jountry stating that petrol rationing in Australia was no longer necessary. As a matter of fact, the right honourable gentleman hailed the High Court's decision as a vindication of his point of view. He regarded it as a great compliment to himself. I do not think that his concern is for the eoonomy of this country or that of Great Britain. He seems more concerned with the profits of rhe great oil companies of this country. I make that charge. I wonder what he is getting for it. The right honourable gentleman is supposed to be the leader of the primary producers of this country. He must know full well what effect the abolition of petrol rationing will have upon Australia and Great Britain. I consider this question from tbe point of view of tbe farmer. If Great Britain goesdown, so shall we, because Great Britain provides us with our greatest market. It is facing one of the greatest financial problems with which it has everbeen confronted. It is in debt all over the world, but honourable gentlemen opposite apparently desire to plunge it further into debt. Why are they so irresponsible?' They are self-confessed hypocrites. For a long time the members of the Opposition have been talking of the necessity for us to help Great Britain, and have accused the Government of not sending sufficient quantities of foodstuffs there. They say that they want the farmers to have the"" right to fill up the petrol tanksof their motor cars at any time they wish to do so. There are 1,500,000 people in Sydney and 1,250,000 people in Melbourne. The motorists among them will fill their tanks first. By the time they have bought all tbey want there will be little left for people in such country areasas those in whicb the honourable member for Wimmera and I live. The responsibility for petrol rationing is now right in tbe laps of the State Premiers. Will they face up to that responsibility? No. Most likely they will say, "" Here is an open go. First come, first served "". Tbe honourable member for Wimmera says that we should produce more food. Tbe GoLong before the decision vernment has kept that object in view throughout the period of petrol rationing. Never has the primary producer had to go witbout sufficient petrol to enable him to sow his crop, reap his harvest, or increase his area under crop whenever he sought to do so. Not once has an application for extra fuel for food production been refused. Many a time has the Government had to reduce tbe private allowance to individuals so that primary producer* and other essential users of liquid fuel could have adequate supplies.

Tbey seek to mislead the public for selfish political purposes. They have hailed tbe High Court's decision as a victory for themselves, claiming that the Government inflicted hardship upon the people by continuing to ration petrol. the Government bas been safeguarding tbe people and looking to tbeir future welfare. I remind the honourable member for Wimmera, who talks about food production, that we must pay for our petrol with dollars or gold. The United Kingdom Government has cut to the bone the ration for the British people. Private motor cars are almost immobilized there. Yet tbe bonorable member wants as, who have had plenty throughout Britain's lean years, to throw a further strain upon that country's resources. No man who bad a legitimate claim was refused a ration of petrol for essential food production under this Government's scheme. [ have not for years heard a genuine complaint about unfairness. The only complaint that I have received recently came from a person who objected to heing asked to fill in a form wben he applied to the Liquid Fuel Board for an additional allowance of more than 100 gallons of petrol a month. The decision of the High Court has not deprived the Commonwealth of its power to restrict imports. Therefore, our imports will not be increased. The honourable member for Wimmera knows that as well as I do. Who will get tbe lion's share if tbere is no system of rationing? This Government will have no power to ensure that primary producers and other essential users will obtain what they need. There will be no authority to reserve supplies for coal distributors and wood carters to Melbourne, for instance. Does tbe honourable fientleman want all tbe petrol to go to pleasure seekers? He and his colleagues must (make up their miinds wbere tbey stand on this issue. should make up his own mind. stand right behind the Government. If non-essential users are allowed to buy petrol without restraint, farmers will have to go without fuel for tbeir farming machinery. Some people will buy great stocks of petrol and a black market will develop. Tbe economy of Great Britain may crash. What would happen to Australia then? The United Kingdom provides the principal market for our wool, butter, meat and other primary products, The truth is that and if it does not survive its present crisis Australia will be hard hit. I wonder whether tbe Opposition's attitude on this problem arises from the fact that a Labour government is in power in Great Britain. cial considerations for the election fund.* of the Opposition parties that are paid in by the oil companies. The Australian Country party especially worksin the interests of tbose companies, although it claims that it represents the primary producers more effectively than does tbe Labour party. The oil companies will rob the primary producers as they will rob anybody else. Why are those honourable gentlemen such strong advocates foithe private oil companies? I hope that » lot of people will ask them that question They are completely irresponsible in this matter. They say that there is no necessity for petrol rationing and that even person should be allowed to buy as much petrol as he needs. Any additional iniports of petrol must be paid for with dollars, and while the Labour party is in power it is responsible for conserving our dollar resources sxthat funds may be reserved for the purchase of capital goods from dollar countries. The Government has planned for tbe allocation of dollars equivalent to about £10,000,000 for the purchase of plant needed to modernize the ooal mines. Coal-cutting machines and equipment needed to increase the rate of construction of houses must be imported beause tbey eannot be manufactured in Australia. Honourable members opposite, taking only a short-term view, would allow the dollar funds needed for those purchases to be exhausted by increasing our petrol imports. They are interested only in the demands of pleasure seekers, who want to go to places where they do not need to go. Thai ia how our petrol and our dollar resources",55,Conserving Dollars

Yet honourable members opposite would reduce that ration further! I whole-heartedly support the Government's policy, and I believe that all Australians, with the exception of a few selfish and irresponsible people like tbe members of the Australian Country party, also support it. The only conclusion that I am able to draw from the conduct of members of the Australian Country party on this issue is that somewhere there is a contact between tbem and the oil companies, wbich hope to make a great profit quickly from the lifting of petrol rationing witbout any regard for the effect of their conduct upon tbe economy of Australia and that of Great Britain. I want to reply very briefly to the bonfrom the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), orable member for Wannon( Mr the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction McLeod), wbo said that the High Court had decided that petrol rationing was invalid. That statement was true. The honourable gentleman also said that this Parliament could not do anything about tbe High Court's decision, and then he turned to members of the Australian Country party, looked directly at me, and said, "" What are you going to do about it ? "" He had just declared that, under the Constitution, this Parliament could do nothing about the abolition of petrol rationing. Wben such loose thinking as that is put into words, it scarcely needs a reply. However, I definitely refute the. honourable member's assertion that the Australian Country party is linked with tbe big oil companies. Of course uobody in Australia will believe such statements. They are too ridiculous to be worth discussing. Members of the Australian Country party have continually fought for greater production so that the people of the United Kingdom may have more food and we have tried to force the Government to encourage production. The fact is that individual citizens have done more to help the British people by sending food parcels to them tban this Government bas done. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Sheehy) -Order! the honourable member to connect his remarks witb the proposed vote for the Department of Shipping, and Fuel. that we believe that the supply of foodstuffs to the United Kingdom will not be threatened in any way if the Prime Minister( Mr Cbifley) decides to permit tbe importation into Australia of extra supplies of petrol. If the Government would only pursue a policy designed to increase primary production and permit the use of additional petrol in the right place and in the right manner, Great Britain would benefit from it. The discussion of the proposed vote for the Department of Shipping and Fuel has covered a wide field, but I shall refer to only two of the many subjects that have been discussed. The first of tbose is petrol rationing. We have heard a great deal ( Mr Dedman) and honourable members who support the Government about the supposedly vital necessity for restricting Australia's imports of petrol in order to help Great Britain through its economic crisis. Those bonorable gentlemen have cast a slur upon members of the Opposition by declaring that we are completely irresponsible in this matter and are not really concerned about the difficulties that confront the Old Country. 1 throw that 'assertion back in the teeth of every man who bas made it. I think the committee will agree that during the last two or three years proposals to help Britain that have been made in this chamber, have usually originated and, unfortunately, continued to reside in, the Opposition. We have made a number of suggestions regarding positive way? in wbicb the Government could do something to help the Old Country. It has been notable that whenever a situation has arisen in which it has become necessary for Australia to help Britain to save dollars or other resources, the first approach and, unfortunately, usually the only approach made by the Prime Minister, has been to restrict imports to Australia. He has entirely overlooked a better way of achieving the same result without I should like causing needless upset to the country's economy. We could produce goods andi",56,Conserving Dollars

Thus it is with petrol. hear all this flapdoodle from the GovernThe Prime Minister makes one approach and one approach only. He tells the people of this country that Australia must get along with less and less petrol. He does not go to any pains to explain how mucb of the petrol imported to Australia is used. He does not tell the people Fadden) concerning an action of thf that because of his own muddling in connection witb tbe coal industry millions of gallons of petrol are used for purposes for which coal should be used. The honourable member for Boothby( Mr that was established by a conservative Sheehy) represents in this Parliament an area which is interested in motor bodywill pass muster for one as far as the building, and he knows that at the present time thousands of motor car bodies are being transported by motor vehicles because there is no shipping available to do the job, either because there is not sufficient coal available or because tbe rate of loading and discharge is so slow that it has reduced the availability of shipping. Last year in Western Australia we had an epic example of a Labour government's muddling. A Labour government had held oflice in that State for years, and had allowed the State railways to deteriorate to such an extent that they proved to be unable to transport superphosphate to country districts, and the Government actually had to subsidize motor transport to do the job thereby using tens of thousands of gallons of petrol for a purpose which could have been very well served by the railways bad tbey been well conducted. The Australian Government now intends to enter the shipping industry, and to build ships designed to burn coal. Of course, if there is not sufficient coal the Government will convert the ships into oil-burning vessels. Oil fuel costs tbree or four times as much as coal fuel and in addition comes from dollar sources. The Prime Minister has been very silent on those matters. He tells the people that petrol rationing is necessary to help Britain, but he does not tell them the alternatives that could very well be adopted, whicb would be of very much more use to Great Britain without causing any restrictions in Australia. He does not do so, because bis Government has not the courage to face up to problems as it should do. That is why we ment. This afternoon we beard a very short speech by the Prime Minister which, I am sure, he already regrets having made. When he suggested thai something was revealed by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited, he disowned all responsibility for the action and said that the Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited was a company government. That is not a fact, but it Prime Minister is concerned. He said that under tbe terms of the agreement relating to the Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited the Governmem has no real control in its operations. The people of this country are fortunate that the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale'l looked up the actual terms of the agreement and showed, beyond all shadow of doubt, that the Prime Minister was completely inaccurate in the impression thai be tried to convey to the people in respeci of the Government's control or authority over the Commonwealtb Oil Eefineries Limited, One Minister after another rises in this chamber and tries to tell the people of this country that we, on the Opposition side, who have bad very little to say about the actual rationing of petrol, are unjustly attacking the Government on that issue. The Leader of the Australian Country party has suggested that the amount of petrol entering Australia might very well be increased, and I consider that the case he advanced for that increase has not yet been answered by the Prime Minister, who stated that the information that he has on tbe subject is of a confidential nature and that he therefore cannot reveal it to the people. That is a very poor excuse. I suggest that the British Government, if it considers that the position ia BO serious as to require such restrictions and controls in Australia, would be more than pleased that the people of Australia who, after all, must in the long run sanction its Government's actions and who will have an opportunity soon of passing judgment on the actions of the Government, should be fully informed of the reason for the restrictions. I shall refer briefly to the subject of shipping, because we bave heard a number of statements regarding this industry, some of which huve been extraordinary. The honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn) made an extraordinary statement this afternoon in which she told the House that she had been informed that certain waterside workers had been told by somebodyihe did not specify by whom, although the inference was that it was by the shipowners-that hurry with this or that job, or, in other words, that the ship-owners themselves were deliberately sabotaging the coastal shipping trade of Australia. is too ridiculous even to be given a second thought. Before the war the freight and Melbourne was 27s. a ton for general cargo, whereas to-day it costs 30s. 5d. a ton to load and unload cargo moving between these ports. That is to say, the whole of tbe loading, unloading and carriage of goods by sea between Melbourne and Sydney before the war -cost 3s. a ton less tban loading and unloading alone now does. I should like honourable members to consider that fact closely and I sball therefore repeat it. To-day, as a result of tbe establishment -of the Stevedoring Industry Commission with its very wide powers, and with very rigid controls over the waterfront, it costs 30s. 5d. a ton to load and unload -cargo at Sydney and Melbourne whereas before the war, when there were none of these fantastic conditions, the shipowners could carry the freight from Melbourne to Sydney for 27s. a ton, presumably at a profit. The whole thing is fantastic. We were told only to-day by the Prime Minister that increases in wages costs were a reason for increased freight charges. I do not question -that. I believe that we should endeaMr MoBride. rour to give all people who are working on the waterfront, and also those engaged in rural and secondary industries, thf highest wages and best possible conditions. But we bave to realize that unless these improvements in wages and conditions result in greater output the balance of our economy suffers. Tbe Prime Minister has stated that freights have already been increased by about 15s. a ton. according to the type of -cargo. It if interesting to observe that higher rate* were required not only by the private companies but also by the Government. The Prime Minister has admitted thai governmental activities in the field ol shipping were no more successful during and immediately after World War II . than when the Government entered thf shipping field during World WarI . The honourable member for Eawkner( M i Holt) bas pointed out that during thf tbere was no need to last three years the Australian Shipping Board has lost about £11,000,000 and that it is anticipated ithat a big loss will be incurred this year. These losses havf That been incurred by subsidies to the shippers of freight in this country, not by subsides to the private shipping companies, rate between Sydney as was suggested by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Thompson) During the war the whole of the ship, on the coast were under charter. Th< Government fixed what it considered to b> a fair charter and then charged appro priate freights to civilian and service users. Although profits were made OD those charter rates in the early stageof tbe war, towards the end of thi war, those profits disappeared rapidly. Following the cessation of hostilities large losses were incurred by the Government. Nevertheless, as honourable members know, legislation wairecently passed to provide for the establishment of another government shipping line. Presumably that line will enter into fair competition to ensure thai shippers on tbe coast of Australia will be charged freight rates on a reasonable basis. The expenditure to date, however, suggests that the Government will not be able to run its ships, as efficiently and cheaply as private enterprise runs ii shipping services and that ultimately those ships will cost the taxpayers infinitely more than the shipper?ure now paying for theirfreight in private ships. The people of this country are already realizing that the most expensive luxury that they or the people of any other country can indulge in is that of socialistic enterprise. That fact is lieing forced home in a very unpleasant manner to the people of Great Britain. Since the railways of that country were aationalized freight rates have been increased 100 per cent. The TEMPOBABY CHAIRMAN Mr Sheehan) -Order! The honourable srentleman's time bas expired. [10.5],-This afternoon I urged that the Government should, provide adequate shipping facilities for Queensland, par-icularly for the river trade of Maryborough and Bundaberg. Although both she honourable member for Capricornia ("" Mr Davidson) and I have made representations in connection witb this matter frequently during the past months, to date a final reply has not been received from 'ho Minister for Shipping and Fuel Senator Ashley). In view of the ever increasing magnitude of trade I impress upon the Government the urgent necessity "">.f assuring contractors, business people, and manufacturers in those districts -hat they will be provided with a regular shipping service. Such facilities should at least be equal to those that were provided in the immediate pre-war period. I hope that the Government will make available to those ports the ship built by Walker's Limited that has been held for allotment until the shipping board was appointed. Such an allocauon would alleviate tbe lifting of overdue -argoes from Newcastle and Sydney and ctvake possible more expeditious re-abip-nent from Brisbane, where cargoes some'iines lie on the wharfs for weeks awaiting -I vessel. I deplore the accusations that were made by the honourable member for Leader of the Australian Country party Mr Fndden) during the temporary absence from the chamber of that right Honourable gentleman. The charges were '.uade in connection with the petrol I should not have risen to discuss a matter industry. The honourable member sugwhich bas already been so fully discussed <r«stod that the right honourable gentlewere it not for the misrepresentation man's endeavours, which were designed to bring about the abolition of petrol rationing in Australia, were motivated by a desire to get a cut out of the profits of the petrol companies and so secure funds for the forthcoming election campaign. That was a mean and contemptible accusation. On many occasions, and as recently as last Friday, I have urged the Government to secure for Australia some rights to oil bearing areas in adjacent foreign countries wbere petrol is available, as ha* been done by Great Britain and Canada Even before tbe cessation of hostilities. I urged the Government in this House to take action to secure for Australia some proved oil-bearing territory, to save tbe people of this country from paying ever-increasing prices to the great foreign oil companies that have helped the Government to inflict petrol inconveniences upon the public, and which were making millions of pounds in excess profits each year. Does that indicate that the party that I support if "" smooging "" to tbose companies to secure money to meet election expenses? It ie indeed a pity that the mind of the honourable member for Wannon is so small and _ his focus on the activities of otber people so ineffective as to cause him to express the view that the Leader of tbe Australian Country party was actuated by such a base motive. As I have already said, I have been very active in my endeavours to get the Government to move to acquire rights over oil-bearing areas in the interests of Australia, and to save the people of this country being unduly robbed by the big petrol combines of the world. With the dayto-day expansion of industry we are becoming more and more dependent on petrol. It looks as if that dependence is increasing as the coal-miners of New South Wales lose interest in the development of Australia. I hope that the Government will do something about shipping . services on the coast of Queensland, and that it will also take action to reduce the high price charged for petrol by the big oil companies.",57,Conserving Dollars

191,Mr Bowden (Gippsland) [10.11],"practised by certain Government supporters. ordinary statement whicb convinced me that probably the High Court should have consulted him before it gave its decision in the petrol rationing case. I am convinced, moreover, that people would rather go without petrol than listen to the honourable member. He rightly said that the decision of the court meant only that the Commonwealth had no power to ration petrol; it did not mean that rationing was no longer required. However, one of his colleagues, with a more realistic outlook, said that, from the inquiries he bad made, he was convinced that petrol rationing had ceased to be of any use. He said that no more petrol was being used now than when rationing was in force, and he added that, with the elimination of black marketing in petrol coupons, there was reason to assume that less petrol would be used. He was probably right. When clothing was rationed, people bought clothes so as to use up their coupons, and 1 have no doubt that many people did the same in regard to petrol. The honourable member for Wannon was bard put to it to find a reason for attacking the Opposition, and particularly his bete noir, the Australian Country party, but eventually he worked the argument round so that he could blame us for the elimination of rationing. He made the extraordinarily unfair statement that the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) was gloating over the verdict of the High Court because it vindicated the policy which he had been advocating for some time. Although it seems to have been established that tbe abolition of rationing has not resulted in an increased demand for petrol, the honourable member claimed that the satisfaction of the Leader of the Australian Country party with the verdict of the court was due to the fact that it would swell the profits of the oil companies, and that he would probably get his cut. The honourable member stated that approach to this matter was entirely non-political, yet he made charges of that kind. He professed to be particularly anxious about Britain's economy, and said that the chief purpose of petrol rationing was to help Great Britain. If Ur. Boxoden. Britain were to go to the wall economiTbe honourable member for cally as the result of the High Court's decision, what were we going to do about it, be asked? Just previously, he had said that tbe High Court had given its decision, and that we could not do anything about it. I remind the House that we on this side of the committee are just as solicitous for the welfare of Great Britain as are honourable members opposite, and we have a more practical plan for assisting Great Britain than by the saving of a little petrol. The Leader of the Australian Country party showed last week that Britain was trading to Argentina over 5,000,000 tons of fuel oil each year in exchange for meat, which was being supplied at double the price for which Australia could supply it. We are not satisfied with that policy. If only one-third of a million tons more petrol is needed in Australia to remove the need for rationing, then let the extra petrol be imported and used to assist in the production of food for Britain. The advantage to Britain would far outweigh any dollar difficulty that could arise out of the purchase of tbe additional petrol. before the importation of petrol was reflected in an increased production of food? People in Britain could die of starvation in tbe meantime. tive government that would make facilities available we could produce tbe additional food in one season. More petrol can be imported only by permission of tbe Australian Government, so that the total consumption of petrol in Australia can be increased only with the consent of tbe Government. Tbe Government controls the allocation of dollars, and it can insist that the petrol is imported from sterling areas. Why, then, do bonorable members opposite talk such nonsense ahout the adverse economic effect of the abolition of petrol rationing? As a matter of fact, the oil companies have his asked the people not to panic, and have stated that plenty of petrol is available. different at their meeting with the Prime Minister. is no need for panic.

Let us give the system of free distribution a fair trial, and if it is found that Great Britain's economy is being seriously affected, honourable members on this side of the committee will insist upon something being done to remedy tbe position. The attitude of Government supporters, however, ie, ""We support socialism, and to bell with the consequences "". That is not the policy of honourable members on this side of the committee. As I have said, we can help Britain more effectively in other ways than by saving a few gallons of petrol. apparent from the speech of the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr the money to purchase both motor care Bowden) that, by passing tbe buck to the Government, tbe members of the Australian Country party are trying to excuse their attitude towards petrol rationing, and their lack of support for Great Britain in the tragic economic plight in whicb the British people find themselves. The honourable member for Gippsland claimed that the restoration of rationing would not help Britain to restore economic stability. Every dollar saved must be of some assistance to tbe people of Britain 'from the economic plight in which they find themselves. for members of the Opposition to say that the Government's attitude is dictated by a desire to support a socialist Administhe people are particularly wary just now tration in Great Britain. The Australian Labour party has a much wider and broader outlook in international affairs. Irrespective of the political complexion of the Government of tbe United Kingdom, Labour would, because of the necessity to rebuild Great Britain and to assist the British people and the Empire generally, impose similar restrictions to those at present operating. It cannot be denied that members of the Australian Country party have adopted an antiBritish attitude Mr Beale interjecting, f.81] for Parramatta ( Mr Beale), who waves more flags tban any soldier every dreamt of doing, has attacked tbe Government because of its attempts to assist the people of Great Britain in their hour of need, and be bas been supported, aided and abetted by members of the Australian Country party. I did not intend to participate further in this debate, but I could not permit a slur to be cast on tbe people of Great Britain and the efforts being made by Labour to assist them without making some reply. As tbe honourable member' for Wannon( Mr McLeod) pointed out this evening, primary producers, wbo require petrol for their livelihood, will in future have to run the gauntlet of the demands upon petrol of approximately 1,500,000 metropolitan consumers, who, thanks to the sound economic position of Australia under the administration of Labour, bave and petrol. If the supply of petrol is not increased at the source it may happen that before long primary producers will not be able to obtain sufficient petrol to operate their vehicles, because it is a natural consequence of laisser-faire that tbose who have tbe money get what they want. It may not be long before members of the Australian Country party will be asking the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) and the Minister for Shipping and Euel (Senator Ashley) to do something to move vehicles on farm proin recovering perties. Tbe mouthpieces of the monopolists, who have spoken in this chamber It is idle to-night on behalf of the oil companies, will tell the people anything at all to further their short-range policy. However, of propaganda concerning petrol distribution, largely because of the manner in which tbey were misled by the opponents of tbe Government during tbe campaign which preceded the referendum on the control of rents and prices. The people to-day realize the disastrous consequences of accepting their advice. It must be remembered that the quantity of petrol imported into Australia will not be increased, because the quotas of the various Empire countries were fixed some time ago, when allocations of dollars were made.

198,Mr Daly,"The honourable memberpetrol consumers will not be able to obtain all tbe petrol that tbey desire, and that, in the nature of things, those consumers who have the most wealth will endeavour to obtain far more than their fair share. It is the plain duty of any government to ensure that people who have only limited purchasing power obtain their fair share. Supporters of the Government are just as anxious as are bonorable members opposite to see the end of restrictions. At the same time, we do not want rationing to be terminated until all members of the community are properly provided for. I place on record that I deplore the attitude adopted by members of tbe Opposition, who are decrying the efforts made by this Government to assist tbe people of Great Britain to recover their economic stability. I also take this opportunity to warn our own people that although petrol rationing has been discarded by the Commonwealth on consequence of the recent judgment of the High Court they should remember that even greater difficulties may be encountered in tbe future in the distribution of petrol Members of the Opposition who have criticized the Government's policy in this matter will not be of much assistance to the community if trouble is encountered in the distribution of petrol in the future. They have no sound knowledge of the position, such as that imparted to the Prime Minister by tbe Chancellor of the British Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps, and it ill migrate to this country, are closed. Simibecomes them to complain that the present Government bas retained control over the distribution of petrol for political purposes. The Government has maintained petrol rationing to conserve the broad interests of the people of the British Empire, and any one with an ounce of common sense must realize that the retention of restrictions or controls by any administration must inevitably be unpopular. It must be clear, therefore, that the reason wby the Government has sought to retain controls is anything but political. [10.26] I bad not intended to speak on this matter because the subject was magnificently dealt with by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr grants. For example, Australia has an Fadden) and the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale). However, bonorable members opposite have sought to defend the conduct of the manager in New South Wales of Oommonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited which is the Government's own company. That individual is apparently a slick salesman, who attempted, to the detriment of the community, to beat other oil distributors in making sales of petrol wben rationing was terminated. I believe that the Government should adopt a long range view directed towards national selfsufficiency sucb as that advocated by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr McBride). I consider that the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) correctly described the motive that hae actuated the Government in its attitude towards petrol consumption when be said that its slogan was, "" We support socialism and to hell with the consequences "". What is the dollar situation, and by what means may we eventually become independent of dollars? Consider, for a moment, the amount that we lose when we import English cigarettes, which are manufactured from American tobacco. Not only is tbe importer needlessly expending Empire dollars, but the development of the tobacco growing and manufacturing industry in this country is retarded,, and in that way possible avenues of employment to Englishmen, who migbt otherwise larly, when we import cotton piece goods from the United. Kingdom, whicb have been manufactured from cotton grown in the United States of America, we retard tbe development of the cotton industry in this country and limit the opportunities for Englishmen who migbt migrate to Australia. I believe with the honourable member for Wakefield that eventually we shall develop our economy to the point of national self-sufficiency, and when that time comes we shall be independent of dollar currency.

What led us to refer to the economic position of Great Britain and the effect of socialism on that country? During the last few weeks, I have spoken to a number of Englishmen who have run away from their country in order to seek freedom in Australia from tbe dictates of a socialist regime. This is what Englishmen have told me The Order! I remind the honourable member that he is permitted to discuss dollars only in relation to the proposed vote for the Department of Shipping and Fuel. that you are denying me the right to speak on tbe economic situation of the British people. The Order! It is not the Chair, but the Standing Orders whicb prevent the honourable member from discussing any further such matters. warning tbe people of Australia that if they permit the present Government to follow the socialist lead of Morrison and Bevin in the United Kingdom tbey will be simply encouraging the onset of Parkinson's disease, which is a form of creeping paralysis, in our body politic. Tbe honourable member for Martin( Mr mean greater production. Honourable Daly) and the honourable member for bers of the Opposition, and, in particular, members of tbe Australian Country party, of being anti-British, to repeat their phrase. I hardly need to state that members of the Opposition parties are just as mindful of the requirements of the people of Great Britain, and perhaps more so, as are members and supporters delivered by the honourable member for MartinI should imagine that the Government realizes that its chickens are coming home to roost. The Government is therefore trotting out its bogy that the termination of petrol rationing and the transfer to the oil companies of responsibility for the distribution of liquid fuel will result in primary producers not obtaining their fair share. Of course, if such a thing did happen, the people of Australia generally would very soon realize their dependence on the primary producers, wbo furnish tbe nation's bread and butter. If the Government is prepared to give way to the inordinate demands of the people of Melbourne and Sydney, as the honourable member for Martin and the honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller) would have it do. petrol supplies in the country would not last a week. Honourable members oppoto add to the hardships suffered by the people of Great Britain.

The Government attributes tbe shortage of agricultural machinery to the scarcity of coal and the consequent under-production of steel. Notwithstanding that contention, New Zealand bas been able to obtain its requirements of steel from. Australia. The Order! Steel is not covered by tbe proposed vote for tbe Department of Shipping and Fuel. only in passing. It has been said by Government spokesmen that primary producers cannot obtain agricultural machinery because of the shortage of steel resulting from insufficient coal supsell it, surely it is not unreasonable to plies. We contend that if steps were taken by the Government to ensure maximum coal production by guarding against absenteeism in tbe coal-mining industry and unwarranted stoppages in the coal mines, agricultural machinery could be obtained in sufficient quantities to meet all needs. The Order! I again ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to tbe proposed vote. the fact that many oil-burning vessels are now in operation, the shortage of coal has its effect on the availability of shipdoes not adopt practical methods of ping. If much needed machinery were made available to tbe primary producers additional quantities of petrol and petroof trouble to obtain information concernleum products would also have to be made available. It appears to me that the Government is complacent about the coal shortages because it knows that if additional coal were made available to enable the manufacturers of agricultural machinery to achieve full production a corresponding increase would have to be made iu tbe importation of petrol and petroleum products. Because of the bad condition into which our railway systems have fallen many thousands of gallons of petrol and diesel oil are being used annually to transport superphosphate to country areas. producers been refused essential supplies of petrol? been refused additional petrol, but they have had to work hard to get it. Many country people have had to use their meagre monthly petrol ration to travel to the nearest post office to obtain tbeir petrol coupons. Some of them bave had to travel distances, of from 50 to 60 miles in order to obtain their coupons. live in remote rural areas, it has not been the practice of the rationing authorities to post coupons to them. If it is good enough for thf I mentioned steel British Socialist Government to ship 5,700,000 tons of fuel oil annuallj to Argentina in order to obtain meat from that country at a price equal to double the price for which we could demand that an additional quantity of petrol equal to one-nineteenth of that tonnage should be made available to Australia so that petrol rationing may be abolished and primary production may be expanded. primary production could be achieved by that means? the increase would be appreciable.

No valid reply has been made to the arguments that have been advanced by the Leader of the Australian Country party. Not one tittle of evidence has been brought to light. Tbe Prime Minister has merely said that, with the approval of the British authorities, he clothes rationing. ""While rationing lasts will make available to the State premiers the confidential information that he has received from Sir Stafford Cripps. Members of this National Parliament apparently are not to be trusted with that information. If the States fall for the idea of taking over the administration of petrol rationing, knowing full well that not the necessary money, they give the the Commonwealth has power to restrict imports, they will be assuming a task which may affect them most detri; mentally. At the same time, they will be absolving the Commonwealth Government of responsibility for its own maladministration. I agree with the honorahle member for Gippsland ( Mr Proposed vote airreed to.

Anybody knows that ration tickets could be purchased in capital cities for from ls, and 3s. for each gallon ticket. Where did the tickets come from ? Ugly and filthy rumours are being circulated about officials of the rationing administration. I do not believe them, but it is sufficient that they are being circulated. Recently a youth was prosecuted for an offence involving the illegal use of thousands of tickets. Forging gangs have been at work in Victoria, South Australia and ""Western Australia. AU the petrol that has been obtained by forged tickets has been in excess of the authorized consumption. I am confident that much of the petrol that is being bought is not for current use. member be surprised to know that every oil company in Australia agrees that ths abolition of rationing would increase consumption by 10 per cent? been told that; but earlier this afternoon the Leader of the Australian Country party disclosed that Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited had done everything possible to boost petrol sales immediately the rationing regulations were invalidated by the High Court. The other companies advised people not to panic because they believe that normal trading would soon be restored. The public reaction to the abolition of petrol rationing will be the same as was its reaction to the abolition of holders of coupons feel impelled to redeem them at the end of each month. Many thousands of gallons have been bought at the end of each rationing period and stored in backyards. The people really do not want the petrol, but they buy it because they have tickets. If they have tickets to some one else who nas the money. Much of the petrol is not being used.
