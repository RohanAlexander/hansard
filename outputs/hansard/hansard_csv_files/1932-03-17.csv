NEW STATION IN SOUTH AUSTRALIAHALF-YEARLY FEES FOR LISTENERSmaster-General, before finally deciding on the location of the proposed broadcasting station at Red Hill, consider the desirability of establishing one in the south-eastern portion of South Australia, say, at Narracoorte? considering the establishment of eight more regional broadcasting stations throughout Australia, and their location will be decided largely on the reports of wireless engineers. Should a station be established in the south-eastern portion of South Australia, it may be at Narracoorte or any other locality from which,'in the opinion of the experts, the best service can be given. financial stringency, will the Postmaster General consider the advisability of allowing listeners to pay their fees half-yearly, instead of an.nually? ber's suggestion will receive consideration. natural difficulties which prevent listeners in southern Tasmania from picking up mainland stations during the day time, and' thus preclude them from obtaini.'is the midday business reports', will the Postmaster-General arrange for a special midday message to he relayed through 7ZL, covering stock exchange and general commercial market information ? honourable member's request investigated. concessional tariff duties on articles in the nature of machinery, does the Minister for Trade and Customs consider right to -regard it as possible to manufacture such articles .

Mr R, GREEK -In a letter I have received from the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in New South Wales, regarding the application of a returned soldier for a pension, the following paragraph occurs:Ou the 2nd January, 1932, the member lodged an appeal to the War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal against the decision recorded by the Commission. Owing to the member's position on the waiting list, it is not anticipated that his case will be heard by the Entitlement Tribunal prior to June, 1932. In view of the delay of six months indicated in that letter, will the Minister for Repatriation consider the advisability of appointing another appeal tribunal, if only temporarily? Entitlement Appeal Tribunal deals only with cases which have been previously adjudicated upon by the Repatriation Commission. In recent years many of the decisions of the commission have been confirmed by the tribunal. In those circumstances, the appointment of a second tribunal to do the work of what is really a final court of appeal would be unjustifiable. pretation placed upon the act by the Commissioner of War Pensions that awidow is debarred altogether from a pension when her bank account exceeds £200, will the Minister investigate the hardship that is being inflicted upon many widows whose only possession is £200 or over, while other widows who have a sum only slightly less than £200, but possess a home of infinitely greater value obtain pensions? Will the Minister also arrange to increase to £300 or £400 the amount which a widow may possess? been asked by the honourable member. One is whether a pension should be payable to a dependant of a deceased soldier when that dependant has £200 or more in the bank. The law provides that the pension shall not be payable unless the dependant is in necessitous circumstances, and under a regulation of the department, if a dependant has £200, he or she is not regarded as being in necessitous circumstances. There is a distinction between the widow or widowed mother of a soldier and other dependants, such as parents, of a soldier, who, in some instances, may be individuals who have become widows more than three years after the death of the soldier. In the case of a mother who was a widow when her soldier son was killed, pension is paid without conditions. It is only when widowhood has occurred long after the death of a soldier, and the pension is much in the nature of a grant ex gratia, that any restriction is imposed. tion of the Minister for. Repatriation to the position of the widow of Gunner Perry; his case caused a good deal of discussion some time ago. Gunner Perry disappeared, and has not since drawn his peusion, which gives reason for the supposition that he is dead. Although already married, he went through the form of marriage with an unfortunate girl. The Queensland police have issued a.warrant for his arrest, but neither the police nor the Defence Department, despite the fact that it has branches in all the States, can locate him. For a number of years Mrs. Perry has, therefore, been deprived of her pension. I shall furnish the Minister with full particulars of the case and I desire to know whether during the coming recess he will look into the matter with a view to an alteration of the present law. That, I understand, would be necessary to enable this woman to obtain justice. notice, give any opinion in regard to an individual case, but if the honourable member will furnish me with the details of this ease I shall have it looked into. Possibly, the Avidow could obtain her pension if she applied to the court, and obtained a declaration that her husband could be presumed to be dead. for Repatriation inform me whether there is any regulation which would debar a soldier's widow from getting a pension in a case where her husband has been dead for nine years, and there is no proof of how he died?

If that is so, all that would be necessary would be the production of evidence on that point. This would entitle the widow and children to receive certain allowances. If the case is one in which the woman was deserted by her husband there may be no evidence available as to whether his disability continued until the time of his death, and it may be difficult to prove. If the woman is a deserted wife she would have no claim; but if she is a widow she would have a claim. ported to have agreed not to apply its ihe Service and retaining them at junior super tariff to Australian exports, and this rates of pay.

I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government will suspend the proposed action for further consideration, so that one section of the community shall not be selected to make a special sacrifice? General explained last night; juniors in the postal service, upon reaching adult age, would, under normal conditions, be appointed to permanent positions at f u l l pay. Under existing circumstances, there tiro no vacancies to which they can be appointed; they, therefore, become redundant officers, and tbe Government bad they can be appointed, but rather than of the award.

The bounty will be payable on that wheat when it is sold. The Crown Law officers advise that the bounty is payable ou wheat only when it has passed out of the control of the grower-whe n it is sold or delivered to a wheat-buyer for sale. Therefore, the department cannot pay a bounty on wheat simply because it is delivered to a co-operative shed as distinct from a pool shed, the grower still having control ' of his wheat. lie sells it. the bounty will become payable. growers is at present under consideration by Cabinet. and consistent allegation of exploitation by the Australian Performing Right Association, will the Minister institute some adequate form of inquiry into that body's activities? ment.

I consider that the Commonwealth Bank should be under the direction of the Governor, subject to the control of this Parliament and the Treasury, as was originally intended. Radio is, socially and politically, one of the most revolutionary additions to the pool of human resources, and we should be careful not to leave any loophole which will permit a service that rightly belongs to the people to be exploited by any monopoly. At the bottom, the issue is part of the larger conflict between exploitation for private profit and the increasingly articulate movement for public ownership aud public operation of essential services. In this conflict the citadel of radio is the key position, because the control of radio mean3 increasingly tbe control of public opinion. This fact the press has recognized. The matter of sponsored programmes is one of the most contentious features of the bill, so far as ministerial opinion is concerned. appears to be well-informed. the basis of fact. Private enterprise feels that a national station is likely to intrude upon a source of income that has hitherto been its exclusive right. Why should not the national stations enjoy the right of broadcasting so.me of the special features that are associated with sponsored programmes? There is no proposal that these stations should engage in general advertising, but the press is endeavouring to make the public believe that the Government is seeking to invade the whole field of advertising by wireless.

What is happening in connection with this bill indicates what we may expect from this Government whenever it has to choose between protecting the interests of the community and giving special privileges to private vested interests. member's time has expired. Trade and Customs) [12.35] -As a result of helpful and constructive criticism by members of all parties,* the Government has decided to propose certain amendments to the bill. tion come more fittingly from the Postmaster-General? desires to announce these proposed changes to the House, and if the Postmaster-General intervened at this stage lie would close the debate. I have risen, not to make a comprehensive statement on the bill, but merely to indicate the nature of the proposed amendments. The first, and perhaps most important, is iu clause 5, which reads] . For the purposes of this act, there shall be a com mission, to be known as the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which shall be charged with the general administration of this act, subject to such directions (if any) as are from time to time given by the Minister. The suggested amendment is that the words "" subject to such directions, if any, as are from time to.time given by the Minister"" shall be omitted. Critics of this clause have been divided, some urging that the commission has too much power, and others that the Minister has reserved too much control. of the matter the Government is prepared fo grant greater power to the commission than was originally intended. If we can secure a capable commission we should entrust to it complete.control of this important social service. Clause 16 sets out the functions of the commission, and sub-clause 2 providesThe hours during which programmes shall be broadcast from the various national broadcasting stations shall be subject to the approval of the Minister. Several honourable members pointed out that that seemed to be an unnecessary reservation of power to the Minister, and the Government has acquiesced in that view. Therefore, sub-clause 2 will be eliminated. The alteration to clause IS is perhaps more contentious. The clause gives to the commission power to compile, publish, and circulate such papers, magazines, periodicals, books, &c, as it thinks fit, and to issue, as the British Broadcasting Corporation does, programmes and other matters of interest to listeners. The fear was expressed that the commission might decide to exercise exclusively the right to publish the programmes of the national -Would not this explanabroadcasting stations. The Government has decided that that would be undesirable. In the interests of listeners, the widest publicity should be given to programmes, and honourable members will agree that publications dealing with programmes should be comprehensive, and relate to B class as well as national stations. Therefore, we are providing that the commission's power to publish and issue this information shall not be exclusive; the programmes will be avail1 able for publication by any firm or person interested in broadcasting. Clause 22 reads1. The' commission shall not broadcast advertisements in general, but may, with the approval of the Minister, and subject to such stipulations ( if any) as are contained in that approval, broadcast announcements having some definite relation to particular items contained in the programme which it is broadcasting. 2. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the commission from broadcasting, if it thinks f it , sponsored programmes accompanied by acknowledgments to the persons by whom they were made available. The Government never intended that the On reconsideration commission should engage in general advertising in competition with other enterprises, but the clause seemed to awaken apprehension on that score in tbe minds of many honourable members. have made that possible.",26,Fenton

138,Mr Riley,"Parliamen t should adticularly at a time like this, of Parliament being indefinitely in recess. should like some statement from the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) as to what business he proposes to bring down when the House re-assembles. Isi t intended to bring forward the tariff schedule for discussion, and is a lengthy legislative programme contemplated? ' I quite understand that the Prjme Minister, in accordance with the promise that he gave some days ago, intends to have the subject of unemployment discussed at the Premiers Conference; but it is necessary that Parliament should meet as soon as possible after that conference has been held, because a grave responsibility rests upon us to relieve the unemployed before winter sets in. I hope that the Prime Minister will give the House some assurance regarding the date of meeting of Parliament, the business th.at will then be done, and the nature of the proposals for the relief of unemployment throughout Australia. I understand that tbe Government is. asking for the adjournment of the House for a period longer than the Easter holidays so as to give time to enable the Premiers Conference to deal with the unemployment problem. None of us can object to an adjournment for that purpose, although I feel that I can justly criticize the Government for having to propose such an adjournment, seeing that those who are now Ministers stated at the general election that, if elected, they would be capable of dealing with this problem immediately they obtained office. It is clear that they cannot fulfil that promise, and that further investigations are necessary. I hope that the Government's investigations will be completed within the period of the proposed adjournment, and that there will not be a repetition of what has occurred in connection with conferences held within the last two years. Committees have been appointed, and various suggestions for the relief of unemployment have been made, such as could be made by almost every member of this House, yet nothing has been done for tbe relief of the unemployed. If the time of the Premiers Conference is not to be wasted in useless discussion or investigation, there may be some justification for the lengthy adjournment of the House, but the Government must expect that upon the resumption of business, definite schemes will have to be submitted for the relief of unemployment. Only under those conditions do I feel disposed to agree to the adjournment being as long as is now proposed. One would not care whether the House adjourned for a month or two months so long as the Government, after the meeting of the Premiers Conference, was able to submit tangible proposals for the relief of unemployment. But the Government has been in office for about fourteen weeks, and all indications point to a further reduction in governmental expenditure by retrenchment or, as the Ministers have termed it, a reorganization of departments, which must throw more men out of employment. Prior to 1929 the Commonwealth expended up to £35,000,000 a year on public works, thus giving employment on loan works to over 17 per cent, of our people. What is the position to-day? The Government has no loan policy. As has been the practice during the last two and one-half years, the Government will adjourn and meet the Premiers in conference. Then the Loan Council will invite the bankers to a conference, to ascertain what moneys can be made available for the relief of unemployment. The economists will be asked to make recommendations as to the methods to be adopted for relieving unemployment, and a further report will be submitted to Parliament. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) must admit that this Government has endeavoured to shift its responsibility to the Commonwealth Bank Board and the economists of this country. The electors returned us to this Parliament to solve the problem of unemployment. Some honourable members say that it is necessary to increase production in this country, but others say that if we do that we shall find no markets for our products. There is plenty of work that requires to be carried out in Australia. Sydney is the third city of the world, and carries a population of over one million. Yet many of its suburbs are not sewered.

In reply to the remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), I point out that there would necessarily be some adjournment at Easter, and in order to allow honourable members who represent distant constituencies to go to their homes and return to Canberra, at least three weeks would be necessary. The extra week is being allowed so that the subject of unemployment can be dealt with by the Premiers Conference. Question resolved in the affirmative. LEAVE OP ABSENCE. agreed toThat leave of absence be given to every member of the House of Representatives froan the determination of this sitting of the House tn the date of its next sitting. Works and Railways) [2.41] I move That the bill be now road a second time. The Lands Acquisition Act 1906-16 does not authorize the disposal of transferred property to a Commonwealth authority such as the Commonwealth Bank or the War Service Homes Commission. The sections of the act which have application to the matter are section 62A and section 63. Section 63 authorizes the disposal of land acquired or deemed to have been acquired under the act which is not required for any public purpose. "" Public purpose "" means any purpose iu respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws, but does not include the acquisition of Territory for the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth under the Constitution. If land is being transferred to a Commonwealtli authority, 3Uch as the Commonwealth Bank, the War Service Homes Commission, or the Repatriation Commission, for the use of that authority, it cannot be said to be not required for any public purpose. Section 62A was. therefore, inserted in the act to enable disposals of land by the Commonbut the section refers only to land acquired by the Commonwealth under the act. It will thus be seen that property which was transferred to the Commonwealth at the time of federation under section 85 i of the Constitution does not come within the terms of section 62A of the act. Under section 64 transferred property is deemed to have been acquired under the act, but in view of the references in sections 62A and 63 to the land which may be disposed of under those respective sections, section 62A can only be taken to apply to land which, as a fact, has been acquired under the act, and ( not to land which is deemed to have been acquired under the act. The amendment now under review is to bring under the provisions of section 62A, transferred property which was transferred to the Commonwealth under section 85 i of the Constitution. The Commonwealth Government has power to sell land that it has acquired by purchase if it is not required for any public purpose; but it has no power to sell transferred properties even though the land is not required for any public purpose. A few blocks of land which tbe Commonwealth possesses is desired by certain quasi-government institutions, such as the Commonwealth Bank, the War Service Homes Commission, or the Repatriation Commission, and the Government cannot give the necessary certificate. It is now proposed that this position shall be rectified. The Commonwealth Bank desires to build premises on one or two small blocks of land which the Government possesses, and it naturally wishes to own the land on which any of its buildings are put, but at present tbe Government cannot sell the land in question. -In various city and suburban areas, land has been reserved for such public purposes as the provision of recreation parks and children's playgrounds, and all honourable members will agree that nothing should be done to deprive the people of the benefits of such reserves.

If this bill is so far -reaching in its effect as to enable a government to use for such a purpose land which should be reserved for all time for the benefit of people living in thickly populated areas, I am not prepared to support it. The Minister has certainly stated that this measure will have applicahonorable member for West Sydney to tion only to small pieces of land here and there; but I suggest that it will also have a general application, irrespective of the size of the blocks. The framers of the law on this subject, probably antici-passe d through its remaining stages pating considerable suburban development, made provision to prevent these open spaces from being used for other purposes, aud there is every reason why we should jealously guard the interests of the public with respect to such land. The names of the far-sighted men who \yeie responsible for setting aside such areas as Centennial Park, Sydney, for the benefit of the public will always be honoured. Many of the people in my electorate live in thickly populated areas, and ample breathing spaces should be reserved for them by preserving all the open spaces possible. This does not appear to be a contentious measure. I understand that if the postal authorities in a city such as Rockhampton had more land than they required for postal purposes, and a branch of the Commonwealth Bank were located on an adjoining allotment, and required some of that land, there is no power at the present time to transfer it, because a cerThis amendment is consequential on the tificate could not be given that it was required for a public purpose. Therefore I have no objection to the bill. Works and Railways) [2.51] I point out to the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) that the Commonwealth Government does not own park lands. Let me indicate the circumstances in which this measure would be put into operation. A piece of land was acquired for the building of a new general post office at Perth, but the whole of the land was not needed for that purpose. Immediately adjoining the General Post Office and the Commonwealth offices is a valuable corner block which was sold to the Commonwealth Bank; but the land not required for postal purposes could not be transferred to the Commonwealth Bank unless a certificate was given to the effect that it was not needed for any further public purpose. Such a certificate could not be given, however, because the Commonwealth Bank is a quasi-public institution. It is unnecessary for the entertain such fears as he has expressed.

164,Mr Lyons (Wilmot,"Prime MinisterThis is a time when governments, political parties, employers, employees and all other interests concerned should realize that only by co-operation and compromise can the problem of unemployment be solved. Honourable members, no matter to what party they belong, should approach this matter free from political bias so that the House, in its collective wisdom, may evolve proposals of value to be referred for consideration to the Premiers Conference, that is shortly to meet to deliberate upon the subject. I several suggestions and proposals on behalf of the Country party. We contend definitely that' wholesale dismissals will not effect national economy. Rather must we as a parliament and a nation provide wholesale employment in reproductive avenues where labour can be used economically and profitably, and endeavour to increase the exportable production of the country. I shall outline briefly two or three sugconsidered on its merits, free from party gestions which are based upon vital principles. I believe that we could relieve unemployment in Australia by using a portion of tbe unemployment relief taxation that is collected by the States, and adding to it a contribution by the Commonwealth. Particularly, by assisting them financially, and by removing harassing legislative restrictions should we encourage those engaged in our rural industries to employ a greater amount of labour. be a spirit of compromise throughout, from the Government right' down and between employer and employee. The Country party contend that asover four-fifths of the total employment in Australia is provided by private enterprise, we must look to it to absorb our workers. It is only by assisting private enterprise that we can hope to achieve that end. By devoting to this purpose a portion of the unemployed relief taxation that is collected by the various States, plus a contribution by the Commonwealth Government, we could place our workless back into industries where their labour would be reproductive, and so overcome many of the economic difficulties that now confront us. Advances would be made to settlers who are engaged in primary production, to Mr Thorby. enable them to carry out a series of developmental and reproductive works. I u order that the greatest amount of encouragement may be given, to such people, it would be desirable to remove -many of the legislative restrictions that are placed upon those engaged in rural industries. We all know that many primary producers refrain from employing outside labour because of those restrictions, so that production is either diminished, or the maximum result is not obtained from their holdings. It may be take the opportunity to make necessary for our governments to agree temporarily to suspend the operation of legislation such as the Hut Accommodation Act, the Workers Compensation Act, the Child Endowment Taxation Act and the rural workers' award. That suggestion is not animated by political bias. This is a time when all parties should realize the seriousness of the country's position, aud do whatever may be possible to surmount our difficulties. Any proposal put forward should, therefore, be bias. The authorities who made these advances would automatically afford protection to every man engaged in these national relief schemes, just as is now done in. industries under the Workers Compensation Act: but as this would not be an obligation upon the employer, he would be relieved ""of the harassing conditions imposed by much of our existing legislation although the interests of the There should workers would be as fully protected as they are at present. I know that the operation of those acts now deters many people from making temporary employment available. If adopted, my suggestion would simplify and stimulate the engagement of labour in rural industries. It would also encourage the activities of private enterprise without in any way creating a new government department, or even increasing existing staffs. Persons desiring an advance would make application through specified departments in the State concerned. The advances could be for periods ranging from two to five years, and should be absolutely free of interest. I suggest that the advances should range over periods of from two to five years, because some activities produce results more quickly than others. The vital point is that producers would not be increasing their interest bill, ueither would the Commonwealth nor the States be increasing their loan debt or annual interest commitments. primary producer, being responsible for the repayment of the amount advanced, would naturally see that the money was expended to the best advantage. Another important point is that all repayments would go back into the central fund, to be re-issued. would be ever-circulating and ever-growing, and it would give a stimulus to developmental works. I suggest that, among other things, advances could be made for fallowing or pasture improvements, and the destruction of noxious weeds and animals. I mention those items first, because, although they are improvements of a temporary nature, they go a long way towards increasing the productivity of a property. Permanent improvements would include clearing, fencing, scrub-cutting, sucker ing, the destruction of noxious weeds and animals, the erection of dog-proof and rabbit-proof fences, the construction of dams, wells, bores-eithe r sub-artesian or required to give any security for these artesian-underground tanks, silos, hay sheds, cow sheds, bails, and any other class of improvement of a reproductive nature. works typical of those which could be undertaken in country districts, the majority by unskilled labour. Among other works that.could be carried out with advantage to the community generally are the reclamation and drainage of swamp areas, the planting of permanent pastures, grading for irrigation, and the construction of channels for tens of thousands of men who are unemdrainage and irrigation purposes. Unskilled labour would be absorbed on these works which would yield to the country the greatest and quickest return. The Government should also consider the need for revising the tariff downwards, in order to cheapen the cost of secondary, products. The works I have mentioned will necessitate the use of quantities of galvanized iron, wire, wire netting, cement, timber, and fertilizers; all Austhe honourable member for Calare( Mr tralian products. The extra demand for .these commodities would increase employment in secondary industries. The suppliers and transport authorities [43] should be asked for concessions, so that the goods he needs may reach the farmer at. as near cost price as is practicable. By this policy we would be The giving the maximum assistance and impetus to the primary industries, which produce the whole of our exportable commodities, and would be providing increased employment under the least onerous conditions. We suggest further that advances be made by loan or grant to shire councils, and other local governThe fund ing bodies, so that they might undertake works in country towns, including water supplies, sewerage schemes, electric supply extensions, and the construction of roads of access to assist production. All these works could be undertaken out of relief funds; they would not involve any increase of our loan indebtedness or the interest commitments of the country or individuals. They would relieve the burden on government exchequers by reducing the demand for food relief, increase the spending power of the workers engaged, and gradually lead the country back on the road to economic recovery. advances? loans and mortgages would not be interI have mentioned only a few fered with, the borrower would be required only to acknowledge receipt of the money, and give an undertaking .to repay it. That system is already in operation in New South Wales very successfully. If the policy I have outlined is put in operation it will probably assist more than anything else to increase primary production aud will give work for ployed at the present time. Owing to the short space of time available to me, I am not able to explain fully these proposals of the Country party, but they will be amplified in a communication to the Prime Minister. employment is the most serious problem confronting Australian Parliaments, and, indeed, the whole world, and I agree with Thorby) that we should brush party differences aside in order to attempt to solve it.

Candidates of the United Australia party were twitted hy the Opposition with having made promises to the unemployed during the election campaign, and not attempting to carry them out. That charge does not lie against me, for I made no promise other than to give a fair deal to. all sections. The unemployed have my sympathy. much support from the honourable member and his colleagues as they have from me their position would be much better than it is to-day. For the last three years I have housed rent free between 50 and 60 unemployed. In normal times the Governments of Australia employ only about one-sixth of the working community; the other five-sixths are dependent for work upon private enterprise, which offers the only hope of increasing employment today. I suggest to the Prime Minister that when he meets the Premiers in conference .he should put before them the suggestions made by the honourable member for Calare, which include some that I bad intended to submit to the House. The sustenance of the unemployed is costing the various Australian £12,000,000 annually. Having lived for a long time amongst tbe unemployed, I have noticed that a man at first applies diffidently for relief; after six months he because the workless have no money with becomes more hardened; within twelve months he claims the dole as his right; and if he continues to draw it much longer he concludes that there is no need to work. He cannot be blamed for that attitude, when each morning he rises to face an absolutely blank future. We on this side of the House are prepared to do all in our power to relieve the unemployed. 1 suggest that we call a conference of eminent men, not politicians, representative of each State, to discuss and to put into effect the scheme that I am submitting to the Hou3e. At present £12.000,000 a year is being spent in doles. The dole system is degrading to our people. They want work, and not charity. I suggest that instead of expending the whole of that amount in doles, £4,000,000 be used as a loan to private enterprise to enable men to be employed in both primary and secondary industries The arbitration awards could be suspended temporarily, to enable a uniform wage to be paid throughout Australia. become permanent. of low wages. I have been one of the largest individual employers in South Australia, and have always paid the highest wages ruling in that State.

If the wage were on the basis of the minimum wage in South Australia to-day, this expenditure would provide employment for 52,000 men for twelve months. This suggestion is well worthy of the consideration of the Premiers Conference. We have been asked to make suggestions for the relief of unemployment. If 50,000 men were given employment, they would, in turn, provide work for other men. It is reasonable to suppose that men who have been out of employment for twelve months or two years would expend at least half of their wages for the first month or so on clothing, and that would provide employment in the retail shops and the governments approximately clothing factories. It would set the wheels of industry moving. The same remark applies to boots. The landlord has suffered most of all from the depression, which to pay rent. Houses are badly in need of repairs, and if the rents were paid men in the building trade would be given employment. I know from experience that thousands of pounds could be expended on the renovation of buildings. If 50,000 men were given employment within the next twelve months, that would, in turn, give employment to 75,000, and probably 100,000 others. It has been said that if more men were employed in primary production we should have no market for our goods. I disagree with that contention. A year or two ago we had large quantities of dried fruits unsold, but to-day all stocks have been disposed of. We have a good market for our wheat and wool, and we can find markets for all our primary products. I trust",35,Adjournment Unemployment

171,Mr Stagey,"I am not in favourthat the Prime Minister will give consideration to my suggestion, and bring it before tbe Premiers Conference. [3.561 I agree with the last two speakers that we have not now sufficient time at our disposal to enter into a proper economic discussion of this problem; but I suggest that the Government should at the earliest moment turn this Parliament into an economic council for a week or two so that we could discuss the problem of unemployment in a non-party atmosphere. I join with other honourable members in asking the Government to treat this matter as urgent. object to the long-range plan suggested by the Country party; but it is almost like lashing the backs of the unemployed to ask for further conferences, further economic discussions, and further meetings of unemployed secretariats to discuss this problem, when there are many hundreds of thousands of breadwinners actually starving, and in need of immediate relief. If we mean business we must at once set to work to place a large number of our workless men in employment. Surely the Commonwealth Statistician has, during the last three years, collected sufficient inforof the community, the unemployed figures mation to enable the Government to decide upon an effective. policy for the relief of unemployment. The honourable member for Calare( Mr Thorby) spoke of the difficulties of the primary producers, and mentioned what they could do to relieve unemployment if they were assisted by the Government, and certain restrictions were removed. But I would point out to the honourable member that .the work that he suggests should be put in hand is generally carried out by contract labour or piece-work, and that, therefore, no responsibility would be placed on the actual' farmer or the employer concerned. While I agree with a good deal of what the honourable member has suggested, that class of work would -not employ much labour in comparison with the number of persons out of work. The contention of the Government supporters is that this problem of unemployment must be solved by encouraging -private enterprise. I admit that private enterprise is the largest employer in this and almost every other country. We all agree that private enterprise is anxious to employ labour, but why has it not done so during the last two or three years? The Commonwealth Statistician has this week published figures showing that tie cost of living has, during the last twelve months, fallen by 11 per cent., the cost of material by 15 per cent., and the rate of interest by from 12£ per cent, to 15 per cent., yet during that period of reduced wages and costs, the unemploymentfigureshave more than doubled. When we began to discuss this problem two and a half years ago, the unemployment figures were menacing, but we did not dream that the position I do not would become worse. The percentage at that time was 11.5; to-day it is 28.30. That is the average percentage ot"" unemployment among the organized workers of Australia. That increase of unemployment has to some extent been due to the Commonwealth Government's policy of reducing costs, yet we hear persons saying to-day that if we could only reduce further the cost of production ail would be well with Australia. With every reduction in the cost of pro : duction there is a further reduction in the wages paid in industry, but because of the restriction in the purchasing power go up by leaps and bounds. We cannot close our eyes to these facts. Private enterprise, as I have said, is anxious to employ labour. No employer in this country would decline to give employment if he could employ men at a profit, and the only way to restore the needed confidence in industry is to ensure a satisfactory demand for the goods produced by the services rendered. Employers everywhere are anxiously waiting to give employment. Huge sums have been spent on the installation of modern and efficient industrial plants which, because of the lack of demand for goo'ds are lying idle for a great part of each working week, or even rusting in complete disuse. Therefore, unless we can give to private enterprise some impetus by the creation of a wage fund which will lead to an increased demand for goods and services, private enterprise cannot be expected to provide much relief for our workless people. I appeal to the Government to give serious attention to this aspect of the problem.",36,Adjournment Unemployment
172,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"I believe that tbe Ministry, having in mind the experience of the last two or three years, will consider it to. be its duty to take steps to put a stop to the deadly system of deflation, which is destroying confidence in the business community. I hope that the Government will give favorable consideration to the proposal for the creation of a fund by the Commonwealth Bank, which will give temporary employment to 50,000, 60,000 or perhaps 100,000 workmen, as a first step towards the rehabilitation of industry in this"" country. With nearly 500,000 people out of work, it was only to be expected that the market for the output of industry would be restricted to an extraordinary extent. Primary producers, and persons engaged in many avenues of business, are more or less in a condition of insolvency, because they cannot sell their commodities in sufficient volume to ensure a reasonable profit. The only thing to be done is for the Government to call immediately upon the Commonwealth Bank to provide a release of credit, and in this way give the necessary impetus to private enterprise. In normal times, when there is competition for labour, I would not offer this sugenterprisegestion, but we are not now living in normal times. On the contrary, we are passing through an abnormal period of great adversity. figures do not represent the annual winter period of unemployment. I am afraid to think what may happen during the next three months. I know, perhaps more than any other honourable member of this Parliament, how severely the workers of this country are suffering, because, for over twenty years now, I have had my finger on the pulse of the industrial movement, arfid I know how the workless fear the approaching winter. situation constitutes the greatest menace that has confronted the Commonwealth within my knowledge. Every one who has studied it must realize that the present great volume of unemployment might easily lead to insurrection, communism, and rebellious outbreaks. The Government cannot, with safety, allow the situation to develop. It must take some steps to remove this threatening problem. I hate to think what will happen during the coming winter unless the Government rises to the occasion. Any further Mr Holloicay. attempt to take from the wages of the workers will further reduce their spending power, and, to that extent, still further limit the market for goods produced for services rendered. I , therefore, make this last appeal to the Government. I do not care what Government gets credit for it, but I hope that the present Ministry will do the one thing which, in my opinion, will relieve tffi situation. Knowing something of the economic and industrial history of the Commoai wealth, I am convinced that before we can expect an improvement, the Government must give an impetus to private industry by creating a wage-fund in the way I have suggested, and so widen the market for the output of industry. Surely it is obvious to all that shopkeej>ers, manufacturers and primary producers throughout Australia are waiting anxiously to give employment to people who are clamouring for it. I have in my hand the report of the Director of the International Labour Conference held at Geneva last year. This is what he has to say concerning the economic and industrial outlook, with special reference to the expenditure on public works as a stimulus to private Here the virtue of this policy of public works is clearly revealed. As has been well demonstrated by Mr Keynes, it acts not merely The present unemployment as a palliative, but as a positive remedy. Extensive schemes for works of public interest, by helping in some measure to raise prices and increasing the demand for material, stimulate activity generally ana produce a psychological reaction that is far from negligible in economic fluctuations. diture on public works should befinanced? the artificial curtailment of credit, and The existing goes on to say that the only hope is to make the credit machinery more responsive so as to fit in with the demands of industry. This is not the advice of an irresponsible advocate of wild inflation, but of an acknowledged economist. The events of the next few months will show us whether or not this or any other Government can evolve means -of solving our present economic problems. A check to the present policy of deflation would, I believe, be followed by a steady rise in commodity prices, and establish a feeling of confidence in the business community which will lead to an increase in employ-",37,Adjournment Unemployment

Wc must realize that the future prosperity of this country depends absolutely upon the development of her primary industries. Of course, we need certain secondary industries and are prepared to make some sacrifice to set them going; but we must make it possible for primary industries to be developed. Qnly to-day I have received letters from nearly every roads board in Western Australia, directing attention to the extensive ravages of the rabbit pest, and demanding that the dumping duty on wire netting and the duties on poisons, rabbit traps, and other requirements for combating the pest, shall be abolished to enable effective action to be taken to overcome the trouble. We know very well that the price of rabbit-proof fencing and poison for the destruction of pests is fully three times what it should be in this country. I do not think that we would have great difficulty in obtaining money for definitely reproductive works; but the trouble is to find works of that description. Can any honourable member indicate at this moment a public work that could be put in hand which would be reproductive immediately on its completion? Possibly, the proposal for the bulk handling of wheat enunciated by the Western Australian Minister for Works, would be reproductive.. The scheme propounded by that honourable gentleman will be much less expensive than that adopted by tlie New South. Wales Government, and might, upon thorough investigation, be found to be worthwhile. Apart from that project, I do not know of one which is sufficiently promising to justify us approaching the banks for a loan. We mustrealize that it is useless for us to throw our money into the gutter, and equally useless for us to cart sand from one place to another and then cart it back again. I agree with the honourable member for Calare, also, that nothing has such a detrimental effect upon a man as to be but of work for a long time, but the unemployment of our adult population is only a part of our problem. It is essential that we shall do something to proare ready to take up work every year. It might be possible to obtain money to establish some of these young people in productive primary occupations, but to place them on the land without first reducing costs would be scandalous. No one will deny that if primary production were to cease suddenly in Australia, our secondary industries would not be able to carry on for 24 hours. The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson) was recently asked 6s. 6d. for a hoe which he had previously bought for 2s. 9d. The stupid restrictions which this Parliament has placed upon the importation of tools of trade, and implements for primary production, have contributed to a great extent to bring Australia into her present position. I hope that action will be taken speedily to grant substantial relief from the existing tariff surcharges and prohibitions. The Government should take steps to see that every section of the community makes some sacrifice for the common good, and particularly to help in reducing the cost of production in this ""country. listened attentively to the speeches that were delivered to-day and last.week, and believe that the only honourable member who has approached the real solution of this problem is the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway).

I have no brief for private enterprise. It has served its purpose, and has outlived its usefulness. It is time that the governments and the people of this and other countries understood that the problem of unemployment .will be solved only by a complete recon-' struction of the social order, under which there would be production for use and not for profit. Wherever private enterprise has held sway, there has always been unemployment; but notice is taken of it only when it reaches such alarming proportions as to give rise to the fear that the unemployed may revolt and destroy the existing form of government. In what are regarded as the better years, when the number of unemployed was comparatively few, and could be handled, no consideration was extended to them. It was not during what is now termed the period of depression I was looking for employment. I was one of the unfortunate few who had that experience in what was considered to be a prosperous era, when the different governments balanced their budgets oxdeclared surpluses. That was not a prosperous era for me. Children were in want, aud many persons died in our hospitals from mal-nutrition. It may be claimed that pneumonia, or some other complaint, was the cause of a number of those deaths; but the fact cannot be disguised that the combative powers of thousands of people are so impaired by semi-starvationthat they fall easy victims to what in ordinary circumstances would be nothing more than a slight indisposition, which they would be able to throw of f . Since 1925, when the scheme for the rationalization of industry was inaugurated with a view to reducing the costs of production, production has increased, despite the fact that the human element has been a consistently decreasing factor in industry. During the period from 1925 to 1929, industrial production increased in Prance by 30 per cent., in Germany by 22 per cent., in the United Kingdom by 13 per cent., in Canada by 54 per cent., in the United States of zVmerica by 14 per cent., and in Russia by 123 per cent. withstanding the fact that, as a result of Mr Ward. the improvement of machinery, and of the means of production generally, fewer men are required in industry, and that the output has been increased to an untold extent, the workers throughout the world are sinking lower and lower into poverty and degradation. Were they able to repurchase all they produce that' would be the end of our present social order, and the destruction of what is known tp-day as private enterprise. While those who produce the goods are not able to purchase all that they are"" able to produce, there will be a surplus, and unemployment to a greater or less extent. It is useless to attempt to disguise that fact. You may have your Premiers conferences, and your meetings of economic councils. Of what use will they be unless the real issue be faced and the understanding arrived at that the existing social order cannot be patched up so as to provide work for all who need it? There must be a complete reconstruction of the social order, under which there will be production for use and not for profit. I can suggest to honourable members many avenues in which the unemployed might be engaged on work of a national character in this countiy, work that is necessary, but which private enterprise is not rushing in to undertake, because it is not profitable. Does private enterprise show any anxiety to do what is necessary for those who are in want or who are ailing i Does every person who needs medical attention receive it? It is admitted that governments should control such undertakings as the provision of postal services, because private enterprise does not consider that work to be profitable; yet, where private employers can exploit the workers they are prepared to do it. If cheap labour were the royal road to prosperity, India and China would be among the most prosperous of the nations; but their position is even worse to-day than that of Australia. Although honourable members opposite talk of the necessity for reducing the cost of production, I claim that the main requirements to-day is markets in which we can dispose of what we produce. The monetary system of the Uuited States of NotAmerica is r-apable of providing all the credit required to make work available for the unemployed in that country, yet its people are suffering from the same complaint as those in Australia. only to the period from 1925 to 1929.

The world-wide nature of the present depression must be recognized. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) attributes it to overproduction, aud another honourable member has declared that it is clue to underconsumption. There are cycles of depression, and, in my opinion, governments, like business men, should set aside reserves in prosperous years to act as a balance wheel to carry thorn over difficult periods, so. that the people might be kept in continuous employment. But governments find it difficult to resist the claims made upon the public purse, and politicians who are not statesmen spend public money which ought to be placed in reserve to meet difficult times such as are now being experienced. Thousands of businesses would have been insolvent by now if their directors had not built up reserves. In a period of depression, the Government should not resort to taxation to maintain the same expensive governmental machine as it might justifiably keep going in times of prosperity. is twice what is paid iu New Zealand. that the Commonwealth has gone over the peak in the matter of taxation. The result has been a fall in revenue and greater unemployment. If thousands of businesses are taxed out of existence because it is no longer profitable to employ labour, it means an increase in the number of unemployed. Honourable members elected from all parts of this vast Commonwealth may have many suggestions which the Government can work into a mosaic that should prove helpful. I have two suggestions. There are many here to-day who remember how the Victorian Government dealt with unemployment during the slump in the 'nineties. 1893 it established a labour colony at Leongatha, in Gippsland, under the auspices of the Charity Organization which is brought about in times of deSociety. report there and be paid for the work age of 21, and become entitled to the he performed. He received part of hi3 basic wage. Obviously a wage which is pay in cash. The balance was banked for supposed to be sufficient to maintain a Mr White. him Over 500 men a week went through the depot. The farm was completely self-contained. Mixed and general farming, pig raising, dairying and fruit farming were carried on. Some years later 260 acres were producing oats, onions, wheat and potatoes, and there were 21 acres of garden and orchard. The remaining acres were cleared for grass, the timber being dead. Eighty cows were being milked and the cream marketed. In one year the return from 51 cows was £493. That labour colony, which continued up to the time of the South African ""War, when unemployment practically disappeared in Victoria, actually showed a profit. The property was ultimately subdivided into three excellent farms, which are being worked by soldier settlers. We might well profit by the experience at Leongatha. Although land settlement is a matter which is dealt with by the States, v/e have a large number of unemployed in Canberra. Rather than remain idle, the majority of them, I am sure, would prefer to be tilling the ground and providing a little towards their sustenance, so that when ultimately they secure employment they may have a little capital behind them. The Commonwealth Government could easily make a piece of Already our income tax land available to these men, and, by getting them employed and satisfied with I think I can safely say their conditions, set an example to the States. At Broadmeadows, in Victoria, there is a camp of 400 or 500 unemployed almost within a stone's throw of a number of farms. It would be better to have those men employed on the lines of the Leongatha settlement, or on adjacent farms by a system of subsidized labour. That question is dealt with in a report by the Victorian representative on the Secretariat Committee presided over by Mr Gunn, which submitted recommendations to the Premiers Conference. Such a scheme worked in conjunction with that which has been proposed by the honourable member for Calare, would undoubtedly be beneficial to thousands who to-day are In unemployed. We all know how tragic is the position 7 Any unemployed man could pression when youths or girls reach the man with a wife and two children, and may be adequate for a man with a large family, cannot, in times like the present, be paid to such youths and girls. Consequently the bulk of them are dismissed when they reach the age of 21. Thousands of dismissed apprentices are tramping the countryside at the present time. It would be better if the basic wage pro£12,000,000 worth of fuel. The proposivisions of industrial awards did not operate until the worker reached the age of 23 or 25. Proper safeguards, of course, would have to be made in the case of married workers. Instead of a general reduction of the basic wage, the alteration at the other end I have suggested, might be considered by the Arbitration Court. It would keep thousands in employment. At the same time the frills of arbitration awards might be laid aside. A condition which prescribes that time and a half must be paid to a man who works for two days or less, a feature of many arbitration awards, keeps numbers of shop assistants out of work. The bulk of extraneous payments in the Public Service should be wiped out. We are told that they absorb nearly half a million pounds a year, particularly in paying waiting time and higher duties. justified in times of prosperity should not be tolerated in a time of depression. Our sales taxation might be administered more economically. on that the sales tax should be collected on turnover. That method would, I believe, bring in the same amount of revenue. At the same time, the cost of collection would be considerably reduced. Briefly my suggestions are: the establishment of labour colonies, the abolition of the right to the basic wage at the age of 21 during a time of depression, and subsidized labour for assistance to farmers. These suggestions, together with others to be put forward, might help towards the drawing up of a plan to alleviate the unfortunate position of a great number of people in Australia today, worthy citizens, who are unemployed through no fault of their own, but because it is unprofitable for others to engage their services. support the proposal put forward by the honourable member for Calare( Mr contribution from the unemployed relief Thorby), and I greatly regret that he had not sufficient time within which to elaborate his ideas. The payment of doles, I understand, costs Australia something over £12,000,000 a year. The community is like a man who possesses a huge engine, from which he gets no return, although he' supplies it with tion submitted by the honourable member -for Calare is in effect that money which does not now return even 1 per cent, should be used in another fashion, iu which case it would show a very good return. The idle power of the engine should be applied in the direction the honourable member suggests. I do not know if honourable members generally are fully seized of the importance and the practicable nature of the proposition. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) will, doubtless, think that it would take a long time to bring it into operation, but a similar scheme is already being successfully conducted in one of the States. If only a portion of the £12,000,000 now being spent in paying the dole were used in providing actual employment, helping men to retain their respectability These extras, which may be instead of becoming, paupers, the quantity of produce available for export would immediately increase, and additional labour would be required, not only I have in the country, but in the cities as well. the notice-paper a suggestion Surely such' a proposal will commend itself to every honourable member in this chamber. The honourable member for Calare states thatThe advantages of such a proposal are numerous. It would encourage the production of exportable products and the expansion of private enterprise. It does not create or extend government departments. It does not increase the annual interest bill of the producer, and makes no demand for repayment for two years, by which time returns will have resulted from the expenditure. No sacrifice would have to be made by the Government in providing the money without interest, and even if repayments are not to be made for two years it would be infinitely better than spend ing £12,000,000 annually in a manner which does not produce an asset of any kind.

It immediately reduces the demands upon governments to provide food relief, and increases the purchaspleased because the right honourable the ing power of those unemployed. In the second year the scheme would tend to develop permanent employment in the rural districts, and would increase revenues while tending to increase production. As each producer borrowing under the scheme would be responsible for the repayment he would naturally see that he spent the money in a way that would secure the best return for the expenditure. It.would be a self-supporting scheme. By employing the "" engine "" in some useful way we could provide employment instead of impoverishing the nation. A large number of those now out of employment would have some practical work on which to be engaged instead of existing on the dole, which naturally leads to physical and moral degeneration. Some members of the previous Government claim to possess intelligence, but for every four minutes in which that Government was in office, one man in the community lost his job. Surely that proves that the policy which they supported was impracticable. The application of the policy submitted by the honourable member for Calare would soon prove of great benefit to the Commonwealth. The honourable ^member for Melbourne Ports referred, and properly too, to the fact that the products of our primary and secondary industries .cannot now be profitably disposed of, because the people have no money with which to buy them. The financial position of most of those who are settled on the land is so precarious that they have not sufficient funds with which to develop their properties. Many holdings are going back, because of the ravages of vermin and the rapidity with which noxious weeds are spreading. Scrub shoots are growing, and in the absence of money, it is impossible for settlers to keep their properties in a productive state. The scheme which the honourable member for Calare outlined, provides a way out of the difficulty. should commend itself to honourable members and to the representatives of the States who are to attend the conference of Premiers shortly to be held. tening to the debate last week, and to-day, on our greatest national problem, I rise express my views on the subject. I am Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), and one or two of his colleagues, have shown that they are prepared to assist the Government in its solution. They have shown a sincere desire to help those unfortunate persons who are at present out of work. On the other hand, I am exceedingly disappointed to find that in the useless, bitter, and provocative speeches delivered by some of our friends opposite, who have taken up more than their share of time, not one constructive word, phrase, or sentence has been uttered. This debate offers an opportunity for constructive criticism, and any honourable member having a practical suggestion to make should give the Government the benefit of his ideas. I believe that honourable members generally are sincere in their desire to see those at present unemployed back at work. I believe that they are sympathetic and humanitarian in their feelings towards the workless; but they should not claim a monopoly of those virtues. Honourable members on this side of the chamber are just as sympathetic, sincere and humanitarian towards the unemployed as they are. Last week the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) said that during the recent general election campaign I traversed the country promising jobs to every one. That is not the case. It is grossly untrue. I said that with a Labour gover-nment in power, both in the federal sphere and in New South Wales, and with ever-increasing unemployment, there was no hope whatever for the unfortunate people who had lost their jobs. I went on to point out that those men and women who felt insecure in the positions which they were holding could not hope for anything until there was a change of government. Throughout Australia the electors accepted that advice, with the result that the Government benches are'now ful l to overIt flowing, while there are only a few honourable members sitting in opposition. Evidently, the honourable member for West Sydney confused Mr Lang, the Premier of New South Wales, with myself, the representative of the Lang electorate in this Parliament. It",45,Government Members Force D Inbview To Maintaining Prices The Producers

They appear to forget that the head of the Government in New South Wales is the wonderful Mr Lang. The greatest privation exists iu the State of which*he is the chief citizen. The first duty of the Government is to explore all avenues which might lead to a solution of the problem of unemployment; and I believe that it recognizes that duty. Having explored those avenues, the Government will, I feel confident, rise to the occasion, livelihood. The amount of capital required and follow the course which it believes will be most productive of employment. This debate offers honourable members an opportunity to offer constructive criticism. We want to hear, not' about conditions in Russia, but about what can be done to improve conditions in Australia. member give us some constructive criticism ? that other honourable members will endeavour to place before the House suggestions worthy of consideration at the forthcoming conference of Premiers. I should not have risen had I not felt that I could offer some helpful suggestions. In my opinion, the first step towards the solution of the problem of unemployment is to set in motion a scheme which will provide the means whereby the unemployed can be absorbed in the ordinary productive life of the community. I believe that the quickest and most effective, as well as the most permanent, means of solving the problem is to develop a real system of land settlement. The old idea that land settlement should proceed mainly on the basis of living areas must, in my opinion, be somewhat qualified, in order that we may provide for a new type of settlement, which will give the unemployed men and their families, as well as others who seek to establish themselves in small homes, holdings which, while perhaps insufficient for the full maintenance of the family, will, to a great extent, meet their requirements, and enable them to produce something for sale. I i may, of course, be necessary to seek other employment during off periods. Por this purpose suitable Crown lands without any payment, in the way of rent or otherwise, being required for, say, five years, provided that substantial improvements are effected during that period. In addition to Crown lands, suitable private lands should be acquiredcompulsorily if necessary. There are millions of acres of good land along our river frontages which is not put to its best productive use. That land would be most suitable for subdivision into areas sufficient, or nearly sufficient, to provide numbers of unemployed families with a would be small; not all of it would be needed immediately. In time, the money invested would be repaid. In order to ensure the success of such a scheme, the co-operation of shire councils and municipal councils should be invoked, because such bodies could provide employment for settlers in the off periods at road-making and in other ways. If such a scheme were started, I feel certain that many practical men would be only too willing to cooperate in order to'ensure its success. TheI shall do so, and I hope successful inauguration of such a scheme would necessitate the temporary continuance of the dole, in order to provide sustenance for the -settlers until such time as they were able to provide for themselves. Land settlement along these lines would do more than find employment for the workless; it would increase the productive wealth of the community. The two things would go hand in hand. When the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) was speaking, an honourable member inquired by interjection why men were denied the right to work. I have here a communication which shows that in New South Wales men are denied the right to work. The letter readsState Contracts Control Board, Harrington and Essex Streets, Sydney. 23rd February, 1932. Messrs. Australian Pigment and Asbestos Company Limited, Botany-road, Waterloo.

WereI so disposed, I could indulge in a caustic criticism of the Government's attitude towards the pressing problem of unemployment.

During the election campaign, that party spared neither, pains uor money to convince the electors that only by a change of government could work be found for the workless. vertisement which appeared in the Adelaide press, which said, "" A vote for Lyons is a vote for work"".

Harrison) would do well to apply his mind to the formulation of helpful suggestions for consideration by the Premiers Conference which is to be held within the next few weeks. I do not regard the suggestion of the honourable member for Calare( Mr the £12,000.000 now being spent on the Thorby) as helpful, nor would his proposal, if accepted, solve even partially the problem of unemployment. Our difficulties have been accentuated by the reduced spending power of the community. When the workers have not the money with which to buy what is produced, there is necessarily a glut on the market. One of the most serious aspects of the problem, which seems to have been overlooked by most statesmen and economists, is the displacement of workers by the application to industry of science and improved machinery. Houorable members opposite would do well to read some of the works on this subject to be found in our own library, particularly one by submit my suggestion to the an economist of repute named Henderson. In that work it is shown what a serious effect labour-saving devices have had upon employment. There must be a worldwide re-adjustment to meet these conditions. The problem cannot be solved by reducing the living standard of the workers, or by removing those safeguards which have been built up over a long period of years. The workers cannot be left at the mercy of those whose interest it may be to exploit them. I am 'confident that in tbe cities, and in country centres throughout Australia, there is work to be done which is only held up through lack of money. The Commonwealth Bank should be approached by the representatives of the States and the Commonwealth, and asked to make money available for reproductive I have before me an adwork which would provide a sinking fund and interest on the money spent. urgently required in South Australia is a supplementary water scheme for Adelaide.

But no section must be left to suffer hardship. Afforestation is another profitable activity upon which the unemployed could be engaged, especially with a view to the future supply of soft timber. We have been at fault in failing to make adequate provision in this respect. Up to the present we have been taking what we want from the forest,, but we have been do a great deal to ameliorate the evils of putting nothing back.

The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) suggested that we should congregate our unemployed in industrial colonies. I should prefer to see some of our rich estates broken up to get people into rural pursuits. Many in country centres, reasonably adjacent to Adelaide, could be profitably used. However, I am afraid there is not much prospect of that coming to pass just yet. Our State Governments must recognize that not only is it necessary for them to institute an adequate programme of public works; they must also open up suitable lands on which to place our people. Governments have sent men to the Mallee, or away to the distant north, to work land that was quite unsuited for the purpose. tually have given up in despair. If on the land, let it be on the best country available; let them begin under the most favorable conditions. These are practical proposals for the Premiers to consider. able member has exhausted his time. [5.22] I can at least compliment honourable members who have spoken this afternoon on the tone of their utterances, I agree with him genuinely anxious to evolve some solution of this problem. I listened with a great deal of interest, in fact, with rapt attention, to the discussion on unemployment, a social disorder which touches indirectly or directly every citizen of the Commonwealth, and is afflicting some 20,000,000 to 30,000,000 persons throughout the world. The fact that this menace to our social life is so present to almost every citizen of this country gives one a vivid idea of the magnitude of the problem and the difficulties with which it3 solution is beset. While individual governments might unemployment, its permanent mitigation can be brought about only as a result of the united endeavour and common policy of all governments, each accepting to the Surely the resources of ful l the obligations that that policy places upon them. Another vital essential to the solution of the problem is the whole-hearted support of the people to Last Friday the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) spoke upon this subject with admirable restraint, as one who has had experience of the many difficulties of tbe situation. The right honourable gentleman referred to the fact that his Government had made available for unemployment relief some £2,500,000, and he indicated that it would be proper for this Government to follow a similar course. The right honourable gentleman must admit, upon reflection, that the making available of such a sum cannot in itself be regarded as a real contribution towards the permanent relief of unemployment. It is merely a palliative, which may effect a small temporary decrease in unemployment. I say emphatically that the indiscriminate Heartbroken, they evenscattering of largess among the people can never achieve any permanent useful our people are to be placed result.

202,Mr John Lawson (Macquarie),"the Government should make available money to be expended on public works. Admittedly, that would give a stimulus to industry, but only in a restricted sphere. All fair-minded people will acknowledge that it would touch only the fringe of the problem, and would, in all probability, have the effect of diverting credits from private enterprise into governmental activities, so depriving private enterprise of the funds necessary for carrying on business. In this connection, it is worthwhile to remember the statement that was made by the Prime Minister on this subject last Friday, to the effect that the banks were now being called upon to provide more money to finance government deficits than they had to advance some three years ago for public works. That hits the nail on the head, and indicates how utterly impossible it is, at a time like this, for governnize that the honourable member for ments to make Aery substantial pror vision for public works. It is obvious that the duty of this Government is first of all to balance its budget, and to insist that every State in the Commonwealth shall do likewise. The failure of any one State to make a genuine effort to balance its budget must make (the recovery of prosperity in the Commonwealth impossible. unemployed? able members not to rush me too fast at my hurdles. If in due course I fail to deal with what they have in mind I shall be quite prepared to answer interjections. While I would support the subsidizing of private industries of specified character, I admit candidly that I have no faith whatever in the average so-called schemes of unemployment relief work. They have been tried everywhere, and have never yet accomplished anything useful. If the disasters of the last two years, and the adversity with which we are now faced, has any lesson to convey, it is that we must cast aside false standards, and cease worshipping at the altar of economic fallacies. Eveni f we cannot learn to love economic principles, we should at least learn to respect them. It is only in that way that, we can hope to bring industry back to a reasonable state of prosperity. In"" short, we should remould the whole of our industrial life along lines which conform to the accepted canons of economics. The suggestion has been made that the Government should undertake land settlement schemes. One member of the Opposition proposed that the Government should attempt to settle 10,000 men on the land. What on earth is the use of attempting to settle untrained and inexperienced men and women on the land when rural industry is not paying dividends even to those who understand it? Undoubtedly, we want more people on the land, but the proper way to effect that is to make rural industry profitable. If that were done, capital would flow into it, more land would be taken up, money would be available for improvements, and employment would increase. I recogCalare( Mr Thorby) had but a little time to expound the policy which he is submitting to the Government on behalf of the Country party; therefore, I suspend judgment on it, although I express my doubt of its practical usefulness over a long period. The honourable member proposes the lending of large sums of money to primary producers. WhilstI have no doubt that the Government would be able to find borrowers, I gravely question whether the money could be profitably employed, having regard to the enormous costs which rural industry has to bear, and the fact that very few men are able to malce it profitable at any cost. The honourable gentleman's scheme shows evidence of deep thought, however, and I shall await, with interest, his amplification of it. Secondary industry is in very much the same position as primary production. It cannot hope to increase the number of its employees until it can sell a greater quantity of goods, and that can be brought about only by reducing the wide gap between the prices of natural products and manufactured goods. All honourable members may not be aware that the average prices of the products of rural industry are 20 per cent, lower than they were in 1915, whilst the average prices of the products of secondary industries are actually 80 per cent, higher. This wide disparity, due to the extremely high price of manufactured goods, is making enormous inroads on",49,Government Members Force D Inbview To Maintaining Prices The Producers

204,Mr John Lawson,"I ask honorthe spending power of, not only the primary producers, but every section of the community. While it continues, we cannot have any real recovery of industry, and government-hatched schemes for the relief of unemployment will not substantially improve the situation. Governments should tackle the fundamentals of this problem. foolish to await the return of profitable prices for primary products. The nation must adjust itself to the lower prices by making every endeavour to reduce the costs of living and production iu order that the diminished national income may be spread over a wider field of industrial activity. This will involve drastic revision of the tariff, and a reduction of wage standards in order that they may conform to the lower cost of living which a reduced tariff will bring about. It will involve also a considerable reduction of interest charges on money lent by banks and other institutions to finance productive private enterprise. It will involve further drastic governmental economies, and a determined effort to reduce the load of taxation at present carried by industry. Another essential is that the Government shall, through its Minister in London, immediately take heed of the recommendations of the Macmillan Commission, and endeavour to discover what action is necessary to avoid those vagaries of currency standards which have had such a devastating effect on the prices of Australian primary products. It seems to me that we should endeavour to follow the advice given in that report, and endeavour to get down to fundamentals. There is an inclination to confuse the problem of unemployment in Australia with the world problems which have produced universal unemployment. I suggest that our problem is divisible into two portions-that which we can attack in Australia, and the wider aspect, which can be tackled by our representatives at the various conferences abroad. If we approach the problem in that way, we shall better realize its ramifications, and be able more effectively mentby having improvements carried to seek a solution of it. I have listened with great interest to the long-range suggestions made by tbe honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Luwson). He is right in saying that we [44] cannot expect a complete re-absorption of our unemployed until we are prepared to face economic facts, but to effect the changes which the honourable member has suggested, and which I believe to be desirable, would take time, and we have to act quickly. I rise to urge the Government to submit to Obviously, we shall be the Premiers Conference the practical proposals put before the House by the honourable member for Calare( Mr Thorby), which have been supported by practical critics like tbe honourable members for Adelaide( Mr Stacey), and Forrest( Mr Prowse), and others. The honourable member for Macquarie said that to use loan money for even productive purposes would be dangerous. But I do not know whether he appreciated the fact that the money which we suggest should be lent to the farmer free of interest is to be taken from the unemployed relief funds and that that will not impose any additional interest burden on the Government which advances it or the individual who -uses it. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) disparaged, private industry, which, he said, had failed. The fact remains that four-fifths of the total employment in Australia is provided by private enterprise, and naturally to it we must look for the reabsorption of our workless manhood. Undoubtedly a large number of landholders would be willing to employ men to effect improvements if the cost of them were not greater than their worth. If they could repay themselves in the added earning-power of their holdings by having those improvements done, many of them would employ men to carry out the work. If money could be provided free of interest over a term of years, as suggested by the honourable member for Calare-say , two to five years in accordance with the character of the work-that would give a tremendous encouragement and stimulus to landholders to provide employout, but it would be necessary to have many of the harassing restrictions on the employment of labour, which obtain to-day, set aside, and to allow the employer and the employee to make their own arrangements.",50,Government Members Force D Inbview To Maintaining Prices The Producers

There is much in the statement of the honourable member for Adelaide, that the fact of giving a man a job tends to provide a job for another man, just as the fact of a man being thrown out of employment tends to put others into the ranks df the unemployed. One feature of this scheme, which has been put forward on behalf of the Country party by the honourable member for Calare, and has much to commend it, is that it would be to the interests of employers who are carrying out improvements to see that the money is wisely spent, or spent in such a way as to render more productive the holdings on which they live. Eveni f some of the money were spent on tlie purchase of galvanized iron, sawn timber, and things of. that kind, one would find that ultimately the whole of the money had been expended on wages, because the wages of the men who manufactured the galvanized iron and sawed the timber in the mill would be provided out of this fund. I urge upon the .Minister in charge of the House the necessity for putting this suggestion before the Government, and bringing it under the notice of the conference which is to meet within the next few weeks. This Parliament has .not the machinery to put such a proposal into operation, but the State Governments have it, and it is only through that channel that we can give practical effect to this scheme. protest to the many made by those who sit on this side of the House, with regard by reason of the undue optimism of our statements to our constituents wi respect of the relief of unemployment. I do not think that any member of this party gained his seat by making any foolish promise or pledge on the subject. Even my principal opponent, Mr Lewis, the late member for Corio, had no complaints to make of me on that score, although we to he warned me that when we began to tackle the problem of unemployment we would find ourselves "" biting ou granite "", a picturesque description of the difficulty possibly not far from the truth. Personally, I think I treated the subject fairly. I did not attempt to saddle the responsibility on the late Government. I showed that the depression, which has brought unemployment in its train, has been caused by two things: First, the cessation of loan moneys from abroad, and, secondly, the catastrophic decline in the prices of our principal exports. We have been told, until we are tired of hearing it, that our national income has declined, approximately, from £650,000,000 to £450,000,000, and we also know how much unemployment has been caused by the lack of loan moneys for the construction of public works. The reasons for unemployment may be stated in this way: Employment directly depends upon production-the sum total of the industrial activities in this country-whic h in turn, depends directly on consumption, or the total purchasing power of the community. That again depends on the size of our national income. Our national income declined in a brief period by some £200,000,000. There are now in this country 300,000 or 400,000 men who are without work. About one-third of that number were previously employed on public works, and about two-thirds in private enterprise. In normal times about SO per cent, of the people, we are told, are employed in private enterprise. It was these facts which led the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), and those associated with him in the framing of the election policy of this party, to declare that the cure of unemployment, so far as we are able to effect it, would come",51,Government Members Force D Inbview To Maintaining Prices The Producers

Unemployment provides a problem that cannot be tackled by itself. solution, and the return of prosperity, are matters which are not, to any considerable extent in our own amount of loan money obtainable, and on the prices of our principal products in the world's markets. We can mitigate unemployment to some extent, and the Commonwealth and the States should do everything within their power to that end. I have listened with considerable interest and profit to what has been said by almost every section of this House this afternoon, and I propose to use what little time is at my disposal to look at the subject, from what might be called a purely federal point of view. There are two aspects from which it may be considered, the short range and the long range aspect. The short range aspect consists of the provision of moneys for the prosecution of public relief works, which, of course, must be sponsored by this Parliament; the long range aspectconcerns matters which 1 wish briefly to mention and which are particularly the responsibility of this Parliament. cial question, the provision of funds for the relief of unemployment. that the Commonwealth and the States have leaned on the Commonwealth Bank, and, through that institution, on the trading banks to the extent of something like £85,000,000 in treasury-bills and overdrafts, both in this country and in Great Britain. The magnitude of that figure must make lis pause before we enter upon any reckless extension of our unfunded debt. It has not, I think, yet resulted in any inflation of the currency or a great extension of credit, but that is solely due, I believe, to the existence of what may be regarded as a gentleman's agreement between the trading banks and the Commonwealth Bank to the effect that treasury-bills, once discounted by the trading banks, will not be presented for rediscounting to the Commonwealth Bank, at any rate for some time ahead. This means that although inflation has not existed, and is not existmore work for Australian hands to do. ing, we still have it hanging over our \A'>1 heads, because the time must come when the trading banks will be unable to carry the existing load of treasury-bills any longer, or, at all events, will be unwilling Its to accept any more. They will then present their bills for rediscounting to the Commonwealth Bank' which will be unable to refuse the request, and will have to hands. They depend on the provide credit which will eventually result in increased currency. that. Commonwealth Bank could resist the demand. wealth Parliament could pass banking legislation. crimkiatory legislation against the trading banks, because it would force them to hold a completely frozen asset instead of a temporarily frozen asset. One. of the principal considerations of the present Government should be the degree to which we can increase the floating debt with safety; that is, without creating a situation in which we defeat our own object. If we produce inflation by milking the Commonwealth Bank and the trading banks to too great an extent we increase There is, first, the finanthe cost of production within Australia. I think we must admit that there is We know a maximum, but as yet unknown, amount of treasury-bills which the Commonwealth Bank can accept in any given year, to be used for the meeting of deficits and for the provision of funds for public works, and it is obvious that the more we require to meet a deficit the less there is available for public works. That emphasizes the need for keeping our deficits within the smallest limit. This can be done by decreasing public expenditure and/or by increasing taxation, though both courses are for various reasons impracticable, and, in any event, would affect the situation only in a very small degree. The next matter of major consideration is the tariff. There are those who regard the tariff as the sole and only solution for most of our troubles, on the ground that the higher the customs wall, the fewer our imports, and, therefore, the One has not the time to pursue the effect",52,Government Members Force D Inbview To Maintaining Prices The Producers

216,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [6.0],"machines own the men or the men own the machines. We know very well that millions of workers have been displaced by the splendid inventive genius of other men. An old Greek philosopher said that we could not have civilization unless we had slaves or machines to do the work of the. world. The time has come when machinery is doing the world's work, and is displacing mankind. I propose to direct the attention of honourable members once again to the possibility of minting silver money to overcome our difficulties. During the life of the last Parliament, the Labour caucus, with the exception of one gentleman, Mr not hesitate to accept the latter. If the Theodore, agreed with my views on this subject. That gentleman admitted that he was a bimetallist, and I said, "" Thank God for small mercies "" ; but he was not willing to go as far as I desired him to go iu the application of the principle to our currency. Not many people realize that when the banking institutions of the world adopted the gold standard, they sentenced every third person in the world to poverty, misery and starvation. During the election campaign, which resulted in the return of the Scullin Government, a promise was made that, if Labour were returned to power, the coal-miners would be returned to work within a fortnight. I.tried to do what I could to help the coal-miners, and when I found that my efforts were in vain, 1 decided to devote myself to the assistance of the miners of silver. At that time the j>rice of silver had fallen to the lowest figure on record for more than a century. It was only Is. per oz. I pointed out that one ounce , of silver could be minted into 5s. 6d. worth of currency, which would show a profit of 4s. 6d. per oz., or 450 per cent. I urged the Government of the day to mint .£1,000,000 worth of silver into silver cointo the„value of £300,000,000. At that time age, which would have given us currency to the value of £5,500,000. I knew very -well that no working man or woman in Australia would refuse to accept silver as wages. But I could not get my proposal beyond Mr Theodore. I hope, however, that this Government will consider the matter seriously. Silver is now Is. 7d. per oz.. so that the profit on the minting of an ounce of silver would be only 247 per cent; but even that is a good profit. Por the sake of my argument, I shall revert to figures which I prepared when silver was Is. an oz. The Premier of Western Australia, Sir James Mitchell, and Mr Lang, are the only people, so far as I know, in positions of authority in governments, who have admitted the wisdom of my scheme. Sir James Mitchell said that he would be prepared to pay 2 per cent, interest on a loan made available iu silver currency, and Mr Lang has said that if he had the power to mint money, he would commence minting silver to-morrow. If Sir James Mitchell could make a choice between a loan in notes or credit at 6 per cent., and a loan in silver at 2 per cent, he would Commonwealth Government would mint £5,500,000 worth of silver coinage and lend it to the Western Australian Government at 2 per cent., it would show a profit of 11 per cent., but the profit would be only C per cent, on a loan in notes or credit. If silver money could be made available to municipalities, shire councils and other public bodies, they could undertake a great deal of necessary construction and maintenance work. Our councils, for instance, could undertake road maintenance and repairs. The Postmaster-General could also put useful work in hand if money were available at 2 per cent. Many of our post offices are a disgrace to us simply because they need renovation. I took a photograph of one post office, and, after a great deal of trouble, was able to get the previous Postmaster-General to agree to the painting of it. There is another way in which we could make substantial profits out of the coining of silver money. In 1920 the people of Great Britain were nervous about the result of issuing fiduciary notes silver was as dear as it has ever been, and Great Britain decided to coin silver which contained only 500 parts of silver per 1,000 parts. I hold a British silver coin which contains only that percentage of silver, the rest of it being alloy. Our silver coins contain 925 parts of silver per 1,000, and only 75 parts of alloy. It will be apparent to honourable members that if silver coins were minted with only 500 parts of silver, as against 925 parts, we could make available nearly twice the amount of' currency from the same amount of silver. I trust the Government will give earnest consideration to this proposal. The soundness of this scheme has never been challenged by any banker, to my knowledge. On the other hand, keen business men have expressed astonishment that the previous Government did not take advantage of the proposal. But, as I have said, I found it impossible to persuade Mr resistance that might be offered by the Theodore to adopt the proposal, though every other member of the caucus, including some honourable members who liament, was willing to do so. I should welcome any inquiry, or any criticism that was based upon logic. Arguments such as that the space involved would make the scheme impracticable are merely foolish. This chamber is sufficiently large to hold all the silver that has been taken out of the mines of the world from primeval times. Silver constitutes an excellent credit, for any nation. Every coinage system in the world, with the exception of those of Great Britain and Ireland, and the dominions of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, is based upon silver. The dollar of the United States of America and Canada, the mark of Germany, the franc of France, the peseta of Spain-fro m the east to the west, silver is the basis of currency. The world will never obtain to a real basis for the interchange of goods until bimetallism is adopted and the fetish of gold is discarded. If , upon investigation, my figures are shown to be wrong, I shall gladly accept the correction and amend my speeches on the subject in the future. to a personal explanation arising out of misrepresentation by the press of a speech of mine in this House. In to-day's Sydney Daily Telegraph, that journalistic offal vendor publishes the following screeching headline:"" James, M.H.R., threatens revolution and bloodshed "", under which I am reported as having saidThere is a determination in New South Wales to resist this interference by the Commonwealth, even to the extent of revolution and bloodshed. I claim that that is 'wilful and deliberate misrepresentation. Rather than threaten bloodshed, I deplored the fact that the legislation which was being debated at the time might bring about revolution; and I expressed the hope that such & spectacle would not be witnessed in any part of this Commonwiealth. I also said that honourable . members opposite possibly did not realize the extent of the people of New South Wales, and that they would not like to be pitted against, their brothers in a revolution. I claim are members of this Parthat, as a member of this Parliament, I am entitled to receive from the press justice and fair treatment. I have gone very carefully through the Hansard report of my speech, and can say that there is not in it a threat of any kind. I ask any honourable member of this House if he can remember my threatening revolution in the State of New South Wales. did not make any such threat. opposite can say that I did. Rather did. I deplore the fact that such legislation as we were then considering might bring about a revolution, which nobody desired in this country that we all love so much. Those were my exact words. It was grossly unjust for a pressman to send to his newspaper a report that wilfully and deliberately misrepresented what I said. -This is the usual hour -for the dinner suspension, and I have no option but to leave the Chair unless the House decides otherwise. ""adjourned now, there might not be a quorum when we re-assembled at 8 o'clock. That would not matter to the Government, but it would matter to those honourable members who, as a consequence, were prevented from contributing to the debate.

Many governments have endeavoured to solve it, but have failed, principally because the issue has been clouded by party politics. freshing, therefore, to find the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) approaching the subject in a spirit of co-operation. That example should have the acquiescence of every honourable member of this House. I trust that this spirit will continue, because without it we shall not be able to solve the difficulty. Much has been said on the subject of industry. It has been admitted in this House that 80 per cent, of those who are employed in Australia are engaged in industry. We know that, at the present time, industry is stagnant, and suffering from a lack of stimulation, due largely to too much government interference and too heavy taxation. It must be conceded that too much legislation is as bad as none at all. Every £1,000 that is withdrawn from industry by taxation lessens to that extent the amount available for the payment of wages upon industrial development, with a proportionate increase in the costs of production. I welcome the appointment of the committee that has been co-opted to advise the Premiers Conference. There are many experts outside Parliament who could give valuable advice on the subject. I give members of the left wing of the Labour party credit for sincerity in endeavouring to bring about a solution of the unemployment problem; they, like honourable members on this side, represent constituents whose claims should be heard. Let me indicate some of the results of the industrial legislation passed iu New South Wales in the last eighteen months. The last banking returns that are available furnish a striking story. I shall show that money is being driven over the border into Victoria. The fixed deposits in New South Wales in September, 1930, for the quarter before the Lang administration took office, amounted, in round figures, to £69,500,000, while fixed deposits in Victoria at that time totalled to £62,000,000. At the end of December, 1931, the respective totals were-Ne w South Wales, £60,000,000; Victoria, £71,250,000. Those figures show a decrease in New South Wales of £9,500,000, and an increase in Victoria of £9,250,000. The funds available for loan by banks in Victoria at that period had increased by 14.6 per cent., while those in New SouthI t was reWales had decreased by 13.8 per cent. Bank deposits in Victoria had increased by 17.3 per cent., and those in New South Wales had decreased by 3.2 per cent. The figures clearly show that the people of Victoria can regard the Administration now in power in New South Wales as one of the best assets they have. It is claimed, I note with much interest, by one or two honourable members opposite that the increased production clue to the introduction of machinery is largely responsible for the unemployment difficulty. I would like the committee that has been co-opted to assist the Government to go into this matter, because it has an important bearing on the problem. The people of Australia would welcome a review of the situation that has been brought about by the system of government relief known as the dole. At the present time, £13,000,000 is spent annually in Australia in affording this relief, and while it is recognized that the people must be fed, this system costs Australia £2_per head of the population. It is an economic waste which should be replaced by reproductive works. If the various governments of Australia could supplement by £2,000,000 the amount required for the dole, employment at the rate of one week in each month could be provided for 200,000 men. To save overhead charges, shire and municipal councils who have the necessary plant should co-operate with the Government. Honourable members with municipal experience will appreciate the point. In that. way reproductive works for the development of Australia could be put. in hand, much of the enforced idleness which is gradually destroying the fibre of the manhood of Australia would disappear, and ambition and initiative would be encouraged. plore the fact that the ministerial benches have been almost unoccupied during practically the whole of this vital debate. Greater interest should have been evinced in this important subject. I listened intently to the various arguments that have been advanced by honourable",56,Honor Able Membebs Hear Hear

The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr ing factor to prosperity.

With due respect for the arguments put forward by various speakers, I submit that it is of no use to emphasize the losses undoubtedly a matter of paramount imin industry in dealing with the vital problem that now awaits solution; time is of the essence of the contract. The unemployed have passed through one winter, hungry in many instances, and dependent on the dole.' They are now faced with the danger of having to submit to another winter of want, unless governments are prepared to act quickly. Under the scheme suggested by the honourable member for Calare( Mr pur duty to create avenues of employment, Thorby), work is already waiting to be done. AU that is required is prompt governmental action. Existing departments should make available the money necessary to carry out the work. The farmers aud graziers are unable, unaided, to increase the productiveness of their land. The bounteous rains that have recently fallen throughout the country make conditions ideal for carrying into effect the scheme propounded by the honourable member for Calare, and, therefore, I suggest that the Governments of the States and of the Commonwealth should forget party differences, and see that the scheme is put into operation immediately. advanced that if production is increased it will be impossible to find markets for the additional produce; but I maintain that if the necessary money is made available for increasing the productiveness of the land, and large numbers of people who are now idle are given employment, markets will be created automatically for the absorption of the product of the land. The proposal would provide wages and healthy occupation, which would be much preferable to the acceptance of the dole. not favour low wages; as a matter of fact, I stand for high wages all the time, Mr Collins. and I say that as an employer of Jabour; earned.

Doubtless, the Government will collate the suggestions put forward to-day, ancl during previous discussions on this subject, and will be able to submit concrete proposals after the Premiers Conference that is to be held in the near future. It is undoubtedly but it is also necessary to keep people in employment. With the limited time at our disposal to-day, we cannot go thoroughly into the whole question of un employment, but I take this opportunity to point out that certain anomalies and rulings under our sales tax acts have a tendency to reduce employment. Paradoxical as it may seem, we may, by the imposition of more taxation, secure less revenue. All taxation is, more or less, objectionable, but our sales taxation is most objectionable. Although the Government will have its hands pretty full during the recess, I hope that it will give The argument has been consideration to the removal of some of the anomalies and injustices which are brought about by the administration of our sales tax legislation. In my opinion, the sales tax should be abolished as soon as the financial position of the Commonwealth will permit it, but, in the meantime, some of the anomalies which cause annoyance and irritation should receive attention. I suggest that the tax should be collected at the source, as is done in the case of excise duties, that is to say, upon the importaI do tion or manufacture of the commodity. Although fish and similar products areexempt from the sales tax, the Taxation",57,Honor Able Membebs Hear Hear
225,Mr Guy (Bass). [6.29],"The proDepartment claims that as mutton birds are processed, they are liable to the tax. The only processing to which the birds are subjected is to salt them before placing them on the market. Beef, when corned and pickled, is exempt, yet mutton birds when salted are taxed! It is generally understood that all uncooked meats are exempt from sales tax, yet mutton birds, which are uncooked, are taxed. The people who are engaged in the mutton bird industry are mostly half-castes, whose income over a year on the average does not exceed more than £1 a week. If , in addition to what they have to pay for freight, wharfage, stacking charges, &c, they have also to pay 6 per cent, on their returns from the sale of the birds, their industry will be ruined. The sales tax officials in Tasmania, who arc conversant with local conditions, say definitely that these birds should not be subject to sales tax. I have received the following letter on this subject from. .Major B. H . Davies, a member of the Tasmanian Parliament:There sire engaged in the industry for about two months every year about 250 men, women and children. The annual value of the industry is about £8,500. The total catch of birds varies taining splendid reviews of the working from 800,000 to 1,000,000 annually. The oil is worth about Ss. ]>er gallon, and at present the feathers are unsaleable. Some few years ago birds were worth 25s. per 100, but the present market price is from 12s. 6'd. fo 15s. per 100. I would like to point out that this is practically a primary product and not a synthetic food, the birds being simply salted and casked. Those concerned at present are not earning a living wage, and are mostly relying on the merchants to carry them over. Included in those interested are those people on Cape Barren-the half-castes-wh o are in a very bad way as regards having means to support them. The half-castes are engaged birding for two or three months, and for the rest of the year are fishing and seailing, but rheir earnings arc not more than £1 a week on the average over the year. If they are compelled to pay 6 per cent, sales tax it will mean ruin to them, and a number of them will be thrown out of employment. Many anomalies under our sales tax laws should be removed. I suggest that all foodstuffs should be exempted. person who-is engaged in the preparation or manufacture of taxable commodities, and has a turnover of £50 a year in such taxable commodities, is obliged to available. register provided his gross turnover is £1,000 a year. Thus, a man with a gross turnover of £4,000 a year, but with a turnover of less than £50 worth of taxable goods, is not obliged to register, and consequently, pays no tax, whereas a man engaged in the same line of business whose gross turnover may be only a little over £1,000 a year, is obliged to register, and pay sales tax if his turnover in taxable goods is a little over £50 a year. Again, a tailor or mercer with a gross turnover of £10,000 or £12,000 a year pays tax on manufactured goods, that is to say, tailormade suits, although his turnover in those particular goods may be less than £1,000 a year, whereas a man who is purely a tailor, and whose turnover in manufactured goods is also under £1,000, is not required to register and pays no tax, except on the raw material he uses. He pays 6 per cent, on the invoice price of the roll of cloth he uses. The other pays 6 per cent, ou the sale price of the ready-made suit less 15 per cent. Por every Is. paid by one man in tax, the other man in identically the same line of business pays approximately £1. Educational books, including some conof various industries throughout the world, the compilation of which has necessitated 'most extensive research, are sent to Australia absolutely free, but are taxable. Although these publications are of inestimable educational value, they are subject to this abominable sales tax. I trust that the Government will consider the points I have mentioned iu this connection, particularly with regard to the mutton bird industry, which, if penalized any further, will cause further unemployment, i that the benches of the Labour party are practically empty, and that only two members of the Country party are present. It is rather discourteous of those honourable members who have spoken to leave the chamber. I should like, however, to direct the attention of the honourable member for Calare( Mr Thorby) to the fact that the greatest objection to the scheme which he outlined for proA viding employment is the very high price of land.",58,Honor Able Membebs Hear Hear

Although railways have been extended into the western districts of New South Wales there are still tremendous areas adjacent to railway lines and much closer to the seaboard, that could be utilized for closer settlement and intensive culture. During the five and a half years I was a member of the State Parliament I found in travelling north, south and west of Sydney-particularl y in the western division-that even had the Government of that State not spent a penny upon railway construction, beautiful land adjacent to townships could be made available if it could only be obtained at a reasonable price.

[Quorum formed.] country districts of New South Wales, I have met with requests from landholders for the construction of railway lines through virgin country, who promised that if a line were constructed the land would be brought under intense cultivation. A reference to the records will show that where lines were built giving the landowners an increased price of £4 or £5 per acre for their land, very little of the area served has been brought under cultivation. It was my intention to make several suggestions whereby employment could be provided; but I shall reserve what I have to say on the subject until some future occasion. I may say, bowever, that the exploitation of the worker by tbe worker is largely responsible for the position with which we are now conI heard only refronted. I take this opportunity of directing the attention of the Government to the hardships experienced by war widows who are at present deprived of a pension, and to earnestly request that further consideration be given to the matter before further pensions are withdrawn. The last Government passed an act which deprived of a pension a woman who has £200 in the bank. Honourable members are constantly receiving letters from all parts of the Commonwealth asking why a widow who lost her husband at the front should be deprived of a pension when she has £200 in the bank. A peculiar anomaly exists in that one widow who may have a home worth £800 and £150 in the bank is entitled to a pension, while another widow who does not own a home and has £250 iu the bank is refused a pension. I have already brought one case under the notice of the department of an elderly lady who kept boarders, whose only son was killed at the war, and who, as a result of her thrift, was able to save up £250. She is not entitled, to the pension. Why should a woman who has reached the age of 70 years, and has that amount in the bank, be compelled to live in a home for the aged and infirm? I hope that during the recess the Minister will instruct his officers to interpret the law more liberally. I know of scores of women whose wealthy sons have left them without protection in their old age, with the result that they have ended their days in the Newington asylum. That fate awaits these women of whom I speak, for their £200 will not last them many months. Unfortunately, there is differentiation in the treatment of war widows. I do not know whether the law, or the interpretation of the law, is at fault. Some cases which I have brought before the Deputy Commissioner in Sydney have been dealt with there, while others have been sent on to Melbourne for decision, and I have been unable to make personal representations to the officer with whom has rested the final decision. I hope that the Minister will see that all mothers of worthy sons who were killed at the war will retain their right to a pension. Question resolved in the affirmative.
