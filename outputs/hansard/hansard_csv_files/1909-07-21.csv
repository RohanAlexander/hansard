0,"3bousr Of Isfprrsentattors. Wednesday, P . M . , And Read Prayers.","The Age, in its report this morning, states that tbe right honourable member for East Sydney said last night thatWhen the Surplus RevenueB ill was introduced by Sir William Lyne not a word was said about putting any of the money away for old-age pensions, so that it was evident that at that time not one penny was intended for that purpose. Sir William Lyne would, no doubt, have been only too pleased to have so mentioned it if it had occurred to him. That statement is absolutely incorrect. Prior to the passing of the Surplus Revenue Bill, I had mentioned my intentions, in reply to a statement of the honourable member for Wide Bay, and, on the 10th June of last year, I was successful in securing the second reading of the Surplus Revenue Bill and the Old-age Pensions Appropriation Bill, of which the latter contained this provisionThere shall be payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly for the purpose of the Trust Account established nnder the Audit Acts 1001-1006, and knoivn as the Invalid and Old age Pensions Fund, tbe sum of Seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds for invalid and old age pensions. member for East Sydney referred to an earlier speech. si July, i.oog. 2.30",14,Setup

It readsOn Guard-Advic e to Orangemen-Federa l Minister's Offer -Inverell, Sunday -The Inverell Orange Lodge celebrated the anniversary of the 12th of July by a demonstration in the Town Hall yesterday. An address was delivered by the Rev. D . H . Dillon. Orangemen were charged with stirring up strife, but in the course of all his addresses he never said a word against individual Roman Catholics. The men who stirred up strife were Cardinal Moran and Archbishop Redwood. In one sermon they stirred up more strife than all the Orangemen put together. He believed a serious crisis was approaching in the Commonwealth. The Church was working hard in a quiet way. member think it necessary to read so much? it to make the context clear. bor may proceed, so long as he introduces no now matter. anxious to prevent. It continuesAustralia would wake up shortly and discover it. Unless they were very careful the next Federal election would be disastrous to Australia. That is the part which connects it, because it makes a clear reference to the Federal elections Prominent Roman Catholic members were being asked not to stand, and weak-kneed Protestants would be put up, who would get the Roman Catholic vote. character more danger was to be apprehended than from straight-out Roman Catholics. The Church was making a tremendous bid for this fair land. Orangemen must stand shoulder to shoulder. At the next Federal elections an attempt would be made to oust five members who belonged to their order. Money had already been subscribed with that end in view. They should remember tie past, and be true to their convictions, as he believed that before many years the Church would have tremendous power. He had been offered by a member of the Federal Ministry the whole of his expenses if he would go through the whole of the New South Wales Federal electorates and deliver addresses -as the imputation is concerned, I accept The mention of the Federal electorates of the Federal Ministry, and the rest I points clearly to the fact that the tour was leave to himself, the reporter of the Sydintended to be an electioneering tour.

Dillon, referring to his speech at Inverell on the occasion of the 12th oF July celebration, states that it was not a member of the Federal Ministry, but a member of the Federal Parliament, who offered him expenses to tour the New South Wales Federal electorates and deliver addresses. In the attack on the Orange Institution, made by Mr Bamford in the House of Representatives last week, he repeated a statement which was represented to have been made by the Rev. J. Dillon, Anglican clergyman, at 'inverell, that 1 he ( Mr Dillon) had been asked by a'member of He said that the present Cabinet to travel through New South Wales for the purpose of delivering political addresses. Mr Wilks intimated in the House of Representatives yesterday that he had received a letter in which Mr Dillon denied the accuracy of the report, adding that, as a matter of fact, he was not acquainted with any member of the present Ministry. Mr Dillon went on to explain that about eighteen months ago he delivered an address on Home Rule, and a member of the Federal Parliament honourable member to proceed in order to ascertain in what direction his remarks were tending, but I cannot see yet that he has suggested any misrepresentation which That is what I am he desires to clear up.

It is not usual for the Attorney-General to give legal opinions in answer to questions put in the House; but I may tell the honourable member that if charges imposed in connection with the inspection laws of the States are not necessary, to that extent there may be a violation of section 92 of the Constitution which prescribes Inter-State Free Trade.

68,Dr. Maloney,"Twenty years ago,should place its views in writing before you, so that the same may be favourably considered when you advise the Cabinet re the amending of the present Federal Pensions Act. I now forward to you the points upon which my Committee considers institutions based on the lines of this asylum should receive the amounts payable to pensioners, namely :1. By sub-section i of section 43 of the Act, in case the Deputy Commissioner is satisfied that, having regard to "" age, infirmity, or improvidence of a pensioner, or any other special circumstance,"" the pension may be paid to others than the pensioner for the lalter's use. This refers to pensioners living outside of charitable institutions. Yet, since this State's Pension Act came into force, several hundred persons receiving pensions have been admitted as inmates to this asylum, thereby losing their pensions. The reason given by them for desiring admission was that through ill-health or infirmity they could not possibly live on ios. a week, as, after paying for a room, food, clothes, medicine, & c , there was nothing l e f t for paying, some one to look after them. These were invariably hospital cases, and the asylum received no special payment for these inmates from the State, as they came under the State's general annual grant to the asylum. Why, therefore, should charitable institutions be excluded from disbursing the pensions by keeping ""a part, say eight shillings a week for the pensioner's board and lodging, clothes, nursing, medical attendance, & c , and paying them the balance, two shillings a week, for what is generally called pocket money ? 2. In passing the Pension Act the i'dea of the That letter concisely puts the advantages Federal Government was to make all old-aged people receiving the pension as comfortable and happy as possible. 3. If pensioners were allowed to receive through the asylum authorities the pension money they would be far better off in the institution than outside, because they would receive regular and wholesome meals, gorid beds, clothes, attention, nursing, medicine and medical services, besides the 2s. a week pocket money. 4. Benevolent asylums can give a better home life to pensioners living apart from their families than can be obtained outside. 5. Besides, all inmates receive certain luxuries, such as tobacco, snuff, &c. 6. A large number have left this asylum from time to time to obtain the State pension, but they have freely expressed to me that they would have preferred to remain in the asylum, ancl hand over their pensions less a small amount for pocket money. 7. Between three and four hundred inmates go out on pass weekly on Saturdays and Sundays, and I am pleased to state that it is only on the average that one or two return under the influence of drink, and these are what may be called dipsomaniacs. My Committee always in cases where an inmate returns under the influence of drink more than once punishes him by stopping his leave for a period. 8. If the money were paid over to the asylum, the Committee would give an undertaking that (2) two shillings per week would be paid to each pensioner, even though any pension was Dr. Maloney. less than ten shillings weekly. The Committee being satisfied to accept the f u l l amounts with the less. 9. Under the present Act a pensioner on admittance to any charitable institution forfeits his pension for the time being, thus, in the case of this asylum, the cost of his keep, & c , will fal l on the State of Victoria, or rather, on the asylum, as it only receives as an annual grant from the State an amount equal to about 40 per cent, of the total annual expenditure'. 10. The cost of this institution's inmates per hea.d per week, although only 6s. 2d. this year, yet those previously State pensioners invariably became hospital cases,'and their cost is, at the very least, 50 per cent. more. 11. In case of death, this asylum incurs the cost of coffins, funeral, burial at the new cemetery at Springvale, and clergyman's fees. This must be remembered in calculating the cost of the inmates' keep. 12. If pensioners become ill they enter a hospital at a great cost per bed, yet, whilst in the asylum, all the necessary treatment is found at a very much less cost. Trusting that the Government will see its way to amend the Act so that inmates'of charitable institutions shall receive their pension money in the way suggested herein, as in my Committee's opinion it will be better for all concerned. I am, Sir, your faithfully, (Sgd.) ALFRED E. LAVER, Superintendent and Secretary. which would be gained by allowing inmates of asylums to draw pensions. But Parliament must insist that residence in these institutions must be the voluntary act of old-age pensioners. Briefly put, such pensioners would receive 2s. per week for pocket money, no matter what amount might be allowed by the magistrates. They would enjoy two days' leave a week, have every Sunday and general holidays, and three whole days every three months, with two weeks at Christmas and Easter, during which, I take it, they would draw the whole amount of their pensions. It is impossible for a decrepit man to live on a pension of ios. per week without the assistance of friends or relatives. In the asylums, pensioners would get regular hot baths, they would hare companions with whom they'could chat or play games, their meals would he served regularly!/ their sleeping accommodation would be comfortable, and in every way their lives would be rendered more pleasant. If an old-age pensioner disliked residence in an institution, he could at once leave, and, on doing so, draw the full amount of his pension. Of course, pensioners able to earn a little for themselves would probably prefer to remain out of institutions. pleasure in supporting the suggestion of the honourable member for Coolgardie, if it is made certain that pensioners who are in any of the innumerable institutions which stand throughout the length and breadth of Australia as monuments to the charity of our people, are there of their own free will, because of infirmity by reason of illness or accident. Then, in regard to the blind. It is pitiful to see them in the streets, sometimes accompanied by children or other relatives, begging alms. Twenty-seven years ago, I was a bank clerk, and know that blind men, even in Melbourne, have held good banking balances, while I have read that, in some of the larger centres of population, such persons have accumulated comfortable fortunes. I understand that those employed in the Treasurer's office have to listen daily to the strains of an indifferent musician who plays outside. munity, however, is great enough to provide for such unfortunates, and should take them off the streets. We should pay them pensions under the invalid pension section of the Act. I hope that no magistrate appointed to administer the Act will be permitted to forget, with impunity, his humanity, as many magistrates administering the State Acthave done. It is the desire of Parliament, and of the people, that the aged should be given pensions, not as a charity, but as a right, and no magistrate, stipendiary or honorary, should be permitted to insult such citizens, who are in every way his equal. question will be raised in Committee. In my view, all citizens who have been given the franchise-whic h is the highest right a human being can enjoy in our communityshould be permitted to draw pensions when, aged. No Asiatics can now be naturalized, but those who have been living amongst us, and have become naturalized, should be permitted to enjoy all the rights of citizenship. A letter which I have received from Tumbarumba, in New South Wales, raises this very peculiar point : Is a man, born in Hanover, when that country was under the rule of the British sovereign, a citizen of Great Britain? I am informed that the local magistrate has foolishly declared that the wife of such a man is not entitled to an old-age pension, notwithstanding that section 16, subsection 2, of the Act, saysNo woman having married one of the persons the Court, I have no fault whatever to disqualified by this section shall, in consequence only of such marriage, be or become disfind with the Victorian system, although I qualified to receive a pension. I shall have Let me read the letter itself. It is as followsSeeing that you, sir, are an important member of the Federal House, I take the liberty to trespass on your attention. Before the Battle of Waterloo, England held out overtures to officers of the Hanoverian and Prussian army to come over to England. My father went, leaving his two brothers, who were also in the army. Father fought at Waterloo, Martinique, Dominique, Guadaloupe, Barbadoes, Africa, and Canada. He retired at the end of 25 years, got a grant of land in Labrador, went there, but found the climate too severe after being wounded and crippled and weakthrough yellow fever, &c. He wanted to go south, but the English Government refused to send his pension into the United States, but he could go to Hanover, where I was born. The House of Commons holds :-That any one born of British born parents will be considered a British subject. Father remained British, until he died, to draw his pension. Britain could claim me to-morrow. I want to make application, together with my wife, who is Irish born, for the old-age pension. My wife, who is bedThis comridden since over three years, is 70 years of age. I am 75. We have abstained until now from applying. CouldI not apply without applying to get naturalized? I have already made application to Mr Allen and other places, and cannot get any answers, to get naturalized. I am seferred to Melbourne by our magistrate. Our magistrate also holds that my wife is not entitled to pension through being married to me. Hanover belonged to England at the birth of my father. The two brothers whom father left in the Hanoverian army lost their lives at Quatre Bras under Blucher. unofficially. The naturalization honourable'member's care, he could not be better off. The honourable member for Ballarat will be interested in a letter which I am about to read, though before doing so I wish to draw attention to the infamous manner in whicli, in this State, aged citizens have been subjected to unnecessary questioning. Their very infirmity makes it difficult for such persons to answer questions. I do not blame either this Administration, or its predecessor, but if these practices are continued, the Government responsible must share the infamy. The honourable member for Bendigo agrees with me that the question list could be simplified. Will the Treasurer kindlv consider what the Victorian Government did ? Never was a pension system administered with such little cost to the community. Up to the time that the applicants appeared before disapprove of the manner in which the",20,Second Reading

There is nothing in the Act that will call a man a pauper, and if any magistrate permits it his action is contemptible. Some, of the magistrates in Victoria did stigmatize applicants in that wayand treated as such, or can we claim the pension as a right? Would any honourable member say that, (he conditions being fulfilled,' the pension is not a right according to law? Allow me to illustrate my meaning by a few quotations from the mass of papers given to the old folks upon application at fhe start.

Another weary wait of a fortnight, and the police personally serve upon the applicant a form to attend at Court.

When nothing can be advanced by the police why the old folks should not receive the pension after a searching inquiry, what need IOT a Court and magistrate -n o property involved?

That would be a much better system than that now in force, under .which an infamous list of questions has to be answered. I can only describe that list as a lineal descendant of the hundred and one insulting impertinences that prevailed under the old poorhouse law of England. Honourable memI quite agree with bers may be interested to learn that I spent two nights and a day in an English poorhouse, and that my memories of it are such that I would rather go into the worse prison I have ever seen than live in such an institution. When I visited the institution subsequently, as a friend of the medical attendant, I found a very great difference in the treatment extended to me. We do not desire to perpetuate such a system in the Commonwealth. Our wish should be to, build up a higher civilization, and to make Australia-whic h has gone farther than any other part of the British Empire has gone in the extension of the franchiserenowned for its humanitarian treatment of aged citizens, who have grown grey in its service. I am not taking a party view of this question. Such a measure as this should be above party considerations, and, therefore, if any remarks I have mad§,are not mine, but his.

85,Mr Page (Maranoa; [ 3 4 4 ],"I wishbourne. If there is one Act on the statute book of the Commonwealth that ought to have the sympathy of all, it is that relating to the payment of invalid and old-age pensions, l t was one of the ambitions of my life to be able to enter Parliament and assist to secure some solace for the aged poor of the western districts of Queensland. orable member's party worked harder than he did to bring about a Federal system of old-age pensions. sincere in every statement. I have made, both inside this House and outside, in regard to the payment of old-age pensions. Many old men in my electorate said, when I returned after the close of the first Federal Parliament, "" God! How long are we to wait for a Federal old-age pension."" Some of these old men are over eighty years of age. They have borne the heat and burden of the day in pioneering and blazing a track across the western districts of Queensland, so as to make them readily accessible to those who follow. If there is one duty more than another to which we ought to attend, it is that of seeing that the old pioneers are properly provided for. I have always advocated that the only qualification for an old-age pension should be that of age. To my mind, the question of what a man's past has been is immaterial, provided that he has lived an honourable life. Many bushmen are very like sailors in the way that they spend their money. They work on a station for two or three years, earn a cheque, and then go to town and knock it down. Having done so, they return to their work for another twelve months or two years, and then repeat the performance. These men have contributed largely to the revenue. penny they earn they spend in the country, and in their own way they have been really good citizens. It is hard that they should be pauperized when they become old. I know of many persons who, at one time, owned property-and some who owned stations-bu t are now in reduced circumstances. Circumstances over which they had no control have reduced them to the lowest ebb of poverty and distress, and it would be damnable to pauperize them. We should do what we can 'to alleviate the suffering of these old people, and ought not to pauperize them in any way. An honourable senator has handed to me a letter from a resident of Rockhampton that I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer, with a view to his intervening in the direction indicated. The letter readsDear Sir,-R e old-age pensions. I wish you would get some member in the Representatives to draw attention to the scandaluus method adopted by the post office here in paying the pensions. Under the State arrangements the old people were paid in a room in the old Court buildings with some little ' show of privacy; but now they have to congregate and parade their poverty on the verandah of fhe post-office like so many beggars awaiting their dole of charity. Surely the Commonwealth Government are not so hard up that they cannot afford to engage a suitable room lor the purpose, considering that they can afford presenting Dreadnoughts to a wealthy nation of landlords like England. England? 40,000,000? "" boodleiers"" are landlords, and no one . knows that better than does the honourable member. I know thousands of workers in the Old Country, but I do not know one who owns the house in which he lives. The writer of this letter continuesMany a respectable old person is glad to receive the pension, yet shrinks from the publicity of receiving as it were alms in public. . . . Do your best in the matter. This is not a private letter, and you can make what use you like of it. Another matter to which I wish to draw your attention is : some of the old people who were receiving pensions under the State are now told that as they have not been naturalized for the f u l l period of three years they cannot receive any pension until the Amended Act is passed;-this is a great hardship, as these few old people had settled down comfortably under the State Act, and now find themselves reduced once more to abject poverty. Had the Commonwealth not taken over the duty Every these old folk would still have been receiving their pensions, and any right thinking person would say it was incumbent on the Commonwealth authorities to pay t'liem until the Act is amended. I am sure that will be your view also. I forgot for the moment whether it was the Attorney-General or the Treasurer who, in reply to an honourable member, said yesterday that the part of the Bill in question could not be retrospective. that part of the Bill, so as to make it all right.

A room can be had for the asking in the old Court House at Rockhampton. That building is separated from the post-office by a green, and the postal officials will not experience any difficulty in paying the pensions there. The amendments in the principal Act that this Bill is designed to make are, as far as they go, very good ; but the desire of every honourable member is that we should make good better. Those who know of any anomalies under the principal Act ought now to endeavour to remedy them. I am sure we should all be glad to see every old-age pensioner receiving £ 1 per week if the Commonwealth had at its disposal the necessary fund's.

Whilst it is easv to sympathize with human difficulty and sadness, in dealing with a measure of this kind the difficulty experienced by a responsible Minister is that if he dare say anything on the other side of the question, personal motives are often attributed to him. I do not know that in the matter of personal feeling, there is much difference between one honourable member and another. It will bring joy to the hearts of We all, I should think, desire to help I those who are not so well off as others, and those who are in distress. appeal to the right honourable gentleman in vain ! any ficulty is that if this question be placed before honourable members, as one of business and of duty, a risk is run of their being misrepresented, and having attributed to them feelings which, I am sure, neither I nor any other honourable member possesses. It is my duty to place this matter before the House as it affects' the people of Australia, and especially as it affects the public finances. This beneficent measure was introduced eighteen months ago, although it had been said over and over again before that time by those who were responsible, that it was impossible tofinanceit so long as the Braddon section of the Constitution was in operation. That view was accepted for a long time; and I need, hardly remind honourable members that the Bill was introduced and passed with great hurry. There was no one opposed to the principle of die Bill, and, as those who were responsible were willing to take the financial burden on their shoulders, all those who were in favour of old-age pensions, and were necessarily not well acquainted with the financial aspect, agreed to it. had old-age pensions if there had not been that hurry. son that prevented us from having old-age pensions was the reason which exists at present, and has existed ever since the Bill was passed, namely, that no special provision was then made, or has been made up to the present, to finance it, except the pro-",26,Second Reading

We are making inquiries, but until we get returns from all the States, we shall bave no certain information.

But I should have thought was £ 5 i 5 > ° ° o ; in Victoria, that the Labour party, under whose special care this Act came into force only the other day, would have done their best in that direction. The amendment of the principal Act, to which the Government intend to agree, reducing the term of residence from twenty-five to twenty years, will involve additional expenditure of, approximately, £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 a year, while the clauses permitting naturalization up to the 31st December One imnext will mean further expenditure of about £ 7 , 0 0 0 , and the retrospective provision to the ist July, to which the Government are agreeable, will add another £ 2 , 0 0 0 .

I may say that, before the Government had agreed to adopt the retrospective view, the Victorian Government had asked the Commonwealth Old-age Pensions officers to pay all the old-age pensioners, including invalids, who were on the Victorian list, and who were disqualified under the Commonwealth Act by reason of their not having resided in I am not critiAustralia for twenty-five years, so that the amendments do not affect existing pensioners in that State.

We should face our difficulties, whether they be financial, economical, or political. The public officers of the Commonwealth -and of the States have to. retire at the age of sixty years, being then considered unfit for longer service, and, generally speaking, private firms adopt a similar rule. It must Ibe remembered that applicants for old-age pensions are, for the most part, persons who have been engaged in much more arduous and less healthy occupations than those of public servants. I think that the age at which an invalid pension could be obtained should be earlier. That has always been my view. While in politics, one must be prepared to take what he can get, Tie must also take advantage of every opportunity to ask for more, until he has got what lie considers sufficient. I think that the age at which women should be eligible for pen-sions should be reduced. Women ought to be eligible for pensions five wars earlier than men, for reasons contained in the evidence of the Old-age Pensions Commis-sion, and the statements .of medical men and other writers, which are available to every member of the Committee. I hope that the Treasurer will accept the amendment which I intend to submit, so that the Bill may be passed with as little delay as possible.

I can show the honourable member, tends to prove that in Australia women, speaking generally, are relatively five years older than men at the same age, from a health point of view. That is a justification for allowing women to be eligible for pensions at an age five years earlier than in the case of men. I therefore ask the Treasurer to accept the amendment. It is not a question of whether the Government will accept the amendment or not. It is a question of whether the Chairman can accept it. The honourable member for Wide Bay has admitted that its intention is to increase the charges upon the people by £500,000. Under such circumstances, no Minister or member can, under the Constitution, Standing Orders, or practice of Parliament, move such a charge on the people without a preliminary message from the Governor General.

If that were alextent of a quarter or half a million lowed, there would be nothing to guide the pounds. In spite of that objection, I , as a Government for the time being as to the private member, was allowed to move the amendments. That is a very good precedent for the acceptance of the amendment now proposed. first that this measure is drafted not only as an amending, but also to some degree as a consolidating Bill, and it is most difficult for me to say what the principal Act does provide. I cannot be expected to have the principal Act here, and to be studying it in conjunction with these amendments. I am placed in a very difficult position in being asked to give rulings where Bills are introduced in ,this way, with nothing to guide me in the shape of letters in large black type as to the effect of the amendments on the principal Act. I understand that the Bill admittedly involves an increased expenditure of £34,000, and that up to the present no message has been received from the Crown to cover that. An amendment is now proposed by a private member which, in his opinion, will further increase the expenditure by £500,000.

By the that, despite what the right honourable memadoption of such a bad precedent, Mr ber for East Sydney has said, the real gist Speaker and the Chairman of Committees of the question at issue is whether or not may come into conflict concerning matters it is possible, in the case of a Bill which that ought to be decided by the Committee is not submitted under a message, to move itself. an amendment that would increase a burmade to Mr Speaker, with the result that den on the people.

If your ruling, Mr Chairman, be upheld, it will mean that it will be impossible for non-official members to submit any amendment which may be considered to increase a tax or burden upon the people. I intend, therefore, to dissent from it. The question as to the receipt of a message in connection with the Bill was not introduced until late in the discussion, and the point whether the Bill itself is properly before the Committee might also be submitted for your decision. But since it has been considered in Committee, and has been accepted as being properly before us, we should tie our hands by accepting the ruling that, it is impossible for a non-official member to move an amendment that may ultimately involve increased taxation. Standing order 171, on -which you, sir, have doubtless based your ruling, provides thatNo amendment for the imposition or for the increase of a tax or duty shall be proposed by any non-official member in any Committee on any B ill . part of the Constitution itself. alter the position. I claim, in the first place, that this measure is.not an Appropriation Bill, or one in which the appropriation of .certain moneys is in any way directly involved. It simply declares that certain treatment shall be extended to certain persons, provided that Parliament is agreeable later on to provide the necessary funds. I recognise that if the Ministry were seeking an appropriation of, say, £1,250,000 for the purpose of old-age pensions, it would not be within the province of a non-official member to move to increase that amount, nor' would it be within the province of a Minister to move to increase it without a further message from the Crown. It is quite within the province of this Committee, however, to determine what form a particular allocation shall take, and for Parliament subsequently to provide the necessary funds. Mr J.. H . CATTS -The Ministry might refuse to provide the funds. majority they could refuse to bririg""dowi> an Appropriation Bill to enable the functions for which this measure provides to be carried out. But this is not a Bill providing for an appropriation within the meaning of standing order 171, nor is it a Bill' directly imposing taxation on the community, l f honourable members opposite, because of party interests, are prepared to accept a ruling in this matter which will tie the hands of Parliament for all time, they will find that the decision will have a boomerang effect, and will recoil upon them. If the Chairman's ruling be sustained, the liberties of honourable members will be curtailed to a degree that was never contemplated when the Standing Orders were being framed, and incalculable injury will be done to the right of free discussion of Bills before Parliament. I have no feeling in the matter towards the Chairman, but I respectfully move That the Committee dissent from the Chairman's ruling. your attention, Mr Chairman, to the proceedings in connection with the Invalids and Old-age Pensions Bill. In Committee a number of amendments were moved by private members, some of which, if carried, would have had the effect of increasing the payments from the Treasury under the Act. The honourable member for Boothby, for instance, moved an amendment to omit the exclusion, under certain circumstances, of Asiatics from participation in the benefits of the Bill. That amendment was put, and, although you, sir, were in the chair at the time, you did not rule it out of order. had the effect of reducing the amount. effect of increasing the amount, because it would have thrown more persons on the fund. As reported on page 11977 of 'Hansard of the 3rd June, 1908, the honourable member for Hindmarsh, on the same Bill, movedThat after the word "" by , "" line 2, the f o l lowing words be inserted :"" residence in any Australian Territory for a portion of the period of residence or.""

Further on in the .same debate, the honourable member for New England moved to strike out the wor'ds "" for drunkenness,"" which, had it been carried, would have .had the effect of increasing the amount to be paid by the public. Then the honourable member for Cook moved, and the amendment was accepted, to include holders of State certificates, and that had the effect of increasing the burden upon the community. It is -clear that the principal Act was treated as it ought to have been treated, namely, as a machinery measure; and if the present Bill is not a machinery Bill, it is improperly before the Committee, because it has not been preceded by amessage. The mere fact that, incidentally, the -amendment will have the effect of increasing the payments to be made under the principal Act, which was covered by a mes-sage appropriating money, is not at all to the point; and I submit that your ruling is not in accordance with your previous decisions, or the practice of this Chamber oefore you occupied the chair, and neither is it in conformity with the right of honourable members to move relevant amendments in all measures excepting those specificallv confined to the imposition of taxation in which case amendments having the effect of increasing the burden of the community -cannot be moved b'y private members. In regard to a Tariff, or a tax, we clearly understand our limitation;' and in the Constitution Act there is particular provision regarding such measures. Sections 53 and 54 of the Constitution contain the following53. Proposed laws appropriating revenue or measures submitted to this House with moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not origiwhich we should have been able to deal. nate in the Senate. But a proposed law shall -not be taken to appropriate revenue or moneys, -or to impose taxation, by reason only of its -containing provisions for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment or appropriation of fees for licences, or fees for serto be dealt with as a party question. -vices under the proposed law. . . . 54. The proposed law _ which appropriates revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government shall deal only with such appropriation. Clearly all' that this Bill does is to rectify anomalies in the machinery Act under which old-age pensions are paid. On the -clear admission of members of the present government, and of the then Opposition,"" when the principal Act was before us, old age pensions could not be -paid because there was no money available; and therefore the whole question turned on the appropriation of sufficient money. This Bill' appropriates no money, and, therefore, we must get revenue in some way before we can pay any more in pensions. The honourable member for Wide Bay has submitted an amendment that may, perhaps, involve additional expenditure; but, clearly, on the statements of the Treasurer, and on the admission of the facts, there is not sufficient money to pay additional pensions without a further appropriation. If you, Mr Chairman, look at the notice-paper, you will find there a Land Tax Assessment Bill, to which is attached the name of the honourable member for Wide Bay. It is proposed under that Bill to include certain persons, and exclude others from such taxation; and I contend it will be quite competent for honourable members to include or exclude any ""other classes from the operation of that Bill, in view of the fact that a Bill actually imposing a tax will not then be before the Committee. Under the circumstances, I feel that you ought not to rule as you have. Although you have been led away by excessive . caution, and a desire not to allow the Committee to get itself into an awkward position, I submit that you have inadvertently clone a very grave injustice, and that the Government, no matter what they may believe, ought to refer the question to Mr Speaker for an authoritative ruling so that we may know precisely where we are. For my own part. I cannot see that there can be two opinions on the point. It is perfectly clear that if we have no right to deal with this amendment, there are only some 10 per cent, of will not uphold the ruling at which you, Mr Chairman, have arrived. The interpretation of the Standing Orders ought not is a question whicli concerns the rights and privileges of members of the House.

Buti f we did not disagree with the present ruling, our hands would be tied so tightly that we could not properly do our business. It seems to me that such a ruling should apply only to amendments of Bills dealing with taxation. It must not be forgotten that, in any case, the expenditure on old age pensions will constantly increase, because there is no prospect of our conditions becoming so good that there will be no claimants for old-age pensions, and there is every probability that the claimants will increase with the population. If we cannot increase expenditure, how is the increase in the number of claimants to be provided for ? This is not a taxation measure. amendment affects merely an Act authorizing an expenditure which cannot be accurately estimated. The honourable member for Wide Bay has given the opinion that his amendment would increase expenditure to a large amount; but that does not follow. Should the ruling of tbe Chairman be upheld, it will be impossible for the Committee to exercise its proper constitutional powers in dealing with the legislation submitted by the Government. member for Boothby that in the consideration of important matters affecting the rights of the Committee there should be no element of party feeling, a consideration which, of course, must apply on both sides. But, in interpreting the rules of procedure, we must not act on rigid technicalities. The point that the amendment might result in the reduction of expenditure does not commend itself to common sense. amendment must largely increase expenditure. 'That is a very important consideration. For many years, where measures involving public charges have been concerned, the powers of tbe Parliament have been strictlv limited, in the interests, not of the Crown, but of the people. Should anv improper provision be inserted in the Bill, it would be open for any honourable member to raise a point of order in the House, which, if sustained, would be fatal to the measure. No Bill imposing a charge on the peoole can be introduced until leave has been obtained by a resolution of a Committee of the whole House. where the charges are merelv incidental and triv'al, there are precedents for dispensing with the Committee stage. But the charge which would be imposed by the carrying of the amendment would involve a very large sum. Of that the honourable member for Wide Bay made no secret. I do not profess to speak confidently in this matter, because there is much to be said in favour of the view taken by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney. Not much importance is to be attached to the point relating to the Governor General's Message, because such a Message can be put before the House at any time, though the want of it might be sufficient to cause a Bill to be ruled out of order. Bill? to Appropriation Bills the rule to which I have referred. Every Bill imposing a The charge upon the people comes within it. Should the rule be broken by an amendment, the point may be taken in the House that a provision of the Bill goes too far, and if upheld, the point would be fatal. If the Bill itself imposes a charge on the people, the Government has done wrong in not obtaining leave to introduce it by the resolution of a Committee, though Ido not see anything in the Bill imposing such a charge, beyond, perhaps, what is subsidiary and trivial. it increases the public expenditure by £34,000. the Bill should have been preceded by the resolution of a Committee. What may be considered trivial or subsidiary charges are small expenditures in the appointment of officers, or in printing, or something of that sort. The the term of residence from twenty-five to twenty years sanctions the idea of increased expenditure. ment seem to have taken the course of separating this particular Bill from the Appropriation Bill. That separation in form, however, does not .at all affect the broad principle to which I have referred. The question is not that of the Appropriation Bill.

I come to the very point with which we are now dealing at the foot of page 528, under the heading of "" B ill s creating a charge.""

If the Bill does create a charge, this is an authority. creates a charge of £ 3 4 , 0 0 0 . amendment, which is of much greater importance :Bills creating a charge -When the main object of a Bill is the creation of a public charge, I am testingthe amendment in that way, and it is a good way of testing it. Suppose the amendment had been in the Bill as introduced, suppose that instead of pensions to those whom we all desire to benefit, the Government had introduced in the Bill a provision involving an extra expenditure of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 in conferring privileges on some wealthy favoured class in the community, without the safeguards of a Royal message and of a Committee before the Bill was brought in. I think in that case my honourable friends would see the necessity for those safeguards. We must not allow our minds to be influenced by the excellent object which the honourable member for Wide Bay has in view. my honourable friends opposite would have considered those safeguards of vital importance. They are, indeed, of vital importance in any case, whether the object is a good one, as it is in this case, or a bad one, as it would be in the case I suggestedresort must be had to this procedure before the Bill is introduced, and upon the r.eport of the resolution of the Committee of the whole House thereon the Bill is ordered to be brought in. If the charge created by a Bill is a subsidiary * feature therein, resulting from the provisions it contains, That is a sort of indirect charge which results from a proposed enactment in the Bill. For instance, the appointment of an assistant Commissioner would be held to be a subsidiary matter, because he having been appointed, his salary would have to be provided. It would not mean a direct charge, such as this is the Royal recommendation and preliminary committee are not needed in the first instance, and the Bill is brought in on motion. But before the clauses and provisions for the creation of incidental charges can be considered by a committee on the B ill , those clauses and provisions must be sanctioned by the resolution of a Committee appointed upon the recommendation of the Crown, and agreed to by the House. So that even incidental charges must be sanctioned by this procedure, "" in my long experience in another Parliament, it was my constant anxiety, as Premier, to see that these messages were brought clown. Too often I have had Bills ruled out of order because one of my Ministers omitted to get the necessary message introduced and dealt I am dealing with the with in Comniittee., although, perhaps, the expenditure for which the Bill provided was not large.

I agree with the right honourable"" member for East Sydney that, under the House of Commons practice, such a Bill as this must first of all be referred to a Committee by a message from the Crown, and be dealt with there. The right honourable member also urged that, since we have no . definite standing order to guide us in this'matter, we must resort to the rules, forms and practice of the House of Commons. Upon that point, I am in agreement with him, but no one knows better than he does that our constitutional practice is exactly the opposite of that of the House of Commons. the opposite of the House of Commons was, to me, one of the mysteries of the first Parliament. Again and again I thought that slip-shod methods were being pursued in dealing with certain Bills, but, on drawing attention to the matter, I was always corrected by an appeal to the Constitution.

I submit that there is a time when honourable members have an opportunity in Committee to extend, as well as to reduce, the scope of such a message. The Treasurer nods dissent, but, with all due respect, I disagree with him. When a message is being transmitted from the Speaker to the Committee, there is a time when a motion extending the amount proposed to be appropriated under that message may 'be moved and carried. That, at all events, has been done more than once in other Parliaments. useless. motion, before we proceeded to deal with the Bill to which the message related, would be a clear direction to the Crown as to the desire of the House. The argument advanced by the right honourable member for East Sydney absolutely fails, at any rate, on the ground that in the House of Commons an appropriation must always precede the Bill to which it relates. We have no such form in connection with this House. The right honourable member has said that' he thinks that this Bill, apart from the question raised, ought to have been preceded by a Committee on a message from the Crown. It is immaterial to the object we have in view, whether or not the amendment is accepted in the particular form presented, since we can attain its object by the omission of one word. I regret that the amendment has been ruled out of order. The point involved is a very delicate one. In you, will give his decisions according to his intelligence, quite irrespective of party feeling.

So far as I understand, the procedure of the House, the necessity for a Royal recommendation prior to any Bill or resolution for the appropriation of moneys being carried, has been obviated. Even though a Bill may require a recommendation from the Governor General, such recommendation may be obtained subsequent to the Bill going through most of its stages, and prior to its final passing from the House. understand that that is the position taken up by the Ministry with respect to this particular Bill-that they anticipated that a. Royal recommendation would be indispensable, but adopted the ordinary custom in at least some of the States, and were prepared to allow the Bill to go through certain stages before the recommendation was brought down. If that be the case, and it is ruled that the Bill is pioperly before us-and that the Ministry propose to ask for the necessary recommendation prior to the Bill passing through all its stages-the n I submit that the ruling is not in keeping with the practice of the House of Commons.

If it is to be followed here, the Bill is not properly before us. According to the Hansard report, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the 27th May. 1908, movedThat it is expedient to provide for old-age pensions, and to authorize the payment out of moneys provided by the Parliament of any expenses incurred for that purpose, and connected therewith. That is a clear formal motion, such as the honourable member for Adelaide had in mind. the chair is a motion to dissent from my ruling, and not whether the Bill itself is or is not in order. do so, I shall show that the matter I am dealing with is relevant. In that particular case, the Bill was preceded by a resolution in general terms, and Mr Chaplin, the honourable member for Wimbledon, took the point of order that the Bill ought to be brought down before the resolution. He saidI do not quite understand . . . whether the passing of this resolution is a necessary preliminary or not of the introduction of the Bill. I am advised so. Upon that, there was a discussion. The resolution was agreed to, and, subsequently, the Bill was brought clown. We are in a much stronger position in this case, because this Bill has not been preceded by a resolution, although, according to the practice of the House of Commons, that is necessary for a Bill of this kind. upon the matter, does the honourable member want to stop the Bill on that account? It will not invalidate the Bill. amend this measure in the direction we speak of. Notwithstanding the fact that the British Old-age Pensions Bill was preceded by a resolution, which, in itself, showed that it was a taxing measure, private members in the House of CommonsI moved amendments which aimed at increasing the charge upon the revenue. Sitting suspended from 6.27 to 7.45 'p.in. ing of the Old-age Pensions Bill in the man, member for Shropshire, Oswestry,, moved an amendment which would have had the effect of increasing the expenditure by £800,000 a year. That is recorded in Hansard of June 29, 1908, page 383 of Vol. 191. The circumstances under which he moved that amendment are preciselyanalogous to these, except that in that case a specific motion had been moved by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which he declared was necessary before the Bill could be brought in. That motion was a recognition that the Bill was a Bill appropriating, or imposing a charge upon, the revenue. It was a general authorization. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, regarding the amendmentThe honourable gentleman had said that hisamendment would cost only a trifle of ,£800,000, but it was a very serious thing to propose to add £800,000 to the already heavy burden of financing a scheme of this kind. The amendment was then discussed at considerable length, |and was eventually put and lost. No point of order was taken as to whether it was in order or not. We must, therefore, assume that it was in order. practice of the British House of Commons. of the discussion, both on the motion and on the second reading, a number of amendments were moved by private members, many of which had the effect of still more greatly increasing the charge upon the revenue. In. face of this, the most recentauthoritative precedent as to the procedure in the House of Commons, your ruling ought not to stand. I admit that the matter might be open for argument if the case were not so clearly established, both in May and by the actual practice of the House of Commons. The latter is much more to the point and ought to be given greater consideration than any declaration by May. May, of course, is an authority, compiled from the rulings and the precedents laid down in the House, but here is a recent precedent directly applicable to the case before us, where a",43,Mahon A Highly Technical Tax Rate Or Duty

271,Mr Hughes,"Yes. D uring the coursemember of the Commons proposed to increase the charge upon the revenue. A private member was permitted to move an amendment which would increase that -charge by £800,000 a year. I submit that we must follow that precedent, the more especially when to depart from it is to take from honourable members a right which they have always enjoyed, and which they exercised without challenge during every stage of the consideration of the principal Act. The right honourable member for East Sydney said the point to be. decided was not a technical one at all. He submitted that the Bill did impose a charge-that, in consequence, the Bill was not properly before the Committee-and that it followed as a matter of course that Parliament would have to honour the obligation which it incurred by passing the Bill. I say most emphatically that that is to mis-state and misunderstand completely the nature of parliamentary procedure. It is to say, in so many words, that an assessment measure and a taxation measure are practically the same. We know them to be distinctly different. It is notorious that legislation has propriation Act of 1908. I submit, therebeen passed in many cases imposing obligations on the Parliament which Parliament later on has not honoured. This measure is either a measure imposing a charge-in which case it is improperly before us-or it is not, in which case it is a mere machinery Bill, which there can be no possible doubt as to our power to amend. In either case we may amend it, because if it be a Bill imposing a charge in the same way as the British measure was, 'then, upon the precedent clearly created in the House of Commons, we can amend it in the direction of increasing the charge, and if , on the other hand, it be a mere machinery measure, we can clearly amend it by the exercise of our right to amend legislation in general. ruling, sir, creates a most monstrous conditherefore, be proposed, whether by a Minister of tion of affairs. If it be upheld, we must either accept the Bill as a whole or reject it as a whole, far the only way in which we can amend it is to make every old man and old woman who is a beneficiary under this legislation worse off than they are to-day. whole course of my parliamentary experience, such a ruling has not been given in connection with a matter of this kind. If it were a direct taxation measure, I admit that your ruling would apply. The honourable member for Adelaide quoted a case which showed that where the resolution Mr Hughes. was in general terms and not specific it was competent for a private member to move an amendment which increased the charge upon the revenue. What is the position at the present time? The principal Act was assented to on 10th June, 1908, and on the same date the Royal assent was given to the Old-age Pensions Appropriation Act, under which an appropriation of £750,000 was made. That is the only appropriation for this purpose of which .we have any knowledge, and if it preceded the passing of the Old-age Pensions Bill, then the amendments that were made in that Bill were made after the appropriation had been agreed to. In any case, amendments which might have had the effect of increasing the proposed charge or burden on the people' were moved, and no objection was taken to their submission. The Government propose by their own measure to increase the amount payable under the principal Act to an unknown extent, but they have absolutely no authority to pay one penny beyond that Avhich is specifically appropriated by the Old-age Pension Apfore, that the proposed amendment would not create a charge upon the Treasury of id. more than that appropriation permits. Beforei d . more can be paid, there must be a further appropriation, and since that appropriation must be initiated in this House, it follows that what we are proposing now is to agree to a propositionwhich may or may not subsequently be ratified. 1 submit, therefore, that the amendment is in order At page 580, of May. tenth edition, we have the statementThe constitutional principle which vests in the Crown the sole responsibility over national expenditure, and which forbids the Commons to increase the sums demanded by the Crown for the service of the State (see p. 532) is strictly enforced in the Committees of Supply, and Your Ways and Means. . . No amendment can, the Crown, or by any other member, to increase the amount of a grant beyond the sum specified in the estimate. Nothing which the Government, or any non-official member of the House may do, can give power to pay one penny more than During the the amount appropriated. But this is not a Committee of Ways and Means, and we are not proposing to create a. charge. Subject to the approval of the House later on, we propose to give to certain persons not now included in the Bill a right which they formerlydid not possess. Whether or not that right involves an impost upon the revenue will depend upon whether or not we have the money to permit it to be observed. The amendment is, in effect, the same as the provision in sub-section 2 of section 15 of the principal Act, which declares that, upon proclamation by the Governor General, that sub-section under which women shall have the right to claim pensions at the age of sixty instead of sixty-five years, shall come into force. The section was worded in that way so. thatwhen the money was available, women would be able to draw the pension on reaching the earlier age. Attorney-General, whether there is any appropriation other than that of the 10th June, 1908, under which £750,000 is set aside for the payment of old-age pensions? Have we an appropriation of the general revenue ? on the paper. to follow the practice of this House as well as the practice of the House of Commons. If your ruling be upheld, Mr Chairman, I can hardly conceive of a measure in connection, with which honourable members will not be deprived of the right to make an amendment in the direction you have mentioned. How can one say what will be the effect of the amendment? The honourable member for Darling bas pointed out that further amendments may be proposed which will have the effect of decreasing the proposed charge. We have either to accept what the Government bring down, or we have to vote against any amendment. That is the situation under your ruling, and it would place the Committee in a very unfortunate position. As it is, it would be perfectly competent for an honourable member to move the omission of a clause, the absence of which would render the Bill void for want of particularity, since it would not prescribe to whom the pensions should be payable. We may do that yet-w e may not liberalize the measure in any way. Those who vote in support of your ruling, Mr remember introducing a Bill into the SouthChairman, will saddle themselves with the responsibility of taking from the Committee the right to make this measure that which the people are entitled to expect. statement of the position. such a method of restricting discussion were carried out generally, Parliament would be reduced to a nullity; we should merely be able to vote like automata. I am anxious to ascertain whether we are not able to pay pensions to those who have reached the age at which the Commonwealth and the States declare their servants may be retired; yet we cannot obtain such an expression of opinion in this Committee. Yet an ordinary resolution might be moved, putting on record the opinion of honourable members, in precisely the same way as is proposed in the amendment, and it would have the same force at law; unless it were backed up I ask the by an Appropriation Bill, it would not enable the pensions to 'be paid. I hope that your ruling, Mr Chairman, will be dissented from, and that we shall have an opportunity to test the feeling of the Committee. Whether the amount is large or small the principle involved is the same. Honourable members cannot justify their action in supporting your ruling by the excuse that the amount involved may be very great. There is a big principle at stake. It is clear that it is recognised in the British Parliament, and that it was followed this time last year in the British. House of Commons, where a member was permitted to move an amendment involving an expenditure of £800,000. I hope that the same right will be extended to honourable members of this House. cedent which the honourable member for West Sydney quoted from fhe House of Commons practice is unanswerable. The Attorney-General also put the position very clearly when he pointed out that the Bill,, as it stands, is in order. To my mind, the Government acted rightly in introducing it before bringing down a message from> the Crown. It is impossible to say what expenditure it will involve, and, consequently, they have deferred"" bringing downthe message until they can ascertain what the additional expenditure is likely to be. I fail to see how honourable members can agree with your ruling, Mr Chairman. I Australian House of Assembly, to provide for the payment of a minimum wage of 7s. per day. There was then on record a resolution of Parliament that the minimumwage should be 6s. per day.

' If he does, he will exhaust his parliamentary rights in the effort to get his own way. The honourable member for Riverina was Chairman in 190.1, and ruled clearly and definitely that a private member has the right to move a motion imposing an increase of dutyand so imposing an extra charge upon the people. He quoted various authorities, and, amongst others, the following passage from page 711 of Todd's Parliamentary Government in EnglandThe general question of a revision of a certain class of duties having been submitted to the House by the Crown, it is perfectly competent to any member, in committee of ways House, upon the Customs or Inland Revenue Acts, to offer an amendment to a particular rate of duty proposed to be levied, either for the increase or diminution of the same; it may even be proposed to insert in the schedule a new rate of duty, provided it relates to an article which is already included therein. In that passage one of the highest authorities on parliamentary practice laid it down that it is possible for a private man, have ruled to-night that we are not permitted to do. The practice of the House of ' Commons at the present time, and the practice of this Committee until tonight, has been contrary to that declared by you, Mr Chairmarj.

Eveni f every amendment submitted this evening upon the Bill is carried, and makes an additional charge upon the people or the revenue, it lies with the Government to secure a recommendation from the Governor General that those charges should be imposed, and if they neglect or fail to do so, or disagree with, the policy of doing so, those amendments willhave absolutely no more effect than would an abstract resolution covering",48,Hutchison Undoubtedl Y We Fully Or Otherwise To Place Before The Com

The ruling of Mr Speaker on that Speaker's ruling ought to have been upheld occasion, was as follows:I may say 1 have known for some four weeks guide this Committee-. past that this question would arise at some portance must be attached to this particular stage of the proceedings on the Tariff, and I ruling, because the whole of the Speaker's have, therefore, given it very careful considerainclinations were in the opposite direction. tion. When first this was made known to me, I at once conceived that the idea of any. unHe said: official member proposing an increase of an item of taxation asked for by the Crown was contrary to the spirit of parliamentary government, the spirit of parliamentary government being that the Crown asks for an impost to be made on the people, and the people's representatives in Parliament consider the request of the Crown, and mav grant fhe request, or may grant a lesser amount, but would not conceivably give <o the Crown a larger sum than the Crown asks should be imposed. When, however, I went from the question of the spirit of parliamentary government to the practice which has grown up as parliamentary institutions have developed, I am obliged to admit that in the House of Commons, which is the standard of our proceedings, where it is not otherwise set out in our Standing Orders the practice of proposing imposts on items not suggested as subjects of taxation by the Crown, and of proposing increases on items which are suggested as subjects of taxation, has sprung up, and that on several occasions, without any objection being taken, new taxes have been proposed by unofficial members, and increases on details of new taxes suggested by the Government. . . . There are cases which I am quite prepared to quote, but which, I understand, the Chairman has already cited. One case dates back to 1S40, and another can be seen in Hansard, vol. i , 21S, page 1041. Striving to interpret the practice of the House of Commons by the practice in other Parliaments, I find that in Canada the same course has been followed; and also in Victoria, where attention was called to the importance of the matter. In South Australia, according to Blackmore's Practice of the House of Assembly, the practice was followed in 1870 and on other occasions. Therefore, ruling as I have to rule, that neither Standing Order 171 nor Standing Order 247 applies to this caseas we are now dealing with a resolution in Committee only, and the Bill stage will come later-anc l falling back on Standing Order No. 1, which incorporates the practice of the House of Commons, I am bound to decide that the Chairman has correctly determined the practice in this House, which is that duties on items may be increased, and that other items which are mentioned in the Tariff on which no duty is proposed may be proposed as subject for duty, and that in that way the House will have the freest possible hand in debating the Tariff. of the last Tariff that order of procedure member for East Sydney quoted from the was reversed altogether in practice in Comtenth edition, but the wording is precisely mittee. sequent ruling of the Speaker reversing the what appears on pages 563 and 564 of the nractice at that time, that cuts away the eleventh edition, under the heading of ""No in all subsequent Committees, and ought to Exceptional imI may say I should have been better pleased to have decided the other way, had my duty permitted me so to decide, because I can see that the ruling I have given may tend to produce considerable discussion beyond that which otherwise would have taken place. But witb the practice of the House of Commons before me, I can only rule, as I have ruled, that the Chairman is correct in his decision. Nothing could be more emphatic and definite upon the point at issue. The whole subject is embraced within that ruling, which, by a peculiar coincidence, arose as the result of a motion submitted by yourself. I hope that in the circumstances honourable members will reconsider any decision which they had already arrived at, in order to secure a final decision from the Speaker. Unless we do so, whenever a Bill involving a . question of expenditure is submitted, and an amendment is moved, we shall possibly have hours of debate on its admissibility. It is even possible that at some future time you may not be in the chair, sir, and that we may again have in the chair the honourable: member who, in 1901, held your position to his credit and to the honour of his electors ancl the House. We may then have him giving an entirely different decision from that which 3-ou have given tonight. That would place the Committee in a very peculiar position, one in which it should not be put. I wish to emphasize now the point that I took hurriedly a. few moments before the dinner adjournment, because it is of exceptional importance. We are bound by the practice obtaining in the House of Commons, and the recognised authority the worlcl over on that practice is May, who has been quoted with effect to-night to support the view taken by 'the honourable member for Kalgoorlie.

I also have referred to the same authority, and have shown that it is clearly laid down that, so far as our present situation is concerned, at all events, the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Wide Bay does not of itself impose a burden upon the taxpayers or a charge upon tlie revenue. Such a burden is only imposed if the proposal meets with the approval of the Crown, and Ministers in their wisdom, seek a recommendation from the Governor General. I am sorry to have spoken at such length, but the importance of the ruling is so great, ancl its effect will be so far-reaching, that 1 think we are justified in searching all the authorities, and exhausting all possible avenues, in order that we may obtain a decision which will be final, and can be accepted by the House. that on this occasion' honourable members will not give anything approaching a party vote, but that they will, if only to conserve the time of the House in future, allow Mr Speaker, he being the only authority, the final decision of such an important matter. able member any other authority that he can quote?

I hope that the motion will be agreed to, in order that we may obtain a final decision. If the point is not now referred to Mr Speaker, your decision, sir, must of necessity be debated hereafter, because of the fact that in 1901 the honourable member for Wakefield, who still presides over the deliberations of the House, gave a different ruling, and it is not known whether his opinion on this most important subject is changed. In the circumstances, I can, with the greatest confidence, ask that, irrespective of party considerations, the motion to disagree with your ruling, Mr Chairman, be approved of. to intervene at this stage, but, in justice to myself, I deem it necessary to make an explanation, in view of the speech just made by the honourable member for Adelaide. The honourable member's remarks may have left on the minds of honourable members the impression that it was merely because I had moved to increase a duty, on the occasion in question, that I desired the point of order to be referred to Mr Speaker for settlement. I am sure that tlie honourable member did not. deliberately seek to convey such an impression, but probably he had not read the whole of the debate that took place. On referring to Hansard, he will see that there was considerable discussion as to the right of a non-official member to propose an increase of duty. In the circumstances, I told the honourable member for Wide Bay that I would deI hope liberately move an increase of duty, in order that the question might be settled. Honourable members will find that, at page 7132 of Hansard for 1901, I . am reported to have saidA good deal of time has been wasted on this matter, and the debate from the beginning has been carried on in a very irregular way.

In order to test the question, I move That the duty be increased by the sum of is. I took up then the position that I take up to-day in regard to the reference of the question to Mr Speaker.

The honourable member suggested that in the next Parliament the position of Chairman of Committees would probably be occupied by some one else, who would reverse your decision on the point of order now raised. Such a remark might well have been left unsaid. I am certain that had it been made by an honourable member on this side of the House, it would have been construed by the Opposition into a veiled threat that something would happen if a decision adverse to the view of our party were given by you. I do not suggest that the honourable member had such an idea in his mind at the time, but his remarks were certainly likely to give rise to that impression. Our debates should be entirely free from any statement that might be conrefer the matter to the Speaker. However, strued or misconstrued into a veiled threat since you, Mr Chairman, have elected to of reprisal against an officer who conscienleave the matter in the hands of the Comtiously gives a decision, which may be opmittee, the responsibility rests with us to posed to the opinions that we ourselves hold. self regarded the remark as a joke, why should the honourable member take notice of it? no suggestion of jocularity. The remark was made seriously. But even jokes can be, and are often, made a vehicle for veiled threats. that the honourable member desired to make anything in the nature of a veiled threat, but I sincerely hope that we shall not have recourse to such a method of procedure. We have also been urged to deal with this question from a non-party point of view. That is certainly most desirable, for the same point may arise in connection with any Bill. There has been, however, a distinct attempt, cn the part of the honourable member for West Sydney, to give a party complexion to the votes of honourable members on the question of your ruling, Mr Chairman. He went so far as to say that if honourable members dared to sustain your ruling, no matter how conscientiously they might vote, their action would be taken as adverse to the pensioners. That is a very improper attitude for the honourable member for West Sydney to take up, and it shows that there is an attempt on the part of certain honortheTheprovisions able members of the Opposition, for electioneering purposes, to give a non-existent party complexion to this question. I resent their attitude very strongly, because it is well known that honourable members on this side are just as sympathetically disposed towards old-age pensioners as are members of the Opposition. But we would scorn to revert to such unworthy tactics. We can give a vote quite honestly adverse to the proposal before the Committee, and yet still be in thorough sympathy with the object of the suggested amendment. good. that may be sought to be cast on honourable members on this side for voting to uphold your ruling, must also rest on yourself, as a member of the Labour party, for having given the ruling; and I think it would have been much more desirable to exercise our votes according to our consciences, quite irrespective of the Bill, in reference to which the point has been raised, because it could have been raised in connection with any other Bill, and it is a mere accident of circunlstance that the point arises in association with this particular Bill. ruling that has been given in this House. I am not suggesting is all the more reason why we should give a judgment quite irrespective of party considerations, and of the object-avowe d or actual-of the proposed amendment. As to the power of private members to propose"" amendments, which, although not directly in the nature of an increase, may have the effect of increasing taxation, I have followed carefully the arguments and quotations of the honourable member for Adelaide, and I think that he slopped short in some of the extracts he read us from May. Had the honourable member read a little further, he would have seen that another complexion was put on the matter-that the authority quoted seemed to sustain the ruling that has been given. The honourable member for Adelaide read the following words, which appear on page 532 of the roth edition, and page 564 of the n t h edition of May:Committee is not bound by the terms of which the Ministers of the Crown",52,Hutchison Undoubtedl Y We Fully Or Otherwise To Place Before The Com

Those quotations relate to a Bill which is covered by a message from the Crown; and there is no such message in the present instance. Acting on this principle, when, in 1S12, a committee was considering a message from the Prince Regent recommending, in general terms, provision to be made for the family of Mr can ""be proposed except by a Minister. That Spencer Perceval, amendments were permitted for , increasing the provision proposed by the Ministers; and this practice has been supported by Tulings from the Chair, though, on the last occasion This is very importantnot without remarks which deserve careful consideration. The honourable member for Adelaide might have proceeded to the next paragraph, which has the marginal note, "" No proposal of new taxes except by a Minister""The principle that the sanction of the Crown must be given to every grant of money drawn from the public revenue, applies equally to the taxation levied to provide that revenue. No motion can therefore be made to impose a tax, save by the Minister of the Crown, unless such tax be in substitution, by way of equivalent, for taxation at that moment submitted to the consideration of Parliament; nor can the amount of a tax proposed on behalf of the Crown be augmented, nor any alteration made in the area of imposition. In like manner, no increase can be considered by the House, except on the initiative of a Minister, acting on behalf of the Crown, either of an existing, or of a new or temporary tax for the service of the year; nor can a member other than a Minister move for the introduction of a B i ll framed to effect a reduction of duties, which would incidentally effect the increase of an existing duty, or the imposition of a new tax, although the aggregate amount of imposition would be diminished by the provisions of the B ill . a direct money Bill? . tions on the next page. is written on the next page has really anything to do with the matter. The point 1 wish to make is that, although the amendment is not a direct proposal to increase taxation, it is of such a character that in its operation it will possibly, and very probably, have the effect of increasing taxation. Indeed, that it will do so, has been admitted. It certainly will have the effect of greatly increasing the charge on the public revenue; and that, I take it, is tantamount in all respects to an increase of taxation. So far as I remember, the practice ever since I became a member of this House has been that no private member may propose an increase of taxation or of duties. The honourable member for Hindmarsh argued that it was quite permissible for a private member to move an increase of duties or taxes; but we find it specifi cally laid down in May that no increase principle was laid down in discussions on the Tariff, and has always been acted upon when we have been dealing with the Budget or Estimates. a Minister cannot propose an increase in the Estimates. revised Estimates. Under all the circumstances, it seems to me that you, Mr Chairman, have ruled in accordance with the practice for many years past, but, at 'the same time, I certainly think that, instead of the responsibility being thrown on the Committee to decide on the correctness of your ruling, it would have been better to have Mr Speaker's decision. to follow the example of the honourable member for Lang, and other honourable members opposite, in quoting long extracts from authorities which have, in very many instances, but a remote bearing on the question. Under the circumstances that presented themselves this afternoon you, what conservative view of the privileges of the Committee, and in throwing on honourable members, either in Committee or through the Speaker, the responsibility of saying what shall be the practice. The Committee is invited by your ruling to make a precedent for themselves to lay down a rule for your guidance. The question is whether the Committee is going to deprive themselves of powers, or to arm itself with the amplest privilege.

Therefore, I appeal to honourable members to look at this matter entirely as it affects the powers of the Committee, ancl to deal with the proposal of the honourable member for Wide Bay on its merits. a vote on the proposal of the honourable Chairman is of much greater importance. I am surprised that the right honourable member for East Sydney is not in favour of giving the Committee the fullest freedom . we must be guided by authority.

I agree with your ruling, Mr Chairman, and think it ought to be upheld in the interests of parliamentary practice. The honourable mem% ber for Adelaide used a long argument regarding the increase of items in the Tariff. He seemed to think that that settled the question, because it had been ruled that the Committee might increase taxes which had been proposed. He thought that applied to this case; but I apprehend that it does not. by tbe responsible Government, who have to provide the ways and means, and if any private member in the Committee can secure a majority to impose an outlay of ten or twenty thousand pounds, or more, without having the responsibility of finding the money, it is a most dangerous principle, which it would be most unfortunate to establish. At the present time, especially, I would warn honourable members that they ought to walk warily. We are proceeding at an alarming rate of progression in our public expenditure. member must not discuss that question. my argument, which is that houorable members ought to be careful how they interfere with the responsibility of the Government to find the money. If we vote expenditure in the way proposed, without making provision foT it, we place the Government in a wrong position.

If expenditure is allowed to be increased by irresponsible parties in the House, we may involve the country in very serious financial trouble. That is why I mentioned the extent to which our public expenditure is increasing. Your ruling is sound, and in accordance with all parliamentary principles.

The Government still have control; they have not brought forward the appropriation; they have not brought down the Governor General's message; and they can decline to carry out the decision of the Committee. Let us consider what the position would be on any similar measure. I want to keep clear of a discussion of the Bill itself, and I regret that some honourable members opposite find it impossible to do so. We ought to decide this important point on its merits.

376,Mr Spence,"The honourable membervoted, we could not force the Government to do anything that they did know how members are going to vote on this question, but the situation is a serious one, and the effect will be most serious if your ruling is upheld. We all have great confidence in you, and in your knowledge of parliamentary practice; but, after listenshould have a chance to cut down their ing to the debate, I feel that we are bound to vote against your ruling in this case if we are to observe the Standing Orders that we have ourselves adopted, because one of those Standing Orders provides that where the Standing Orders themselves are silent, we must follow the practice of the House of Commons. Cases have been quoted tonight to show that recently, when an Old age Pensions Bill was before the House of Commons, a private member actually moved an amendment involving an additional expenditure of £800,000, and that no objection was raised to his action. The honourable member for Adelaide also quoted from May to show that private members have power in these cases to propose such amendmentsa point which the honourable member for Mernda quite ignored when referring to the honourable member for Adelaide's argument, although I do not see how could be more explicit than the pas j sages which the honourable member for Adelaide quoted from May. Our case has been absolutely proved, and there has been no reply to it. The practice of the House of Commons undoubtedly shows that we have the right to propose amendments to increase expenditure. orable members prepared to limit their powers as private members in Committee? to limit ourselves in the work that we have to do, especially as the Government still retain control of the purse. They need not provide an appropriation, and in that way they still have power to defeat the decision even of a majority of the Committee. I do not know that they would be justified in doing so, but they undoubtedly have that power. If we uphold vour ruling, Mr Chairman, we shall close the door on ourselves with regard to many Bills that are already on the business paper. We shall not be able to add a line to them, unless the Government themselves agree to do it. We shall not be able even to move to do so, or to discuss the question. Everything will have to be done by the Government. The Committee will have no say, not want to do. I do not and it will be of no use for us to sit here at all. We can only do less than what the Government propose, and it will be necessary to have an extremely Radical Government, which goes miles ahead of the wishes of the House. In that case, we proposals for expenditure. Under this ruling, we could not add to the Government proposals an amendment involving any additional expenditure whatever. Take as an illustration the proposal to establish a Bureau of Agriculture. Eveni f we all agreed that it would be desirable to add another Department to it, the Committee could not do so. No private member could propose it, and it would be left for the Government to move it. They might say that they hacl not the money, and the , Treasurer would hold the key of the position. We should be putting ourselves in the hands of an autocrat. The same question would arise in connection with defence, which is a very big matter, involving large expenditure. The difference in our proposals might run into thousands of pounds, and yet the Committee dare not propose an amendment involving additional expenhe could ignore it. Nothing diture. Although we can give away battleships that cost millions, we could not propose the addition of a torpedo boat. is claimed for representative government. representatives whom the people have elected would be of no use, and that the only man controlling the Commonwealth would be the right honourable the Treasurer, l f he said that he had not the money, we could not propose anything which cost even an additional pound. ""That position, which some honourable members have declared themselves ready to vote for, is absolutely ridiculous and an outrage on the common sense by which yve are supposed to be guided. The alternative position leaves us free always, although we are not likely to do anything rash, and at the same time it takes away no power from the Cabinet. It gives the Committee the power that it ought to have. As we ourselves have the right to decide this issue, I cannot understand honourable members voting to curtail their own powers, and to prevent themselves from doing something which they want to do now, or may want to do next week.

380,Mr Spence,"It would mean that thethat there was in any honourable member's mind a desire to prevent a vote on a specific issue. I hope there is nothing of that kind, but, although I have not a suspicious nature, I am very puzzled by the attitude Ojf certain honourable members on this occasion. The right honourable member for East Sydney, after discussing the question very ably, admitted that it was quite debatable, and by no means clear. He is the only one on that side who has gone into the question. From the Attorney General, who would have given us from his old position a very carefully-thought-out address, we have heard nothing to-night which anybody could make head or tail of. Why did he not speak out? Why have not some Ministers risen to discuss the question ? Their silence is not fair to the Committee. We on this side have done our best, and a number of honourable members have taken a great deal of trouble in ransacking the authorities and the records of the House of Commons to arrive at the correct view, but we have had. no help and no enlightenment from the experienced Ministers opposite. I cannot understand it, nor can I understand any honourable member voting in such a way as to tie himself up. Certain honourable members on the Government side, who on other occasions shout loudly for freedom, have been conspicuously silent this evening. In this case, judging by their attitude, they intend to deprive themselves of freedom. sir, for being consistent. You pointed out, in giving your ruling, the difficult position in which you were placed. You reasoned out very well the position that you took up, and said that, having regard to a previous decision, you must rule in a certain way. You certainly indicated that you would not consider that any reflection was cast on you by our voting against your decision. I have always a tendency at meetings and conferences to stand by the Chairman, but no such consideration arises in-a case of this kind. There is an important principle at stake, and it is for the Committee to lay down a precedent for its future guidance. I cannot conceive of there being more than a small minority of honourable members in favour of voting to cut down their own power. If vour ruling be agreed to, Mr Chairman, we shall have to accept whatever the Government choose to bring down. The honourable member for Mernda [53]2 misunderstood the object with which a quotation was made in regard to the course adopted in a certain case. If we do not disagree with your ruling, Mr 'Chairman, we shall vote against a principle that we have already adopted] for our guidance. The passing of the proposed amendment would not necessarily mean the imposition of an increased burden on the people. No message has been brought down, and no one is able to say what will be necessary to finance the Bill. The amount to be allotted for the purposes of the Bill will depend upon the estimates that are made, and it will be voted from time to time upon Appropriation Bills. I hope that the Committee will vote against the decision of the Chairman. the House of Commons on the Pensions Bill has been referred to more than once, and strongly relied on by those who urge that the Chairman's ruling should be disagreed with. I would point out, however, that one discussion took place upon a resolution, and that an amendment was moved for a definition of the amount that was to be appropriatedIt is quite competent for any honourable member to take such an action on a resolution in Committee. ceded by a message. other case relied upon by honourable members opposite is rather more difficult to We must all give you credit, define, but it does not consist really of a ruling.

There is a class of Bills which are not money Bills, and there is another class that are money Bills. No Minister can introduce into: a measure that is not a money Bill a clause that would make it one. A money B i ll cannot be considered by this House unless the subject of it has been introduced and a resolution passed in a 'Committee of the whole. There must also be a message from the Governor-Generalbefore that Committee can deal with it. Committee cannot consider a resolution as the foundation of a money B ill until the Governor General has sent a certain message to this House. That is an interference with our rights, but it is the law. Then, this House must, in Committee, affirm the propriety of introducing a. B ill which involves a charge upon the people before such a Bill can be introduced. That is a limitation upon the rights of Ministers. A Minister cannot introduce a money Bill unless he follows the course I have mentioned. On your ruling, Mr honourable member for Wide Bay.

The rule that makes it irregular to consider an amendment which would increase a burden upon the people by ^500,000 also prevents the Government from increasing a burden on the people by ,£34,000 a year, unless a certain course is followed. These are the rules by which we are to be guided, and it is absurd to say that in endeavouring to uphold those rules we are seeking to deprive any honourable member of a right he possesses. An honourable member does not possess the right to initiate taxation, to create charges upon the people, and Ministers do not possess the right to do so except in a specific way. My objection to the honourable member for Wide Bay's amendment goes very much further. appl'es equally to an amendment moved by a Minister, as it would to an amendment moved by a private member. losing sight of the fact that no B ill in the nature of a money B ill that is to say, which creates a charge on the people-ca n be dealt with except rartain precedent steps have been taken.

I am dealing with this as a matter of principle, and with no desire to fetter the rights of honourable members. I have hacl painful experience of the effect of following the rule of the House of Commons. I remember on one occasion, at least, I introduced a very important measure, and. because there was a provision for appointing an officer-no t an appropriation of money for his salary, but simplv provision for his appointment to perform certain duties-the Speaker, f o llowing the usage of the House of Commons, ruled that it became a money B ill , and that it was improperly before the House, seeing that it should have been preIt ceded by a message and a resolution of the Committee of the Whole. If these conditions hacl been fulfilled, there would have We are been no objection either to the proposal of the Government, or to any amendment being proposed by an ordinary member.

Time after time this House, to suit its own purposes, has had to depart from the practice #f the House of Commons; and on the present"" occasion we have simply to exercise judgment. If the Bill has been introduced wrongly, even in view of the British preceWe cannot get dents, it ought to be thrown under the table. This is not a matter of sentiment; and I certainly do think that the ruling which has been given is an invasion of our powers as representatives. If the ruling shuts out the introduction of certain amendments, I am, so far, prevented from casting a vote. The question whether an amendment means taxation or a charge on the Treasury could be dealt with when the amendment itself is before the Committee. Why should we not make a precedent without in any way casting a reflection on the Chair? I cannot understand any man saying that this is a party matter, because to do so is simply begging the question. Honourable members on this side, who say that if we vote against the Chairman's ruling we are taking away tbe Government's responsibility, are equally silly with those who talk about this being a party question. My vote may be ill-advised; but I think it desirable, not only in view of the measure before us, but of other measures which will be subsequently introduced. The common sense of honourable members, whether in House or Committee, will always assert itself in regard to amendments ; and I see no reason why we should be led by the practice of the House of Commons, or the practice of any other Legislature. It is my intention to endeavour to obtain further power as a private member, and, therefore, I must oppose the ruling. ence is limited, and I have listened attentively to the arguments for and against the motion. I have been considerably impressed by the remarks of the right honorI intend to vote for the able member for East Sydney, and also by the House of Commons last year when dealing with the Old-age Pensions Bill.

419,Mr Wise,"My parliamentary experiit is a money Bill, it has been wrongly introduced, and is wrongly before us; and that if it is not a money Bill, we have no power by amendment to make it a money Bill. The amendment proposed is to reduce the qualifying age of pensioners from sixty-five years to sixty; and if it is alleged that this would make it a money Bill, then surely the clause which reduces the qualifying period of residence also makes it a money Bill. monev B ill ; and, therefore, to be wrongly before the Committee. At the same time, we are bound by the practice of the House of Commons; and we have from the honourable member for Laanecoorie the fact that when the Old-age Pensions Bill was being discussed private members did move amendments in Committee which would have considerably increased the charge on the people. It is all very well to say that the point was never raised in the House of Commons; but we know that on that occasion the Government were met with tremendous obstruction and long discussions; and we cannot imagine that, if there had been the slightest hope of the discussion being stopped, the point of order would not have been taken. We find, however, that pages of discussion are recorded in Hansard, and that, in order to put an end to the talk, the Government had to use the closure. That seems to be the last precedent, and it is the precedent by which I shall be guided. At the same time, I agree with the right honourable member for East Sydney that the Bill has been wrongly introduced ; and if the Government did right they would withdraw it, and reintroduce'it.

420,Mr Fisher (Wide Bay) [10.30],"cost ? the probable cost of the change involved in the last amendment, and Mr Chairman took so much notice of it as to partly base his decision upon it'. Therefore, I should not be wise in giving another estimate now, though I do not think the cost will be much. It is for the Treasurer to say whether he regards the amendment as a reasonable one. of order that the amendment raises the same question as did the last amendment. The honourable member for Wide Bay seems to admit that himself. the Chairman is a far-reaching one. honourable member proposes"" to reduce the age at which women shall be qualified to receive pensions. I take the point that if the words which he proposes to strike out of the principal Act are omitted, the charge upon the people will be increased, and that, therefore, his amendment is out of order. Orderhad a very long discussion on this question, and, therefore, I am prepared to give my ruling at once. Let me begin by pointing out that the system of amending and consolidating legislation at the same time places me in a very difficult position, and throws upon me work which I should not have to do. Not only have I to give my attention to the Bill before the Committee; I have also to compare it carefully with the principal Act, in order to ascertain what its clauses mean. Unless read with the principal Act, the clauses of Bills such as that now before the Committee convey no meaning. I understood from the honourable member for Wide Bay that the effect of the amendment he has just moved would be practically the same as that of the last amendment. If it is intended merely to bring about a reversal of my decision, it is distinctly out of order. Of course, the honourable member has merely moved the insertion in the clause of a proposal fo omit words from the principal Act. That amendment by itself means nothing. I cannot know the intention of the honourable member for Wide Bay until I know what subsequent amendment he intends to move. I have no means of knowing whether the amendment will increase the expenditure or not, and in those circumstances I must accept it. It is merely to omit certain words, but, of course, it will be useless unless the honourable member intends to move a subsequent amendment. When hedoes that I shall, perhaps, be in a better position to decide its effect. upon one point which I submitted, to the effect that even the omission from the principal Act of the words proposed may involve an extra charge upon the people. While the matter is left for the Governor General to -deal with by proclamation, it is only a future charge upon the people which, may become operative in ten or twenty years'' time, but if the words relating to the proclamation are removed, the effect may be to bring the charge immediately upon the people. whether the Governor General will issue the proclamation to-morrow, or twenty years' hence. It may have been done today, and in those circumstances, as the Act already provides that it shall be done at some time, the honourable member's point of order does not hold good. surer) [10.45] I am sorry that the honourable member for Wide Bay seems to desire to amend this beneficent measure in a way that is unacceptable' to the Government. The Government have met the wishes of honourable members to the utmost extent in proposing to make the alterations which they considered, and the House thought necessary yesterday, but if the proposals of the honourable member are to find favour in this Committee, all I can say is that it will be impossible for the Government to proceed with the Bill. Several honourable members interjecting, disorder? I am merely stating the facts, and before I sit down I shall show that the honourable member's proposals are not reasonable. I should like to ask him whether he had in his mind when he was Treasurer and Prime Minister any such proposals as he made this afternoon, and is making to-night. I hacl no notice, until the honourable member proposed them this afternoon, that they were even contemplated.

I ' interjected that I -did not think it was in draft, and he replied that that was only trifling with the -question, as it was settled before he left office. As a matter of fact, it was not in draft, but the terms of it had been arranged before the honourable member left. I do not think it has been altered in any material way, the Law officers after I assumed oflice as Treasurer. The honourable member also said that the delay in passing the P ill was caused by the action of honourable members on this side. He, therefore, not only took credit for the Bill as it was in draft, and I can say that the draft, as submitted to me, has no: teen altered in any material way.

If he did not .suggest their inclusion to those who were drafting the B ill , what induces him now to propose them? I am not going to mince matters.

Sir JOHN FORREST I have not as f u l l information as I should like regarding the present proposal of tlie honourable member for Wide Bay. right honourable member's estimate. stated is based on information signed by the Accountant of the Treasury. It is proposed now, I understand, that that part of the principal Act which authorizes the payment of pensions to women at the age of sixty shall be brought into operation at once. That would mean that instead of women receiving them, as in the case at present, at the age of sixty-five, they -would receive them at the age of sixty. The estimate of the Treasury is that that would involve an additional expenditure of about £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 per year. give £ 2 , 000,00 0 for a Dreadnought, but they cannot give anything for old-age pensions.

441,The Chairman,"I must again askname those honourable members who are responsible for them. of the proposal to bring into operation at once the provision that women shall be entitled to receive a pension on reaching the age of sixty instead of sixty-five years, would mean an additional expenditure of £ 3 9 1 , 3 6 0 . That, of course, is only an estimate. that pensions should be paid as early as possible to women who had reached the age of sixty years? not possible just now. Before submitting proposals for largely increasing the expenditure, honourable members might reasonably have been expected to await the delivery of the Budget so that they would know what is the exact financial position of the Commonwealth. The utter recklessness of the honourable member for Wide BayI can use no milder term-in now desiring to increase immensely the burden on the people, although when Treasurer he did not propose to increase the expenditure in this way, shows, I think, that he must have been actuated by some party motive in submitting these proposals. Had he thought of making them when he was Treasurer he would have announced the fact at the time. But the responsibility of financing them was then upon him, and he was afraid to face it . He knew that it was too great. Now, however, that the responsibility has been removed from him he does not care what burden is placed on the people. The honourable member's proposals on their merits are impossible.

It is only by the merest accident that they have been enabled to proceed with that measure at all. After having been in office for seven weeks, they were not in a position to supply honourable members with copies of the Bills which they wished us to discuss. In my judgment, the honourable member for Hume is quite right, and is acting practically as a benefactor to the Government in proposing to take up time to-morrow afternoon, in spite of what they have stated, so as to enable them to get ready to place the business of this country before the House in, at any rate, an intelligent form.
