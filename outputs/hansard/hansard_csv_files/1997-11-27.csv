The report was jettisoned by this university students while saying that if he minister here with a press release late at night stood for one thing it was going to be vouchbefore the release of the West discussion ers. paper. It did not get two minutes of public Minister, it is a bit rich-I know you like consideration. And under this minister's putting the spin on, being the spin doctor on manipulation of due process it might not even every single interpretation-and we all know get to a final report. it, for you to be saying that you do not So all those supporters of the university support vouchers. It is a like your saying you sector in Australia who are looking for a bit do not support labour market deregulation; of guidance, a bit of direction on policy you do not support the free market.

That is an night follows day you would be introducing absolute outrage for all those people who those university vouchers. It really is rich troubled themselves to make a submission and indeed-like Dracula saying that he no longer who took this government at face value when supports the Red Cross-for Minister Kemp it said that this would be a report with farto be saying that he no longer supports reaching consequences over the next two vouchers for universities. decades. The truth is that the West committee The one thing about university policy is that has long gone west under this minister. it exposes the wide gap in ideology and This is something that is just typical of the attitude when it comes to education. It is way in which the minister has conducted certainly true-and people say this as I move himself. He is only interested in funding cuts throughout the university sector-that in and cheap publicity. He is only interested in aspects of policy the gap between Labor and two things in the discharge of his responsibilithe coalition in the past decade narrowed in ties: funding cuts and cheap publicity. His some areas. But the policy gap in education decision to jettison, to undermine, the West is large and growing, because we are not a committee has either wasted $2 million of political party which would ever make educataxpayers' money or the minister cannot be tion and training the number one target for believed in his press release when he claims budget cuts. We are a party which believes in that he does not support vouchers. the public purpose of education. One thing I will say about Minister Kemp The coalition engages in this narrow debate is that we would give him credit for the virtue about whether education should be treated as of consistency. For 30 years, either advising a private or a public good. Their conclusion politicians or being one, he has not changed is that you should attach a user charge and an his mind on one single issue. And the up-front fee to every single aspect of private minister nods. So why would anyone think for benefit out of education. The ALP has a totally different approach. When we hear the deserve one set of rules for university access, term 'user pays' in education our assumption on the basis of merit-not on the basis of is that society is the user and the beneficiary having $100,000 spare in the bank, but on the of education and, as a consequence, it should basis of merit. In terms of the spin doctoring be the funder of universal education access and the fantasy, he was even here in the through the work of the Commonwealth and House earlier on this week saying, 'Oh, this its revenue raising powers. could cost 90,000 places.'

The overall importance university. An average university in Australia now of lifelong learning, the fact that good has 20,000 places. This minister, so deluded citizenship needs to be based on a sound and so in a state of fantasy, has the belief in education in an information rich society-all his head that some time in February next year these things bring education and training even these universities will be accommodating an higher on the Labor agenda. An even greater additional 11,000 students each. Minister, it priority will be given under the next Labor is just not going to happen.

Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services) (10.02 a.m.},-in reply-I would like to briefly sum up the debate yesterday which followed the second reading speech on the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill. There were contributions from colleagues in the opposition and the government, and I would like to place on the record my gratitude to my colleagues for ensuring that this bill went through as smoothly as it did. The bill ensures that some small changes will take place-principally, that the roles of the now full-time chair and full-time CEO will change to those of part-time chair and full-time CEO. This really shows the understanding of the government-and the opposition as well, for that matter-of the extraordinary amount of important work being done at ANZFA. Reforms such as the food hygiene review, the review of food regulation, the review of food standards and the national uniform food legislation are all important matters going on there currently, and it will be a particularly busy year next year. I would like to acknowledge my colleague the member for Bendigo, Mr Reid. He mentioned that he had launched national food safety awareness week in his electorate. I encourage all my colleagues to promote such community events whenever they have the opportunity-as I had in Sydney and also in Adelaide-to promote community awareness of just how simply things can be done to promote people's health. Again, I acknowledge my own gratitude and that of the government to those members who contributed to this debate. I am pleased to have had their support. Question resolved in the affirmative.

277,Mr Miles (Braddon,"Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (10.0411540 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 November 19-7 More than a third of Australian adults-some 4.7 million people-now have investments in the share market. Efficient capital markets are central to the government's objective of achieving higher economic growth and facilitating private sector investment, employment generation and wealth creation. Economic growth depends on the investment of the sayings of Australians in productive and innovative ways. Efficient, well supervised securities markets are a vital component of our capital markets and are one of the most important vehicles for economic growth. They provide investment opportunities, enable companies to raise capital, act as an efficient price discovery mechanism, and help to channel resources and savings to their most productive uses. Strategies to promote the standing of our securities markets must be adopted in order to achieve the government's foremost objectives of promoting growth, attracting investment to Australia and creating employment. . . The Australian Stock Exchange, the ASX, as Australia's leading securities market, plays a central role in the efficient operation of the Australian economy. It provides a marketplace for the trading of the securities of Australia's leading companies. In reflecting the collective information and judgment of investors, the exchange channels investors' capital into its most productive uses. By bringing together parties wishing to buy and sell securities, the exchange facilitates price discovery and reduces transaction costs and settlement risks. The savings of millions of Australians are invested directly or indirectly through the exchange. The privatisation of one-third of Telstra, together with the recent demutualisations of National Mutual Holdings and Colonial Ltd, will add to the overall market capitalisation of the exchange. In addition, the ASX, in its capacity as a market regulator, is the front line regulator of the day-to-day operations of the market. The ASX is, therefore, an important national asset and a cornerstone of our capital markets. The ASX is currently organised and governed in a manner that is traditional for stock exchanges. It is a 'cooperative' or mutual. Since their origins in coffee shop meetings of stockbrokers in London and Amsterdam four centuries ago, most stock exchanges around the world have come to be structured as mutual organisations of stockbrokers. The exchange is owned and controlled by its members and run on behalf of its members under its own constitution and operating rules. Its members are the brokers who use the exchange to deal in the securities of businesses and governments. They are either corporations or firms that are licensed stockbroking organisations, or individuals who are senior employees .or directors of stockbroking organisations. Only recently has the continuing appropriateness of this structure been challenged. Substantial changes to. the commercial and international environments in which stock exchanges operate have obliged exchanges to radically rethink their corporate governance structures. In 1993, the Stockholm Stock Exchange chose to become a limited liability company whose shares are freely traded. Recently, other European exchanges have altered their governance structures in one form or another. Stock exchanges operate in a dynamic, competitive and rapidly changing environment that is far removed from the circumstances of yesterday. The world financial system has witnessed dramatic changes and exponential growth over recent decades. New technologies have allowed an increasing range of financial services to be supplied across international borders. Recent events in the world's stock markets highlight the increasing international interdependence of those markets. Thursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 11541 Exchanges must continually appraise and, if necessary, adapt their governance structures to meet new demands and competitive pressures. The ASX initiated a review of its governance structure in 1995. That review concluded that the ASX should demutualise and go one step further than any other stock exchange by listing on its own market and having its shares quoted. In October 1996, after considering a business case prepared for them, members of the ASX voted to 'demutualise' the exchange-that is, to convert the exchange from a company limited by guarantee to a company limited by shares. That company would ,be owned and controlled by its shareholders and conducted as a conventional business for the purpose of yielding a return to its owners. The ASX is, essentially, a private body. It is not funded by government in the role that it carries out. The government accepts that the internal governance of the exchange is, in the first instance, a matter for the exchange and its owners. The government has agreed in this bill to facilitate the conversion of the exchange to a public company. However, the proposal does raise an important issue for government-namely, how is it to ensure that the public interest in the proper running of the exchange is protected following the proposed changes to the ASX's governance arrangements? The ASX undertakes three roles within the securities industry. It is a market regulator, a selfregulatory organisation or SRO; a commercial entity conducting a public securities market as a business; and a trade association seeking to protect and promote the interests of its members. The regulatory responsibilities of the ASX The ASX's listing rules perform an important role in the regulation of listed companies. In making and administering these rules, the ASX occupies a formal, statutorily recognised position in the system of co-regulation of companies and securities with the Australian Securities Commission, the ASC. Important services provided by the ASX include the maintenance of market integrity, fair trading systems, guarantees of trade completion, clearing, settlement and transfer systems and information about stock that is traded. The maintenance of market integrity encompasses a number of important facets, including ensuring investors are properly and fully informed about matters affecting listed companies so that their shares can be fairly priced, having trading and settlement systems that are fair and efficient, ensuring that stockbrokers deal fairly and honestly with their clients, and detecting any attempt to mislead the market. Markets characterised by the presence of these elements attract broad investor participation. It is essential that the Australian Stock Exchange continues to ensure the honesty and integrity of .the securities market for which it is responsible. The conversion of the exchange to a company limited by shares represents a significant change to the way in which stock exchanges have traditionally been conducted. The issue, from a policy perspective, is whether the commercial pressures of a 'for profit' entity will undermine the commitment of resources and capabilities of the exchange to effectively fulfil its regulatory and public interest responsibilities to an appropriate standard. To ensure appropriate levels of investor protection, the Corporations Law will be amended to clarify the responsibilities of the Australian Stock Exchange as an SRO, and ensure there is appropriate accountability of the Australian Stock Exchange to the ASC and the government in carrying out its SRO responsibilities. 11542 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 November 1997 The law will impose obligations on the exchange to do everything necessary to ensure that the market it conducts is an orderly and fair market, and self-regulatory functions are carried out on an ongoing basis. It will, in particular, require the exchange to have adequate arrangements for overseeing stockbrokers, for the settlement of transactions and for investigating complaints by investors about business transacted on the market. To ensure appropriate compliance with these obligations, the bill will empower the minister to direct the exchange to attend to certain matters that the minister believes will promote compliance with the ongoing obligations. In addition, the bill will provide for an annual report by the exchange of its performance of its SRO responsibilities. Supervision of a listed Australian Stock Exchange The Australian Stock Exchange proposes that its shares be listed on its own exchange. As the Australian Stock Exchange is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the listing rules against all listed companies, there would be a conflict of interest in the Australian Stock Exchange monitoring its compliance with, and enforcing, its listing rules against itself. To remove the potential for any conflict of interest, the bill provides for the ASC to undertake the supervision of the Australian Stock Exchange's compliance with the listing rules. The Australian Stock Exchange will meet these supervisory costs. Restrictions on the ownership of shares in the Australian Stock Exchange Given the critical role it plays in the national economy, it would not be in the public interest for anyone party to gain control of the Australian Stock Exchange. The bill thus imposes a statutory limitation of five per cent on individual shareholdings in the Australian Stock Exchange. A limitation of this order will encourage diverse ownership of the Australian Stock Exchange. The five per cent limitation will apply to both Australians and foreigners. The regulation of stockbrokers Under the current law, stockbrokers must be members of stock exchanges, and stock exchanges must ensure that their members are of good character and conduct themselves accordingly when trading on an exchange. Following demutualisation, the right to trade on the Australian Stock Exchange will be available to appropriately qualified and financially sound organisations, whether or not they are members of the Australian Stock Exchange. Access to the market will be based on a contract between the Australian Stock Exchange and brokers. Those contractual arrangements will not require any ownership interest in the Australian Stock Exchange, as at present. While the bill recognises the Australian Stock Exchange's altered relationship with brokers, at the same time it ensures that the Australian Stock Exchange continues to be responsible for the conduct and integrity of market participants trading on the Australian Stock Exchange and in related activities. Access to the National Guarantee Fund On its conversion to a public company, further approvals of payments from the National Guarantee Fund, the NGF, for the Australian Stock Exchange's own development would not be available. Such approvals, in circumstances where the benefits of the capital investments funded by those moneys would inappropriately accrue to shareholders of the Australian Stock Exchange, will no longer be appropriate. There is no need to make specific provision for these changed circumstances in this bill. The Corporations Law presently confers a broad discretion on the minister in approving payments out of the National Guarantee Fund for the development of the securities industry. Thursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 11543 Within the scope of this discretion, the government proposes that guidelines be developed detailing the circumstances in which payments from the fund may be approved in light of the ASX's changed circumstances. It is anticipated that payments will continue to be approved for such purposes as investor education and campaign or research projects that will enhance the development of Australia's securities markets, but not for capital development of the exchange. Conclusion In summary, the bill provides a mechanism for the conversion of the exchange to a public company. In so doing it gives effect to the decision of members as to the governance arrangements they consider appropriate for the ASX into the next century. Legislation is necessary to effect this change as the Corporations Law does not presently permit a company limited by guarantee to change its status to that of a company limited by shares through administrative procedures, nor facilitate the breaking of the nexus between ownership of a stock exchange and access to the market .operated by that exchange. More importantly, however, legislation is necessary to clarify the responsibilities of a demutualised ASX as a self-regulatory organisation, or SRO, and ensure appropriate accountability of the ASX to the ASC and the government in meeting those responsibilities. Where appropriate, the clarification of these responsibilities will have application to securities exchanges generally, and not solely to the ASX. The measures proposed by this bill will assist the ASX to compete with regional exchanges and enhance the international competitiveness of Australia's financial sector in the Asia-Pacific region. They will help to deliver significant new employment, income and wealth to the Australian community. The bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on government. While additional costs will be incurred by the ASC in supervising the listing of the ASX, the ASX has agreed to reimburse the ASC for these costs. In accordance with the corporations agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted and has approved the introduction of the bill into parliament. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and I commend the bill to the House. Bill 1997 proposes to facilitate the decision by the Australian Stock Exchange to demutualise-that is, to change from a company limited by guarantee to a public company limited by shares-and to list on its own market. The evolution of this bill goes back to a review in 1995 that the ASX initiated of its own structure. That review concluded that the ASX should demutualise, something which had been done by a number of exchanges internationally, and, in addition, that it should do what no other exchange had done: list its own stock. Iri October last year, the ASX members-the stockbrokers-voted to demutualise. Exchanges in other countries, such as Sweden, have demutualised but none have, apparently, been listed before. So this does represent a groundbreaking decision by the ASX. The ASX presently is a private cooperative or mutual company which performs a number of multiple roles simultaneously. First, it operates a securities market as a business; second, it acts as regulator for listed companies; and, third, it operates as a trade association for its member stockbrokers. The key issue arising from this legislation is: are these roles compromised by the new, demutualised structure?",117,Representatives Main Commitiee
278,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (10.17 A.m.},"The Corporations Law Amendment (AS X)11544 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 27 November 1997 The advice that we have received from the government, from the ASX and from the industry is that the answer to that question is no, the change of structure ought to provide an opportunity to clarify and improve existing arrangements; it should not involve any imprudent risks. Accordingly, the opposition supports this legislation. To ensure adequate levels of investor protection, the Corporations Law is to be amended to ensure that the ASX, and other exchanges, are accountable to the general company regulator, the Australian Securities Commission. Specifically, obligations will be imposed on the ASX, and exchanges generally, to do everything necessary to ensure that the market it conducts is an orderly and fair one, and that self-regulatory functions are carried out on an ongoing basis. This should ensure the continued proper operation of the market. Indeed, there is no doubt that it is in the commercial interests of the ASX to run an orderly, efficient market. Having a specific profit motive should assist in that motivation to continue to run the market properly. Clearly, as the ASX will be listing on its own exchange, there will be a conflict of interest in overseeing itself. Therefore, the ASC will supervise the ASX's compliance with the listing rules. This provision has the agreement of the ASX and is a necessary alteration to accommodate the demutualisation. In addition, the bill will also free up the regulation of stockbrokers. Currently, stockbrokers must be members of stock exchanges and stock exchanges must ensure the good character and conduct of their members. Following demutualisation, the right to trade will be available to all appropriately qualified and financially sound organisations, whether or not they are members of the ASX. However, the ASX will continue to be responsible for the condur! and integrity of market participants trading on the ASX and in related activities. This is J. worthwhile reform freeing up access to the ASX which has the support of the opposition. The other major decision in the bill is the limitation of individual holdings to five per cent of the issued capital. This limitation applies to both resident and non-resident shareholders. This is a necessary public interest regulation which will ensure that, although the ASX will be fully commercialised, the national interest lies in preventing a takeover of a cornerstone of Australia's capital markets. The opposition is supportive of the legislation. We wish the ASX success in its new structure. We are indebted to ASX representatives for their assistance in explaining some of the relevant issues to us. There are a number of issues concerning market regulation and confidence which ought to be raised in a debate of this kind. I and other members of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities raised with the Australian Securities Commission aspects of their role in overseeing the ASX and sought their assurance that the changes which were going to occur would not compromise the integrity of the ASX. The committee received the following advice from the head of the ASC, Mr Cameron: We will assume directly only a small additional rolethe role that I referred to earlierand that is to supervise their own listing when that occurs, because they cannot be seen to be the body that gives themselves exemptions from their listing rules and monitors their compliance with the listing rules and so on. So we will do that. Thursday; 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 11545 Mr Cameron went on to express the personal view: ... when the stock exchange becomes a publicly quoted corporation and is no longer directly controlled by 'the' braking industry as such, when it is controlled by investors seeking to make a profit out of the trading on the exchange, then the assumptions that you would otherwise have made about the enforcement of professional standards, the role that the stock exchange ought to perform at the moment and does perform at the moment and will continue to perform, the judgments they make in that will be more difficult. They will have a greater tension between their role of immediately trying to make a profit for their invest()rs, for their owners, and the other role of maintaining the credibility of the market. He goes on to say-and I think this is right: In the long term they are not in conflict because long term the credibility of the market is crucial to its long-term profitability. But there is a short-term tension at least between those objectives. I think that will mean that a new regulatory paradigm has to emerge when the exchange is privately owned. That will be a process of time. That was the sort of response that we in the committee received from the ASC to questions about the issues involved in this bill. I further make the point that the ASX has noted its in its annual report that funding for the Australian Securities Commission will fall from $104 million in 1996 to $74 million in 1997. Given the importance of the ASC in maintaining that most critical asset of market integrity, it is a matter of some concern to us that the ASC budget has been reduced in this way. In addition, if we are going to talk about the issue of public confidence in the ASX, there is no doubt that it is essential that the public believe that all investors and all those who deal in shares are treated on an equal basis. That is why it was a matter of great public concern that we saw revelations earlier this year on the Four Comers program concerning the activities of the Victorian Premier Kennett in apparently telephoning the former chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange, Laurie Cox, to secure shares in the Arthur Yates float. That was a hot float, and members might recall that Stephen Mayne reported on the Four Comers program that he had made inquiries on behalf of Premier Kennett as to whether shares in Arthur Yates could be obtained. He reported back that he had made inquiries and had established from the brokers that all the shares were allocated. But, according to Stephen Mayne, Premier Kennett contacted the chairman of the Stock Exchange, Laurie Cox, and emerged with 20,000 Yates shares for his wife Felicity. It is a matter of considerable public concern if there is the impression that some shareholders, or prospective share owners, are treated differently from others and that brokers apply different rules between clients. member. Interestingly, Premier Kennett has said that he could not remember whether he telephoned Laurie Cox concerning this matter. Mr Cox has refused to be interviewed about the matter and has refused to deny that he received a call from Mr Kennett, who was seeking shares in Yates. which managed that float back in 1993. That is correct. But if you were an ordinary member of the public you could not get shares concerning that float.",121,Representatives Main Committee

You are under a misapprehension. I advise members that this chamber is a chamber of goodwill in terms of the legislation that is processed through it. It is non-controversial. If honourable members feel that they are being unduly attacked over a particular comment no doubt they will have the time to address that particular situation when called upon to speak. I call the honourable member for Wills. So in your view in general there is no public interest test on how those brokers conduct themselves? Mr Cameron replied: To the contrary; I think there is. That is the reason why the Stock Exchange, as the front-line regulator of the behaviour of brokers in that situation, would normally deal with that. So it is important that both the ASC and the ASX investigate the questions, which have been the subject of considerable public concern, as to whether Premier Kennett rang the former head of the Stock Exchange, Laurie Cox, and how it was that he was able to acquire shares in Guangdong-or at least Felicity Kennett was able to acquire shares in Guangdongand shares in Arthur Yates when others were not-in circumstances where one of the principals of the Guangdong Corporation, Bruce Mathieson, subsequently emerged as Victoria's poker machine king, with more poker machines than anyone bar Lloyd Williams and the Crown Casino chairman, Ron Walker. In the circumstances, these are matters which the ASC and the ASX need to investigate to make sure that behaviour by brokers which damages the reputation of the Stock Exchange is not tolerated. Those points having been made-and they are important points of public interest which need to be made so that public confidence in the ASX does not suffer as a result of the kinds of revelations made by Stephen Mayne and others-there needs to be a proper investigation of those matters.

This is what the coalition understands, and again I stress that those on the opposite side failed to adequately grasp that a fundamental key to achieving greater economic growth is to give priority to business. I should hope, even though it has not happened in the past, that in the future all members in this place recognise this, because it is only by helping business to operate more efficiently that wealth can and will be created and that employment is generated. I am also a member of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, and I particularly welcome the changes that this bill will bring about. The Australian Stock Exchange, Australia's leading securities market, acts as the hub of the securities trading in the Australian economy. The ASX mission statement, on page 2 of the 1996 ASX annual report, has been defined as follows: To provide for the benefit of all participants, the most internationally competitive and fair market for financial securities and derivatives so as to enhance Australia's position as a regional financial centre. The Australian Stock Exchange is the 10th largest national equities market in the world and the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. It is one of the most technologically sophisticated equities markets in the world. Indeed, the ASX is a credit to our nation-and it is a shame that some people seem to want to use it as a tool to put their scurrilous allegations around. The frantic buying and selling atmosphere of the ASX reflects the hectic activity of the industry and the speed at which money changes hands in the new world economy. Because of the fast paced exchanges of information and capital in the 1990s, Australians cannot just look to the past and commend themselves on their successful efforts thus far, but rather we need to look forward and prepare for the next millennium. If we fail to meet the challenges presented to us we will be left behind-there is no doubt about that. Not only will we be isolated geographically but we will be isolated technologically as well. The decision to convert to a public company was not taken lightly. In deliberating over the option to demutualise, the board of the ASX considered the advice of external consultants who responded in the following way. They said: A mutual structure inhibited the flexibility and speed of decision-making that was necessary to meet growing competition ... This is from page 6 of the same ASX annual report that I referred to earlier. The members of the ASX in October 1996 voted overwhelmingly to demutualise the exchange, that is, to convert the ASX from a company limited by guarantee to a company limited by shares. The Howard government, in giving speedy passage to this bill, ensures that Australia will not be left behind in providing an efficient marketplace for the trading of securities by Australia's leading companies. The overwhelming success of the recent Telstra float demonstrates that millions of Australians, from all walks of life, are positively embracing the share market as a real investment option for their hard-earned dollars. Indeed, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Ian Campbell) alluded to in his second reading speech, more than 4.7 million Australians have investments in the share market. Proceeds of some $14 billion are expected from the sale of one-third of Telstra-I am not quite sure what we have actually got by now-and 81 per cent of this has been secured into Australian hands. That is good news for Australian families as well as for Australian businesses. 11550 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 November 1997 The rollover of private savings into business investment, which facilitates economic growth, requires the implementation of innovative and productive approaches to corporate governance structures. As shown by the demutilalisation of the Stockholm exchange in 1993, the conversion of the ASX into a public company will provide the mechanism for enhanced competitiveness of Australian capital markets, both internationally and domestically. The role of the ASX within the securities industry is threefold. Firstly, it acts as a market regulator. Secondly, it acts as a commercial entity conducting a public securities market as a business. Thirdly, it acts as a trade association protecting and promoting its members' interests. Under current arrangements the ASX is, in essence, a private body. It is a body which is not funded by government. However, in saying that, this legislation is necessary due to the fact that the Corporations Law does not allow a body such as the ASX to change its status to a public company under current administrative procedures. Moreover, legislation is required to ensure that, although converted, the ASX remains subject to appropriate accountability procedures. To achieve this the government, as well as the Australian Securities Commission, will oversee that the ASX is meeting its responsibilities. The demutualisation of the ASX will not diminish its market integrity or fair trading systems. The potential for conflict of interest has been removed with supervision by the Australian Securities Commission. Moreover, given the pivotal role the ASX plays in the nation's economy, the public interest of all Australians has been protected by the five per cent limit on shares available to both domestic and foreign investors. The coalition government, in formulating this bill, consulted with the states and territories and they all agreed upon this legislation. There is no financial impact to this measure. It is not a cost cutting measure, and neither does it have any significant financial impact on government. The Corporations Law Amendment (ASX) Bill 1997 represents plain good business sense, and we on this side of the House all recognise that it is good business decisions that serve to increase the wealth generating capacity of companies and individuals who in tum provide employment opportunities for Australian people. Job creation is the outcome of that: an outcome that we on this side of the House are taking action to encourage. It is on this positive note that I commend the bill to the House. Corporations Law Amendment (AS X) Bill 1997. In a nutshell, the bill will facilitate the demutualisation of the Australian Stock Exchange as the ASX changes its status from a mutual company to a publicly listed company limited by shares, with external ownership and operated for profit. The giant leap of faith by members of the ASX to demutualise occurred at a vote of its members in October of last year. That decision was based on business principles. This bill attempts to facilitate the proposed changes to the Australian Stock Exchange governance arrangements whilst at the same time ensuring that the role of the Australian Stock Exchange in the regulatory framework is not diminished or impaired at the risk of shareholders, companies and our nation's growing reputation as the key financial player in the South-East Asian basin. This will be achieved, principally, in four significant ways. Firstly, it will clarify the responsibilities of the Australian Stock Exchange, as a self-regulatory organisation, to ensure appropriate accountability of it to the Australian Securities Commission and the government.",126,Representatives Main Committee
314,Mr Bob Baldwin (Paterson) (10.45 A.m.),"It gives me great pleasure to speak on theThursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITfEE 11551 Secondly, it will continue the role of the Australian Securities Commission to supervise Australian Stock Exchange compliance with the listing rules in respect of the ASX's own listing. The Australian Stock Exchange will be listing on a market in which it acts as a selfregulator and administrator, hence the arms-length provision legislated to ensure the ongoing integrity of the Australian Stock Exchange. Thirdly, the bill will recognise the Australian Stock Exchange's altered relationship with brokers, and clarifies that as a corporate entity it will continue to be responsible for the conduct and integrity of market participants in trading on the Stock Exchange and in other activities. Fourthly, it limits individual Australian investors and foreign investors to owning and controlling no more than five per cent of the shares in the Australian Stock Exchange. This five per cent limit, which stands in contrast to the current individual limit on bank ownership of 10 per cent, shows, if nothing else, to the man or woman in the. street the principled financial integrity of this bill. That five per cent limit ensures that no significant foreign investment player will obtain a controlling interest in the Australian Stock Exchange. The figure could, in the eyes of some, seem a little ironic-especially when the recent Wallis inquiry into the financial sector painted the genuine picture that banks should be allowed to raise their restricted individual ownership levels from 10 per cent to 15 per cent-but I think it is an important irony and I will quickly explain why. The Australian Stock Exchange is generally perceived to be philosophically opposed to companies having share ownership restrictions-if for nothing else but to avoid a restriction on the depth of an individual listed company's share register, levels of liquidity or, potentially, stifled share trading. Why the restriction? The decision to restrict is one instilled by the current government to ensure that financial integrity and confidence in dealing with the Australian capital markets are enshrined. The decision is also about delivering peace of mind to the small, but extremely important, mum and dad investors in large investment houses and corporate share traders. The Australian financial market-for all its integrity, for all its hordes of commentators, brokers, market analysts, and for all the attention it receives-is, of course, a minor player in the global marketplace. Yes, we stand on our own two feet as the ongoing repercussions in parts of the Asian financial sector day by day is proving. But we cannot be seen, in this time of volatile world financial markets in particular, to be providing foreign investment players or overseas corporates with even a sniff that Australia is prepared to put its own market self-regulator even remotely in the control of anyone, two or three individual corporate entities, be they foreign or local. The bill is also about maintaining our Al financial integrity within the Australian capital markets. It would be fair to say that a fifth key element of the bill, in light of the members of the Australian Stock Exchange who voted overwhelmingly to demutualise, is that it amends the Corporations Law to permit the Australian Stock Exchange to change from a company limited by guarantee to one limited by shares. As the market regulator and overriding key player in Australia's capital markets, the Australian Stock Exchange presently acts as the national exchange for the trading of shares, bonds, notes and debentures of over 1,200 Australian and overseas companies, other entities, government and corporate. In terms of market capitalisation, it ranks 11th in world standing. As of 31 December 1996, its domestic market capitalisation was a quite incredible $392.8 billion. Annual turnover for 11552 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 November 1997 the 1996 year was $185.8 billion, which was undertaken via 4.7 million separate transactions. These figures vindicate the record equities market activity which has occurred on the Australian Stock Exchange over the past year. They are the kinds of figures that would make somebody like Karl Marx tum over in his grave, along with those who have followed in modem history since that abhor the concept of capital markets. They are figures that show that a growing number of Australians are importantly investing in the Stock Exchange and are confident of putting part of their savings into equity investments. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not need to remind you of the Telstra float and how successful that was, in particular for the mums and dads of Australia. These are the kinds of figures which have acted as the foundation rock for the recently successful part privatisation ofTelstra and its listing on the Australian Stock Exchange. Share investment has become a way of life in the 1990s and this bill is a way of ensuring that the integrity of the market and the integrity of the Australian Stock Exchange in general is kept. When I add that the Australian Stock Exchange, perhaps not as an entity but as the selfregulator of the Australian Stock Exchange per se, has achieved an important position in the general public's thinking and investment strategies, I wish to digress towards some wonderful developments occurring in relation to capital markets in the Hunter region. The Hunter, to a lot of people, would not be even considered as a potential new growth market for the financial sector. I urge the members of this House to think again. The Stock Exchange of Newcastle is presently in the midst of doing something very visionary for the Hunter and has set in train a new industry with immense employment opportunities for the 21st century. The exchange, which is now in its 60th year of existence, is in the process of completing a review and restructure of its operations to enable it to conduct a stock marketyes, an individual stock market in the Hunter-that specialises in the securities of small, medium and regional enterprises. In layman's terms, the exchange is attempting to reactivate the establishing of an electronic trading system within the Hunter to operate a fully-fledged alternative equity market. Its moves to do so were the result of the members of the exchange wanting to assist thousands of small to medium enterprises across Australia who are seeking additional equity capital of between $500,000 and $1 million and, of course, more. I might take the time to remind people that one of Australia's most successful companies, Brambles, had its beginnings by listing on the Newcastle Stock Exchange many years ago. The stock exchange's vision is being matched by the federal government's general approach to reform of fundraising for businesses, particularly for small to medium enterprises, under the corporate law economic reform program. Similarly, it is a forerunner to what could be expected should the government look favourably on the yet to be released Study of a growth equity market for Australia, which was prepared for the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism( Mr Moore) by the Catalyst Institute. The report will be the end result of an inquiry into the range of problems associated with small to medium enterprises obtaining effective access to effective equity finance. I very much envisage the Stock Exchange of Newcastle's proposal for a vibrant alternative equity market-upon its approval by the ASC, where, as I understand it, developments are progressing well-will vindicate the government's thinking that alternative equity markets have a place in Australia, not so much to compete with the Australian Stock Exchange as to carry Thursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 11553 the excess companies who do not perceive the value of being, or simply cannot be afford to be, on the main board. From day one, since my election to this House, I fervently backed the Stock Exchange of Newcastle's proposal-a proposal driven by the likes of John Tonkin, Chairman of the exchange, and directors Barry Rees and Stephen Pritchard. There is a reason I have stuck my neck out to do what it takes; to lobby the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Ian Campbell, on the merits of this proposal, and to put John Moore continually in the picture. If the government is keen to facilitate the development of alternative equity markets, here is a perfect example of what can be achieved both in jobs and in facilitated new investment and immense opportunities linked to this project. That primary reason is jobs, and plenty of new jobs in an exciting new industry sector for the Hunter. County NatWest Securities, one of the leading financial houses, believes that 2,500 new long-term jobs and an upgrading of the skills base of employment across the Hunter are just two very realistic and possible outcomes if the proposed trading facilities of the Newcastle Stock Exchange get the necessary support of my government. That support, of course, comes in the form of the ASC which, under both the existing Corporations Law and the intentions behind the CLERP reforms, must for financial integrity ensure that the Newcastle Stock Exchange stacks up on paper. As the relevant i's are dotted and t's are crossed, I believe that will occur; and Senator Ian Campbell himself is quite excited about the merits of the exchange's ideas. It makes you wonder why neither the former Keating government nor Labor fellow Hunter parliamentarians showed little interest in exploring the depths that fostering alternative equity provisions for small to medium enterprises could achieve for regional economies, let alone for the greater Australian economic picture. In due course, along with my colleague, Hunter based Senator John Tierney, I will be pushing the case for the Stock Exchange of Newcastle to Ipeet the necessary regulatory hurdles to become a part of the government's new industry vision for this nation and for the Hunter. That push will also continue on a financial front, at the appropriate time. I have already had long discussions with the member for Ballarat( Mr Ronaldson), who is the government's key driver of the Commonwealth's $10 million commitment to the Hunter-as part of the joint state-BHP financial support package-about the immense merits of the stock exchange'S proposals and assistance in funding an electronic trading platform. Such a platform would cost anywhere between $500,000 and $700,000-which I think produces a very good return on investment for jobs, if we can help foster 2,500 created jobs out of the Newcastle Stock Exchange in the years ahead. My push to secure Commonwealth dollars through that avenue of funding will continue unabashed and unabated. Let us not forget the net loss from BHP at the end of 1999 in Newcastle is that same figure. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you question my excitable support for the proposal-which is anything but pie in the sky-the words of the Newcastle Stock Exchange Chairman, John Tonkin, in a recent press statement, will lay the significance of a proposal down on the table. He said: This is a very exciting initiative, with real upside potential for jobs and investment in the Hunter. Local Hunter Parliamentarian Bob Baldwin, who has been a powerful lobbyist and go-between to entice Commonwealth interest in the proposed creation of an operative alternative equity market within the Hunter from day one, along with Senator Tierney, have both overseen the preparation of the submission. 11554 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 November 1997 Both Parliamentarians to their credit, have given their support and real commitment to the project. The Hunter has many firms who would benefit greatly from an injection of capital. They are his words, not mine. Also, I bring to the House's attention a newspaper article of 20 November of this year, entitled 'Money on for bigger city stock exchange', a report by Scott Tucker. Rather than take up the time of this chamber, I seek leave to have that article incorporated in the Hansard. It has been agreed to by the opposition. you can only put figures in and not text. of jobs and public investment in established and emerging regional industries, if a proposal to the Australian Securities Commission and Federal Government gains support. The Stock Exchange of Newcastle Limited is awaiting feedback on its submission and hopes the Minister for Industry, Mr Moore, will provide federal funds, possibly through the Hunter Advantage Fund, to help establish local trading. It says the proposal, which followed the release of a report by County NatWest Securities Australia Limited into the commercial potential of small to medium businesses in the Hunter, would offer many financial and social benefits to the region. The Newcastle trading proposal has won support from a range of regional business leaders, including Australian Business Limited, Newcastle Regional Chamber of Commerce, Newcastle Law Society, the Australian Society of Practising Accountants and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. 'Some 2500 long-term local jobs and an upgrading of skills base of employment in the Newcastle region are just two of the possible outcomes,' the chairman of the Stock Exchange of Newcastle Limited, Mr John Tonkin, said. 'An electronic trading system at the Newcastle Stock Exchange would put local companies in contact with the many private and public sources of capital throughout Australia and internationally.' Although the Newcastle trading proposal is being considered for approval by the Australian Securities Commission, the Newcastle Stock Exchange itself is not a new idea. The exchange was first established in 1937 following a meeting of residents and has operated continuously from that date, except for 1940 to 1947 to enable members to enlist for World War II. On February 7, 1972, it was incorporated as a company with 13 members and during its heyday had up to 300 listed companies, ranging from local businesses to large national interests, but today the exchange is merely a group of four members trading among each other and through the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) in Sydney. In its submission, the Stock Exchange of Newcastle Limited said it hoped to establish a new and innovative electronic trading system in Newcastle, to help companies raise capital and to allow investors to buy and sell securities in companies which were not catered for under the ASX's listing rules. The submission said the Newcastle Stock Exchange's rules had been rewritten to reflect current international standards, and predicted at least 25 companies could be listed in the proposed trading system's first six months of operation. On that note, there are a lot of companies in the Hunter who are just waiting for extra capital but do not have the ability to list on the major boards. By allowing this to operate, by allowing injections of capital, by allowing ventures to go ahead in the Hunter rather than going offshore, we will see those jobs created-very necessary jobs-that will bring unemployment in the Hunter region down perhaps to equity with that of the city areas, rather than being maintained at around three to four points higher than the cities.",128,Representatives Main Committee

316,Mr Bob Baldwin,"I will not dispute you on that. I will read it. It states:Thursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 11555 The reason that that has happened is this. After the very early shutdown days of BHP, it dropped from over 13,000 employees to under 3,000 under the former Labor governmentwithout a lot of input, without a lot of direction from the former government, whose only attempt to rectify that was the steel plan. And as we heard our great minister yesterday say in the House, and he has said it before, not one cent of the Button steel plan was invested in the Hunter. Not one cent was invested in the Hunter. But those people in the Hunter-their taxpayer dollars that were put into that steel plan-did not receive one benefit. The only benefit they have received is the unemployment benefits, as Labor st-ipped away over 10,000 jobs directly at BHP and many, many thousands more indirectly. we have that master of the pencil, the member for Corio( Mr O'Connor), who helped pencil the Button plan. I ask you: who has the interests of the Hunter at heart? We have. Why have we got them at heart? Because we are determined to deliver jobs; we are determined to deliver outcomes; we actually care for the people in the Hunter. Bill 1997 will bring about the demutualisation of the Australian Stock Exchange, involving conversiqn from a company limited by a guarantee to a company limited by shares. As a result, the concept of market access will be distinguished from the ownership of the ASX. In facilitating this demutualisation, the bill will also ensure that, in the ASX becoming a public company, its role as an industry regulator is not diminished or undermined. To achieve this, the bill provides for a number of limitations. Firstly, the responsibilities of the ASX as a self-regulatory organisation are clarified. Secondly, the bill provides that the Australian Securities Commission is to supervise the ASX's compliance with its own listing rules. Thirdly, the bill ensures that no-one can own or control more than five per cent of the shares in the ASX. Lastly, provision is made for the accountability of the ASX to the Australian Securities Commission and the government. . The ASX is owned, controlled by and run on behalf of its members under its own constitution and operating rules. Its membership is currently composed of the brokers who use the exchange to deal in the securities of businesses and governments. From its sometimes turbulent history, three clearly identifiable roles have emerged. It is a market regulator, commonly referred to as a self-regulatory organisation; it is a trade association which represents the interests of its members; and it is a commercial entity which operates a public securities market as a business. The ASX considers that its central purpose is 'to conduct markets in which investors and enterprises come together with confidence to create prosperity through the sharing of risks and rewards'. Accordingly, the ASX has come to play perhaps the pivotal role in Australia's capital markets. Specifically, it is the national exchange for the trading of the shares, notes, bonds and debentures of over 1,200 Australian and overseas companies and other entities. In the lead-up to its demutualisation, the ASX has had an extraordinarily successful period, particularly over the 1996-97 financial year. In that 12-month period, the value of foreign investments in Australian domestic equities rose by 15 per cent to $125 billion in the quarter ending March 1997. Capitalisation of the domestic market increased 27 per cent over the 199697 financial year to reach a record $444 billion at 30 June, comprising a 22 per cent rise in",132,Representatives Main Committee

The equities market, which is at the heart of the ASX's operations, was the 10th largest national equities market in the world last year. Equity transactions averaged over 20,000 a day, and the busiest single day saw over 36,000 transactions. The 12-month total was a staggering 5.39 million transactions. On a world scale, according to the Global Securities Consulting Services survey, the ASX ranked in the top three exchanges for operational risk, settlement services and value for money. At the close of the 1996-97 financial year, based on the average domestic market capitalisation, Australia had the third largest share market in South-East Asia. And to top off this spectacular year, the ASX's all-ordinaries and all-industrial indexes out-performed Japan's Topix and market-weighted index for South-East Asia. The ASX has not been complacent about its performances over the years. It has sought to further its gains by investing in technological advances, so much so that it is now in a position to offer outstanding service to its customers. Particularly noteworthy is the ASX plan to assist companies, from early 1998, to source informal equity finance on an Internet vehicle called the enterprise market. Basically, the enterprise market operates as a sophisticated financial dating service. Capital seekers, capital providers and venture capital intermediaries can be introduced in the one electronic space, therefore facilitating the development of venture capital as an established asset in Australia. The ASX has invested in superior technology systems, such as SEATS 97, the new trading platform for the equities market, and CLICK, an automated trading system to replace floor trading in the derivatives market, which together represent world best practice in trading technology. Yet, despite the exceptional performance of the ASX and its willingness to embrace innovation, it is an institution that is vulnerable to. competition, particularly of a global nature. This vulnerability of stock exchanges was not lost on the six state stock markets which amalgamated to form the ASX in 1987. They realised in the early 1980s that technological advances made them more vulnerable to competition and that an electronic market, which channelled orders from around Australia into one place, would provide the two most vital aspects of a stock exchange--optimum price discovery and maximised liquidity. This transformation marked the beginning of an increased adaptation to a changing environment. However, we now know that securities markets no longer recognise national boundaries. The mobility of investors and their capital, company listings, corporate structures, skilled labours and, potentially, stock exchanges have created global markets where players can, and do, cross borders in search of better operating conditions and those elusive dollars. Mr Deputy Speaker, you need no better example of that comment than the volatility in stock exchanges and in equity markets around the world in October, where we saw a massive flight to quality. At the end of the day, the Australian Stock Exchange can hold its head high over the way that it handled that volatility. Thursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 11557 The ASX faces challenges from other stock exchanges, which are engaged in trying to entice Australian businesses to their shores, as well as from the Internet, which will bring as yet untried share trading possibilities. But share market globalisation works both ways. Just as our ASX will have to watch its back, it will also have new opportunities for creating markets, attracting overseas investors and, importantly, forging regional alliances in the vein of the memorandums of understanding signed with the Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges. The ASX is well placed to meet the challenges presented by globalised markets head on. It is currently a financially sound institution which, after a decade, has not only a strong, positive cash flow, but net assets of around $158 million. Its markets have developed strongly over the past 10 years. The value of trading grew from a daily average of $264 million in June 1987 to a remarkable $1.14 billion in June 1997. The derivatives market experienced a similar rate of growth, from under three million options contracts in 1986-87 to just over 10 million in the 1996-97 period. The capitalisation of the equities market rose at a rate faster than the economy as a whole. Equity capital raisings have averaged $15 billion a year over the past five years, with new issues far exceeding new floats. This decade of growth and diversification in the Australian Stock Exchange has also been distinguished by unprecedented demutualisations of large insurance companies and the privatisation of key government owned institutions. One of the most successful floats has undoubtedly been the recent Telstra IPO, which now boasts 1.8 million shareholders-so successful that the federal government originally under-estimated the total sale value by nearly one-half. At this point, I would like to offer my congratulations to the Minister for Finance and Administration ( Mr Fahey) who has done an outstanding job. John Fahey has laid his-hands, in a way that can only be described as an outstanding achievement, on the most significant IPO in Australia's history. I would join with this House in congratulating the minister on what has been the most successful IPO in the world this year. Privatisation of various government institutions has also resulted in phenomenal share subscriptions, as we recently saw. The Commonwealth Bank now has over 370,000 shareholders, the GIO Australia 100,000, and Qantas 105,000. Shareholdings in demutualised insurance mutuals are just as remarkable. The National Mutual has some 500,000 shareholders and Colonial Mutual 460,000 shareholders. Soon the AMP will be listing with over one million shareholders and a significant number of those shareholders, particularly through demutualisation, are first time investors. Running in tandem with this change in trading focus has been a readjustment in the compilation of consumer shareholders so astounding that today 4.7 million Australians directly own shares, compared to only 1.5 million in 1987. Indeed, the mums and dads of Australia are snapping up blue-chip listings like a shark pursuing a school of fish through muddied watersshareholdings in demutualised insurance enterprises and privatised government institutions, the mums and dads of Australia have staked their claims in publicly listed companies such as the National Australia Bank, now with over 240,000 shareholders, Woolworths with 251,000, and BHP with 300,000 shareholders. And of course, it is not insignificant that of the 1.8 million Telstra shareholders, 600,000 or more are first-time investors.",133,Representatives Main Committee
320,Mr Sawford,'Shark' is the operative word.,135,Representatives Main Committee
321,Mr Hockey,"and I will attribute that to Dave Brockhoff. In addition to large11558 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 November 1997 The 1997 Australian share ownership survey revealed that 20 per cent of Australian adults, approximately 2.2 million Australians, now have direct investments in ASX listed equities. And after the Telstra float, that figure is 2.8 million and it will, of course, be even higher after the demutualisation of the AMP. In addition, the average value of private investors' portfolios has risen from $26,000 in 1994 to $33,000 today. Sigriificantly, these figures are not too dissimilar from those of the United Kingdom and Canada and, of course, the United Kingdom has had the most significant and successful privatisation program in the OECD world. These survey results suggest that private investors directly owned about $86 billion in equities at the end of May 1997. The fact that nearly 40 per cent of the Australian shareholders have a yearly household income of less than $50,000; that nearly one-third of all 25to 34year-olds own shares; that there has been a significant increase in share ownership amongst women, which is particularly pleasing-they now constitute almost one-third of all share investors-and that the dominance of older people in the share market has declined, flies in the face of the old-time perception that the stock market is merely a playground for the rich. On the contrary, these figures suggest the dawning of a new age in share market ownership. The Australian public has flocked to the floating of enterprises which have stood the test of time, weathering the good times with the bad. But there is yet another factor which has impacted on the decision by members of the ASX to demutualise, and that is the effect of trading on the Internet. This takes globalisation of world markets one step further, adding both an air of uncertainty and anticipation to global trading. In July 1996, it was estimated that Australians represented approximately one million of the 60 million individuals with access to the Internet, making Australia the fourth largest country of Internet users worldwide. If analysts are correct, by 2000 there could be between 500 million and 800 million Internet users worldwide, and over one billion by 2005. What this means for global trading is mind-boggling. The concept that Australians will be buying and selling shares from the comfort of their living rooms is very real. And it is into this environment that the ASX plans to forge its future as a demutualised institution, an institution with a proud 126-year history which, from its first amalgamation through to its adoption of the latest technology, has proven itself to be adaptable and progressive. In short, it is an institution whose publicly listed shares will be devoured by the Australian public. The decision to demutualise the ASX shows great discernment on the part of its current members. The pressures of increasingly globalised trading, which have brought competition across borders, coupled with the desire of the Australian public to own a piece of established Australian institutions, has meant that a change in direction for the ASX could not have been more timely. This demutualisation is a magnificent opportunity for the strengths of the ASX to be shared among the people of Australia in addition to furthering, in the words of the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) 'the reputation of Australia's capital markets as among the best in the world'. The demutualised ASX will combine with our stable economy, our low inflation and a government clearly committed to substantial taxation reform to encourage further foreign investment and therefore the creation of even more jobs in Australia. At this point, I would like to offer my very sincere congratulations to the pioneering efforts of the chairman of the ASX, Maurice Newman, to the managing director of the ASX, Mr Thursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 11559 Richard Humphry, and to the board and to all the members of the Australian Stock Exchange. They have led the Stock Exchange through this very difficult period because they have a vision for the Stock Exchange which means that demutualisation is the first step towards Australia having an even more successful stock exchange in the world markets. I commend the Corporations Law Amendment (ASX) Bill 1997 to the House as an example of yet another great Australian institution ready to meet the challenges of an increasingly globalised economy and the desire of the Australian public to be a part of this future. debate. The Australian share market and the Australian Stock Exchange are very important to the people of Australia. This was indicated most obviously during the recent Telstra float, which was four times oversubscribed when the mums and dads of Australia showed that they wanted to participate in part ownership of a major national company. The result of the Telstra one-third sale will mean that Australia could well become the country in the world which has the largest percentage of share ownership amongst its popUlation. I believe the Labor Party stands condemned for not supporting the one-third sale of Telstra, and personally I hope that the coalition goes to the next election seeking a mandate from the people to sell more of this important national company. The government has always said that it would not sell any more than one-third of Telstra without a further mandate from the Australian people. I believe the fact that we will have 1.8 or 1.9 million shareholders in this company indicates that there is a demand there-four times oversubscribed-and that it would be appropriate for the government to consider floating more of this important national company. The purpose of the Corporations Law Amendment (ASX) Bill 1997 is to facilitate the demutualisation of the Australian Stock exchange. This will mean that, like many other Australian companies, it will seek to be a mutual company and that it will become a public company limited by shares with external ownership and operated for profit. The government is not seeking to impose this demutualisation; this is the result of a decision made by the members of the Australian Stock Exchange themselves. Everyone knows what an important role the Australian Stock Exchange plays in Australia's capital markets. In fact there are three aspects to its role within the securities industry. Firstly, it is a market regulator; secondly, it is a commercial entity conducting a public securities market as a business; and, thirdly, it is a trade association representing the interests of its members. I believe this legislation, when carried, will facilitate the carrying out of the role that the Australian Stock Exchange has performed in Australia over a very large number of years. The ASX is the front-line operator of the day-to-day operations of the stock market. In making and administering the listing rules regulating listed companies, it occupies a formal, statutorily recognised position in the system of co-regulation of companies and securities with the Australian Securities Commission. The ASX is currently organised and governed in a manner that is traditional for stock exchanges. As I said, this bill seeks to tum it from a mutual company into a public company limited by shares, but in effect it is presently a cooperative owned and controlled by members and run on behalf of its members under its own constitution and operating rules. As has been indicated by other speakers, members are the brokers who use the exchange to deal in the securities of businesses and governments. I believe it was a very forward-thinking action by",135,Representatives Main Committee
322,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (11.21 A.m.),"I am very pleased to be able to participate in this11560 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 November 1997 the members of the Australian Stock Exchange to effectively ask the government to bring this legislation into effect so that the Australian Stock Exchange will be well placed to face the challenges of the new millennium. The bill will facilitate the proposed changes to the ASX's governance arrangements while at the same time ensure that the role of the ASX in the regulatory framework is not diminished or impaired as a result of its conversion to a public company. It is very important that the current overwhelming confidence that the Australian people have in the Australian Stock Exchange is maintained. This will be achieved in a number of ways. Firstly, the bill clarifies the responsibilities of the ASX as a self-regulatory organisation and ensures appropriate accountability of the ASX to the ASC and the government in carrying out its SRO responsibilities. Secondly, the bill will limit persons and their associates, both Australian and those from overseas, to owning and controlling no more than five per cent of the shares in the ASX. That is very important considering the key role that the ASX currently plays. The five per cent limit can be contrasted with the current individual limit on bank ownership of 10 per cent. That lower percentage shows that the government is very serious about making sure that there is a dispersed share ownership of the Australian Stock Exchange following the passage of this bill. Another important thing that the bill does is provide that the Australian Securities Commission will supervise the compliance by the ASX with the listing rules in respect of its own listing, the listing of the ASX. That is very important, and I know other speakers have highlighted the fact that this is a vital safeguard. The bill also recognises the altered relationship of the ASX with brokers and clarifies the point that the ASX continues to be responsible for the conduct and integrity of market participants in trading on the ASX and in related activities. Efficient capital markets are absolutely essential to the government's objective of achieving higher economic growth. Most people in the community would accept that we have done a very good job there. Our predictions of growth are likely to be fulfilled, despite the currency crises which have swept across some of the nations to our north. Efficient capital markets are also essential to our objective of facilitating private sector investment, employment generation and wealth creation. The Australian Stock Exchange plays a central role in the efficient operation of the Australian economy. That was why, when this legislation was being looked at, it was absolutely essential to niake sure that it was balanced legislation and that the safeguards that are included in the bill were in fact included. The ASX is too important to Australia to risk undermining the essential role it plays and the confidence that people have in it. As I said earlier, the vital role of the ASX was highlighted by the way it handled the Telstra float. The honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hockey) was generous in congratulating the Minister for Finance and Administration ( Mr Fahey), and I would like to join him in congratulating the minister on what I believe was an absolutely outstanding job. There will be a very large boost to the Australian share market as a result of the Telstra float. The honourable member for North Sydney also referred to the coming demutualisation of the AMP Society which will see about another one million shareholders added to the share market. That follows the demutualisation of both the National Mutual life office and the Thursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 11561 Colonial Mutual life office. So this bill which will demutualise the ASX really is very much in line with actions taken by other important national institutions. Australian share ownership is currently at 22 per cent and indirect share ownership at 36 per cent. As I said, after the sale of one-third of Telstra and after the demutualisation of the AMP, we will find that Australians will have maybe the highest level of share ownership of any country in the world. While the Labor Party, with respect to most legislation brought into the parliament, usually likes to look back 10, 20 or even 30 years, it is, on this occasion, supporting the bill, and I commend the Labor Party for that. I believe it is vital that parliamentarians join together when legislation has widespread acceptance in the community. The fact that both sides of politics are supporting the bill is an indication of the importance of the bill, and the benefits that it will bring to the Australian Stock Exchange and to the Australian share market. It is obvious that having an up-to-date, well-run and efficient stock exchange is essential, particularly when one looks at the recent market correction which took place in this country and when one looks at the diminution in the value of shares in other countries throughout the world. This bill is all about encouraging the ongoing, efficient role of the Australian Stock Exchange for the next century. It is a mature stock exchange. We have a mature market and we are a very mature country. Demutualisation is, I believe, a sign that the Australian Stock Exchange has grown up and it is an important step in facilitating an appropriate role for the ASX in the 21st century. This is an important piece of legislation because it will ensure that there is a more effective and appropriate corporate structure. This will enhance the competitiveness of the Australian Stock Exchange and the Australian capital markets domestically and internationally. It brings into effect the overwhelmingly expressed wishes of the current members of the Australian Stock Exchange, and it brings about something that the ASX needs-that is, a more flexible corporate structure because of the likelihood of increased competition between the ASX, the SFE, and other emerging Australian exchanges, should some of the Wallis recommendations and other reforms under the government's current corporate law economic reform program be implemented. Some people have wondered whether the ASX, as a public for-profit company, can legitimately continue its role of effective surveillance and regulation of the market. In response, it ought to be noted that it will be in the interests of the Australian Stock Exchange to maintain the integrity of the market and the stringent regulation of its listing rules. The market would detect any lapse of standards and this naturally would have an adverse impact concerning investment and listings. I have pointed out that the ASX will not be responsible for the regulation of its own listing, that this will be carried out by the ASC. It is important not only that the right thing be done but also that it be seen to be done. This is a vital provision. The government will also clarify the ASX as a self-regulatory organisation in ensuring the honesty and integrity of the securities market for which it is responsible, and will make improvements where necessary to the regulatory framework governing the conduct of public stock markets. Some people have said that the ASX might use this opportunity to charge higher prices. But it ought to be noted that the ASX is already subject to competition and presently it has the capacity to increase charges for the services it provides. This would continue whether or not it demutualises. In any event, the market will playa very important role in ensuring that costs are kept to a reasonable level because the ASX would certainly not, as a publicly listed 11562 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 27 November 1997 company, want to be losing business to overseas exchanges or to competing exchanges in this country. Some people may have said that there are no foreign ownership controls but the government has covered that by pointing out that no individual would be able to own more than 5 per cent of the Australian Stock Exchange as a publicly listed company. This is balanced legislation which prepares the Australian Stock Exchange for the next century. It is legislation which is strongly supported by the current members of the Australian Stock Exchange, and it is legislation that is backed by both sides of the parliament. It is good, sound legislation and I am very pleased that it will be receiving the overwhelming support of this chamber. I commend the bill to the committee. Corporations Law Amendment (AS X) Bill and join with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fisher( Mr Slipper), in congratulating the House on the bipartisan approach to this quite revolutionary development that will be happening to the Australian Stock Exchange. the responsibilities of the ASX as a self-regulatory organisation and ensuring appropriate accountability of the Australian Stock Exchange to the ASC and to the government in carrying out its self-regulatory organisational responsibilities; limiting persons and their associates, Australian and foreign, to owning or controlling no more than five per cent of the shares in the Australian Stock Exchange; and providing that the ASC supervises the ASX's compliance with its listing rules in respect of the ASX's own proposed listing. But the evolution of this bill, the Corporations Law Amendment (ASX) Bill 1997 has occurred so that the nexus between the ownership of the Stock Exchange and the access to the share market will be broken. The ownership of the Australian Stock Exchange will be open to anyone who wishes to buy its shares while access to the markets will also be available. The principal reason why Australian Stock Exchange members recommended that the government make amendments to the Corporations Law Amendment (ASX) Bill 1997 was because the financial market and the global environment that we are in have changed quite significantly and have brought new challenges to the Australian Stock Exchange. There have been structural changes, particularly with the globalisation of financial markets and crossborder competition of listing, trading and competition within Australia. One of the principal reasons why it needs to be demutualised is that the Australian Stock Exchange needs funds路 for further capital expansion. Why? Because of the increasing competition of globalisation and the necessity to have new technology and communication. Likewise, in the past where governments have been barriers of control, they are no longer, particularly when it comes to exchange rates or to the flow of capital, so further assistance is needed to the ASX particularly to raise capital. Institutional investors can also move money anywhere and cross-border activities amount to over $6 trillion. Therefore it is essential that we hold on to our local companies and we need a more flexible approach while attracting foreign companies to have either listings or joint listings on the Australian Stock Exchange. With the advent of new technology, more sophisticated computer hardware and software will be needed to meet the challenges in the future.

The funding for this came from the Securities Institute Development Account, SIDA, and the National Guarantee Fund, NGF. However, in this new environment of low interest rates and the requirements for higher margin calls and deposits and with the advent of more sophisticated derivatives-and of course there is added competition now with the Australian Stock Exchange against the SFE-higher surplus funds will no longer be as available as they have been in the past for expanding new technologies that are necessary to maintain our competitive edge and indeed to increase it, particularly to North Asia. Therefore, the Australian Stock Exchange must generate more of its own funds to replace existing hardware and software systems. The bottom line that was principally behind this key decision to demutualise was to raise further finance. Thus the Corporations Law needed to be amended because the corporations laws at present do not permit a company limited by guarantee to change its structure to a company limited by shares, which is exactly the status for all other companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. That came from the ASE research information paper. . Members should also understand that the Australian Stock Exchange is the central facilitator for Australian capital markets and provides a vital role in the allocation of savings of Australians to productive capital investment. Clearly this is what was demonstrated recently with the listing of Telstra. One of the other driving forces behind the demutualisation decision was that the Australian Stock Exchange has a very unusual balance sheet and over 80 per cent of the financial assets are in cash. Quite frankly this is not an appropriate structure for the future for this type of organisation as it competes against other global exchanges to attract capital-although the Australian Stock Exchange has had a tremendous track record to date. Certainly, looking back over the past 10 years, in the market capitalisation of early 1986-87 when I worked in the equities market myself, domestic equities were $184 billion. That figure today has gone to over $444 billion in domestic equities or market capitalisation. When you include the overseas equities in 1986-87, which was a very small $42 billion, that figure has now gone to $290 billion. In total, we have seen a rise in market capitalisation from the mid1980s from $226 billion to over $734 billion. That is a great credit to the Australian Stock Exchange. An interesting factor, though, is that the actual number of listed companies has decreased from the early 1986-87 figure of 1,320 to just under 1,200 today. We have seen huge numbers of mergers and takeovers-and, obviously, companies that have not complied to ASX have been delisted-and we have seen a far more transparent and fair regulatory environment, which was very different to the 1980s, where the corporate cowboys were evident wherever you looked. In actual equity raising, there has been a massive increase in equity raising this year of over $16 billion. We have seen record turnovers and record participation of Australians in equity ownership: from 22 per cent, as mentioned by the previous speaker, up to 36 per cent indirectly-which is very different from where Australia was at 10 or even 15 years ago. At the current rate, we could well surpass the United States, particularly, which has one of the highest equity participation ratios.",140,Representatives Main Committee
326,Mr Slipper,"It is almost certain.11564 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 November 1997 purpose of the bill is to enable the conversion of the Australian Stock Exchange to a public company. The Australian Stock Exchange, as mentioned, is presently a company limited by guarantee and, therefore, the liability of its members is limited to the respective amounts that the members undertake to contribute to the property of the company if it is wound up. This really is obsolete in this age. Contrast this with companies limited by shares, with the liability of members being limited to any amount which is unpaid on their shares. Each member currently in the Australian Stock Exchange has an equal interest in the company; therefore it is termed a mutual organisation. That is why it is being demutualised. This decision was reached on 22 October 1996, where the members of the Australian Stock Exchange voted 540 to 22 to demutualise-which was quite extraordinary, because they actually had tried to do this a number of times in the past, but were not able to reach the magical 75 per cent of membership approval. Thus the ASX will be converting from a company limited by guarantee to a company limited by shares. As I mentioned before, the Australian Stock Exchange plays a vital role in facilitating the trading of securities in listed companies and performs a regulatory role through the use of its listing rules and its ultimate power to delist a company. Certainly, there have been concerns that the Australian Securities Commission may eventually absorb most of ASX's regulatory functions. We will have to wait and see. Indications are at this stage that most of those functions will remain with the Australian Stock Exchange-with, of course, the exemption of its own listing. The main provisions in the bill, in proposed sections 766E to 7661, have the effect of prohibiting any person from being entitled to more than five per cent of the voting shares in the Australian Stock Excr .nge. There has been much debate over why the Australian Stock Exchange has such a low limit, particularly when compared with foreign companies, who are limited at 15 per cent; with banks, at 10 per cent; and indeed with casinos, which have to have regulatory approval to go above five per cent. I believe there is very strong justification-even though it might fly in the face of having an availability to move up to higher holdings in capital markets-for it to be essential that the ASX has a very broad diversity of ownership so that no particular institution can gain control of the ASX, which is obviously one of the main facilitators for capital in Australia. And it is in the public interest that no individual person gain control of the ASX. So there are very good reasons why the government has decided to limit the level to five per cent, and I am encouraged to see that the opposition also endorses that. The other principal reason, of course, is that it becomes more liquid. This is particularly important. We certainly do not want to see foreign companies having any further control, particularly in an environment where it is very competitive amongst the New York Stock Exchange, Tokyo, London, or, of course, the new developing markets in Asia. The other proposed section is 769A to 769D, and they are concerned with the Australian Stock Exchange ensuring that each stock market of the exchange is an orderly and fair market and that there are adequate arrangements for monitoring and enforcing compliance. Part of this comes down to the actual administrative and voting structure of the new demutualised stock exchange. There will not be a requirement, as there has been in the past, for decisions to be made where there has to be 75 per cent in favour of a decision. It was very difficult to reach that, because the ownership to date has been by stockbrokers.",141,Representatives Main Committee
327,Mr Anthony,"Certainly, with the demutualisation of the AMP, this will happen. TheThursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 11565 What will happen now with regard to the decision making ability of the Australian Stock Exchange after demutualisation is that there will be a board that will be principally making those decisions. Those decisions can be made more rapidly and be more relevant to what is happening with public companies today. As you look towards the future of the Australian Stock Exchange, it has had a tremendous growth rate. We have managed to obtain enormous amounts of capital internally through a number of public listings such as Telstra. This has seen a rapid increase in share ownership across Australia; we have also seen the demutualisation of other organisations, particularly Colonial, National Mutual and, of course, the big one, AMP, which will be, potentially, quite revolutionary: over another million shareholders could enter the market. By demutualising and becoming more modem, the Australian Stock Exchange will have an ability to raise capital, because it has a limited balance sheet now. Its balance sheet can become more flexible, and decision making can be made more appropriately. We can maintain our competitive edge, but, more importantly, be a beacon to continue to attract foreign listings onto the Australian Stock Exchange to路 develop new and more sophisticated derivatives markets-for which the ASX have been leaders, along with the Sydney Futures Exchangeand, likewise, capitalise on the uncertainty that is happening now to our northern neighbours in South-East Asia and also to north Asia. With a number of scandals that have been happening for many years now in Japan-one of their largest security houses, Yam aichi , potentially going into liquidation-with their banking system, there is a great advantage for Australia, for the Australian Securities Exchange, and for financial markets to stake out a much bigger claim in Asia. There is also the benefit of the time zone that we are in and our transparency. The other advantages we have are a very sophisticated IT industry and a transparent financial system and these can be used to the advantage of the Australian Securities Exchange. In conclusion, I endorse the move to have the Corporations Law Amendment Bill amended to take into account the demutualisation of the Australian Stock Exchange. It has done a terrific job-so has the chairman, I might add, Maurice Newman-and I do believe that the next decade will be an exciting decade. We are leading the way for this demutualisation. There have been other exchanges which have not gone to full demutualisation, for example Stockholm, and there are three other exchanges in Europe. This is a new frontier amongst capital markets, but if we lead the way then there are other markets and other availabilities that we might be able to trade on. I congratulate ASX and also the House for its bipartisan support of this bill. a.m.)-in reply-I would just like to thank those people who have participated in the debate.

First of all, the member for Wills( Mr Kelvin Thomson), the only member who spoke from the opposition, quoted some figures in regard to the Australian Stock Exchange annual report, claiming that there have been large falls in the Australian Stock Exchange funding.

The member for Wills also made comments relating to the issue of public confidence in the Australian stock exchange in the context of allegations that different shareholders may be treated differently in the allocation of shares in popular floats. It would be inappropriate to discuss specifically the circumstances of particular allegations made today. Those are matters for the ASC as the independent statutory regulator of the markets. Let me say that I think there is a constant theme from some people in the opposition to play personality politics rather than policy politics, and this was a classic example of that here today. It is just personality politics rather than a case of getting on with the debate of the issue at hand. I will however make a number of general points in reply. The bill will impose a specific obligation on the Australian Stock Exchange in paragraph 769A(i)(c) to have adequate arrangements for the expulsion, supervision and the disciplining of a member for conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles in the transaction of business. The bill is also concerned that the co-regulatory arrangements of the ASX and the ASC continue to ensure the appropriate regulation of the market and the activities of participants in that market. The amendments proposed to be made to the Corporations Law will impose on the ASX specific obligations to conduct a fair and orderly market. The operations of the ASX and its market will, as of now, be oversighted in the first instance by the ASC under the memorandum of understanding moved by the ASC and the ASX. The memorandum of understanding deals with three or four points. Firstly, with reference to the membership and the oversight of brokers, this MOU sets out agreed arrangements for promoting cooperation in monitoring, surveillance and enforcement action in relation to ASX members. It details procedures that the ASX will undertake in its surveillance of ASX members, and provides for the referral of serious matters concerning the conduct of ASX members to the ASC. Secondly, with regard to market trading and referrals, this MOU provides for the referral of serious matters by the ASX to the ASC. Serious matters include: market manipulation, insider trading, and warehousing. Thirdly, it deals with the surveillance and monitoring of compliance by listed companies with the disclosure, accounting and corporate governance requirements of the ASX listing rules, and certain parts of the Corporations Law. In the event that the ASC were to have concerns with the operations of the ASX and its market, it would furnish appropriate advice to the minister. The minister will have the power to issue a directive to the ASX requiring it to do specified things that the minister believes will promote compliance by the ASX with the ongoing obligations imposed on it. If the ASX failed to comply with that directive, the ASC may apply to the court for an order that the ASX does so comply. In the light of these arrangements-as a rebuttal to the comments made by the member for Wills in that area-the government does not thus anticipate any fall in public confidence in the operations of the Australian Stock Exchange, and we are totally confident that these arrangements are satisfactory. Once again I thank all of those people who participated in the debate and I commend the bill to the House. Thursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 11567 Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-If no member wishes to consider the bill in detail, I will put the report question forthwith. The question is that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. White Paper on Foreign and Trade Policy Debate resumed from 20 November, on motion by Mr Downer: That the House take note of the paper. on this important white paper some three months after the document was brought into the parliament with the announcement that this. represented the coming of age of our foreign policy. AllI can say is that it has taken an awfully long time for its coming before the parliament, although it was, I admit, discussed last week in this committee. At the outset can I say that the background against which this paper was produced and commissioned was a raft of policy bungles that have upset our neighbours and trading partners, and that such a paper was necessary to try to give some appearance of coherence and direction to our foreign policy. I will just instance some of those policy bungles. Soon after the government came into office we had the abolition of DIFF, the Development Import Finance Facility, which caused great upset to a number of our trading partners in Asia, especially China, Indonesia and the Philippines, particularly through the way it was handled. Then we caused further upset to China by the government's portrayal of the annual Ausmin security talks with the United States last year as a 'reinvigoration' of the alliance. China interpreted that as the alliance being directed against it, so souring its relations with Australia and the United States. Then there was major concern created in Asian countries by the racist statement to the House last September by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). Of course, the government was not to blame for that, but it was very much to blame for the fact that it was not until eight months later that the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) repudiated, in unambiguous terms, those remarks. The fact that there was that delay caused deep scars in our relationship with Asian countries. In particular, the whole incident has reawakened Asian stereotype thinking about Australia as a white supremacy, racist nation-a notion of Australia that we had, with much success, been endeavouring to bury over the last 25 years. Nothing this government has done has been -ore damaging to Australia than its eight months of wilful silence on this most important Issue. Then we had the issue in the United Nations last October where we were humiliated by a defeat by Portugal for a seat on the Security Council. Of course, the factors I have just been referring to were not unimportant in that outcome. Then, just a few months ago, we had the appalling incident at the South Pacific finance ministers meeting in Cairns, with the careless handling of an extraordinarily graphic, no holds barred, background briefing on South Pacific nations and their leaders. Its subsequent reporting in the press created a major embarrassment and caused deep offence to our South Pacific neighbours, which was made much worse by",143,Representatives Main Commitiee
329,Mr Willis (Gellibrand) (11.55 A.m.),"I welcome the opportunity to make some comments11568 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 November 1997 the refusal of the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) to apologise. Altogether, this was one of the most gauche episodes in Australian diplomatic history. Then, in October, we again alienated our South Pacific neighbours at the South Pacific Forum conference in the Cook Islands, at which Australia's uncompromising position on greenhouse gases had us apparently isolated 15 to 1. Not even New Zealand was reported as supporting us. Certainly, the greenhouse gas issue is a difficult issue for Australia, but not just for us. Faced with nations which would be drowned by a couple of metres rise in the sea level, we appeared unsympathetic and self-interested. Altogether, our relations with our South Pacific neighbours must路 now be at about as Iowan ebb as at any time since Queenslanders were kidnapping South Pacific islanders to work as slaves in their canefields. Furthermore, we also have the current issue before the parliament of the Native Title Act, with the appearance of us engaging in action which is a breach of our own Racial Discrimination Act in taking a racist position, ,an action which is being noted overseas and again embarrassing us on the international scene. A good indication of how Australia stands in international circles was provided by the recent comments of a leading international figure-himself an Australian, born and bred-Jim Wolfensohn, the President of the World Bank. He praised Australia for its reaching out to Asia through its leadership in APEC, the ASEAN consultative group and the work we did in Cambodia-all, of course, Labor initiatives. But then he went on to express his concerns about Australia's current leadership and whether it had the courage and belief to lead Australia to take advantage of the great opportunities provided by its geography and innate capacities. This is the context in which the white paper has to be seen, a context of extraordinary blunders and serious policy mistakes and the international perception of a government that is unsure about Asia and lacking in courage and belief to be fully involved with it. This white paper is clearly an attempt to put some coherence and substance into what had become a policy shambles. The best one can say for it is that it was sorely needed, but it will require much more than this pedestrian document to restore Australia's international standing. The document is called In the national interest: Australia's foreign and trade policy which begs the question: what is the national interest? The document answers that question in this way. On page (iii), it says: Preparing for the future is a not matter of grand constructs. It is about the hard-headed pursuit of the interests which lie at the core of foreign and trade policy: the security of the Australian nation and the jobs and standard of living of the Australian people. That was a definition of the security of the national interests. There is no argument that ensuring national security and enhancing employment and living standards should be key objectives for our foreign affairs and trade policy. However, the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer) went so far as to say that this was the jobs foreign and trade policy. If he wants to call it the jobs policy and have it measured on that basis, he has got an appalling problem, because the jobs record of this government, compared with that of the previous government, is quite appalling. Perhaps more importantly in this context, in the definition of the national interests, it seems extraordinarily insular to say that these factors of national security, employment and living standards are the only factors that comprise our national interests. What about our obligations to be a good international citizen? To be concerned about such matters as world health problems, world environmental problems, the international drug trade, the poverty of three Thursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 11569 billion people living on $2 per day or less, the need to promote human rights around the world, the need to promote the rights of women, children, indigenous populations et cetera: are these not matters that concern the national interest? Certainly, the narrow and, one could say, selfish approach of the white paper forms an interesting contrast with the policy declarations of the previous Labor government, which were spelt out in very substantial terms in the book Australia's Foreign Relations by the previous Foreign Minister Mr Gareth Evans and Mr Bruce Grant, in which the third leg of being a good international citizen was given great prominence. . It also makes an interesting comparison to look at the new Labor government in Britain and the way in which it defines its role. They issued a mission statement by Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary, on 12 May, soon after coming into office. And this is how it read at the start: The Mission of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is to promote the national interests of the United Kingdom and to contribute to a strong world community. We shall pursue that Mission to secure for Britain four benefits through our policy: Then they go on to security and prosperity. Under the heading, 'Quality of Life', it says: We shall work with others to protect the World's environment and to counter the menace of drugs, terrorism and crime; Under 'Mutual Respect' it says: We shall work through international forms and bilateral relationships to spread the values of human rights, civil liberties and democracy which we demand for ourselves. So they put these other issues of being good international citizens right up there, up frollt with the other issues of security and prosperity for the British people. The contrast with this white paper is quite marked. The paper does go on to discuss some national values briefly, in a low-key secondary way, and in that regard it does give a quite unambiguous rejection of racial discrimination and commitment to racial equality, and that was very welcome. Indeed, it should have been said straight after the speech of the member for Oxley in September of last year. Apart from racial equality, no other human right is specifically mentioned. The paper heavily emphasises the need for a pragmatic approach to promoting human rights. Perhaps we are seeing what this pragmatic approach means in operation in China where, after we had alienated China, as I mentioned earlier, we then sought to get back into China's good books by refusing to support a resolution condemning China's human rights abuses at the UN human rights convention earlier this year, a resolution traditionally supported by Australia. When the Prime Minister visited China, discussion on human rights was hived off for secret talks between officials. As far as I am aware, there is no public indication of the nature and extent of those discussions, except for a report in the Financial Review of 28 August of this year, in an article by Paul Monk headed, 'Beijing's deadly secrets'. In talking about these secret discussions, he said: Since the dialogue is to be secret, it is hard to know what its terms of reference are to be. We may gather something of its character, however, from the fact that the Chinese Government has announced that political prisoners are not under discussion, because of course, ""China does not have any political prisoners"". 11570 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 November 1997. If that is an indication of the nature of these discussions, we cannot expect too much to be coming from them. In other words, it would be a very pragmatic approach to human rights indeed. ' In relation to the economy, the white paper places great stress on the importance of opening up our economy to international markets and to economic integration with Asia, and it is absolutely right to do that. The Minister for Foreign Affairs correctly points to the extraordinary development in our economic links with the Asia-Pacific region in the last 15 years or so, but he fails to say that this has happened mostly as a result of the previous Labor government's initiatives. I refer to such things as the development of a much more competitive economy; the major reductions in tariffs set in place under Labor; the establishment of APEC, which was a Labor idea; the APEC leaders conference, which was the idea of Prime Minister Paul Keating; and the Bogar declaration, which Labor was instrumental in initiating and which sets the scene for further tariff reductions throughout the region. All of these initiatives endorsed by the white paper are very much Labor initiatives. ' The white paper essentially commits to processes started by Labor: the continuance of APEC and the pursuance of the Bogor declaration to bring that to fruition. It notes that Australia has already reduced tariffs and other barriers more than most other APEC member countriessomething which Labor put in place. As for the future, it states that the government will take account of what other governments are doing in deciding future steps. That is a position that Labor articulated well before the government adopted that policy approach. Finally, the white paper's assessment regarding the most profound influences on Australia's foreign and trade policies over the next 15 years refers to globalisation and the continuing economic rise of East Asia. It states on page v at paragraph 17: The Government's judgment is that economic growth in industrialising East Asia will continue at relatively high levels over the next fifteen years. That may well be right as a long-term judgment, but in the shortto medium-term it appears increasingly like a wrong call. Even before the white paper was published, events were occurring in Asia which might have led to some caution, but since then the unfolding array of crashes in currency markets, stock markets, property markets and financial institutions in East Asia have increasingly undermined the white paper's assessment. At least in the short term, for the next one or two years, East Asian growth is certainly going to be considerably reduced by all these aspects. It will vary between the countries, but certainly in Thailand, South Korea and probably Indonesia, growth is going to be drastically reduced, if not put into recession, and certainly growth in other countries will be significantly impaired. In the light of all that, one would have to conclude that this is a potentially very serious development. President Clinton, at the APEC leaders meeting currently occurring in Vancouver said that we now have a global crisis. Given that East Asia accounted for 40 per cent of world economic growth in 1996, a dramatic slowing in the growth of this region-which now appears certain-must impact upon the whole world. With 60 per cent of Australia's exports in the region, we must expect that they will be substantially affected, with both reduced volumes and prices. But in addition, we must expect a flood of imports from East Asian countries whose prices will now be much more competitive in Australian dollars. And as their domestic economies languish, there will be great pressure on them to expand exports to obtain some form of economic growth. So for us that means Thursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 11571 rapidly rising imports, great pressure on our import competing industries and a substantially deteriorating current account. It also means reduced growth. The Treasurer said that it would be barely measurable, but the OECD has already said that the GDP growth reduction for Australia would be about 0.4 per cent in 1998 and that in other countries it would be up to about three-quarters of a per cent-and all that was before South Korea was in the hands of the IMF. So for the next couple of years-hopefully no longer than that-our extensive integration with East Asia is likely to mean that we will wear some substantial economic pain, more so than most other developed Western countries which are not so integrated. It would be a great tragedy, however, if that led us to go back on our commitment to trade liberalisation. This is a short-term issue for us. We should not let it distract us from the long-term benefits of trade liberalisation. We should keep our eyes on the longer gain, and there will be long-term benefits as East Asia gets back on its growth path. (Time expired) the committee will note the white paper In the national interest: Australia'sforeign and trade policy, published recently by the government. It is a visionary document and a document which should enjoy bipartisan support. Foreign policy in Australia has been a bipartisan matter, largely, and it is rather sad to see the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Willis) descending into a party political debate on what really ought to be a bipartisan approach to our national and foreign policy white paper. I do not know whether the member saw the Australian yesterday in which the opposition foreign affairs spokesman, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Brereton), is quoted as deriding the performance of the Keating government. The article said: In an extraordinary attack on his colleagues, Mr Brereton accused the former government of badly misjudging community feeling on French nuclear testing in the South Pacific during 1995 and putting obstacles in the way of a landmines ban rather than trying to find a solution. Mrs Bailey-That's refreshing honesty. known for that. However, he did point out that there was evidence of foreign policy fatigue during Labor's last months in government. It is obvious that was one of the reasons why the Labor Party was cast from office in March last year. Returning to this particular white paper on foreign and trade policy, it gives that policy a very sharp focus and it represents a coming of age of Australian foreign policy. I believe it is very important to recognise the white paper stresses that Australia's national interest will drive our approach in foreign and trade policy. In other words, we will make no apology whatsoever in international fora and elsewhere for standing up for what we believe is in the interest of this nation. I believe the courageous stand taken by the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) in relation to greenhouse emissions is another indication that this government is prepared to stand up and be counted for Australian jobs. The government's approach to greenhouse, particularly given the statement made by the Prime Minister last week, is fair and balanced and reasonable, and I believe that all of us ought to support it 100 per cent. Our approach to foreign and trade policy will aim to improve the security, the jobs and the standard of living of all Australians. It will do this in a number of ways. Firstly, there is a clear",145,Representatives Main Committee
330,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (12.10 P.m.),I am very pleased to participate in the debate whereby,149,Representatives Main Committee
331,Mr Slipper,"Unfortunately, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith is not always11572 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 November 1997 recognition that Australia has global interests which require an active trade and foreign policy of broad scope. We believe that since we are in the Asia-Pacific region the Asia-Pacific region should be our first and highest priority, although not our only priority. The white paper is a public declaration, in effect, of our commitment to the Asia-Pacific region. It is vital to realise that our policy may be Asia first but it is not Asia only. Australia does have interests in other parts of the world and the white paper recognises that our interests are not limited to anyone region, although it stresses the very important role that our relationship with the Asia-Pacific region will play in the future. I must say that there is a great misconception in the Australian community over the benefits of trade liberalisation. Many people say to me that the reduction in tariffs means that we are costing Australian their jobs and that we are casting Australian families out of the work force. I believe that view is quite inappropriate. I am heartened by the bipartisan approach, largely, to trade liberalisation that exists between this government and its predecessor. It is always important to recognise that trade liberalisation has very many benefits for the Australian economy and for Australians. As a country which exports many products, we benefit more from trade liberalisation than some other countries do. Unfortunately, it must be noted that there are some short-term adjustment costs but even conservative estimates point out that the average Australian family has gained $1,000 per year from tariff reductions. A recent publication pointed out that families now have access to a wider range of affordable and high quality products, that imported cars would cost 25 per cent more if the 1988 tariffs still applied-which is an extra $5,000 to $20,000 a car-and that clothing and footwear would cost around 14 per cent more, which is an extra $300 or so, per year, for the average family to maintain its dress standards. It also pointed out that falls in trade barriers have contributed to a stronger industrial base, higher productivity, better access to international markets and new technologies and more competitive manufactured and services exports. While unfortunately some factories have closed, improved processing by other manufacturers, education, tourism and other services have produced good news. As other countries join us in trade liberalisation, there will be increased opportunities for Australian products and, as a result, we will create Australian jobs and our economy will be boosted. This is a policy that the former Labor government and this government have both supported. We ought not resile from the fact that we are in favour of trade liberalisation. The pauses in the areas of the motor vehicle and textile, clothing and footwear indistries that have occurred will create some increased investment but the overall policy is that tariffs should, must and will reduce because it is in the interests of Australia that this should happen. The former Labor government, to an extent, was sidetracked into indulging too much in multilateral international arrangements. We are certainly not opposed to multilateral arrangements but we believe there are very great advantages to Australia through bilateral arrangements whereby we are able to come to individual arrangements with individual countries to make decisions which are in Australia's national interests. In supporting the principle of bilateral relationships, we are not undermining the necessity for Australia to take its role in multilateral fora but the balance has changed with the change in government. The focus of our bilateral trade and investment efforts is very much on tailored and customised strategies. This means that different markets will need different levels of government support for Australian exporting and investors. I believe this is a very important Thursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 11573 change. Although the foreign policy of Australia does not automatically change with an alteration in government, and it has been largely bipartisan, this new emphasis on the importance of bilateral strategies is certainly an improvement which will work to Australia's interest. Over the next 15 years, our bilateral strategies will emphasise domestic regulatory elements and services. This will require Australia's trade negotiators to have a greater specialisation and expertise in areas such as barriers to services trade, intellectual property, investment impediments and anticompetitive behaviour by firms. This focus will be critical for Australia to capture its share of the high value-added activity in the international chain of production. We saw the Prime Minister playa key role in the recent APEC forum, and bilateral and regional fora will continue to provide means for pursuing bilateral objectives. The honourable member for Gellibrand mentioned certain comments made by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in September 1996. I place on record my very grave concern at the impact that the comments made by the honourable member for Oxley are having in relation to our trade with South-East Asia. I have been to South-East Asia on a number of occasions and I have seen newspapers report those comments in a way that indicates that this nation is racist. I think most people in the chamber and most Australians would agree that we are one of the most tolerant countries in the world. The newspapers abroad, I believe, have done the wrong thing in so far as they have claimed that we are biased against people on the basis of race. That is clearly not the case. The simple fact of the matter is that newspapers in South-East Asia are read by people in the same way as newspapers here. The net result is that there could be some adverse impact on our exports to Asia. That would be tragic because Australia is very well located to export many things to South-East Asia, particular primary products, and the government's supermarket to Asia program is outstanding. We export an enormous percentage of Singapore's consumption of dairy products. One can go to many of the stores in Singapore and see Australian products everywhere on the shelves. emphasise that we are a tolerant nation. We should point out to them the reality of the situation. It is eminently regrettable, firstly, that the honourable member for Oxley's comments have been reported in this way and, secondly, that she has made some of those comments at all. Returning to this white paper, it is a very forward thinking document. It is a statement of commitment to the Asia-Pacific region. I believe that it will be supported by the Australian people and, ultimately, by the Labor Party as well. Happily, foreign policy is largely a matter of bipartisan approach by both parties in the parliament. It is absolutely essential that we recognise we are all about Asia first, but not Asia only. This country will benefit greatly as it seeks to work as part of the Asia-Pacific region, but there are also opportunities in other parts of the world. The white paper certainly recognises that those opportunities are there. I would like to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer) and the Minister for Trade( Mr Tim Fischer) on producing such a forward thinking document. The government ought to be commended for stating where we stand so clearly and so unequivocally.

I think most people would agree that we would want a bipartisan approach on many foreign affairs issues, but that does not mean that we have to blindly follow everything that the government does. We are a different political party. We do take a different point of view on many issues. Where we can, we are happy to extend that bipartisanship in so many areas. Of course, we have the right as well to put an independent point of view on foreign policy where we see it as being appropriate. Let me at the outset make it clear that I welcome this white paper on Australian foreign and trade policy. I note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer), said that the starting point of the paper is that an active foreign and trade policy is crucial to Australia's future security and prosperity. He went on to say that it is crucial because Australia has global interests and, as part of the global economy, its prosperity is tied to its performance as a trading nation. I agree entirely with this statement. Australia does have global interests and, for this reason, I am very concerned at the downgrading, cost-cutting and also closure of many of our diplomatic missions. I do not believe that in every country there should be an overseas mission or that every post of the overseas mission should be filled by totally Australian based staff. There is an argument for the employment of locally engaged staff, where appropriate; but I cannot understand why, if we have global interests, we are constantly cutting missions throughout the world. We are not represented in much of Africa, as indeed we are not in Latin America. Our posts in Africa are faced with an impossible task of adequately presenting Australia's case with constantly cut resources. For example, the post in Zimbabwe represents eight or nine African countries: it is just an impossible task. The same applies in Latin America. I am not for one moment suggesting that Australia should have a diplomatic mission in every country, but we are far too thin on the ground in far too many parts of the world.",151,Representatives Main Committee

338,Mr Hollis (Throsby) (12.24 P.m.),"I listened to the honourable member for Fisher( MrThursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 11575 The closure of the post in Denmark was a mistake and will be seen to be a mistake. I still cannot understand why we do not have a mission in Addis Ababa, the headquarters of the Organisation of African Unity. One parliamentary delegation went to Ethiopia and recommended that we open a mission there. When the report came down, they accepted that recommendation and we opened a mission. It was in operation for 12 months and then it closed. The Canadians walked into the premises and got everything at a very low rate. The point that I am making about Addis Ababa is that it is the headquarters of the Organisation of African Unity and, if for no other reason than as a contact point or a listening point, I believe that the mission there should be reopened. There was much soul-searching and wringing of hands when Australia missed out last year on a position on the United Nations Security Council. MightI suggest that it was our lack of representation in Africa, especially francophone Africa, that contributed in part to our not achieving that position? The largest block of votes in the UN is the African nations. We have got a couple of missions in Africa and not one single post in francophone Africa. I am also concerned about the direction Australia is taking with regard to overseas aid, especially in relation to population programs. Australia's aid level today rates as 13th out of 21 in OECD countries. This is a drop from ninth in the previous year, and so Australia's aid ratio is falling. Australia has a responsibility to support the continuation of assistance for family planning programs, especially as part of an overall health strategy. Although the question of human rights is often difficult-and the honourable member for Aston( Mr Nugent) appreciates that it is a difficult situation-I do believe that we gain respect by speaking out on human rights issues. Having said that, it is important that our own human rights situation be beyond reproach. I am concerned that, on so many issues, Australia appears to be reneging on the strong commitment we had on these issues. The refusal regarding the human rights clause in the European Community treaty last year was ridiculous. We sent all the wrong messages about human rights and reinforced all the wrong prejudices that other countries have about us, in that we are prepared to pontificate, especially on human rights, yet we will not subject ourselves to the scrutiny we demand and expect of others. The cutting of funding to international bodies, such as the United Nations agencies, especially in relation to population programs, the cut in our funding to the International . Planned Parenthood Federation, and the cuts in the funding to the United Nations Fund on Population and Development are not worthy of Australia. In an overall budgetary context, it did not amount to a lot of money. To the organisations concerned, not 6nly was it a severe cut but, again, it sent all the wrong, negative messages. The honourable member for Fisher said that there should be a bipartisan approach to foreign policy issues. We on this side will not agree to sending all those wrong, negative messages, especially in relation to population issues and many, many other issues, and there is no way that we are going to support the government in what they are doing here. We are going to criticise them and raise the issues constantly so that hopefully in the next budget this funding will be restored. The same wrong message is being sent to the world regarding greenhouse gas emissions. I do not want to quote the honourable member for Fisher too much, but nevertheless during his speech, which I listened to with great interest, he did say that the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) did make a courageous statement on greenhouse gas emissions. The definition of 11576 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 November 1997 'courageous' is open to interpretation. I actually do not think it was a terribly courageous statement-when you are in a minority, when you are offside with most of the world. Now, again, greenhouse is a difficult issue and it is difficult for Australia. I represent a coal mining area; I know the issues involved in greenhouse. I am not saying for one moment that it is an easy issue-it is a difficult issue-but I do think that the message that we are sending from Australia on greenhouse gas emissions is a wrong message. The Prime Minister makes much of the fact that he is saving jobs, especially in coal areas such as my own. YetI have spoken to the miners in my area. Indeed a recent statement by John Maitland from the federation indicates that they do not support the Prime Minister's stand regarding greenhouse. Again, as I said before, we are sending a wrong and very negative message. For a government that wants to create a favourable image, we are certainly not going about it the correct way. As I am in areas critical of the government, let me make it clear that in one area I totally support the government and the action, and that is their decision on landmines. I have long opposed these dreadful destructive weapons, and indeed was critical of my side of parliament. I do not think we moved quickly enough on landmines when we were in government. When we were in power, my objection to landmines was equally strong, so I congratulate the government for moving quickly and decisively in this area. Managing foreign and trade policy is a challenge but governments are elected to meet these challenges. I do not think the government has shown the necessary leadership in this area and I believe that our image as a nation has been diminished by many of the stands that have been taken over recent months in the foreign policy area. I want to tum briefly to the comments made by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in this debate about this time last week. I do not usually comment-I am not in the habit of commenting-on the utterances of the honourable member for Oxley as it only gives them some status. But her comments in this debate were so far over the top that they actually deserve some comment. Much as she may wish, Australia cannot divorce itself from the rest of the world. We live in an interdependent world. We have enough people arguing about internationalist conspiracy theories or pushing internatiopalist conspiracy theories without members of parliament peddling this trash. It always fascinates me when people talk about tourists coming to Australia on a foreign plane and on a national carrier and prepaying their accommodation. The member for Oxley quoted this. I personally do not know if the member for Oxley has ever been overseas, but, as good a patriotic Australian as she is, I suspect that, like me, if she went overseas, she would travel on our national carrier, Qantas. I guess she would pay for her fare in Australian dollars, in Australia, to Qantas-as Japanese tourists often pay and fly on their Japanese line and people from other countries fly on their national lines. When one goes overseas, one often pays for one's accommodation before one goes. I do. Sometimes, people even pay for side trips before they go. When I do that, I pay in Australia in Australian dollars. I do not see why people are so concerned if the Japanese--or the Italians, the Thais or whoever they are-fly on their national carrier and have prepaid their accommodation. We do it. Maybe they have paid in Thailand or Japan for a trip to the Blue Mountains, but if we want to go from Tokyo to somewhere else we pay in Australia, if we so want, to do that. This is a furphy that is pushed, about all these people flying on their national carrier. Why shouldn't they fly on their national carrier? I am always proud to fly Qantas. IfI have a choice Thursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 11577 of what airline I am going to fly on, I always fly Qantas. And, where appropriate, I prepay. You can often get a very good deal by prepaying your accommodation. SoI do not know why people keep talking about this. Other members have talked about the damage that has been done to Australia's image. I am old enough to remember the image Australia had. on the White Australia policy. It took us 30 years after that policy was changed-and, I will say before people interject, by the side of parliament opposite-to live that down. So many times when you went to Asia, or to Europe and places like that, people would still raise the White Australia policy with you. We suffered unnecessarily for that for many years. ' I honestly believe that we are going to suffer from the messages that the honourable member for Oxley is sending out. We are going to suffer for a long time, not only in the image of Australia we are trying to portray, but also from a financial point of view. The honourable member for Oxley made much of jobs-youth unemployment and loss of jobs in Australia. We all deplore the lack of employment and we all, on both sides, hope that we can make a contribution to restore that. But I would say something in all sincerity to the honourable member for Oxley. While we all can be critical-no-one is saying that the honourable member for Oxley cannot stand up in this parliament and be critical of parliament or of our government and so on; no-one argues with that and we are all, on both sides, critical of each other-the very policies that she is advocating and the messages she is sending out will ensure the loss of jobs in Australia. They will ensure a diminution of the living standard in Australia. That is why so many of us, on both sides of the parliament, are very critical of the comments of the honourable member for Oxley. What she says is a contradiction. She is just ensuring that what she purports to want for Australia will not be achieved. She is making a significant contribution to that. In that way, she is wrong and she should be criticised for what she is doing. I welcome the fact that the government has put out this policy on foreign affairs and trade. It gives us in this chamber an opportunity to debate it, albeit that two or three months have been spent in the waiting list. follow the honourable member for Throsby( Mr Hollis) in a debate on a different matter, and it is coincidence that I follow him today. As usual, his is a very thoughtful and considered contribution, and I thank him for that. I do not agree with everything he said and I will challenge him on a couple of those matters, but I certainly agree with a number of the issues that he has raised. PerhapsI should start by mentioning specifically his comments, and also those of the member for Fisher( Mr Slipper) who spoke before him, concerning the contribution that we have had from the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). There is no question that if one travels around in Asia, which is an important part of the world for our country these days, Australia's response to the views of the member for Oxley will be raised. I have had the opportunity this year to travel quite extensively, both on official delegations and in my capacity of holding office with various friendship groups. I have been to an IPO conference, I have been to Singapore and Malaysia, I have been to Hong Kong and China. Last year, I went to India and Pakistan. In talking to people in those countries, it is regrettable but still a fact that, although in formal exchanges you will not always have the subject of the",152,Representatives Main Committee
339,Mr Nugent (Aston) (12.39 P.m.),"Yesterday, in the House, I had the opportunity to11578 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 November 1997 views of the member for Oxley raised---'it does happen on occasion-there is no doubt that in one-to-one conversations, 99 times out of 100, whether you are talking to MPs, Australian businessmen overseas or local business people, or people in the community, the possibility that Australia might agree in any substantive measure with the views expressed by the member for Oxley is, unfortunately, raised. People raise it in the context: 'Is it safe to invest in Australia; is it safe to send my child there to university; is it safe for my family and I to go to Australia for a holiday?' The reality of life is that if people have those concerns, and they do not have those concerns allayed, we will lose some of those people coming here for those various purposes. What that means is that the very things that the member for Oxley complains about-the loss of jobs and the loss of benefit to this country-will occur because we will not have the hotels so full, we will not have some investment in business ventures going ahead, and we will not have the education industry so well supported. And that earns us something like $2.8 billion a year; it is a very substantial industry. There are a number of factors that will determine whether or not people invest here, come here for a holiday or send their children here for university. The reality is that it is raised so frequently in so many countries that you cannot. help but feel that there has to be some negative impact. So it seems to me not only that from a moral point of view one might disagree with many of the One Nation comments, but that that party and the member for Oxley have to understand that by her utterances, which are repeated willy-nilly, unfortunately, by the media and are often not challenged as they should be, she is actually doing this countryand by implication, therefore, her constituents-positive damage. I think that needs to be pointed out on a regular basis. I would like to pick up a couple of the other comments from the gentleman from Throsby. He complained about the cost-cutting in Foreign Affairs of this government; he talked about the fact that we were closing missions. I have to say that we have not actually closed very many missions. The reality of life is that a lot of it comes down to money, and his government left us a huge debt. You cannot go on racking up debt forever. Sometimes you have to take some hard decisions and you often have to take decisions that you do not like taking. But I have to really take him to task in terms of his comments about our representation in Africa, saying that because we had closed posts in Africa we had lost the vote in the United Nations for a position on the Security Council. Frankly, that is absolute nonsense. The reality is that our lack of broad representation across the continent of Africa was something that occurred under the previous government, during their 13 years in office, and anything that we have done has frankly been peripheral and very recent in that regard. The reason that we did not get a lot of support from African countries in that United Nations vote was very much because we did not have representation-but we had not had it for years. People reflected in that vote the view that they had built up over a long period of time, not just something that had happened in the last few months. Remember, that vote occurred within the first year or so of our being in government. So, apart from the fact that one might have the view that Mr Butler could not count anyway and would never have made a good politician because he cannot count in things like voting, the reality was that that lack of support was a result of years of our lack of representation there. It is quite inappropriate to suggest that that is something brought on by this particular government. Thursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 11579 But we also have to understand-and it is part of what this white paper is all about-that you cannot run foreign affairs today the way you necessarily ran it 50 years ago, or 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago. Foreign affairs, like every other field of endeavour, has to change. What the white paper is about is trying to lay down some of the basic tenets. But the way we then operate within those basic tenets will, of course, change from time to time. In business and a whole range of other fields, and also in foreign affairs, we are going to be affected, for example, by technology. We have to recognise that. It is much easier to communicate with another country, to get information. It is much easier for the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) or the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer) to fly off to a meeting to fix a problem. We do not necessarily need the huge structures that we had in individual countries in yesteryear for our representation because you could not get the senior politicians there in time to deal with some of those issues. It is an entirely different ball game. For example, one of the trends that is happening-and I think a very sensible, reasonable trend that is not going to adversely affect our relationships with other countries-is that we are starting to look at and experiment with the idea of sharing representation in countries. Perhaps Australia, in one country, might represent not only our interests but also those of Canada and maybe New Zealand. In another country, there might be a reciprocal arrangement, where Canada has a post and represents us, and that sort of thing. For example, I went to the IPO conference in Bali a few months ago. During a period when we were not actively engaged in the conference, contrary to the media perception that we might go and lie on the beach, we actually went off and looked at some of our aid projects. We visited our consul-general in Bali to have a look at what he was doing. In Bali, he represents Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Britain. He has got a regular job with the tourist trade to Bali from all those countries, unfortunately shipping home bodies, visiting people in gaol, replacing lost passports, dealing with people who have had their money lost or whatever it is-a whole range of problems that come from having large numbers of tourists in one place. He does a very good job on behalf of Australia and three other countries. Clearly, if we can develop reciprocal arrangements with some of those countries in other places to do the same sort of thing, we can have quite adequate representation without, in fact, having to say, 'Well, we have got to have a post in every country'. But we do not lose the quality of our representation. It seems to me that multilateral representation is quite interesting. It was interesting that the gentleman from Throsby specialised in talking about Africa. He has a special interest in Africa. Clearly, the white paper says that we have to focus on areas that are most important to us. It is not just about Asia, which is a critical area, but there are other parts of the world as well. There are parts of Africa which are of interest to us, but one has to be realistic and say that most of the continent of Africa is not at the top of our priority list. It does not mean that it is unimportant. Like the gentleman from Throsby, I am obviously concerned about our drop in aid, as I think many of us are. Unfortunately, one has to point out though that, whilst regretting the fact that aid is dropping, it is a trend that has been there for many years. I find it, frankly, somewhat disappointing that the gentleman from Throsby, who is normally, I think, sound on these issues, really wants to make a political point about the drop in aid when, under his government for so many years, that trend was in place as well, as it is with most OECD countries. Clearly, we are still in the top half, on a percentage basis, of aid givers in the OECD, but it is regrettable, in my view, that we are not able to get that up a bit. It seems to me that, once 11580 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 November 1997 we get the economy moving in the right direction-and we have done a number of things in the last 19 or 20 months as a government to do that-we will have much more wealth, much more disposable income, if you like, and that is when we, hopefully, will be able to start to get the aid going in the right direction. Under the previous government, aid dropped on a regular basis and, therefore, it is nonsense to start to point the finger in this direction. Clearly, a number of us in this parliament raise these human rights issues on a regular basis in a public way, as does the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has raised a number of those issues with China, for example, and we have had open publicity about that. He has raised those issues with Indonesia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has regularly raised those human rights issues, and he does so when he visits a whole range of countries. And there is a place to stand up and publicly raise those issues. But equally, it has been demonstrated over the years that just to stand up and make a noise is not always effective with every country. So one of the things this government has tried to do is to adopt a new approach to human rights by saying, 'If you like, we will do less head kicking with other countries in public on human rights. We will try to develop our relationships and to raise some of these things in private in the hope that, on a friendly basis, we will start to have a bit more influence in actually achieving something.' We are only 18 or 19 months down the track of that new approach, but it seems to me that previously, although we made a lot of noise and there was a lot of rhetoric, we were not always successful in achieving the results we desired. Therefore, it is worth trying a new approach. I think it is too early; I think the jury is still out in terms of whether the new approach has been successful, but after two, three, four or five years we will obviously start to see the results. It seems to me that it is rather fruitless just to condemn a new approach without giving it time to work. I really have to protest at the European Union comment made by the member for Throsby. He argued that we were not prepared to sign off a trade agreement because it had human rights elements linked to it. The reality of life is that not only has that matter been satisfactorily resolved to the satisfaction of Europe as well as to our satisfaction, but that in fact his government took exactly the same position when it was negotiating on exactly the same issue. So the previous government was taking no different an official position from that of the Howard government. I am obviously pleased that the member for Throsby acknowledged the support for the position on landmines. This government was also extremely successful with things like the nuclear test ban treaty, which was a major achievement of this government. The white paper is an important document, and it is important to recognise that it is the first time that the government-any Australian government-has laid down its foreign policy thrust. It is important that people understand where we are coming from, what our priorities are and what it is we want to do. That does not mean that things will not change or that there may not be change to react to different circumstances as they develop. It is not to say that over a period of time there may not be some variation. But it is very helpful to have a basic understanding of where Australia is going in terms of foreign affairs, and it is very important to understand where we are going on trade policy. Of course we will have differences as time goes by; of course we will have arguments about whether you link trade to human rights and whether you do it openly or quietly. Thursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 11581 It seems to me that the proof of the pudding is in the eating and, whilst the previous government certainly had its foreign policy successes, this government has had its foreign policy successes. Historically, we have generally followed a bipartisan foreign policy approach and I very much hope that that will continue. It seems to me that there are lot of good things in this paper which the opposition should be able to agree with, and I certainly commend the document to the House. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (12.53 p.m.)-In the 50 years in which Australia has had a distinctive, independent foreign policy-as the member for Aston( Mr Nugent) said-this is the first white paper which actually sets out our foreign and trade policy framework. In the evolution of Australia's foreign policy, the white paper is significant for detailing that globalisation and the rise of East Asia are likely to be the two most important influences which will affect Australia as it enters the next century. It also notes that, as the centre of gravity of the world's economy shifts from the Atlantic to the Pacific, Australia's future will lie in a successful integration in Asia. As the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) has stated, this does not mean that we have to choose between our history and our geography, but rather that we must recognise that Australia faces a significant national challenge in engaging with our regional neighbours. Paul Keating promoted the idea that he was a modem day Vasco da Gama, a modem day Marco Polo, a man who discovered the east-which his predecessors had somehow overlooked. During the last election, he promoted the idea that regional leaders would not deal with John Howard as Prime Minister. Subsequently, successful meetings with Prime Minister Mahathir, President Suharto-on two occasions-President Jiang Zemin of China and Prime Minister Hashimoto have shown that Asian leaders are comfortable dealing with Prime Minister Howard and that Keating's accusations actually ignore the fact that recognising the importance of the Asia-Pacific over the next two decades is not the exclusive preserve of the ALP. The importance of East Asia is not a new notion. As far back as the 1950s, Richard Casey recognised that Australia's relations with the emerging post-colonial nations in our region would be important to our future. Initiatives such as the Colombo Plan not only assisted developing countries in Asia but changed Australia through the person to person contact they created between young Australian students and their Asian counterparts. The negotiation of the Australia-Japan trade treaty in 1957, the abolition of the White Australia policy under Harold Holt and the recognition of China under Whitlam were all important landmarks in Australia's relations with Asia over the last 50 years. The future for Australia in the 21st century is as aconfident and open nation that accepts the challenges of competing in the international economy and the challenges of engagement in the region. On a strategic, cultural and economic level, engagement with Asia will be critical and will require foresight and flair to be successful. As the economies of ASEAN and NorthEast Asia continue to grow, and as the programs of military modernisation update the armed forces of East Asia, Australia will need to work hard to maintain its relative influence. The alternative, a failure to integrate in Asia, a failure to maintain our level of influence as a medium-level power, and retreating to a being a protected and insecure country, just does not bear contemplation. Our goal should be to be a nation in the South Pacific with European traditions, but a country that is comfortable dealing with the different cultures and languages of the Western Pacific rim, and that is able to work in a coalition of shared interests. Our expertise in Asian studies should be expanded, and many young Australians should consider 11582 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 November 1997 improving their Asian language skills to improve our business and official links with Asia, and also our understanding of Asia. The white paper clearly rebuts many of the myths which are being propagated by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) with her dangerous brand of xenophobic protectionism. The white paper shows that over the last 10 years, Australia has become a more open economy. Trade in goods and services has increased from 35 per cent of GOP to 40 per cent of GOP, and over 60 per cent of our exports are now sent to East Asia. The white paper also demonstrates unequivocally that this increase in exports has created jobs, and that those jobs pay more. Surveys in 1995 and 1996 showed that firms which export are increasing employment faster than non-exporters, they are more productive, and they pay better salaries. The paper also shows that since the 1950s, rural commodities have declined as a proportion of our exports as services, manufactures, and non-rural commodities became more important. That has become particularly noticeable over the last 15 years. As tariff protection has fallen, Australia's elaborately transformed manufactures have increased as firms' competitiveness has increased. For example, cuts in tariffs from 30 per cent in 1987 to around 5 per cent in 1996 have seen medical and scientific equipment increase their exports from $300 million in 1987 to $700 million in 1996. It is not just Australia that is reducing its tariffs alone in a protected world. Since 1988, most East Asian nations have reduced their tariffs significantly. ASEAN nations have cut their tariffs on a trade weighted basis by about two-thirds between 1988 and 1995. Professor Peter Drysdale of the ANU has pointed out that 77 per cent of the increase in exports that we have seen over the last 10 years went to East Asia. To quote Professor Drysdale, he said: Australia sends more of its growth in its exports to the countries of East Asia than does any .other country in the world, including any in East Asia itself. The recent currency and financial market turmoil which has now affected every country in East Asia has raised questions about the ability of East Asia to continue the stunning growth rates of the 1980s and 1990s. On balance, the opinion seems to be that if these nations are able to correct the weaknesses in their financial systems, maintain political stability, in the medium term manage several leadership transitions, and improve their current account deficits and the high levels of debt, then East Asia is likely to continue its high levels of growth. Dealing with globalisation and maintaining support for policy reforms will be a significant political challenge for all governments in the next century. World trade and investment are growing much faster than the world economy. The white paper correctly identifies 'that trade liberalisation and an open economy contribute to economic growth and job creation', which refutes the common notion that tariff protection actually protects jobs and reducing levels of tariffs actually leads to job losses. Much of the growth in international trade has come in the services sector and that will continue. Services comprise about 21 per cent of world trade now and that is projected to rise to 27 per cent by the year 2010. As a consequence, critical comparative advantages for nations in the 21st century will be an openness to new technology, high levels of education and a culture of innovation. In an article in the summer 1997 edition of Foreign Policy, Professor Dani Rodrik of Harvard University has tried to make sense of many of the myths that exist about globalisation. Thursday, 27 November 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 11583 His thesis is that globalisation can improve a nation's overall national income but that in advanced countries this can sometimes be at the expense of a decline in wages of unskilled workers. Professor Rodrik said that 'globalisation does not constrain national autonomy nearly as much as popular discussions assume.' In the paper he also highlights the significant political challenge that results from the process of globalisation. Politicians such as Buchanan in the United States, Zhirinovsky in Russia, Le Pen in France and, in Australia, the member for Hotham( Mr Crean) hand in hand with the member for Oxley, show that opposing globalisation, through a brand of neoprotectionism, can gain some political support. It is actually a much more politically challenging task to go out and sell something notional, which is free trade, against something more concrete and tangible but also harmful, which is protectionism. The article does not minimise the significant dislocation that can occur as a result of globalisation. While the benefits of this process are distributed more evenly, those who pay a cost for freer trade are often clearly found. The policy challenge is to sell, as this paper does, the benefits for Australia in globalisation and also to make sure that education, training and the social security net can minimise the impact for those who do not prosper in a globalised economy. As Rodrik says: National policymakers must not retreat behind protectionist walls. Protectionism would be of limited help, and it would create its own social tensions. Policy makers ought instead to complement the external strategy of liberalisation with an internal strategy of compensation, training and social insurance for those groups who are most at risk. Globalisation will continue to be influential with political, social and economic dimensions. Globalisation means that nations will have to account ultimately for poor fiscal and monetary policy. One of the lessons from 1997 must be that, when the firestorm was engulfing the equity markets and the currencies of most Asian economies, Australia was only minimally affected. As Paul Kelly highlighted in the Australian of 26 November, 'Asia's crisis reveals Australia's assets in terms of its economic fundamentals, its sophisticated financial system and its liberalisation of trade credentials.' The Howard government's lead by turning a $10 billion deficit into a budget surplus over three years helped Australia withstand that Asian turmoil. The budget turnaround was opposed by Labor but without this improvement in our fiscal position not only would interest rates be higher but it is likely that our equity markets and exchange rate would have come under more pressure. Our low inflation, low mortgage interest rates and successful privatisation of Telstra are underpinned by policies that were opposed by the Australian Labor Party. The implementation of the Wallis inquiry recommendations will build on the reputation of our financial system in the key areas of consumer protection and prudential regulation. Australia has moved from Paul Keating's banana republic of 10 years ago to be a beacon in our region for fiscal prudence and financial sophistication. In the section of the paper dealing with regional trade agreements I would like to sound a word of caution. There is nothing wrong with regional trade agreements per se. The closer economic relationship with New Zealand and APEC are both examples of regional agreements that Australia belongs to which do not undermine the World Trade Organisation or global free trade. They do not divert trade. However, customs unions or free trade areas which do not offer liberalisation on a most favoured nation basis, and are not open to entry for other nations, are likely to divert trade and actually undermine the principles of multilateral trade liberalisation. 11584 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 27 November 1997 I believe that, while bilateral trade agreements may offer a tangible short-term gain, the underlying principle for Australia's trade policy must be a commitment to multilateral trade liberalisation under the World Trade Organisation and also a commitment to the concept of open regionalism, which was defined by Ross Garnaut and Peter Drysdale at the ANU as embodied in organisations such as APEC, which do offer liberalisation on a most favoured nation basis to non-participants of the regional organisation. The advantage of regional trade agreements may be a more wieldy, more rapid liberalisation, but it is important that they are WTO consistent and do not lead to any sort of trade diversion. I think the white paper states very clearly and importantly what Australia's priorities will be as we approach the next century. It does offer a framework in a very transparent way to say what Australia will be prioritising in terms of our foreign policy. It is only a framework. It is a framework which we will work within.
