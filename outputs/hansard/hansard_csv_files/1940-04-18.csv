ALE FOBOE. Loss OF PAPEHS. Minister for Air stated in the press that numbers of applications for membership of the Air Force had mysteriously disappeared. Ls he in a position to say whether the missing papers have been found, and who was responsible for their disappearance ? proved that any applications to join the Air Force were lost, but as numbers of men have complained that applications made by them about October or November last year were not replied to, I concluded that some applications must have been lost. At that time a small recruiting station had been established in Sydney, but the response to the call for volunteers was so phenomenal-the number of men offering in ' Sydney exceeded the enlistments in the rest of Australia-that the small group of untrained men working in cramped quarters could not cope with the work. In the circumstances, no blame can be attached to them if the station did not function perfectly. I understand that the recruiting centre at Sydney is now working smoothly. LOAN COUNCIL. last year the Loan Council promised that £5,000,000 would be made available to New South Wales for its works programme, and, if so, has any of the money been made available to that State? If not, will money be made available for works that have been specified, and, if so, .when? public works in New South Wales was settled before the commencement of this financial year. Arrangements have been made for New South Wales to receive the full amount allocated to that State. of the Postmaster-General regarding the promise made by his predecessor that the surcharge on border telegrams would be removed ? grams lodged in border towns are now under consideration by the Government with a view to the introduction of a system which will 'be satisfactory to the Government and will overcome the existing difficulties. trade balance and the need to conserve dollar exchange, will the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs consider the advisability of increasing the duty on imported tobacco leaf and' reducing the excise duty on Australian leaf to the rates which were imposed by the Scullin Government, thereby providing encouragement to'Australian growers of tobacco? convey the honourable member's question to the Minister for Trade and Customs and to supply him with an answer later.

The Government intends to utilize the technical schools in all of the capital cities where adequate facilities are available. The first two schools were established in Sydney and Melbourne because the great majority of the trainees came from those centres. A t first it was intended that these schools should be filled to their maximum capacity before other schools should be opened in the other States, but I have recently issued instructions that schools are to be set up as soon as possible in each State where the necessary facilities are available.

(2) Will the Minister also The report was received make inquiries in regard to the huge quantities of wool exported by Bradford as tops at enhanced prices, thus depriving the Australian wool-growers of their share of the increased price? negotiations are in hand at the present time. placed before the Prime Minister representations from a magnesium company for financial assistance to promote the production of an aluminium alloy in Tasmania, this metal being so greatly needed",12,Tobacco Duties

74,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Prim a time ahead, Germany suddenly and without warning invaded two neutral and peaceful countries. Within a few hours Denmark was under German domination. A few hours, later Norway was attacked, and Norway's rugged country, untouched by war for many generations, became a battlefield in which, I am happy to say, the German occupation is now being effectively countered by the Allied arms. If it is possible to admire organization few weeks will provide the answer. when it has the effect of bringing domination and disaster to peaceful peoples, then one must pay a tribute to the secrecy and skilful planning with which this evil action was carried out. We are indeed up against a formidable foe. But the British Navy was not idle. Within 24 hours British warships and the British .air fleet were rendering assistance to the , Norwegian people. Since then the Skager -Rak has been forced, the Baltic Sea has been mined and Allied forces are iu possession of points on the Norwegian coast. Not only have these actions cut off from Germany those supplies which it formerly received from the northern democracies, but we confidently expect that it has left stranded in the country and attacked troops and equipment which must in the near future fall into Allied hands. During the various naval encounters, the German Navy suffered crippling losses. The battle cruiser Scharnhorst is known to have been severely damaged by two hits in her action with HMS. Renown on 10th April. Three other cruisers are known to have been sunk, and possibly a fourth. Seven German destroyers were sunk at Narvik, and possibly three more have been put out of action. Two submarines have also been sunk. British losses have been restricted to four destroyers. Four other destroyers have been damaged. The battle-cruiser Renown was very slightly damaged in its action with the Schafrihorsb, and the damage done by a bomb to the battleship Rodney was negligible. I do not conceal from honourable members' my belief that, as the result of these events, we have entered upon a phase of this war which may well prove crucial. There is a tense expectancy in the air. Every neutral country in Europe has had its warning, has been told by Germany (hat it has no rights.' The success of the allied actions must surely have a tremendous effect upon these neutrals who stand wavering and afraid in the shadow of the Third Reich. Arc they to exchange their proud and historic independence for a prompt and relatively bloodless slavery by surrender, or are they to stand with those in whose victory resides the only hope for a new dawn of freedom for Europe? The next I now wish to turn and examine in some detail the development of our own war effort since the beginning of December last; I take that period because that was approximately when I last stated these matters to the House. I shall deal first, with the Navy. In the period under review, there has been a steady expansion in navy personnel amounting to 1,000, and the number of ships in commission has been increased by twelve, including ships formerly under construction and merchants vessels chartered. Since the""outbreak of hostilities no less than 13S merchant ships have been defensively armed in Australia-a n increase of 41 since early December, 1939. To ensure the adequate training of gun crews, special gunnery training courses for officers and men have been established in Melbourne and Sydney. Training courses are also held for selected officers and ratings in anti-submarine work. Traffic around the coasts of Australia is safeguarded by ships of the Australian Station with the co-operation of the Royal Australian Air Force. The ships are continuously employed patrolling and carrying out exercises calculated to maintain The them in a high state of fighting efficiency. The transportation of the Australian Imperial Force overseas involves considerable work in fitting out, equipping and provisioning merchant ships, in making detailed arrangements for sailing from the different ports of embarkation and in arranging adequate escort protection while the convoy is en route overseas. The efficiency of the special coastwatching organization set up at the outbreak of hostilities is being increased continually. The Admiralty has requested the Naval Victualling Department to supply large quantities of victualling stores to His Majesty's ships and establishments of the Mediterranean, East Indies, China aud South Africa stations. By the end of this year some 55,000 tons (dead-weight) will have been supplied. Victualling stores are also supplied to the Australian Imperial Force for use abroad. The Admiralty has recently requested the Commonwealth Government to arrange for the building as rapidly as possible of anti-submarine vessels in Australia, and orders are about to be placed to the maximum of our capacity. Arrangements are well advanced for fitting ships with anti-magnetic mine equipment when this is considered necessary. Finally, there is the progressive improvement at various ports of naval defence measures, increased storage arrangements, and facilities for embarking fuel, fresh water and stores. By December, 1939, considerable progress had been made in connection with the initial war programme approved for the Army. This programme provided for protection of vulnerable points, the completion of coast defence preparations, intensified militia training, the introduction calendar year 1940, and have not been of universal training beginning in January, 1940, and the raising of the Sixth Division and ancillary troops of the Australian Imperial Force. As the result of the recent comprehensive review of Australia's war effort by the War Cabinet, this programme has since been extended, mainly by the decisions to expand the Australian Imperial Force to a corps of two divisions and corps troops, and to raise one head-quarters railway construction and maintenance group, three railway construction companies, one railway survey company, and two forestry companies. The garrison battalions enlisted from the Australian Imperial Force Reserve for guard duties in connection with vulnerable points now total 4,655 personnel. Coast defence batteries are in a constant state of readiness, the permanent troops being supplemented by Militia personnel called up on a voluntary basis for the duration of the war. The first month's period of camp trainwith first reinforcements, will approxiing for the Militia was completed in December, 1939. The first series of three months' camp training period for approximately half the Militia has in many Mr Mentries. instances been completed, and the second series, which will terminate in July next, has begun. The present strength of the Militia, voluntarily enlisted, is 62,328 personnel, 13,720 having been transferred to the Militia Reserve. Further transfers to the Reserve are expected with the beginning of the second series of three months' camps, and at its conclusion. By June, 1940, it is anticipated that approximately 75,000 voluntarily enlisted and national service personnel will have received periods of training ranging from three to four months. During the year 1940-41, militia training will revert to the pre-war period of twelve days' camp training, with twelve days' home training for officers and reduced periods for other ranks. The introduction of universal training under Part IV . of the Defence Act in January, 1940, has resulted in 20,727 national service personnel being called up for training. They are being trained concurrently with the Militia for a period of eleven weeks' camp training. In addition, men who will have attained the age of either 20 or 21 years during the called up under Part IV . of the Defence Act, are being registered under Part XIV . of the act. Registrations to date number 47,003. Of these, 6,573 are serving under voluntary engagements with the Defence Forces. During 1940-41, the quota at present in training will carry out the same training as the Militia. The new quota, called up in 1940-41, will receive 5S days' camp training, at the conclusion of which they will be trained with Militia units for twelve days' camp traininga total of seventy day's. The Sixth Division Advance Party and Head-quarters Overseas Base sailed on the 15th December, 1939. These were followed in January of this year by the first detachment of the Sixth Division, which arrived safely in the Middle East, and is continuing its training there. Recruiting for the Seventh Division and Corps Troops will begin in May, 1940. The total strength of the. corps, mate 50,000 personnel, and subsequent reinforcements will be provided for later. Training depots have been established, and as a beginning, the second, third and fourth reinforcements for the Sixth Division are in process of being raised. The forestry and railway construction companies will have a strength of 40 officers and 1,203 other ranks. The organization of the Australian Imperial Force on the basis of British war establishments involves the provision of several thousands of mechanical vehicles for the Australian Corps, including light tanks, artillery tractors, lorries and trucks of various types, and Bren gun and scout carriers. In addition to rifles, light automatics and machine guns, various types of field and medium artillery and anti-tank weapons will have to be provided from Australian and British sources. Considerable progress has been made with the conversion of artillery equipments to pneumatic tyres. The clothing of the Sixth Division and ancillary troops and reinforcements, the Militia, national service personnel and garrison battalions has been completed. Provision has been made for replacements, and the accumulation of reserve stocks at home and abroad. Owing to the large number of personnel undergoing military training, it has been found necessary to make special provision for hutted and hospital accommodation. All Australian Infantry Force personnel are now inoculated and X-rayed soon after enlistment, and the system of inoculation has been extended to the Militia Forces during the three months' camp training period. A canteen service has also heen established for the welfare of the troops at home and abroad. Since December last much has been done towards the achievement of the Government's objective of completing the. Air Force development programme by June of this year, approximately twelve months ahead of the date originally intended, and of* recruiting and training air crews in accordance with the scale agreed upon as our contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme. In order to achieve our programme, the War Cabinet decided yesterday to place further orders in the United States of America for 49 Lockheed Hudson reconnaissance bombers together with spare engines and a range of spare parts, &c. That will bring the total of such machines to 149 and will have the dual purpose of further strengthening our home defence squadrons and of making available Avro Anson aircraft for training purposes in connection with the Empire Air .Training Scheme. Eighteen of the new Lockheed Hudsons will be allocated for the equipment of an additional general reconnaissance squadron, and the balance will be used for the re-equipment of squadrons from which the Avro Ansons will be withdrawn. The total cost of this order will be £2,277,000. Many Lockheed Hudson aircraft have arrived in Australia and been allotted to squadrons. The Air Board has expressed itself completely satisfied with the performance of the machines of this type which are already in service. The total of orders prior to the last order amounted to 100 Lockheed Hudsons, which are aircraft of modern design and high performance. At one stage the Government foresaw some difficulty in obtaining deliveries because of the neutrality embargo imposed by the United States of America, but anticipating a change of policy under the pressure of circumstances, it arranged to have direct representation in that country. The representative was there-when the embargo was removed, and was able immediately to make arrangements for the shipping of the machines with the result that practically all of the 100 machines covering the original order are now either in active use in Australia or on their way to this country. The others will be entirely completed during the next few weeks. Australia's representative in this matter is Mr F. B. Clapp, of Sydney, a gentleman with considerable business experience both in Australia and in the United States of America, who undertook this responsibility in an entirely honorary capacity. I .cannot adequately express my appreciation of his services, and of .the satisfactory results that have followed the timely action by the Government with the willing co-operation of Mr Clapp. Australia's participation in the Empire scheme entails the building up of a vast training organization capable of fulfilling our commitments. This great expansion involves the solution of many serious problems of organization, personnel, supply, maintenance and works. In order to ensure the successful completion of the task, some measure of re-organization of the Air Force was considered necessary. The two principal changes decided upon were the. reconstitution of the Air Board to enable it to deal more efficiently with the problems mentioned, and the formation of area commands. "" The main changes in the Air Board were the appointment of. Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett as Chief of the Air Staff, the creation of an additional member for supply and production, and a redistribution of duties among members. As an additional measure of decentralization in order to allow the staff of Air Porce Head-quarters to concentrate upon matters of major policy, units of the service have been organized into four areas. The southern area consists of all units in Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and southern Riverina, the central area of units of central New South Wales, the northern area will consist of units of northern New South Wales, Queensland, Northern Territory and Papua, and the western area all units in Western Australia. The medical organization of the Royal Australian Air Force has been so much expanded that it has been decided to separate it from Army control, while at the same time providing machinery for co-ordination between the Navy, Army and Air Force in relation to medical services. A recruiting organization comprising centres at the capital cities, and nine of the larger country towns, has been established'. Air crews for entry, into training establishments for at least six months ahead of the programme have been selected and placed upon a waiting list, to be called up as additional schools are opened. Voluntary recruiting committees have been formed in each State and are conducting a campaign to ensure that the response continues to he satisfactory. It is worthy of note that whereas at the outbreak of war the total strength of the Royal Australian Air Force was approximately 3,500, it now numbers over 9,000. Due to the heavy demands of industry, and of the other Services, upon the fitting trades, schools of technical training have been formed at Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, where recruits are being trained to the standard of trade efficiency of the 100 Lockheed Hudson aircraft prerequired for entry to the engineering viously ordered from abroad have either school. Mr Menzies. Since early in December of last year, the following new Air Force"" establishments have been formed, although some are not yet fully developed:-Six recruiting centres, three recruiting depots, three schools of technical training, one engineering school, two elementary flying training schools, one armament school, one seaplane training flight and one equipment depot. Under the Empire Air Training Scheme a large number of additional x flying instructors will be required. The training of flying instructors was taken in hand some months ago; with the result that our immediate and future requirements are now assured. Instructors in specialist subjects also are being trained rapidly. Certain deficiencies of specialist instructorsare being supplied by the RoyalA i r Force. Some of these experts have already arrived in Australia and have been absorbed by the training organization. Elementary and service training establishments also have been working to. capacity, and trained pilots are becoming available in sufficient numbers to' meet the demands for new service and training units to be formed under the programme. Full advantage has been taken of the facilities for flying training offered by civil aviation companies, and of the services of skilled civil flying instructors in organizing the elementary flying training of pupil pilots. The claims of home defence units have not been neglected; the plan for the full development programme for home defence is well under way. Number ten squadron, the nucleus of which was overseas at the outbreak of war, has been brought up to its full establishment of men and equipment, and is now employed with similar squadrons of the Royal Air Force upon active service flying: operations. As already announced, it has been decided to send one army co-operation squadron overseas for army co-operation duties with the Australian Imperial Force. A squadron is available now, and it is expected that this unit will be despatched in the near future. I have previously said that nearly all reached Australia or are en route. The local production of ""Wirraways is proceeding satisfactorily.. The re-armament of servicesquadrons with these types of airdevised. craft, and the consequent conversion, courses for the crews, are well under way. Light training type aircraft also are being delivered in adequate numbers to meet our present needs. Apart from the. work, upon training, which forms sueh a large part of our -effort, mention should, be made of the operational duties, undertaken by the service squadrons. Patrols to ensure the safety of shipping, in coastal waters, are regularly carried out in co-operation with the. Navy.. In order to assist in. safeguarding the passage of the first convoy while in. Australian waters, the Royal Australian Air Force patrolled, areas totalling, nearly 500,000' square miles. Finally, I wish to tell' honourable members something concerning the activities of the Department of Supply and Development. ""When. Parliament adjourned in December, this department w.as' adapting: the normal processes of private industry to the new demands of war. The problem before it was very different from that which the old Department of Defence faced in 1914. Then, the problem was one of recruiting men, and sending them away with the barest essentials. The task we have undertaken now is to provide the full personnel and equipment of a modern mechanized army. Twenty-five years ago we were sending men away to help in munitions making in England.. To-day we are sending, the munitions themselves, not only for our own troops, but also for the three fighting, services in Europe and in other part3 of the Empire. Nevertheless, and -although the actual production and supply to date have been on a scale which would have astounded our predecessors of twenty-five years ago, the work of the last six months has been chiefly preparatory for larger production still to come. It is not possible in these days to launch tin enterprise in modern manufacture -quickly. As honourable members know, it is not uncommon for a period of two years or more to be used in active preparation before a single unit of output is produced. ""Modern armaments are highly complex products, demanding the finest degree of -precision at all stages. Men and machines have to be trained and made. Elaborate foundations and structures need to be These processes, have been tihe main', preoccupa/tion of the department concurrently with the actual production and securing of other supplies The Government's! own factories have been* enlarged and extended, and' some 25 annexes toprivate egta-bIish!mentshave been, or are being constructed and equipped.. The chief purpose of these annexes is to' produce munitions, foi; our own defence in Australia, in the quantitiesthatwould be needed if war visited ourowncoasts, but already our output is such -that we are usingsome of them for overseas purposes, more will he coming: into production in the near future, and the whole system is very well, advanced. Recently the Government established an Aircraft Production Commission to take care of the construction programme now before us. This programme is doubtless the most ambitious part of the whole of the supply plan, and it is doubtful if any country has attempted to do more in relation to its resources and experience. No small part of the problem of all of this war production is that of skilled craftsmen. As time goes on, this part of 1 our problem will become more apparent. Our capacity to trainmen to cope with fhe technical aspects of munitions and aircraft will certainly determine our supply capacity. The training schemes now commencing are limited by the facilities available andprocurable in a world all of which is demanding, the same thing-as , for example,, precision machine tools. Australian capacity to produce these things is being mobilized to the utmost. In all of these efforts the Government has had to pay regard to any disturbances to civil industry and employment, and to its supplies. The disturbances have been remarkably slight, considering the magnitude of the task. An example of this policy will be .found in the labour ""dilution"" plans recently approved by the engineering imions, and, if I may say so, largely devised, discussed and carried through by my then colleague-, the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), to whom a tribute should be paid. The Government has had to select the work and the programmes on which concentration would be most effective. It has not launched out in every direction and dissipated energies and resources. It has applied a policy directed to achieve the most important and effective results. I have taken up a considerable amount of time, but I feel that honourable members should be given full information of these activities during the period when the House has been in recess. The determination of the Allies to win this war and to establish a just and lasting peace has not abated one jot since this conflict began, and I am proud to say Australia is playing its part with vigour, skill and resolution. GOLD RESERVE. surer if the Government has considered whether the Commonwealth Bank Board is to be allowed to continue the policy of selling Australia's gold reserve, which is used as a backing for our note issue, to Great Britain in exchange for sterling? If that policy is to be continued, what is the reason? If it is to be reversed, what is the reason? notice-paper a question which covers a portion of the question asked by the honourable member. With respect to the subject-matter indicating tlie policy which, he alleges, the Commonwealth Bank is pursuing, I know of no evidence that points in that direction. surer is not aware of any policy for the exchange of our gold reserve for sterling ber is not in order in asking a question based on a reply already given. in a position, to inform the House and the country as to what proportion of the reserve against the note issue is held in gold and in sterling, in view of the fact that the Commonwealth Bank does not discriminate between the two in its balance-sheet ? orable member the particulars to-morrow morning. OF UNEMPLOYMENT. session the Treasurer stated, in respect of the £850,000 which the Commonwealth was granting to New South Wales for defence works for the relief of unemployment, that the State Government had agreed to give employment to men who would not be affected by State permissible income regulations. Has the attention of the honourable gentleman been drawn to the fact that the State Government has not carried out its agreement with the Commonwealth, but is taking men off State relief works and placing them on Commonwealth works in order to relieve itself of its obligations? orable member surely is giving information, not asking a question. this kind were made last session, I instituted inquiries with the State of New South Wales. Those inquiries revealed that there was no truth in the allegations. Since then fresh allegations have been made, following whioh I , within the last week, addressed a letter to the Premier of New South Wales, a reply to which I am now awaiting. Prime Minister to say that special technical training centres are to be established in Sydney and Melbourne. I am not sure whether he also mentioned Brisbane. Is it anticipated that additional centres will be provided, and that training will be given to young men. in Adelaide, Perth, and other places? extending training facilities to each of the centres mentioned by the honourable member has not been overlooked. It is now under the active consideration of the department. the schools that have heen established for the technical training of men who are serving or are about to serve with the Royal Australian Air Force, will the Minister for Air state whether these men",18,Fighting Smvicus Aerial Action Up To The Present Is Most

There has been no change in our understanding of the cause that led up to it, or of the inherent and unquestioned justice of it which is the inspiration of Great Britain and its Allies, and of the identification of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations with that cause.

103,Mr Curtin (Fremantle,"Leade r ofmy colleagues the principle for which, we the British Commonwealth of Nations stand is that the form of government in is one upon which there can reasonably Germany is not a matter which we seek to be a difference of opinion without any influence. I have dealt with this subject justification for accusations, pro or con, before and have said also that the form as tb the loyalty and patriotism of the of government in Poland was not a matter propounders of those different opinions. with which the people of Germany should have concerned themselves. The form of government in Finland was not the cannot get out of it that way. business of the Russian Government or the Russian people. The particular able member for Barton( Mr Lane) that political philosophies of other counthe leader of his own party only a few tries are matters for the people of moments ago made a statement in the those countries and are not in any House in which he set out how very great way the philosophy that the Australian was the effort that the Australian people Labour party expects the people of Auswere making in their endeavour to resist tralia to adopt. our own making because we are the Ausable gentleman did not say "" The aggrestralian Labour party, formed of tlie sor powers in Europe"" ; he said, "" the Australian working people and other aggressor powers "".

But does the honortight compartment of the expression of able member for Barton suggest that His our views, but we hold the opinion that Excellency the Governor General spoke it is the right of a people to determine as he did yesterday, and 'as I have quoted that they will govern themselves in their him to-day, without any justification? I own way. Since we last met in this Parliament into an absolutely false sense of security the war has assumed a wider complexion. Other countries have become embroiled if we assume that the struggle in which we in it and the view stated by myself when are engaged will be restricted to the conlast we met here to the effect that there tinent of Europe. had been no final .alignment of countries and that there was no certainty that some sition ( Mr Curtin) says that our men countries whioh were then neutral might should not go near Europe. change their policy of neutrality and that some neutrals which might not desire to change their policy might probably be member for Barton not to interject. forced to do so and so become involved in the war, has come to pass. The ber seems to be able to make a successful result has been that certain countries appeal to certain people in this country which had agreements with other counby continually blackguarding the good tries have found their agreements disrepute and the honest intentions of honorhonoured. There is not even to-day any able gentlemen who sit 'against him on this certainty that powers which are not now side of the chamber.

Our programme is of the aggressor powers. The right honoram sure he does not.

My desire is that there shall be the maximum of unity among the people of Australia in their devotion to the common cause against aggression.

I am quite unconcerned over interjections, relevant or otherwise, or over attacks from outside this Parliament from whatever point they may be lodged; I am concerned only in performing here what I believe to be the right thing in the interest, the welfare, and safety of all members of the British Commonwealth, and in particular, of that section of the British Commonwealth to which I have definite personal responsibilities. Notwithstanding "" Hands off Russia "", I tell the honourable member to his face that for every disguised Communist in the Labour party who is doing the work of the enemy, there are persons in every part of the British Commonwealth, and in neutral countries as well, masquerading as respectable business men who are prepared to betray their countries to the enemy by assisting in the incubation of his .plans in their own communities. Such persons are not any more numerous among the Labour party than within the ranks of what is known as fashionable society in every country of the world. member not to regard my interjection as a personal reflexion on him. able member, but it was an unwise observation to make. Why was it made when me from my argument? If so, it was unworthy of the honourable member. Or was it done in order to trip me into a political error? That might be legitimate political controversy in normal times, but it is very unwise at this time. The war has become larger than was the case when this Parliament last met. It is true that Finland has been ravaged, not by Germany, but by Russia. It is true that Denmark and Norway have been ravaged by Germany. It is also true, however, that there is in southern Europe considerable anxiety as to what side another great power may take, if it decides to take any side. The difficulties that will be created for the British Commonwealth if that power decides to come in against us must be kept clearly in mind. Should it happen, who is there to say that, not as the result of any present deliberations, but solely because of the opportunity that would thereby be presented, some other country at present neutral might not attack us, and justify itself hy declaring that it is merely fulfilling its destiny?",27,Scholfield

121,Mr Curtin,"I believe the honorber mean that it is fortunate that we sent forces to Suez? Germany thought it proper to assail Norway in order to carry out its programme, and just as Russia thought itself justified in "" mending its fences ""-to use an expression I disown-by invading Finland, so some other country, given the opportunity provided by the complete absorption of Britain and France iu Europe, might be disposed to take such action as would bring the war, not only close to us, but even to our shores. If honourable members say that this is a matter which should not be discussed here let me point out that yesterday morning, and the morning before, the Sydney Morning Herald published extensive references to what a certain great power might be contemplating in regard to a part of the world not far away from Australia. member be prepared to go to their assistance ? v a responsible man to give to that question is that when the government of that country requests us to do something, then will be the time for us to indicate the answer that we shall give. But I see every justification for the Government of Australia putting itself in such a position that, if the call should come, and our reply were what I think it would be, we would be able to take action promptly and decisively. That would not be possible without the existence in the Commonwealth of a powerful organization designed to that end, and a re-disposition of certain defence cunits so as to bring them closer to the possible point of danger. fended? honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) that I would not, on any account, leave undefended that, part of Australia which is his particular responsibility. In order that we might be able to give effective help, if such help wore asked for, I would greatly increase our forces in the northern part of Australia, and that applies to north-western Australia also. However important Darwin may be, Wyndham and Broome are equally important, because they are points from which could be sent prompt assistance for such purposes as this Parliament might approve. ter, which represents a separate problem of organization for the Defence Department. In the assessment of what the Commonwealth is capable of doing we ought to keep in mind those contingencies which some honourable members seem to think may never arise. If , however, they should arise, they would imperil the safety of this country, not after Great Britain had lost the war as has been suggested, but while it was losing the war. I pray that neither of those things may ever occur. The late Prime Minister of New Zealand said, "" If Great Britain goes down, we go down"". I believe that to be true, but I believe also that the great danger to Australia wi,ll come before Great Britain goes down. It will come when Great Britain is engaged in the last desperate effort to preserve itself and France. It is at that point, when help cannot come to us, not because it will not be sent, but because it cannot, that we shall stand in greatest danger of attack. Then we may find ourselves in the same position as Finland was in relation to Russia. The whole world, with the exception of Germany and Russia, was on the side of Finland, yet no great power was able to save that country. Whatever may be done for the resuscitation of Finland most now be done after the war is won. That might well be our position if we do not make a wise choice in determining the way in which we should make our contribution to the war. ways said that, but the honourable memberwas not prepared to make any contribution. man can say this: that this Parliamenthad presented to it an outline of government policy in which there was provision for an expeditionary force.

That is to .say they want a universal 40hour week in fhe coal industry. That is not true. What was sougnt was a standard of 40 hours. That was agreed to by Judge Drake-Brockman.

Three per cent, of the workers in this great and important industry would get an improvement of hours over and above insistence on the letter of the award, not Judge Drake-Brockman's award, but the award of the full Arbitration Court. I say to honourable gentlemen opposite that I and my colleagues have done our utmost to bring a termination to the coal dispute in the national interest. The Minister for Industry, so far as I can judge, has done his very utmost to end this dispute in the national interest, no more in the interest of the coal-owners, than we have been solely interested in the claims of the workers. National considerations influenced us just as much as they would be likely to interest any other honourable members. The Right Honourable the Prime Minister can advance very considerably the national solidarity of Australia from now until the war is over, and tralian workers. ensure better competence of all to deal with the after-war problems which are referred to in the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General, by asking for that co-operation and showing some positive way in which to ensure it. E put it to him that there are measures on the statute-book which ought not to be there, and that portions of other measures ought to be wiped out. If we leave them there while the war is on, we shall find when the war is over that one party to the re-adjustment of the social and economic life will be able to start off give effect to our desires. At present that again with the advantage of having on the statute-book coercive legislation against other sections of the people. I .submit that that is wrong. I believe that much could be done if the right honourable gentleman were to call a conference of employers and of representatives of the trade unions of Australia. He could say to the employers, "" We do not want you to be constantly pinpricking the employees', we want you to remember that they are under serious domestic strain at the present time, because many -of their relatives are in the fighting forces and they themselves are experiencnever had to invoke them, because no one ing all sorts of difficulties. They are 'faced with rising prices, and economic -conditions are daily becoming more diffimuch political window-dressing. Afr. Curtin. cult for them. You must have consideration for the standards of the workmen and must remember that the strain of the war upon them is great"". Then he could say to the representatives of the workmen-and I would say it with him"" In this war your most treasured possessions are at stake. Your own lives may be involved, but there is at stake more than your lives. All of the things that represent the foundations upon which your political and social aspirations rest are in jeopardy. Without freedom of discussion, without an opportunity for free political organization, without means whereby trade unionism can be organized and maintained, the workers of Australia will have no more hope than have the workers in Germany"". The workers of this country know the fundamental antagonism between the philosophy of Nazi-ism and all that they understand by the rights of Australians in their trade unions and political organizations. There is no need to preach anti-Nazi-ism to AusThey know that Nazi-ism came into power on the destruction of trade unionism and the burning of the parliament of the country. Therefore, I say that an appeal can be made to the two sides to reduce the gap between their respective demands in the national interest. At the same time, the Government could give to at least that section of the people who are infchetrade union movement an undertaking that, when this night passes and we enter upon a new day, we shall enter upon it as social and economic equals in our capacity to is not so. To be more specific, I urge the repeal of the Transport Workers Act forthwith as an indication to the people of this country that the shipowners will not have an advantage over the waterside workers when the problems of rehabilitation have to be faced after the war. I also advocate the repeal of certain of the punitive provisions of the Crimes Act. They are obnoxious and offensive to tradeunionists-so obnoxious and offensive that, apparently, the Government has has ever offended against them. They were put in the law some years ago as so The Speech of His Excellency contains a reference to Communists. One sentence readsMy advisers have hesitated to adopt restrictive or punitive measures which might even remotely be regarded as a limitation upon freedom of political thought or action, the freedom for which we are fighting. If I were in the position occupied by the right honourable the Prime Minister, that would be precisely my attitude. I should have said: "" We are fighting for freedom of speech and for maintenance of our free institutions. I hesitate to do things which might interfere w i th the right of free speech "". The Speech continuesBut the limits of freedom in an organized community are reached when men profess an allegiance to a nation other than their own. The Labour party says that any man in Australia who professes an allegiance to a nation which is an enemy of Australia should be dealt with as such. I make that plain. required. The next paragraph contains the words: "" When they plan to overthrow constitutional government overthrow constitutional government do not necessarily begin by throwing bombs. Before the bomb-throwing stage is reached they must develop an organization. That is done by word of mouth, by giving counsel, by making utterances, or by publishing or circulating writings. Men must first be educated in order that they w ill support the organizers when the time comes for throwing the bombs. Labour party says that any persons who, at this juncture, carry on propaganda for the destruction of Australia, or in the interests of some other country with which the Allies are at war, or seek to destroy the free institutions of this land, should be dealt w it h in such a way as to render them impotent. I am not now referring to the degree of punishment to be inflicted upon them; that is a matter for legislation. I believe that the officers of a government department should at least ensure that men who are not guilty of these things shall not be thrown into gaols merely because some other persons charge them with planning to overthrow constitutional government. enable attacks to be made upon persons [5] who are not guilty, or put the Government in a position to act like Hitler,, and put innocent people out of the way equally with the guilty. No one should be able to say that this man or that man shall be put out of the way merely because someone says that he is a Communist. Last week I sat as a member of a body that bas some responsibility to Australia, even though it merely states that to be so. We were asked, so it has been said, to exclude certain persons from the meeting because they were Communists, but DQ evidence that they were Communists was produced. They denied that they were Communists; each of them had signed a statement that he was not a Communist. The executive of that body of which I am a member is not a court of law ; it has no power to call evidence, or to require those who take part in the discussions to give evidence upon oath. It is not the function of the executive of the Labour party to usurp the authority of the courts of law. An y resolution of that body in no way directs any man or woman in the W o r d s are involved. Australian Lahour party as to what he or she shall -do. It is not sufficient to tell a man that he is a liar merely because Men who plan to some other person says that he is a liar. If communism is an offence, if membership of the Communist party is an offence, and if members of that party are doing the work of the enemies of the British Commonwealth, have we not police officers and courts of law to deal with them, and has not this Parliament the power to deal adequately with any public menace? And if the existing laws are The inadequate, is it not possible to give to the Government such additional statutory powers as are required? does not say who shall be members of the Lahour party. it would be very difficult to say what authority decided that the Minister who has interjected should be a member of the Government. that; I decided it . that that was a decision which ought to he subject to appeal to a higher We must not authority.

There dom of political thought or action, "" the freedom for which we are fighting "" ; but those qualifications are qualifications with which we also completely agree. Freedom of speech does not mean the right to destroy one's own country while it is at war, or to advocate the claims of sophical approach? But that is not the another country with which the nation ia at war. It ought not to allow men to engage in subversive activities aimed at the defeat of their own country. Surely, the onus of proof is not on the Opposition, but on those who are responsible for and has done all through the piecej but the administration of the war, and to whom Parliament has given authority to act as the executive of the nation. If there are Communists in this country who are doing the things complained of, I suggest that the right honourable gentleman should hold not me responsible, because I cannot alter things, hut those who administer the laws of fhe land, and he will find them on his own side of the chamber.

[4.48]' -Honorabl e members on all sides of the House have listened with great inLabour party, ancl that of the Leader terest and considerable sympathy to the speech which has just been delivered by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr he has said on previous occasions, namely, Curtin). This is the first opportunity that the honorable gentleman has had sinee the war took on its more decisive phases to appear before .this Parliament and endeavour, to the beat of his ability, gentleman indicated that quite clearly. to outline the changed outlook of the members of his party. must necessarily have changed in accordance with the changing circumstances of the war. It will be conceded, at any rate by members on this side of the House, that the Leader of tlie Opposition found himself in a deplorable position when he rose to tell the national Parliament where his party actually stands in relament but ig actually a planned system tion to the issues that have confronted the nation during recent weeks and months. He began by saying that there was no division among the people of Australia and his party regarding the issues cannot be any division of opinion, but there can be a difference of method in the intellectual approach to those issues. The approach of the Leader of the Opposition to these issues was mainly academic; shall I say that it was a philomethod of approach of the Australian people. They have ceased to take an intellectual interest in this war. They may have done so in the early stages, just as the honourable gentleman himself did they now realize that there is no philosophy in it, that one cannot take an academic view of the frightful catastrophe that is slowly but surely unfolding before civilization. Therefore, if the honorable gentleman wishes honourable members of this House, and the country generally, to take him seriously, as one competent to analyse the issues, the motives, and the possibilities of this war, the first thing he must do is to drop the philosophical and academic pose, and get down to realities. To expound my argument on that point, I would indicate to honourable members the vast difference there is between the mental approach to the present war by the Leader of the British of the Australian Labour party. The honourable gentleman said to-day what that we are not out to destroy Hitlerism, that we are not against Hitlerism as such. I took that to mean as a form of government for Germany; indeed the honourable The only deduction to be drawn from his remarks is that, in the view of himself and -his party, Hitlerism is something that can be embraced in the general system of world-wide government past or present, that it is merely government -of another type with which we are familiar, and that in that sense ho has no objection to it . There are other persons who take the view that Hitlerism is unique in the world's history, that it is not a form of governdesigned for world conquest on behalf of a nation.

I explain that fate of this country rests wholly and our loyalty, whether it be verbal or merely I lie must get down to first principles, as bas tbe Leader of tbe British Labour party. With the invasion of Denmark and Norway-forgettin g Poland for the time being-and with the daily threat of the impending invasion of other neutral countries, it is not sufficient to say, "" There may be some merit in the system called Hitlerism, and, therefore, we are not going to condemn it "" . To do that is to break away from the realities of the situation. Mr Attlee has not done that. He sees the hideous, dangerous thing that is right at his door. He describes it as "" this foul thing Hitlerism "", which the workers of Great Britain are united, as they never were before, in their determination to smash, because they believe that what has happened in Poland and Denmark, what is happening in Norway, and what would happen in Holland, Australia, and wherever else this vile thing could spread its tentacles, would lead to the victimization of the workers. I have before me an article which appeared in the Daily News, a newspaper that is described as the official organ oi the Australian Labour party. article, which was published on the 23rd March last, gives an analysis of Labour's attitude towards the war. It is the same unsatisfactory, wishy-washy statement as that made by the Leader of the Opposition in this House to-day. direct; it gets away from realities and merely harps on things which every body admits. It saysThe workers of Australia need yield second and really overlook the degree of our place to none in their hatred of Hitlerism. obligation to Australia itself. The Leader None seeks its destruction with more sincerity, of the Opposition practically said that but none realizes more forcibly that Hitlerism is not a German but a capitalist product. Even if it were a capitalist product, that in my opinion, will lead to its downfall, would not detract in any way from the namely, concentration wholly and solely true nature of the menace that Hitlerism on the defence of Australia. He referred now places before the world, as has been to the possibility of war developing in clearly indicated by Mr Attlee. SoI say the Pacific very close to our doors. There that if the Labour party is lukewarm, not was no need for him to have avoided in its loyalty-that should not be used in these debates-but in its mental grip of the problems with invaded by Germany, and of the Dutch which Australia and the Empire are now East Indies being occupied by Japan. confronted, the blame must rest on the But even though he took a very serious Leader of the Labour party, because of view of those possibilities, he did not the obscurity of his language and his failindicate what the Labour party would do ure to get down to tin tacks. I shall quote about it. When he was questioned on the briefly from the speech which the honorpoint by members on this side of the able gentleman recently broadcast to Mr Thompson. South Africa, as final proof of my contention. He then said1 am certain that the people of every country will understand me when 1 say that iu Australia there is no diversion of purpose regarding war. Of course there is no diversion of purpose regarding war; but what about the war? The honourable gentleman went on to sayWe have no economic or territorial ambitions. All we desire is to put au end to the power of armed might, merely because it is armed might, to get its way in the world. We stand for a safe world, aud naturally and logically we oppose and resist the makers of war and the users of aggression, and we tell the world that our opposition will be unwavering t ill the very end and until victory is won. That is absolutely meaningless; it is merely a tirade of negatives. Nobody disputes the statements of the Leader of the Opposition. I quote them simply to show that his whole attitude towards this war is one of refusal to face realities. He talks of things about which there is no disagreement. Yet when it conies to the tin tacks of the situation he says nothing; merely that the policy of his party is to This give adequate defence to Australia. That is the policy of other parties, though we do not find the Labour party giving us credit for that. In its official organ, and in the speeches of different members of the party, there is the definite suggestion that, It is not because the parties which now constitute the Government are proceeding with plans for participation in the war overseas, they are more or less jingoistically inclined, to-day, when he again brought up that phase of his party's defence policy which, is a word which reference to the actual situation. He had in mind the possibility of Holland being chamber he grew rather confused and seemed to run away from his own thoughts, whatever they were. He was very wise not to pursue that subject because it is perhaps the most dangerous topic that could be discussed in this Parliament at present. been invaded. The Dutch East Indies are still intact. All we know of the possibilities in that quarter is that Japan, through its official spokesman, has warned other people away. ""You must not deal with that problem, even if it arises, without consultation with us "". It has been admitted generally that Japan's attitude is quite proper provided Japan adheres to it. Of course we have the possibility of the United States of America offering protection to the Dutch East Indies; but that position also is obscure, for the offer has not been conwere quite with him up to a point. He firmed by the Government of the United States of America. We have also the development indicated in this morning's press. The Dutch Government, through its official press, has stated that even if took particular notice of the honourable Holland were invaded its Government would be quite able to protect the Dutch East Indies. We do not know how it would do so, but, at any rate, it has not sent out .an SOS to any other nation. In these circumstances, it would be improper ancl exceedingly undiplomatic for the members of this Parliament to discuss these problems until they actually arise. If they do arise, some thing more than a debate on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply will be needed to enable the Government and the Parliament to deal quickly with the situa-. tion. Mere talking by honourable members would not be sufficient to relieve the Government of the new and heavy responsibility that would then fall upon it. In my opinion that problem should be left entirely to Great Britain and the United States of America. It should not be an immediate concern of Australia, and it would certainly pass at once from the realm of party politics. Other problems than whether the Government or the Labour party would be prepared to send an expeditionary force to the Dutch East Indies would arise. The Leader of the Opposition has again adopted an illusive attitude in regard to what his party proposes to do in connection with the war situation that has now developed. A by-election was held recently, before the war assumed its present ominous phase. At that time some people were saying that there was not a real war at all, and that the Germans were afraid to go to war. Since the Holland has not Corio by-election, however, the whole situation has changed. Not even the most light-hearted member of the Opposition would say, to-day, that the position is not entirely different and graver than it Japan has said then was. It is now sufficiently serious to give each member of the House cause for concern as to how he should exercise his responsibilities to the country. During the Corio by-election campaign the Leader of the Opposition was very definite about the attitude of his party in respect to certain aspects of the war. The members of the Government parties said that the Labour party would do its utmost to defend Australia; and, of course, the Government parties were actually doing their utmost to defend it. I gentleman's speech to-day to see whether he had any criticism to offer of the Government's efforts in this regard. He did uot at any point, suggest that, as to the defence of Australia, the Government had fallen down on its job. But the Labour party says, ""When we get-to the shores of Australia we part company with you "". During the Corio by-election campaign a definite conflict of opinion was manifested between the political parties of this country. At that time the Leader of the Opposition said that there was no difference of opinion on the issues that were involved, and I agreed with him, but I said that there was a difference of opinion as to the way in which those issues should be faced. To-day, however, the position is quite different. did not participate in the Corio by-election campaign. to do so, and even if I had been I do not know that I should have done so at that juncture. I am, at the moment, directing my attention to the cleavage of opinion that developed during the campaign. The Leader of the Opposition said, at that time, that the Labour party was not prepared to send men out of Australia to fight. I ask the honourable gentleman",34,Scholfield
154,Mr Makin,The honourable member,37,Scholfield
155,"Mr Thompson""","I was not askedto-day, and I ask any other honourable member of his party, whether the changed conditions of the war have changed their views on this vital issue? Apparently the Labour party is satisfied with the way in which the Government is seeking to defend this country, but I wish to know whether it has receded from the position it took up during the Corio by election campaign. At that time it offered the strongest opposition to any further troops being sent from Australia lo participate in the war overseas. Does it still adhere to that policy? This point must soon be elucidated, for a general election will have to be fought in the not distant future. The Leader of the Opposition showed a remarkable excess of caution in discussing this matter to-day. In fact, he very carefully avoided any reference to it. The conclusion I drew from his remarks was that, having regard to the changed situation of the war, he was not prepared to criticize the Government any further for sending two divisions of Australian troops overseas and for insisting that, while troops arc wanted for service overseas, and men in Australia are prepared to offer themselves voluntarily for such service, they should be accepted. present position of the Labour party is very unsatisfactory. It seems to have no cohesive defensive policy. I do not desire to refer to the "" Hands off Russia"" resolution, for it is rather ancient history. It is quite evident, however, that the Labour party has become seriously divided in the last month or two. member advocate "" Hands on Russia ?"" that subject a little later. In view of the united in its support of the British hopelessly divided ranks of the Labour party I , and I have no doubt other honourable members who support the Government, listened this afternoon with great sympathy to the Leader of the Opposition, for he is in a more difficult position with France, to hear the brunt of the than any other Leader of the Opposition has ever found himself in in this country, having regard to the serious war developments of the last week or so, and. the deplorable industrial strife that has now developed in this country. It was thought that his party had become united, but, in fact, it is more divided than ever. I do not doubt the sincerity of the Leader of the Opposition, nor do I doubt that of practically every other honourable member of the Opposition. It seems to me that all of the signs and portents of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon showed that the general demeanour of his party is becoming more and more favorable to the formation of a great national government, representative of all parties, for the effective prosecution of the war. able member's chances be then? honourable member of the Parliament I would be prepared to make any sacrifices that were necessary to ensure the formation of a truly national government. If there should be such an upsurge of war in the Pacific as the Leader of the Opposition seemed to fear, there would be nothing for it but the formation of a national government in this country. There may be even worse developments. Australia may actually be attacked. We do not know. When we see neutral countries, whose frontiers have been inviolate for centuries, being over-run; and when we see historic citadels falling into the hands of invaders, we must be prepared to admit that anything may happen to Australia. This is the most isolated part of the British Empire. We are, in fact, one of the most isolated communities in the world. We cannot, therefore, assume that we shall be absolutely immune from direct attack. We are learning every day how dependent we are upon fhe British Navy and upon help the honorahle from overseas. Mr Attlee, the Leader of the Labour party in Great Britain, made it clear that that party was 100 per cent, Government's war policy. There are no strikes in Great Britain, and no defenders of Hitlerism. The Labour party there is standing solidly behind the Government, which is being called upon, fight that is being waged for civilization and liberty.

161,Mr Thompson,"Lik e every otherdirectly assailed by some predatory power. In tbese circumstances it is high time for the Leader of the Labour party in ""this country to come down from the air onto solid ground. Regardless of the dissention which has developed in its ranks, regardless also of 'the strike which is having such a disastrous effect on this country, and of Communism, the Australian Labour party should give its complete support to the Government. It should follow the lead of the British Labour party. As Mr Attlee said in Great Britain, we are in this struggle and we must do our utmost to win. The Leader of the Opposition admitted quite frankly to-day that we might have to face grevious possibilities in the near future. His party should therefore agree at once to unite with the other political parties in this country and abolish party politics for the duration of the war. The best talent in this Parliament should be available to the Government. I agree that Communism is not a vital issue in Australia, but as a few Communists are giving some trouble, and are doing their host to disorganize our national effort, we should deal with them at once. We should not permit rabid and dangerous traitors to be at large. There is no doubt that the coal-miners have grievances. I should like to see them rectified. I do not think that they should be obliged to suffer intolerable grievances for the duration of the war. If their grievances are intolerable, when compared with those suffered by, say, the workers of Poland, Denmark and Norway, they should be rectified. But if they are grievances which have been endured for a long time, if they do not require instant attention, if they are merely trumped up hy agitators and disloyalists and traitors to handicap our war effort and bring about the downfall of the Empire, then every section in Parliament should unite to put those men where they belong. The' strike is unnecessary. It should be fixed up in quick time, as the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has said. If it can be shown that the mine-owners are guilty, there will be very little sympathy with them among members who support the Government. If the Prime Minister( Mr the .Governor General's Speech. That is Menzies) finds that they are blameworthy, he will tell them in no uncertain terms what they ought to do. The grave fact remains that the arbitration system has been flouted, and no suggestion has been made by members of the Opposition for the settlement of the dispute that would not involve striking a blow at the arbitration system which the Labour party itself helped to set up. As for the Communists, who are supposed to be responsible for the strike, perhaps there are some among the leaders, but we have had coal strikes when there was no war, and the men responsible were not called Communists. They were called members of the Industrial Workers of the World, or just plain agitators. Therefore, I do not put the blame altogether on the Communists, though that is a fashionable name to apply at the present time to all who are responsible for industrial upheaval. If our war effort, which is so vital to the Empire, were to crash because of this strike, what a demoralizing effect that would have on the other parts of the Empire, and on the Labour party in Great Britain! What a depressing effect it would have upon the Labour representative, Mr Grenfell, who is at present visiting us in Australia with a message to the Labour party throughout the whole Empire! If there is any considerable section of the miners' leaders who are prepared to do as Mr Orr said the other day, when he threatened to hold up the whole industry of the country if any attempt were made to break the strike, then we must regard them as traitors, as men to be dealt with, if not by laws already in existence, then by laws specially framed by this Parliament. ber's time has expired. The motion under discussion is one for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to the Governor General's Speech, to which has been added an address by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) of a recapitulatory character. In fact, it might truthfully be said that the attitude of the Government is capitulation to the Country party, and recapitulation in regard to the war. The conduct of war-like operations is the outstanding feature of natural and proper. I agree that, until the war is ended, it is hopeless to expect",38,Scholfield
162,Mr Speaker,The honourable mem,39,Scholfield
163,Mr Brennan (Batman) [5.35],"that other matters, however important they may he, will receive any intelligent consideration. It is for this reason that I offer a few observations designed to advance the common object of Parliament and people, namely, an early termination of hostilities. This unfortunate war is essentially a European war. Britain is only technically a European power. Its vast colonial possessions are mainly African and Asiatic. The very considerable territories acquired by Britain as the result of the last war, under the polite fiction of administration under mandate, are also external to Europe, and the vast bulk of the dominions are scattered all over the world, but external also to the continent of Europe. This thought-provoking consideration presents itself to our minds: Accepting Great Britain as a European power, of all European States now self governing and self-contained, there are but two, Britain and France, which, up to the present, in their wisdom or otherthe invasion of Norway, some significant wise, are opposed to the ending of the war on any terms other than a clear military definition. With wearisome reiteration we have been told that we are fighting for the preservation of small nations. That statement itself requires a little honest and dispassionate examination. For myself, I know of no principle of international law by virtue of which any nation, or group of nations, may constitute itself arbiter by force of arms for the preservation of any other self governing nation. It must be always remembered, when we are discussing these matters, that nationhood power of self-defence. No nation, in fact, has a right to presume to nationhood which is not prepared to accept the responsibility of self-defence, as I have frequently said in regard to Australia. That important principle has been largely the guide of the Labour party in determining its policy of non-participation in foreign wars. If two nations may combine to re-shape the map. of a continent, then, logically, one nation may assume the same role, and we reach a condition, which, if honestly examined, makes those two nations or one very little different from a dictatorship. It is only by virtue of a dictatorship that such power can be successfully exercised. Mr Brennan. But I return to the position of European States which, we must all admit, are suffering intensely, and are most intimately concerned with the conduct and outcome of this deplorable war. The fact is that these nations are crying with a single voice that we should spare them our unsolicited attention, and leave them in peace. I am leaving out Germany, which has submitted terms of peace, that, however, have been unacceptable, and, I think, rightly unacceptable. It is a strange position that each group of great powers is declaring its support of the rights of neutrals, which are themselves at peace except for the intervention of the belligerent powers. In the meantime, charges of breaches of neutrality are made on every side, and, I am bound to confess, are truly made. The truth is that the thin veneer of international law is being worn thinner every day and the inevitable consequences of total war arc becoming daily more apparent. Before observations were made by the Premier of that country. He saidWc made 21 protests to the belligerents against violation of our neutrality by foreign planes, ten to Britain, six to Bussia and five to Germany. We cannot continue protesting. We shall shoot down such planes. Then he went on to publish their deplorable record of losses by sea and by land. those prisoners on the German prison ship in a Norwegian port? touch on that point, but as the honourable implies the member has raised it, I may say that it is important to recall that this incident, about which we must examine our consciences, arose out of a breach of neutrality on our part, as was candidly explained in the columns of a Melbourne newspaper by a professor of international law. And, since that has occurred, as honourable gentlemen may see by reference to Current Notes that are published in such a convenient form for the information of honourable members, another distinguished international lawyer on the British side has written deploring that fact in very candid language. The most recent case is the sowing of mines by the Allies in the neutral waters",39,Scholfield
164,Mr Rankin,Did he explain about,40,Scholfield
165,Mr Brennan,"I did not intend toof Norway, the impeding of its trade, the imperilling and terrorizing of its people and the violation of its waters. Germany, never slow to take advantage of an example, either to set a bad one or to follow a bad one, goes one worse and hurls its destructive armies upon a people with whom it has had no quarrel. It is in these circumstances that there are placed in the Speech of the Governor General the wordsI have not them by me at the moment, but honourable gentlemen will remember them"" Unprovoked invasion of Norway had taken place"". majority of persons in this country or in any way associated with the Allied Forces believe that the Allies' cause was justified at the beginning and that it is a good cause. Surely then it is capable of being sustained by the plain language of truth! Surely .also to depart from that is to weaken one's cause and to strengthen the cause of the enemy! Why, in these circumstances and on a most solemn occasion should the Government deliberately employ a phrase which it knows when it uses it is absolutely contrary to the fact? The excuse of Germany, quite a good one vis a vis Great Britain is a bad and invalid one vis a vis Norway. And it is a word or two for the neutrals that I am endeavouring to utter this afternoon. Assuming my attempt to analyse this position is greeted, as already it is evident that it is to be greeted, by the cry of "" Pro-German"" and so on-that kind of tush from the Government benches with which we are familiar-le t me say at once that I am quite prepared to concede to honourable gentlemen opposite, who make that kind of comment, that the behaviour of the Germans is worse even than our own. But when did it become a sound moral principle that the end justifies the means, or that an indefinite number of wrongs makes one right? It is obvious that there must be heard in many of those neutral countries, which have been suffering so intensely, "" A plague o' both your houses "" and "" Heaven save us from our friends "". It is impossible to think that out of this welter of hatred against hatred, abuse against abuse, this unpleasant contest between experts in scurrility, that the white light of justice and charity will, as a natural consequence, begin to shine. Does the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson), who interjects so unkindly, being the man he is, really think that this smashing and desecration of human bodies, poisoning of the seas, desolation of the land, can ever bear as their natural fruit and flower a world of harmony, beauty, truth and understanding? I wonder! The scriptural allusion that grapes do not grow on thorns nor figs on thistles remains true as it has through the ages. If it were otherwise ethics is a mockery and Christian religion a sham. I am prepared to The concede neither to the honourable member for Gippsland. Who started the war and the proximate and remote causes of the war are difficult matters to determine, but they are merely of historic interest. The much more important question is the ending of the war. When a bush fire breaks out men do not sit under gum trees arguing as to who started it. They sweat themselves to put it out. Even in a street .brawl between two men, the first consideration is to separate the disputants, not to inquire into the merits of the case. This is none the less the case in a brawl in which one of the combatants is the aggressor. Tho first consideration is to end the brawl. This war is sometimes described, as I have heard it described, as an imperialist war. I did not choose the phrase. Neither do I object to it. The fact is that we are much ridden by words "" i m perialism "", "" pacificism "" deed, and many other words about which there is no common understanding as to their meaning. I have nothing to say about ""imperialism"". The fact is that the motives for carrying on this war are many and various. I have no doubt that there are many quite innocent motives arising through ignorance and lack of truthful information, but there are other motives, such as fear, lust for revenge, and avarice-al l very important factors in the carrying on of the war. In a democracy it is difficult, nay, impossible, to avoid the licence of a rabid press, and it would be strange, indeed, if the people did not become a little like the swill that is fed to them.

BeforeI refer to a speech made by Mr practice or philosophy that we should Neville Chamberlain at Birmingham on the 24th February last I remind myself and the House that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has said that it is a good general rule not to criticize the utterances of the spokesmen for other dominions and Great Britain in relation to those matters in respect of which we cannot expect to be so well informed as they are. But when I refer briefly to Mr Chamberlain's speech-and I shall not have time to deal with it in detailI do so because the wise rule enunciated by my leader does not apply. If my view as to dominion status had been accepted by this chamber the position would be different, but it was not accepted. Australia entered this war without any consultation with the national Parliament or the people. In that respect Australia differed from the other dominions. in the same position New Zealand, after making a proclamation, submitted a positive, motion to Parliament relating to its entry into the war. That was not done in Australia. As my view in regard to dominion status was not. accepted, and as the matter was not discussed in this Parliament, I must accept the inevitable; but I point out that Australia is in the war because a Government external to Australia, and which was not responsible to the people of Australia, made us at war. The fact that that Government is friendly towards Australia is beside the question. Therefore I claim that I am entitled to analyse the view of those who insist on making me at war when I want to he at. peace. In his speech at Birmingham Mr records of the House of Commons, as I do, Chamberlain said that the Empire was engaged in a religious wara crusade. I claimed when the war began; and I submit with great confidence that we have neither the equipment nor the authority for conducting a crusade. beam out of our own eye before we speak of the beam rather than the mote in the eye of another. I am not aware that we have set such an example of Christian presume to hammer those qualities into other people by fire and sword. It is not so long ago that the official representatives of Prance boasted that they had conducted Christ to the frontier. No doubt that was a blasphemous statement, but it was made officially on behalf of France, our ally. We have a better example of the christian mission in the expression by 90 clergymen not of my own communion who have signed the following statement:We feel, however, that we must emphasize the fact that within the various communions with which we are associated, there is a substantial number of Christians who hold with us in the unfaltering conviction:(1) That evil can never be . overcome with evil; (2) That war is a negation of the Spirit and teachings of Jesus Christ; and (3) That where the claims of the State conflict with loyalty to Christ, the Jower allegiance must give way to the higher. We affirm our high evaluation of all those things that are worthy in the life and government of the British Commonwealth of Nations, but we believe that they cannot finally be preserved by force of arms or unreserved allegiance to the claims of the State. through the ether? signed, not by Goebbels in Germany, hut by 90 ministers of religion in the Commonwealth of Australia* The gentleman who so kindly supplies me with this useful information assures me that there is no reason to suppose that the number of clergymen ready to subscribe to it is limited to 90.

It certainly was not a war "" Not yet"". I see something ironic in aim at the time when it was most relevant, the fact that a gentleman who says that and when the invasion of Czechoslovakia we are engaged in a crusade, and are fighttook place. ing a religious war, should have the temerity to tell ministers of the Gospel that he was too busy to entertain their "" assimilated "". representations in favour of prayer for peace.

To their minds civilization is capitalism and capitalism is civilization. They are lighting for a world made in Brummagem, because any other is beyond their capacity to understand. That is why British and French propaganda is so pitiably ineffective. Our propagandists have not ithe face to say that we arc fighting for British and French capitalism; but they are not allowed to say that we are fighting for anything else. They can, in consequence, say only that we are fighting against Hitlerism; and so negative an appeal is bound to be weak and ineffectual. wrote that? reader on economics at Oxford and author of many standard works. I say, in conclusion, that the guarantee given to Poland was vague in its terms and apparently also as to its subject matter. The one thing clear is that it referred to a geographical entity, and included that congeries of inharmonious people thrown together by the Treaty of St. Germain. SurelyI am entitled to know with some certainty what the lives of those who are dear to me are to be pledged for ! SurelyI should know what m y constituents are to die for on foreign battlefields! Surely those wiseheads who are conducting this war should set before us in clear terms whether we are fighting for the Poles, or for Poland -as we knew it . Isi t Czechoslovakia, or that much smaller group of people known as the Czechs? Are we waging a crusade and a religious war, or is this merely political rhetoric that we are being supplied with by the distinguished leader of the British Government? I say ""distinguished "", because I have great respect for Mr Chamberlain as an imperialist capitalist. He is a conscientious representative of his class. He says that we must have tangible evidence that pledges and assurances w ill be f u l filled. I have heard that over and over again, and I reply that assurances and pledges can have no greater value than is afforded by the integrity and good f a i th of the person who gives the pledges and utters the assurances. Therefore a ll the chosen German leaders are unacceptable if those words about assurances and pledges mean anything, they mean that the war is to be conducted until B r it a in and Prance take control of the German people. Yet with another voice they deny that that is so. They say that Germany is to govern itself, and that there is not to be a dictated peace. I have heard also that there is to be a dictated peace. Is there, or is there not? BeforeI shall be prepared to see handed over to a form of government to which I have always been opposed the working masses of any country, whether enemy or not, I want to know exactly what the plan is; and that has not been disclosed up to the present. We are urged W h o is the traitor who by Mr Chamberlain to abolish the spirit of militarism, which w ill reuniversity duce us to bankruptcy. Let us be candid. The British Government has no intention whatever of abolishing the spirit of militarism. The whole history, tradition, and background of Britain's development have been along militarist lines. Even to-day, in this country, this Government would not know how to open anything, from a sardine f in to a House of Lords, without having a group of individuals with drawn swords, fixed bayonets, "" t in "" hats, and every other adjunct of military force. I remind honourable members that capitalism has been built upon and maintained by military force. There is no intention to abolish militarism in Great Britain, nor has this Government any intention to do so in Australia. If it had, it would have my whole-hearted assistance; but everybody knows that it has no such intention. Such assertions are pure make-believe Militarism has been the buttress of capitalism, and capitalism the maker of Hitlerism and of wars such as that with which we are now being afflicted. I am opposed to Hilterism, but I am not a supporter of policy dictated by sycophants to a government external to Australia which country in turn merely registers in this chamber the views expressed elsewhere. I am conscious of the fact that the greatest service which a representative of the Labour party can render to the people of Australia, to the people of the world in general, to humanity, to religion, to the great cause of Christianity before which most of us",44,Scholfield

The Leader of the Opposition is still floundering in tlie mystery of the Labour party's war policy. What we want to know to-day is where the Labour party stands. The Leader of the Opposition cannot tell us because he is held back by the extremists throughout Australia who dominate the Labour party. The attitude of the United Australia party towards the war was made clear in the first paragraph of the Governor General's Speech, from which I cite the following passage-= The war forced upon the British and French peoples by flagrant international law-breaking on the part of Germany shows no sign of a -speedy ending. While we are all confident of ultimate success, there can be no doubt that the situation is a grave one. Nobody can prophesy what fresh aggressions there may be in the near future or what new enemies we may be called upon to meet. Only in the last few days we have witnessed unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Denmark and Norway by the enemy, in circumstances which show plainly that the future existence of the smaller nations of Europe, and indeed of the world, not excluding Australia, is entirely dependent upon a conclusive victory for the allied arms. able member make his own speech? drive a little common sense into the head of the honourable member for East Sydney. need to be nasty. opposite want proof that communism has entered the ranks of the Labour party they can find it quite easily.

We must all congratulate the Prime Minister upon his action in causing Australia to declare war as promptly as it did. Australia was the first Dominion to stand behind Great Britain when the war occurred. That the right honourable gentleman took such prompt action will always be a laurel that he can wear with pride. He said, in effect, "" Australia will stand behind Great Britain whatever happens"". Honourable members of the Labour party allege that this action was taken behind the backs of the people, and without giving Parliament an opportunity to voice its opinion, but as 95 per cent, of our population is British thero WHS no need for the Government to wait before declaring itself. The honourable member for Batman went so far as to say that he did not agree with Horr Hitler, but lie thou proceeded to denounce the British Government as imperialist. Most of us have known the honourable member for many years, and we know what to expect of him. able member for Barton would not call hi in a Communist. -speech. I have always recognized the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) as one of the quiet underground, engineers of the Labour movement. He never reveals his hand until a crisis has developed in the party, juid then w.e are able to understand somethat honourable gentlemen opposite are not thing of the fine work which he has been doing in his quiet way. But something must be said about the state into which -the trade union movement of Australia has fallen. That movement is, of course, stronger than all the labour leagues and other labour organizations in the -country. This causes me to ask, ""Where is my friend, Jock Garden, to-day?"" When he was expelled by one branch of rhe Labour movement he went back to the trade union movement and turned up again iit tbe Trades Hall. He was to be seen at the recent Labour conference supporting what has been described as the' ""Hands off Eussia"" resolution, -about which I shall have something to say presently. What has the honourable member for Melbourne Ports tq say about the ""Hands off Russia"" iiesqliitiqh? We a.ll know that the trade union movement, in which the honourable gentleman is so interested, is not what it was, so he has, no doubt, been doing some underground engineering in that connection. The general opinion hi Australia, is that the Prime Miuistei acted wisely in 1 falling in behind Great Britain as promptly as he did. We have been informed that the Labour ljiovement is quite prepared to do something in the war in favour of Great Britain,""and that it is against Hitler. Yet Labour is opposed to the sending of men for service overseas! Perhaps the new honourable member for Corio( Mr Dedman) will be able to make some revelation of Labour's policy. He knows very well tha' during the by-election campaign in Corip the Leader of the Opposition said that Labour would not be guilty of refusing to send reinforcements overseas to help the Australian Imperial Force. Mi'. GEORGE LAWSON -What was wirong with that? Air. LANE -If the Labour party is prepared to send reinforcements overseas, why does it not get right behind the Government in its war effort? It seems I shall make my own that the Leader of the Opposition was speaking with his tongue in his cheek when he said that Labour was prepared to stand behind the Government in its war effort, and that it was walling to do what it could to prosecute the war effectually, for there can be no doubt wiling to send men overseas to fight. It seems to ine to be stupid in the extreme to say, ""We are prepared to prosecute the' war, but we are not prepared to -send men into the battle line "". Surely 'honourable gentlemen opposite do not wish to see Australia suffer the indignity of being -handed over to another power. What have the present-day members of the Labour party to say about Andrew Fisher's declaration at the beginning of the last war that Australia would be in it "" to the last man -and tlie last shilling "" ?

The Leader of the Opposition asked where-our men were. He said that they were not in the war zone. He spoke about Finland, Poland and Norway. An OPPOSITION MEMBER -And Ireland? Ireland. Perhaps he was leaving that for Brother Brennan to do. I expected to hear it from him.

In the next breath he says As the honourable gentleman did not say anything about the Vatican and its peace efforts, perhaps I shall do so before I resume my seat. In seeking to explain why we should not send men overseas, the Leader of the Opposition said, in effect, that it was useless to send them to Poland now because that country had been ravished; it .was also useless to send them to Czechopore, is guarding us in the only effective slovakia or Finland. the Opposition did not say anything of the kind. drew a picture of the country surrounding Germany and referred to the devastahas stated that it has no designs on those tion that had been caused by reason of the fact that Russia came into the war and seized half of Poland. Russia, of course, used Germany as a tool. The honourable gentleman said, "" We are against that kind of thing "". But he did not say what the Labour party was prepared to do to resist it. He did not say, either, that Labour was prepared to Send men to fight shoulder to shoulder with others who were resisting such aggression. our naval forces would have? Ths fact is, of course, that the trade union movement in New South Wales carried the resolution to which I have -already referred and which has come to be known as the "" Hands off Russia"" policy. The Germans say that they want to maintain the neutrality of Norway. The honourable tried to explain to us what neutrality meant. He said that the small neutral states are begging the great belligerent nations to leave them in peace. I point out that Denmark' never made any provision for defence at all, yet it was overrun by the German forces in less than 48 hours, and all its rights were taken from it. What did the Germans do to Poland, and did they show any mercy to Norway, which only asked to be neutral ? In spite of these examples, honourable members opposite tell us that we in Australia ought to remain neutral in this war; that we ought not to send men overseas to fight for Australia. He says that increased forces should be sent to Darwin and north-western Australia to repel a posthat we have a population of only 7,000,000, and that we are unable to defend ourselves. Why did he not say that it was our duty to send men to fight our battles in Europe, where the decision will be made regarding the future of Australia? Why did he not point out that Great Britain, by maintaining a fleet in the China seas, and a naval base at Singaway against possible aggression? The honourable member did not specifically name the enemy against which he says we should prepare to defend ourselves, but he implied that Japan might attempt to occupy the Dutch East Indies. Japan territories, and Great Britain and America have given Japan to understand quite clearly that it must keep its hands off them. The honourable member says that we must send forces to Darwin and Broome to meet an enemy if it should attempt to land troops at those points. Does he suggest that we should pit the Australian Navy against the navy of Japan? If so, what chance does he think Let us turn now to the industrial field. The honourable member said that he wanted to protect the coal-miners. He said that the miners were not fighting in their own interests, hut because they wished to have the 40-hour week extended to other unions.

I am more than surprised that the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) should draw the Cross into this question. I think that it was the Leader of the Opposition who declared that tlie penal sections of the Crimes Aet should be repealed; that nothing should be done to hold in check those forces which are destroying the great Labour movement, but rather that they should be given the liberty to disrupt society and destroy the community at large. When an honourable member talks like that, in my judgment he has not paid heed to the voice of the working class.

The Opposition knows that, but it is prepared to stand idly by and let Germany triumph and then say, "" We are sorry England was defeated."" By God! England will not he defeated, because we have always found men outside the official Labour movement ready to stand to their guns, men different from the men who refuse to come out in the open and support this Government, preferring to hide behind the Opposition's cry of, "" A strong Opposition is better than that we should have a unanimous Government to prosecute this war and send us forward to victory."" The people of Australia will understand what has been put forward here to-day by the Opposition in spite of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition, being a journalist, has a very fine choice of words.

I am one who believes that Australian industrial expansion should not be impeded and I do not care whether it is Smith, Jones, or Brown who has a contract with the Government so long as industry proceeds. I have yet, however, to be convinced the honourable gentlemen opposite are competent to attack this Government on the formation of a monopoly. On the contrary, the Labour party has been the friend of the great monopolists for many years. I have been here long enough to know that.

All that he is capable of is a tirade of abuse of honourable members on this side. He does not realize that democratic government is only formed by the right of healthy criticism advanced by His Majesty's Opposition, which today we happen to be.

The honourable member ' for Barton attacked, first of all, something for which a unitI emphasize the word "" u n it ""of the Australian Labour party was responsible in order to pin upon the whole of the Labour movement the stigma that whatever Eussia may do we shall not attack Eussia. That is entirely wrong. stitutions in which we believe we shall fight Eussia in the same way as we are fighting Herr Hitler. It has been proved definitely that the Australian Labour party has demanded that that unit of the party should expunge from the records all reference to "" Hands off Eussia"" as the resolution has become known, although it was never that. The resolution was construed in that way for political reasons by our political opponents; and politics is at a low level when men stoop to the murky depths of the sewer in order to attack the other fellow. Not even the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) was fair enough to make matters clear to the people. He said, "" The Lahour party stands for ' Hands off Eussia'"". He wanted to know if the honourable member for P reman tie ( Mr ferent from other industries in Australia, Curtin) is leading the Australian Labour party, or Eussia. Minister knew full well when he made that statement that it was not the Australian Labour party but a unit of that party, in New South Wales, in which there are unfortunately warring factions, that was responsible for the party opposite being able to say that labour's attitude was "" Hands off Eussia "". The honourable member for Barton, went on to say that the miners have been badly misled. I am as concerned with the coal mining dispute as I am with the international crisis. I recognize that, if we are to conduct this war successfully and bring it to a conclusion in which our cherished democratic system will be maintained, the democracies at least should endeavour to make the people whom they represent a little more contented than they are by providing them with employment. Give them a stake in the country and then one can count on their patriotism. The miners have not been badly misled. Eleven years ago in this HouseI defended the miners just as I defend them to-day. I was a lone voice. The coal owners then, in spite of the fact that they had an award of the court made under the law of this very Parliament, locked the miners out and demanded that they accept a reduction of their wages by 12\ per cent. The chickens are now coming home to roost. Honourable memhear! bers opposite stood idly by on that occasion and saw an award of the Arbitration Court deliberately flouted. Who then said "" An award is being broken""? Only the honourable member who is now speaking, apart from his friends who sit behind him. Did the then Government do anything? No! Silence prevailed, in spite of the fact that on the statute-book there was the Industrial Peace Act, which is still the law, from which there is no appeal to any court. That legislation was created by the right honourable gentlemen who is now Attorney-General, the member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). The right honourable gentleman piloted that measure through this chamber, because he recognized when he belonged to the labouring classes that coal-mining was an intricate industry, an industry that was in every way difand one that can be understood only The Prime by those, who are associated with it. Provision was made in that legislation for the appointment of chairmen of special tribunals whioh would have a semblance of knowledge of the industry. The right honourable gentleman did the job well in 1920, and although I have been criticized for saying this, I believe that if he had his own way to-day, and possessed the courage which he displayed in those clays, he would say to tlie present Government, "" I am Attorney-General and Minister for Industry and I am going to do this job without being dictated to by the Prime Minister. 7. shall do something to encourage Australia's effort in this war"". But the right honourable gentleman is growing old and has lost some of his punch; I say that more in sorrow than in anger. It is time that the people of Australia knew these things.

But I know from early and sadi experience some of the hardships of the coal-miners. When I was quite a boy my father was mangled in a mine, and my eldest brother killed. My mother was left with eleven children. I have frequently had to break the sad news of the death of a miner to his widow and family. I have memories of attempts to comfort a widowed mother for the loss of a son who had played his part as husband, father and brother. A miner can never forget these things. When these coal-miners plead for justice, they are given dust. Three years ago they asked for a 40-hour working week. 1 remind the House that coal-miners work in an atmosphere that is heavily charged, not only with dust which is injurious to health, but also with gases which are even more harmful to the lungs. The limited breathing space underground is shared with horses and appliances which consume the air. The conditions under which these men work undermine their health, and they are justified in claiming that they should not work under such conditions for more than 40 hours a week. I ask honourable members in this chamber how their working conditions compare with those of the miners. There is no dust in this chamber, although possibly, there is plenty of "" gas "" here, yet a ventilating plant has been installed; every seat has its ventilator. But do these men who serve the nation, and provide us with the. comforts that we enjoy, receive similar treatment? I remind honourable members that only by the sacrifice of the miners do we enjoy these comforts. Much of the coal which provides these comforts comes out of the ground stained with the blood of our fellow men. They have appealed to the nation for a 40-hour week, and have asked for health regulations and decent compensation should they be hurt. They desire that, in the event of their being killed in a mine, their dependants, whom they love, will at least be able to enjoy a reasonable standard of comfort. They have served the nation. Why should they not have these things ? They have asked for a pension at the age of 60 years because, they say, at that age their health is so undermined that they are unable to continue work. What causes their health to become undermined? I have given the causes. Under the miners' agreement, there is the provision that the last to come shall be the first to go. That is a reasonable clause, yet it reacts tragically upon the miners because, with the application of machinery to the production of coal, the young men are put off and the old men are retained. In the little village in which L reside to-day, I frequently see old men toddling off to the mines whilst their robust sons of up to 30 years of age have never done a day's work in their lives, and, so long as the income into the home amounts to £2 10s. a week, they cannot participate in relief work or get the dole, and thus are obliged to live on the bounty of their old parents. Some of these young men marry in order that they may become entitled to emergency relief work, while the object of others is probably to relieve their parents of the obligation to maintain them. That is not right. Yet these are the boys we expect to fight in our wars for a country that cannot provide them with employment. The Prime Minister has gone to the coal-fields to-day to plead with the rank and file of the miners to resume work, on the ground that the strike in which they are engaged is retarding the effort of the nation to bring the war to a successful conclusion. It may be said that his visit to the coal mining areas denotes the possession of a considerable degree of courage. He is going amongst a community which is hostile to him; but even though they be hostile, they are democrats and will give him a hearing. They will certainly question him, and charge him with maladministration and unfairness in broadcasting his case over the national network while denying the same facilities to the leader of the miners, thus preventing the people from hearing both sides of the question; and rightly so. I purpose now to quote from an act of this Parliament which is still on the statutes-book. It is the. Industrial Peace A.ct. By one of its sections, it provides that the Governor General may appoint a special tribunal for the prevention or settlement of any industrial dispute or disputes; that the chairman of such a tribunal shall be chosen by agreement between representatives of the employers and employees, or in default of agreement shall be appointed' by the Governor General; that there shall be equal representation on each side; that the tribunal shall have the power to inquire into all matters relevant to the dispute, from the point of production to the final disposal of the commodity by the employer in the case of producing industries; and that the decision of the tribunal on the question of relevancy shall be final. Section 18 provides as follows:A special tribunal, or the clmirinan thereof, or the Minister ""Who is the Minister to-day administering this act? It is the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) who is Attorney-General and Minister for In dustry. That right honourable gentleman piloted this legislation through this House. I shall again quote from the beginning the provisions of section 18. They are as follows:A special tribunal, or the chairman thereof, or the Minister, or any person thereto authorized in writing by the Minister, may, tor the purpose of preventing or settling industrial disputes, summon any person to attend, at a time and place specified in the summons, at a conference. Why has such a conference not been called? I quite appreciate, of course, that the Minister for Industry is only one individual in the Government. Subsection 2 of section 18 makes the following provision:""Any person"" (last occurring) in the last preceding sub-section includes not only person? engaged in or connected with nn industrial dispute, but also any person engaged in or conthe present occasion, they have come to a nected with any dispute relating to industrial matters (whether extending beyond the limits of a State or not) The present dispute extends beyond the limits of a State and related in any way to an industrial dispute; and also includes any pcrsun, whether connected with an industrial dispute or not, whose presence at the conference, the person or tribunal summoning the conference That means the Minister or the chairman of the tribunal thinks is likely to conduce to the prevention or settlement of an.industrial dispute. If that is not clear, I do not know what is. \Leave to continue given.] the House for its indulgence. I never care to take advantage of the standing order which enables leave to be given to an honourable member to continue his speech, but the whole nation realizes how important is this matter, not only from the. Mr James. economic point of view, but also from the point of view of the successful prosecution of the war in which the nation is involved. Here is an act of this Parliament which could be invoked for the settlement of the present dispute and which in the past has not only prevented but also settled manydisputes. The miners have every confidence in this act. They asked for it to be invoked before they went to the court and certainly before the strike in 1938. I place on the Prime Minister the whole of the blame for its not having been invoked. HadI accompanied him to the coal-fields I should not have done other than say to h i m there that ho alone is responsible; but rather than embarrass him, I have remained in Canberra. 1 want h i m to be given a f a i r go, and 3 know that that w ill be his experience. Probably, upon his return, he may hold different ideas. If his object be to get the rank and file of the Miners Federation to go against their leaders, he has another think coming. One thing that can bo said of the miners is that, in an industrial dispute particularly, they are loyal to their leaders, notwithstanding what political opinions they may hold. Some persons have said that they have been badly misled. The miners are not led; when it comes to a final showdown they have a democratic way to decide their destiny; on any matter affecting their welfare they vote individually, whatever may be the advice of their leaders. On majority decision to strike after they had experienced failure after failure to secure redress through the courts. Let no honourable member of this House blame their leaders, because they themselves have embarked upon this struggle, after having exhausted during the last three years every constitutional means at their disposal. Viewing the way in which they have, been treated by the arbitration system during the last decade, one can only sympathize with them in the attitude they have I thank adopted. The Industrial Peace Act, by section 28, providesNo award or order of a special tribunal or local board shall be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called in question, or be subject to prohibition, mandamu? or injunction in any court on any account, whatever. In spite of that section of the act the 0i coal-miners, after a fifteen m'onths' lockwhich three judges sat, including Judge out, were forced, in 1929, to accept a 12£ per cent, reduction of wages which the avaricious coal-owners then demanded. I do not want to touch further on that matter at the moment except to say that the miners did not receive the legal protection to which they were entitled. he settled under the provisions of the Section. s to the present dispute, the final claim was served on the coal-miners on the 23rd August, 1938. It was rejected. In September of that year the men went on Strike and the strike lasted for six weeks. The Government of New South Wales was concerned about the situation and, with the consent of the Governments of the other States, it devised a formula which provided for the setting up of a local authority or tribunal to deal with disputes in the coal industry. Subsequently, this tribunal made good progress in dealing with such matters as pensions, health and insurance. The coal-miners were pleased with the progress that was made. The economic question, however, had to be submitted to the Arbitration Court. The court which heard the claim was presided over by Judge Drake-Brockman, at one time a senator of this Parliament, and chairman of the Employers Federation of Western Australia. He could hardly be said to have had leanings towards the coal-miners. He conducted an inquiry which lasted for five and a half months, in the course of which he visited -every mine and went down into its workings. In June of last year he made an -award for a 40-hour week of five working days, inclusive of crib time for underground workers and 'exclusive of crib time for surface workers. Crib time in mining parlance means lunch time. In addition, he gave tlie craft-unions in the mining industry a 20 per cent, increase of wages to compensate for their shorter avorking time. The Government of Victoria accepted the award and the miners -at Wonthaggi worked under it for six months. In New South Wales, however, where brawls of all kinds unfortunately occur, the coal-owners appealed against the award. The appeal was heard by the f u l l bench of the Arbitration Court on Drake-Brockman. The other two judges had made no inquiry into tlie industry and had inspected no mines. One of them was an old man who'had almost reached the stage of senility. The Full Court rescinded the award and obliged the craftunions in the mining industry to revert to a 44-hour week exclusive of crib time in respect of some of the workers. BeforeI became a member of this Parliament I was a coal-miner and every morning I used to go to work with my neighbour and every afternoon after work I used to come home with him. Wo worked the same hours, though we did a different job. Under the new award, however, some of the men are obliged to work half an hour longer. I know of cases of men who have gone to and come home from work together daily for 24 years and are not now able to do so. Since 1916 the men have worked under what was called the eight-hour bank-to-bank system. Now some of them have to work half an hour longer because their crib time is excluded from consideration. They have to work these longer hours in spite of the fact that labour-saving machinery has speeded up production. Moreover, the Full Court reduced the 20 per cent, wage increase to 5 per cent. HOAV can it be expected, in such circumstances, that harmony will prevail in the industry? The men who have to work face-to-waggon groups are the men who handle coal on the surface and down in the bowels of the earth, but they have to Avork 40 hours a week. Some of their companions, Avho are engaged in other branches of the coal-mining industry, have to Avork half an hour longer or 44 hours a A\eek despite the fact that these r workers are members of the same federation. When one of the judges who was a party to the rescinding of the aAvard Avas questioned about coal-mining he said "" I Avould not know a coal-mine if I fell into one"". It is deplorable in the extreme that an award which was made after an exhaustive inquiry of five and a half months should be upset by judges who had no part in the inquiry and who had never, on their own admission, seen a coal-mine.

I do not like speaking of the dead, but I cannot help referring to an occasion in 1934 when Mr Charles McDonald, the president of the coal-owners' organization, visited the rooms in this House of the members of the New South Wales Labour party and asked if they would agree to accept one arbitration authority for the whole of the unions.

I had no intention to participate in this debate and should not have done so but for certain remarks made by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) this afternoon to which I feel I must reply. May I first congratulate the mover and seconder of the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply upon the excellent speeches which they delivered yesterday. My colleague, the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), delivered a speech which was one of the best of its kind I have listened to in this the deep waters of the ocean and sunk. Parliament. It must have appealed to honourable members of all parties. The speech delivered this afternoon by the honourable member for Batman stirred in me emotions of an entirely different kind. The honourable gentleman appeared to constitute himself as an allegedly impartial judge of the motives and actions of Great Britain and Germany in the conduct of the war that is now in progress. He condescended to condemn Germany in that he said its actions had been worse than those of Great Britain, but the whole tenor of his remarks was in condemnation of Great Britain and Australia for their participation in the war. The honourable gentleman argued that war was utterly un-Christian, and that if we followed the teachings of Christianity we could not possibly engage in war. In my view, if Great Britain had not been a Christian nation it would not have been prepared to make the tremendous sacrifices which it is now making largely The then Attorney-General in the interests of the smaller and weaker nations. The honourable gentleman, while not prepared to make the statement that this was an imperialist war, This attempt, which was unwas not prepared to deny it. He said so this afternoon. He was prepared to assert, and did assert, this afternoon that the war was being waged in defence of capitalism, and that capitalism was built on militarism. He said also that Britain would never give up militarism. Those were his words as nearly as I can recollect them. of any honourable member in the House so short, as to forget the events of recent history? It is not very many years since we were all looking to the League of Nations as a possible means of settling international disputes without the dreadf ul arbitrament of war. No nation took a more prominent, or more sincere, part in an endeavour to make the League of Nations a success than did Great Britain. No nation stuck to the League with more tenacity, even after it had become discredited as a means of dealing with, the more powerful nations. Some time after the League was established a disarmament pact was agreed to at Washington, as the result of which the great nations consented to. limit their armaments, and great capital ships were taken out into I , as a member of a Government in power in Australia when His Majesty's Australian Ship Australia was taken out and sunk, possess still a relic of that ship. The building programmes for battleships, cruisers, &c., were drastically curtailed by all of the powers who were signatories to the agreement. At least, they all agreed drastically to curtail their programmes. Sizes of ships were reduced",55,Opposition Members Hear
231,Mr Speaker,The honourable,56,Opposition Members Hear
232,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [9.26],"and gun calibres were limited. Everything was tending in the direction of reduced armaments. under MacDonald, and later under Mr Great Britain's present intervention in Baldwin, travelled along that path in an honest attempt to fulfil the great ideal of peace through disarmament, probably going further than any other country. Indeed, Great Britain travelled along that path until it placed itself and the rest of the Empire in absolute jeopardy because, while denuding itself of its defences, while of whom we read in the story of the reducing the number and size of its ships, and its fighting personnel, other nations were doing just the opposite. They were building up armaments, constructing warships, and adding to their trained man-power. It was not until Great Britain had placed itself in a position of very great peril, indeed, that it awakened to a realization that a fresh threat was hanging over Europe. Even then Great Britain was very slow and very reluctant to reverse its disarmament policy. Had it not done so I tremble to think what might bave happened to the British Commonwealth of Nation's. It is possible that had not Great Britain disarmed at all there might have been no Abyssinian campaign, and no invasion of Albania. The recent history of Germany might have been entirely different. It is, however, idle to speculate on that. At least, whether we think it was right or wrong, wise or unwise, we can be proud of the fact that Great Britain did honorably try to carry out the disarmament pact to the fullest, extent. I say to the honourable member for Batman, who says that Great Britain never will give up militarism, that Great Britain most reluctantly bowed to the necessity to rearm. The honourable member spoke disparagingly of the claim of the British Prime Minister that in this war Great Britain and its ally, France, are fighting for the rigbt3 and liberties of small nations. He said that he knew of no international law to authorize Great Britain to engage in armed intervention on behalf of small nations without first receiving a request from those nations so to do. When did Great Britain ever intervene without receiving such a request? Take Finland, for instance. Finland sent out appeals to the whole world for help, and Great Britain, as we have since learned, was only too ready to answer the appeal if it were possible to Great Britain, get troops through Norway and Sweden. Prime Minister Bamsay Does the honourable member suggest that Norway is unwanted by the people of that country? The honourable member referred to religious maxims, and to Christianity in a general way in connection with this matter. Does he think that Britain should be content merely to pass by on the other side, as did the man Good Samaritan, or does he think that Great Britain should intervene as did the Good Samaritan. The honourable gentleman repeated what is, in effect, mere Nazi propaganda by blaming Great Britain's laying of mines along the Norwegian coast as providing an excuse for the German invasion. Surely he does not believe that. Surely he knows that Germany has boastfully admitted that the landing took place many hours before the mines were sown. This is a remarkable war in many respects. One such respect is the callous disregard of neutral rights involved in the extraordinary sinking of neutral shipping by Germany, amounting to a total approaching 500,000 tons. Another development of this war is the fine art of lying propaganda by Germany. Herr Hitler, long before the war, in his book Mein Kampf, referred to the value of propaganda. He said that the timid little lie was of little use for propaganda purposes. It was easily recognizable as a lie; it was easily contradicted. But, he said, a big, bold lie, without any foundation except that of a vivid imagination, was almost always believed, was generally successful and, even if it were afterwards contradicted, there remained in the mind of the hearer the feeling that the original lie was more likely to be true than tbe contradiction. The Nazis' claim that the invasion of Norway was excused by Britain's breach of international law reaches the high standard of mendacity recommended by Herr Hitler. excused the invasion. member said that Great Britain gave the Nazis an excuse for the invasion by laying mines in Norwegian territorial",56,Opposition Members Hear

As a legal man, he must surely know that international law rests mainly on usage, and is absolutely dependent for its continuance ou mutual observance. bullied and terrorized Norway into inaction and acquiescence, so that Norway permitted the Altmark to pass through its territorial waters on the understanding that no prisoners were on board. ""While Great Britain may have been guilty of a technical breach of international law, every dictate of that humanity about which the honourable gentleman has said so much demanded the release of the prisoners from that prison ship. The honourable member also argued that now was the time to make an appeal for peace. He said that there were a dozen countries in Europe to whom this appeal could be entrusted. I remind him that there are only five countries which count in Europe: Great Britain, Prance, Germany, Italy and Russia. would there be of bringing those five countries around a conference table to-day? With in an unrepentant and unregenerate Germany to-day, a Germany which teaches its school children that the last war started because Belgium invaded Germany, which says that Great Britain started this war, which refuses, under penalty of imprisonment or death, io allow it3 people to listen to broadcasts from other countries from which they might learn the truth? Is it any wonder lhat a large percentage of the people of Germany can be induced to believe anything that tlie Nazi propaganda machine tells them to believe ? We, in this country, who enjoy freedom, find it difficult to believe that any intelligent people could long consent to remain in such thraldom. No; we cannot make peace with a German government which has broken almost every pact it has made in recent years. As Mr Chamberlain put it, Hitler gave his word to observe the Locarno Treaty; be broke it. He gave his word that he had no desire or intention to annex Austria; he broke it. He gave his word that he would not incorporate the Czechs in the Reich; he did so. He gave his word after Munich that he had no further territorial Mr Paterson. demands; he-'broke it. He gave his Avord that he wanted no Polish provinces; he broke it. He swore for years that he was the mortal enemy of Bolshevism, and he became its ally. I say that no nation wants peace more earnestly than do the people of the British Empire. No other Germany had British Prime Minister, in the course of all our history, ever went to such lengths as did the present British Prime Minister in his attempts to preserve peace. Honourable members will admit that. But Mr Chamberlain to-day recognizes, as, I think, does every man and woman who lives in a practical world, and not in a world of dreams, that a patched-up peace with an unrepentant and undefeated Germany would be no lasting peace, but an armed truce during which the mad armaments race would go on as before. I regard the present ruler of Germany as a far greater menace to the peace of the world than ever Napoleon was. Eveni f we agree with the Leader of the Opposition that every country has the right to choose its own form of government-and that is a What hope reasonable proposition-it must be a government whose word and pledges have some value before we can make peace with whom could we negotiate it. Wc can put.no trust in the word of the present German Government. Herr Hitler said some time ago, in a statement to the then Nazi leader in Danzig, with whom he has since broken, that he was prepared to sign anything. He said that he would make a non-aggression pact with any one. It was, he said, a simpleton's idea to refrain from making such a pact simply because the day might come when it would have to be broken. That is his cynical idea of the value of pacts. I believe that, in this war, we are fighting for. .the right of the individual to live his^ own life, to think his own ; thoughts, ito express his own views in his own way, no one daring to make him afraid. I believe that we are fighting for truth and good faith, in international relations; for the right of all nations, great and small, to live their own national lives, and to retain their independence, civic liberties and religious institutions; for the right of all nations, great and small, to trade freely with one another and not under duress, to live in peace with one another, and not under the constant shadow of the fear of attack by more powerful neighbours. No country has ever had a better cause for engaging in war. I shall order to create a political psychology support the Government in every effort it may make to bring the struggle to a successful conclusion, and in passing the legislation foreshadowed in the Speech of 1 His Excellency the Governor General. There is a disposition on the part of honourable gentlemen opposite to lecture .members of the Opposition as to what their political policy should be in the I more generous than the Labour party in giving to the Government that which is essential for the most efficient war effort those big business interests that to-day possible. Every vote that has heen sought by the Government to prepare this country to meet the emergency has had the support of honourable gentlemen on this side, and it ill-becomes honourable gentlemen opposite to give homilies as to where our duty lies. Mi. PATERSON I criticized only one honourable member, the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). not only the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) but also amongst other honourable members, the honourable son) who devoted the whole of his time to a critical review of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin). able member for New England sought to give tbe impression that the Leader of the Opposition did not have a realist's view of the present situation. ber for New England admits that. 1 listened to the honourable member earnestly and patiently in the hope that he would give some indication of the Country party policy; but no, we are not to be enlightened in that direction; we are merely to be subjected to strictures from the cross benches. The honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) essayed to take the Opposition to task. I repeat for that honourable gentleman's benefit that the Opposition has been extremely generous to this Government in assisting it in the war effort. We are all aware that this is the kind of thing that invariably occurs when an election is imminent. In cidents in recent weeks have been capitalized, exaggerated and magnified in favorable to the parties opposite. Those parties never win on their own merits. Any victories they have are due to their efforts to make it appear to the general community that in the Labour party there is a sinister design and an unwillingness to face the realities of nationhood. At the same time, honourable gentlemen opposite sit snugly in their places and condone exploitation and profiteering. Have we heard of one prosecution of those who are present emergency, but no party has been profiteering in this war ? Not one! Until the end of this Government's regime there will be no prosecution of are unmercifully using this dire period as a means for improving their financial standing. In the Governor General's Speech there is an indication that the Government intends to impose a wartime profits tax, I understand, to the extent of 60 per cent. If there he the necessity for that tax, there is sufficient proof that the community is being exploited. Yet, instead of taking 100 per cent, of the excess profits, the Government is prepared to take only 60 per cent., allowing the commercial interests to walk away with the other 40 per cent. That is how this Government is prepared to condone the activities of those people who would be The honorwilling, if they could get the licence, to go so far as to trade with the enemy in order to increase their wealth. When the people have had the opportunity to have the situation placed before them in an unbiased way and have weighed the respective policies of the Government and the Opposition, on each occasion they have registered a verdict in favour of the party to which I have the honour to belong. The people of Australia stand solidly behind the principles and the policy of the Australian Labour movement. It was the Leader 'of the Opposition who was the realist to-day when he directed attention to a grave menace to our own safety. I warn honourable gentlemen opposite that there will be a reckoning if they fail in their duty in this respect.

That is our first obligation. If we are to offer any further assistance to the Allies, over and of the big emporiums in Rundle-street, above the immediate protection of this country, that must be to supply such materials and foodstuffs as we can to Britain and its Allies. As we heard today from a member of the House of Commons, Britain can supply itself with foodstuffs for only two days a week and relies on outside sources for the maintenance of its population on the other five days.

In one particular case it affected a young man with five years' service to this firm that certified to his capabilities and integrity. The significance of that is that this year certain of those young men will be called up for compulsory military training. It is the same thing with, most Adelaide. The excuse, of course, is that there is a re-organization of the staff. One young man applied to five or six different emporiums and at each he was asked, "" Do you come under the provisions of compulsory military training this year "" ? When he replied "" Yes "", he was told "" We are very sorry but we are unable to place you "". Such is the kind of patriotism we find. I have supplied the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) with particulars of one case in a theatre in Adelaide and, if the right he will be lacking in his sense of responsibility. The young man concerned in that case is undergoing military training at the moment. While he is undergoing training, he is told that on completion of such held will not be available to him.

Economic conscription is being applied to the sons of the workers, persons which need no repentance. whereas the sons of the more wealthy section of the community, most of whom are undertaking professional studies, are able to obtain exemption. In these matters, the Government has something to answer for. Frequently, the persons who do these things are among those who parade their patriotism. From the homes of the workers come the majority of those who enlist in the Navy, the Army and the Air Force, and woi'k in our munitions factories. Yet honourable members opposite cast aspersions upon the loyalty of this section of .the community. The time has come to acquaint the electors with the facts. The Prime Minister has told the people of Australia that they must be prepared for hardships and sacrifice, and a tightening of their belts. At the same time it boasts that its motto is, ""Business as usual"". of the community is being exploited by those who seek to make greater profits.

On each occasion they have adopted a slogan containing a few words. In 1925, a statement made by Tom ""Walsh was capitalized-in their interests. So grave were the charges against Tom ""Walsh that his deportation was made an election issue. Ou almost every hoarding throughout Australia, this man was depicted jumping on the Union Jack.

Later the catch cry was inflation""; and another elec<r tion was won by the anti-Labour parties. Subsequently, a charge of "" isolation"" against the Labour party was used with good effect. Then followed "" repudiation."" It is easy to predict what the slogan at the next election will be. It is significant that the parties now forming the Government never win an election on their own policy, but always as the result of some form of sensationalism. It is time that their tactics were exposed. The results of recent by-elections should give the Government food for thought. The patriotism The ""Wakefield electorate, which had been held since federation by the Tory element, was won by Labour with a substantial majority. The death of the former Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) left the ""Wilmot seat vacant.

Notwithstanding a continuous barrage by the Melbourne metropolitan press, particularly in regard to war issues, and the malignity of the propaganda against the Labour party, the electors of Corio returned the Labour party's nominee, Mr Dedman. Thus, it is clear that both the wartime policy and the domestic policy of the Labour party are preferred by the Australian people to the policy of the Government. The Prime Minister was not sufficiently courageous to announce to the people of Corio, and to the nation as a whole, its more recent decision to send an army corps overseas.

244,Mr Francis (Moreton) [10.15],"I that is, in Australia. That party is prebirthright, because we havebeeu associated with and have been a»part of the British Empire, and have enjoyed the protection of the British navy. Without that protection we could not last a day, and if Great Britain should go down we, too, would go down in a very short time. Australia has been in the happy position of having always had this protection. We cannot expect Great Britain to purchase and convoy our produce overseas if we ourselves do not play our part. Australia is the greatest prize in the world to-day. Where is there which has the big open spaces that we have? Where is there another country which has our resources? The very moment that Great Britain went down we should be subject to attack from every quarter. If the Labour party were allowed to carry out the policy to which it has given expression Great Britain would go under. Great Britain is protecting us from those nations that have designs upon us. The adoption of the policy of isolation and of "" Hands off Russia"" shows that the Labour party is riddled with communism, is moribund and is not worthy of the confidence of the people of Australia. Parliament has been called together mainly for the purpose of appropriating money for the prosecution of the war, and I hope that we shall get on with that job very quickly. I wish to say one or two words about the extraordinary and unhappy conditions that exist in the coal-mining industry. I appreciate the many difficulties that confront the coal-miners. I appreciate in equal degree the part that the Prime Minister has been playing, and that he proposes to play, in an endeavour to bring about peace in this industry. He proposes to-morrow to. address the coal-miners of Kurri Kurri. r This .speech will be broadcast to the whole of Australia. listen to what he has to say, and, above all, that they will accept his advice. I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the coal-miners of Queensland, about 60 per cent, of whom are in my electorate. These men have had the opportunity to express their view as to the action that should be taken. By an overwhelming majority they have declared emphatically that they do not wish to participate in this strike, in spite of the fact that the Communist leaders of the movement in New South WalesMessrs. Orr and Nelson-wen t to Queensland and harangued the miners' union. These men have my highest admiration and esteem for the noble stand they have made against extreme pressure. They appealed to the Arbitration Court for a 40-hour week, and it was granted to them. They asked for fourteen holidays annually-which , in my opinion, was for far too long denied them-and obtained another country them. The miners themselves have stated in the press and in conversation with me that the Communist leaders of the movement are responsible for the tragic struggle in which they are engaged to-day. 1 realize that the coal-mining industry is -one of the most difficult in which men could be engaged. It bristles with difficulties, problems, accidents, sickness, and diseases such as tuberculosis and minens' phthisis. I believe that these men should receive the highest wages and the best conditions that the industry can afford to provide. A 40-hour week is not too short. To-day, the wives and children of these men, as well as they themselves, are suffering because of the activities of the Communist influence in the movement. The Communists who are in control are doing their utmost to destroy the industry and to nullify Australia's war effort. This strike began as far back as 1937, when the first threat of war dropped like a bombshell on all of us. Mr Orr, the general secretary of the Miners Federation, is reported to have then made the following statement to a southern newspaper :The vital question in this (1937) dispute was therefore not one of organization, but merely a strategic appreciation of the situation. We selected a time when war scares abroad had increased the coal trade. Everywhere there were shrieks for coal' and more I hope that .' they will coal, steel and more steel, ships and move ships. In 1938 the following,statement appeared in the same southern .newspaper:The strike was planned and timed a year ago. Nothing could stop it.

Communist leaders, and not the men. The men are not in favour of. what their Communist leaders are doing. In the course of my speech to-night a number of interjections have been made about conscription. I wish here and now to nail down' this conscriptionist lie. Again, and again, and again, the Prims Minister has said that it is our desire to secure an early peace and to end this terrible war which is threatening the whole structure of civilization. He has made it clear that the Government is willing to do everything in its power to proserationed in order that large stocks may cute the war to a successful issue, but even to-day Communists, Pacifists, and some Labour leaders, are endeavouring to work the people into a state of hysteria about conscription. They are suggesting thai the Prime Minister intends to introduce conscription with the object of requiring every able bodied man to render overseas service. The Prime Minister has denied, almost ad nauseam, that he has any intention of the kind. He has made it clear that any man who desires to proceed overseas to fight for the defence of this country and of,the Empire will be assisted to do so, but he must enlist of his own volition. Only the men who volunteer will be required to serve overseas. Those who volunteer will be trained and will be assisted to the theatre of war in which it is believed they may render tbe most effective service; but onlj volunteers will be called upon to go overseas. It is not the policy of this Government to introduce conscription for overseas service. The Government has done an extraordinarily good job of work in having arranged for the sale of considerably more than £100,000,000 worth of our primary products overseas, but one section of our . primary producers is suffering considerable anxiety. I refer to the producers of dairy products. The agreement with the British Government for the purchase of Australian dairy produce will expire on the 30th June next. The ""goods that have [01 been sold have returned to the producers a satisfactory price, and the agreement was not opposed in any way. Mr BI-AIK -Does the honourable member believe that the price was reasonable? protests' from the producers and is not in dispute. Britain has had in force for some considerable time a restrictive policy in connection with consumption of dairy produce. Until quite recently the ration was only 4 oz. of butter a week for each person. This has lately been increased to 8 oz., but the consumption of margarine in both Great Britain and Australia has reached such alarming proportions that the dairy producers are in grave anxiety concerning the position. In some quarters it has been suggested that butter has been be conserved in Great Britain so that when consideration is being given to the renewal of the agreement it will be posr sible to oblige the producers to accept a lower price. I do not believe that this is so. Of course, the unfortunate position of Denmark has substantially eased the position for Australia. Until quite recently, the Danes sent 215,000 tons of butter a month to Great Britain. No doubt henceforth the Danish production of butter will be commandeered by Germany, and in due course the dairy stocks of that country will also be diverted to Germany. This will undoubtedly relieve the position in respect of Australia, and it will be a considerable time after the war before Denmark will be an active competitor against Australia in dairy products. quantities of dairy produce were also finding their way to Great Britain from the smaller Baltic countries. ter for Commerce j( Mr Archie Cameron) has in mind the supplies received from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Finland. Holland is also a big producer of butter. The export of butter from these countries because of the difficulties of the war has also been substantially reduced. I hope that, the Minister will take an early opportunity to make a more reassuring statement to the dairy producers of this country than he has hitherto beeD",62,Opposition Members Hear

I trust that steps will also be taken to deal effectively with what I am advised is an amazing growth in the sale of margarine in both Great Britain and Australia.

Appropriate legislation designed to that end should be introduced in this Parliament without delay and in all State Parliaments. matter with which this Parliament can deal. ister to use his influence in the Australian Agricultural Council to urge the State governments to implement the decisions of the council in this connection.

Australia have not entrusted this Parliament with sufficient power to deal with this subject. culty caused by the constitutional limitations of the Parliament, but I again ask the Minister to exercise every power he has to see that appropriate steps are taken to curtail the human consumption of margarine as imitation butter. I have no objection to margarine in its normal sphere but not as a competitor with butter. If the various States will cooperate, the situation can be effectively dealt with and the trouble largely overcome. In conclusion, I appeal to the members of all parties in this House to rally around the Government and assist it to the fullest measure in the prosecution of the war. The Government is making a very noble effort in this connection, and its activities should not be retarded by men opposite, and especially by persons with Communist tendencies and sympathies. I strongly appeal to the members of the Labour party to review their war policy and to abandon the moribund attitude which they have adopted.
