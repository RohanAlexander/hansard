It is a well-known rule of debate here that to provide an opportunity for disoussion a motion must be submitted, and the Prime Minister stated that, in order to facilitate the discussion of the matter that ho was bringing before the House, he would move ""That the.paper be printed,"" holding up a copy of the Argus, from which he had read a statement he had made.

This motion, of course, is for the adjournment of the House; hut would it not be fitting, and within the .Standing Orders^ to give the House the fullest and freest opportunity to discuss the Judge's conduct, as well as the award he made, and all the circumstances relevant thereto which we think should be ventilated ? missible. All parliamentary authorities are agreed that such a discussion cannot be raised on a motion for the .adjournment of the House. If the conduct of a Judge is to he made the subject of criticism by Parliament, it can only he upon a substantive motion.' For the information of the HouseI may, perhaps, read what May has to say on the matterCertain matters cannot be debated, save upon a substantive motion which can be dealt with by amendment, or by the distinct vote of the House, such as the conduct of the Sovereign, the Heir to the Throne, tbe Viceroy and Governor General of India, the LordLieuteftant of Ireland, the Speaker, the Chairman of Ways and Means, members of either Houses of Parliament, and Judges of the superior Courts of the United Kingdom, including .persons holding the position of a Judge, such as a Judge in a Court of Bankruptcy, and of a County Court. These matters cannot, therefore, be questioned by way of amendment, nor upon a motion for adjournment understanding order No. 17. The conduct of a Judge cannot be discussed on a motion of this kind, and, therefore, the .present discussion must, be"" confined to the award and such matters as do not involve criticism and reflection on the Judge. were President of the Court and not a Judge, or does it apply only because he is a Judge? I point out that the Deputy Presidents and the Chairman of the Coal Board are not Judges. I wish to make it perfectly clear that I am not taking sides in the matter at all, but only desire -to know whether the distinction is' to be drawn between the President, because he is a Judge, and Deputy-Presidents and -the Chairman of the Coal Tribunal, who are not Judges. If these latter may be criticised while the President of the Court may not be criticised, not because he is President of the Court, but because he is also a Judge,, then, to a certain extent, we are hampered in dealing with the (matter. I , of course, take a different view of the matter from that of my friend -opposite, but there is the position, and I desire your ruling, Mr Speaker. ber for Darling( Mr Blakeley) yet committed any offence against the Standing Orders? Minister( Mr Hughes) deals with a hypothetical case, on which I do not feel called upon to give a ruling. If a case of that kind arises I shall be prepared to deal -with it ; but in the present case the motion deals with an award of a Judge of the Court. I have mentioned the matter at this stage to avoid, if I can, any occasion to intervene while debate is in progress. Question, proposed. thank you, Mr Speaker, and the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) for giving me -warning as to what may befall me if I -transgress the rules of the House. This, 1 think, is the sixth attempt I have made here to ventilate the very extraordinary judgment given by Mr Justice Powers, the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. There is a mass of material connected with the matter, and the time at my disposal will not allow me to' use it all. I do not desire to do the Judge any injustice, and I shall carefully give extracts from his own judgment, and use his own words as they appear in the transcript and minutes. May I say that in this Parliament it should be possible for any member, if he so desires, to submit a motion censuring a Judge and asking for his removal? But when I moved a motion, which was tice Powers, it was placed at the bottom of the business-paper, and the Government refused to allow it to he discussed. Personally, I do not think that a man occupying a high judicial position should continue in office in the face of such a motion. To give an idea of the extraordinary circumstances in connection with this particular award, I shall refer, as briefly as possible,to some of the incidents during the hearing. I take f u l l responsibility for my action in dealing with this important matter, which involves between 40,000 and 50,000 men in Australia.

37,Practically One Of Censure On Mr Jus,"held up; sheds which should have been "" cut out"" three months ago are still without labour, and at the award rates are likely to continue without labour. This will mean a great loss to the country, and a great loss to the workers, because they are without shearing. I shall give one 'illustration of the many mistakes which have been made, and it is an extraordinary mistake on the part of a Judge occupying the highest position in the Industrial Courts of Australia. In one portion of his judgment, which appears in the Commonwealth Arbitration Records, he said that if a man sheared 200 sheep a day at 30s. per 100 this equalled £3 10s. This ought to have been stated as £ 3 ; hut, on the rate of £3 10s., the Judge declared that a shearer would receive £19 5s. per week. ber say that that is in the first award Mr parties, the Court having noi power to' do Justice Powers made? incidents during the many hearings of the . case. award, it is in the judgment. A school boy of ithe second class could not make such a mistake, or, if he did, he would very hurriedly remedy it. That mistake of the Judge, however, still stands. ber eay that that mistake is incorporated in the award? the reasons given when Mr .Justice Powers gave an award for 35s. In the first judgment, delivered on 5th May, 1922, His Honour fixed the shearing rate at 30s. per 100, and shed hands' wages at £3 per week. Four pages of his judgment were occupied in proving to the respondents and applicants before him that 30s. (per 100 was a fair rate; and, after he-had proved this to his own satisfaction, he suddenly discovered that he had made a mistake. Later on, based on such reasons as I have indicated, he fixed the rate at 35s. On page 16 of his judgment, Mr Justice Powers saysAs it is proposed, to fix the basic wage at the same rate as in the 1917 award, because the rate is fair now, the shearers and other piece-work rates and wages will remain the same as in the old award. I am satisfied that the 30s. rate will secure to the shearers in 1922-23-24 much better returns than it did, or, at any rate, what the Court intimated it would return to the average shearer in the days when .the 30s. was first fixed. As. a (inatteir of fact the basic wage for 1916 waa 63s. (vide page 71 March .Bulletin, No. 87, index No. 1324, equals 10s. 6d. per day, 63s. per week; whereas same Bulletin, page 73, shows index No. for March, 1922, as 1630, equals 13s. 4d. per day,""or 80s. per week). The old claim was based upon the 1915 index figures as. to cost of living (vide same Bulletin, page 71 index figure 1278, equal td 10s.. 2d. per day, or 61s. per week). That claim was for 30s. per 100, and though the case was not heard until about June, 1917, when 30s. was not a fair rate; yet, because it was the limit asked for, and tthe claim could not be amended, that rate was"" awarded by consent of the anything else. The rat© of 30s. was based upon the known-procedure of the Court; but, before we could obtain our award, the cost of .living had increased so rapidly that we were really entitled to the 32s. 6d. per 100. However, as I have just mentioned, we were legally prevented from securing anything better. Before making his award final, His Honour discovered that something 'had gone wrong with his figures, and ne altered the rate from 30s. per 100 and £ 3 per week, to 35s. per 100 and £3 10s. per week. And he said he had never intended to do anything else. ' That was after he had occupied four pages iu order to justify his judgment for 30s. per 100. This, though an improvement on the first intimation, is not a fair award. His Honour; on 'page 24 of his statement,says, "" On the whole I am satisfied that 25 per cent, lost time is reasonable for the whole expedition/' On page 25 he saysIn the judgment, when making the award in 1911, it was apparently accepted as a fair estimate that whatever average number of sheep were shorn' at .n shed, the average number for the time of the expedition was about 338 per week. Those figures appear to have, been accepted in 1917. His Honour further says, on the same pageOn the evidence before, although it was shown in 1.912 that shearers averaged whilst at the sheds 439 sheep per week, I do not think, even allowing for the better organization in some districts to secure a run of sheds, that shearers generally had increased the average for the expedition from 338 to more than 350.",16,Adjournment Formal Shearing Dispute Arbitration Awabd

On page 2 5 A of his f o u r t h judgment It w ill be noted that if 400 at the start His Honour saysAssuming that 439 sheep a week is the lost time, the average for the expedition average while at the sheds, it is clear that in is only 300 per week. His Honour only four weeks the number of sheep shorn by a allowed 12^ per cent, off by starting at shearer would be 1,756; hut if 25 per cent, is 350. Nevertheless he does it , as the f o l fair for lost time, it would take five weeks to shear them, and that would mean only 351 lowing further quotation from his judgsheep per week. I cannot, therefore, basement shows:rates on 439 sheep, even if it is an average. But His Honour does base his rates on matters referred to, I propose to see what the 350 sheep per week, which is also should be the rates fixed on Mr Allen's basis. Mr Blakeley.

Total. . ' The basis wage includes the husband's food at home . . That would be th© amount a shearer would get if he were a wages man and shore only 50 sheep a day, but in all awards made by this Court for piece-workers the rates fixed are from 10 per cent, to 33 per cent, more than on wages. If 20 (i9s. 2d.) iper cent, is added for piece-work, it ' would amount to about £6 l is . 2d. It would be necessary on these figures to give to the average shearer about 35s. per 100, if the average number he shore per week for the time of the expedition were 350 in order to secure to him £6 12s. 6d. Out of that amount he would have to pay his mess account of 25s. per week and 6s. per week for fares. It will be noted that 350 sheep at 35s. per 100 will only give £6 2s. 6d., not, as stated, £6 12s. 6d. His Honour says that the discrepancy is due to a typist's error, but most likely it was not, as he was testing a sum of £6 l is . 2d., and by making a mistake of 10s. in the sum misled himself. To produce £6 12s. 6d. it would require 38s. per 100, not 35s. as stated, but if the actual ayerage in the shed on the respondents' ownfiguresare taken, 325, over 40s. per 100 will be required to produce £6 12s. 6d. On page 9 of the Judge's operative Shearing Company, said that under 'final remarks he is reported to have saidThere are good reasons, in my opinion, why Queensland rates could reasonably be higher than a Federal rate for all other States. The Judge had no evidence at all with regard to conditions in Queensland. There was evidence for that State before the Court in 1911, when the pastoralists pleaded for a lower rate in the southern States than in Queensland. President ( Mr Justice Higgins), who had the evidence of all the States before him, said {Commonwealth Arbitration Report No. 5, page 84)If any discrimination in rates ought to be made as between States the rate ought to be lower for Queensland, for the sheep generally Week. are in Queensland easier to shear and the £ s. d. tallies are greater for a day's work; and pwing to the prevalence of dry weather in the shearing months the average earnings from .. .. 3 18 0 start to finish' are higher. .. .. 0 ,18 0 Let me now give an illustration of the chaos which this award has caused in the .. . . 1 4 0 pastoral industry.

When an award is responsible for such chaos as exists in the pastoral industry, and is based upon such extraordinary miscalculations, no citizen who resists it should be charged with a criminal offence, and possibly gaoled. That is probably what will happen to some of us before this case is finished. come to see you. honourable member when he was in. gaol, and it would be only fair if he were to return the compliment. I only hope that my durance is as pleasant as was that of the honourable member, who had fruit, cigarettes, and plenty of reading matter, the warder coming at 5 o'clock in the evening and saying, "" Mr Considine, your room is ready."" If I can serve my time in a Victorian gaol, I shall not object so much. In the Graziers versus Booie case, the following evidence -was reported: Clarence Spier, manager of the Graziers Conormal conditions tliere was no difficulty about getting men for shearing, but this year it was very difficult 'to get men. Wheni t was known that 35s. was the rate, the men generally stated that they would not accept, and would stand out for_ Queensland rates. There had been great difficulty in getting labour right up to the present time. William Henry Eyres, a shearing contractor, said that he was a. member of the Merriwa Contract Company. There was no difficulty in getting labour during normal years. There The then was difficulty this year, the difficulty first manifesting itself about mid-June. . . . The witness said he was at Coonong on 12th July. The shearers .were there, but they did not start. Foster Francis Cooper, organizer of the Graziers Co-operative Shearing Company, said there was plenty of labour offering an normal years, but this year there was practically no",17,Adjournment Formal Shearing Dispute Arbitration Awabd
46,Mr Considine,Neve r mind; I shall,19,Adjournment Formal Shearing Dispute Arbitration Awabd
47,Mr Blakeley,"I went to see the labour offering at all. Since tbe Federal award came out there had been no labour offering. Herbert Lionel Davies, manager of the Federal Pastoral Shearing Company, said under normal conditions there was no difficulty in obtaining shearers no difficulty about labour last year, but this year, as soon as the new award was announced, there was a very decided slackening off in both verbal and written applications. They had not been able to get all the labour necessary. Many men.refused work when he said he was paying award. rates. The difficulty in getting labour continued right up 'to. the present. Arthur Stanley Long, a shearing contractor, said that in normal times there was sufficient labour offering been very difficult to get men since the award was announced. work and then refused it. Charles McDonnell, a member of a shearing contracting firm, and Thomas Bell Eyre, manager of Bringagee station, gave similar evidence. There have been strikes all over New South Wales. In South Australia practically the whole of the sheds, so far as we know, are shearing at £2 per 100. pastoralists are paying the £2 without any demur, recognising, I believe, as quite a number of the squatters do, that the award is based upon wrong grounds, and that miscalculations and mistakes occurred, as a result of which the men are not getting a fair deal. On page 13 of his judgment, the President, after mentioning that different methods of calculating the rates for shearing had been suggested, saidFor instance, although the purchasing power of money increased as a matter of fact it decreasedby at least 2s. between 1907 and 1911, Mr Justice Higgins in 1911 found that 24s. a 100, the rate fixed in 1907, would give to tbe shearer under the then existing conditions, for the reasons mentioned by him, all hewere arrived at. was fairly entitled to during the expedition, and fixed the same rate in 1911 as was fixed in 1907, 24s. per 100. The Judge has made many errors. Did time permit, I could give, I think, twelve illustrations of the extraordinary attitude of his mind in dealing with this case. I do not know whether he personally arrived at the figures that he used or relied upon"" the calculations of some one else. If the calculations were his own, his education in arithmetic was sadly neglected, but in any case he was responsible for the correctness of the figures' used. One instance of the absurdity of Ifr. Blakeley. his calculations is the working out of' 200 sheep at 30s. per 100 asi £ 3 10s. There is not the slightest chance of the shearers working under the award, and no There was hope of peace in the pastoral industry under it . Next' year the men will be even more solid than they are this year. The pastoralists may believe themselves strong, but we feel that we are much stronger. . We will not work under the award, and refuse to abide by its conditions.

56,Mr Groom,"The result of th»stances I wish to say at the beginning that Parliament is not the place in which to review the judgments of the Arbitration Court. Were every honourable member to use his position here to get legal cases discussed in Parliament with a view to influencing decisions, the Courts would lose their character as judicial tribunals.

The honourable member for Darling( Mr Justice Powers again, but that made no Blakeley) has made an ex parte statement. I am not in a position at this moment to criticise it in detail. ' He based his case on remarks made by Mr Justice Powers during the progress of a trial; but what We have to ask is, Does the award do substantial justice?

Minister as an authority on unionism. of honesty, is it right for any person to invite a union to apply to a Tribunal for a decision and then, having got an award, given according to the law, to go out and create discontent, in order to nullify it? The judgment of Mr Justice Powers was given after a most careful inquiry, and it is deeply to be regretted that the honourable member has taken this action. It is certainly not in the interests of the workers. BeforeI conclude, let me quote the following, which shows what big money is earned by shearers under the award in question:In a statement issued by the Graziers' Association to-day, it was shearers were earning from £9 to £17 a week in the sheds of New South Wales. These men are said to be working only forty-four hours, .weekly, at the Federal award rates of 35s. a hundred. Weekly earnings of from £10 to £12, it was also stated, were common, and ringers were drawing from £13 to £17. At shearers shore 14,725 sheep in one week, averaging about 640 a man. This, on the Federal award Tate, would work out at just .over £11 a man for a week's work. During a previous week at the same shed, the same shearers shore 12,302 sheep for the week, or member had made no charges against the an average of about 534 a man. On award Judge. rates this would work out at about £9 6s. a man for the week. The ringer's tally for the against an award given by Mr Justice week was 752, which would return him just over £13. At Dummbral, Collarendabri, 20 shearers Court, and any Government that believes shore 13,008 sheep in one week, averaging 650 in arbitration and wants to see the sysa man, which would work out at £11 12s. 6d. tem continued should immediately take a man.

It is unfortunate that the honourable member for Darling should seek to discredit a judgment that has produced such excellent results for the workers of Australia. Attorney-General( Mr Groom) waxed rather warm because the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) had raised this question in the House. He charged the honourable member with having aided and abetted men to break awards given by the Arbitration Court. said that 2,000 for Darling admitted having done so. charged with a very big responsibility on this question of Arbitration, and before the Attorney-General lectures the honourable member for Darling for having incited men to break an award, he should Boorooma, Walgett, twenty-three investigate the very grave charges that honourable member has made against a Judge, and see if they are true.

82,Mr Scullin,"He made chargesit has had it in its power to create turmoil in the country, and although, on many occasions, it has not got all it has asked for and has suffered many disappointments in awards given since it first went to the Courti n 1907, it has never once struck against a decision once an award has been given. The responsibility rests upon the Government to say how it happens that this union, which has so faithfully abided by the awards of the Arbitration .Court, is now proceeding to break an award today. Not one of the facts put forward by the honourable member for Darling has been controverted. It is a simple question of arithmetic. The Attorney General says that if the Judge made a mistake in arriving at his figure, the union should have gone before him again. As a matter of fact, the Minister knows that the union did go before the Judge again. It placed all these facts before His Honour, but its efforts were of no avail. The President of the Arbitration Court stubbornly stood to his mistake, not even admitting that he had been guilty of making a common, ordinary, arithmetical error. If the Government choose to bluff through a proposition like that, I am afraid that this big organization, the Australian ""Workers Union, will have nothing more to do with arbitration. I say this with regret, because if we can have peace in the industrial world, and justice done to the men who toil, without the arbitrament of strikes, it will be of benefit to the country. Buti f the Government choose to stand by a Judge who makes this kind of error, and stubbornly stands by it, they will have to take the responsibility for the industrial discord that will prevail in Australia. The award given by Mr Justice Powers is one of the worse examples of bungling ever perpetrated by a man in a responsible position. tell the truth in this case and observe the rules of the House. this discussion to take place, I took theopportunity of reminding honourable members that, while they were at liberty to. discuss an award given by a Judge, no personal reflection or attack must be made upon the Judge himself! I hope that honorahle members will refrain frcm remarks which are not in order. Attorney-General has told us, namely, that it is not within the province of this Parliament to review a decision given in any Court; but the issue to-day is something more than the mere matter of reviewing an arbitration award. The issue is, whether, in view of the serious statements made by the honourable member for Darling, the Government's appointment of Mr Justice Powers as President of the Arbitration Court was justified. keep within the ruling of the Chair. I shall take one out of the many illustrations given by the honourable member for Darling to prove that the award in question was based upon a mistake. His Honour based his decision on figures supplied by the Pastoralists Union, namely, that the average shear is 439 per week. That this was an increase of 101 on the . previous year's average was admitted. The very men who came before the Court and supplied these figures were those who had previously contended that the introduction of the forty-four hour week would reduce the speed of shearing by from 5' to 27$ per cent. Yet His Honour accepted the ex parte statement of these' men, which, on the face of it , could not be true. He not only does that able member -may discuss the award, but cannot discuss the Judge. to discuss the award itself. It provides for 439 sheep per week as the average, and then allows a reduction of twenty-five for lost time. An ordinary ""school boy with a third-class education, if asked to take 25 per cent, from 439, would give the answer as 329. but the award gives it as 351. I pin the Minister down to that one fact. Without traversing the supporting arguments of the honourable member for Darling, I ask the Minister, who is responsible to this country in the matter of arbitration, whether he is prepared to say that the workers are bound to abide by awards« based on such erroneous figures? When the question came before the Court again, and the figures were put before the Judge, no man not stubbornly prepared to stand by statements made, however, erroneous, would have refrained from, correcting them. That has not been done, and yet this body of men are expected",23,Adjournment Formal Shearing Dispute Arbitration Awabd

90,Mr Scullin,"I will try my bestto accept the award. Further, the Judge has allowed 20 per cent., although he says that the right allowance is 25 per cent. I ask honourable members to exercise their common sense, and to put themto the position they have taken up. They selves in the position of those men who earn their living in this industry They way, accept the award. Those who, aftermay have gone to the Court, and have been disappointed in the award given, hut they have abided by the award. The Minister -for Defence( Mr Greene) says that that is because the awards have always improved the position of the men; but I point out that the awards were not always in accordance with the cost of living. have been disappointed in this regard, but in many cases have abided by the decision. ' an obvious mistake in arithmetic which robs them, at any rate, of 5s. per 100, it is asking too much of human nature to expect the men to accept the award. There is no organization in Australia, and certainly not the Australian Workers Union, which could ask its members to abide by such an award. If the Minister is simply going to brush the matter aside, and, lecturing the shearers, the old days of strikes. tell them that they must abide by the award whether they like it or not-that they must accept the bad arithmetic of the President-it is making a> farce of arbitration, and, indeed, wiping arbitratain the services of statisticians to investion out.

My view is that the mistake of the shearers was in going, in the first place, to the Arbitratio n Court. The Australian Workers TJnion desired, by means of a conference w i th the Pastoralists Union, to obviate an upheaval, but the Pastoralists Union refused to meet them and' discuss any alteration of the conditions.

This is not a matter that w ill be settled in the Arbitratio n Court; it w ill be settled, as in the past, by the strength of the organized forces.

It w ill be a question of whether the circumstances are -favorable to the pastoralists or the men.

In Committee (Consideration resumed from 19th September, vide page 2395): Clause 13Section one hundred and thirteen of the Principal Act is amended by omitting the word "" s h a l l "" (second occurring) and inserting in its stead the word "" may"". Section proposed to be amended(1) On polling day, an elector shall be entitled to vote at any prescribed polling place for the subdivision for which lie is enrolled, or he shall be permitted to vote at any other polling place within the State for which he is enrolled at which a polling booth is open, under and subject to the regulations to absent voting. sire to be informed of the reason for the extraordinary amendment proposed in the Act. Since electors have been given the right of absent voting, they should be free to exercise it ; 'their opportunity to do so should not be merely permissive. One of the greatest privileges of our electoral system is the right of absent voting. It does away with much postal voting, and, compared with that method, is infinitely more to be desired. One of its advantages is that an elector need not worry about being within reach of ihis own subdivision on polling day. He knows that, under the law, he will be accorded the right of voting as an absent voter in any polling booth in the State in which he resides. Many an elector does not know, until the last moment, whether he will be within his own subdivision on polling day; by which time-in the case of his absence-if the law demanded that he should vote by post rather than as an [98] absentee, it would be too late for him to secure postal voting papers. The Government now propose that an elector shall no longer retain the right to vote as an absentee, as a matter of unquestioned legal procedure, but that he may be accorded that privilege. Who will determine whether he may or may not be so permitted? I understand, that the reason of the Government for proposing the change in the law is based upon trouble which arose out of the last election. At a certain polling place in the division of Ballarat there was an insufficient supply of absent voting papers. Surely, however, it is the duty of the electoral authorities to see that every polling place is furnished with adequate supplies. The Government should not stint money in securing full and true expression of the will of the people by medium of the ballot-box. Every possible facility under the law should be provided for electors to record their votes. Rather than that this permissive provision should be inserted in the Electoral Act, I would prefer to sec the privilege of absent voting actually withdrawn. Electors would then know exactly where they stood. It would be an altogether unsatisfactory position if , when an elector entered a polling booth at the last moment on polling day and aprelating plied for the necessary papers to enable him to record hi3 vote as an absentee, the presiding officer saw fit to withhold those papers. I ask the Government not to press this amendment of the law. ney-General) [4.18] -The reason for the amendment is that in the last general elections trouble arose owing to an insufficiency' of absent voters' ballot-papers at one polling . place in the Ballarat division. It was held during the hearing of the petition arising out of that election that there was an absolute duty on the part of the Commonwealth Electoral Department to provide voting facilities, under section 113-that which is proposed to be amended-for any person who might make application; provided, of course, that the elector was able to fulfil the conditions of the section. I ask honourable members to visualize the enormous area of the Commonwealth, and to think of the tremendous number of polling places which are scattered over the length",28,Commission

The Act provides that in an election for the House of Representatives at which there are not more than two candidates, /the voter's preference shall be deemed to be sufficiently indicated hy a mark showing his first preference, and that the placing of a cross in the square opposite the name of one candidate shall be deemed to in dicate that that candidate is the voter's first preference.

The effect of this option has been to make many votes informal, and thus ta deprive many voters of the franchise. the Electoral Act , and few of them know of the option. mentioned on the public platform , and I know that its existence leads to errors in voting. only two candidates, what happens if the voter marks a cross against the name of one, and does not place a mark against the name of the other? vote would be v a l i d; but it is proposed to take away the right to mark with a cross. sent method is that it allows two styles of marking ballot-papers-on e for the Senate, and the other for the House of Representatives. mistake to have two methods of marking. The present arrangement is intended merelv to cover a transitional period. Mr Justice Isaacs saidI am impelled by some of the ballot-papers I have seen to observe that it is possible that some of the voters have been misled as to the use of a cross. Wihen they have placed a 1 for one candidate, and a cross for the other, it might be conjectured that they thought that they were simply crossing out and voting against the other candidate. That being only conjecture, I am not entitled to act on it in deciding this case. But the possibility might be guarded against for the future. It is noticeable that, although section 133 provides for a cross in substitution of the figure 1 in the cases mentioned, there is no reference to that in the ballot-paper, FormF in the schedule.. Perhaps some means of informing electors of the law as to the use of a I would remind cross may be desirable. The amendment is recommended by the officers responsible for the working of the Electoral Act , who say that it is desirable that we should have only one method of marking ballot-papers. effect of the amendment would be to rob some voters of the franchise. A t the present time, when there are only two candidates standing, a cross placed in the square opposite the name of one of them makes a ballot-paper valid, but, under the law as it is proposed to amend it , such a ballot-paper would .be invalid. The Minister holds that confusion is caused by permitting two methods of marking ballot-papers, but I do not think that he is right, because the electors are not instructed that they may use either of two methods. The provision which it is proposed to amend is a provision governing only the counting of ballot papers. known. have made a close study of the Act . ' I cannot imagine that any one would direct electors to mark their ballot-papers w it h a cross. Eveni f the amendment werecarried, there would still remain an in consistency in the method of marking: ballot-papers, because where there are only two candidates the elector is allowed to indicate his preference by placing the numeral 1 opposite the name of the candidate for whom he wishes to vote, and leaving the other name unmarked; whereas, if there are three candidates, he must mark all three names in the order of his preference -1 , 2, and 3. This inconsistency has led some voters to think that it is sufficient, where there are three candidates, to set the figures 1 and 2 against their first and second choioe, leaving the t h i r d name unmarked. Such ballot-papers are informal, though they should, I think, be counted, because they clearly indicate the intention of the voter. Confusion also arises because where there are several candidates the elector is instructed to mark his first preference w it h the figure 1 and his following preferences w it h the figures 2, 3, 4,",32,Electoral Bill

If the law strictly provided that the marking of ballotpaperswith crosses would render those papers informal, more valid votes would probably be cast than if electors were still permitted to make a cross. I presume that where there are only two candidates for one seat, if the name of one is erased, and there is no other mark on the ballot paper, the vote w ill be regarded as valid. one name only, or puts a cross against one of the two names, his vote will not be valid, for the reason that his paper has not been marked in accordance with the directions of the Act. the interpretation. the High Court ruled, in the case arising out of the liast Ballarat election, that if there are only two candidates for one seat, and one name is struck out, and there is no other mark upon the ballot-paper, the vote should be accepted as valid for the reason that the ballot-paper clearly indicates that the elector intended to vote for the candidate whose name had not been struck out.

All parties will joi n in securing any proper means for the prevention of informal voting. bring about a system of voting which cannot possibly lead to confusion. this House are as much experienced in elections as are many Returning Officers. Probably their experience is as wide as is that of the officials who made the proposal now before the Committee. The bulk of the people are used to a certain method of voting. ""Very many electors are accustomed to mark their ballot-papers with a cross. The public generally do not attend political meetings; that applies particularly to country residents. Their habit is to mark their papers with a cross before the name of the candidate whom they favour. If that method of voting is done away with , informal votes will grow enormously in volume. Where the intention of a voter is clear his vote should be accepted as formal. places a nought before the name of a candidate ? I understand that formal. Electors have been trained to mark their papers with a cross. That is the principle in vogue in South Australia, and in many municipalities.

It is not right, nor in the interests of Australia, that the residents in the cities should have so much political power. But the only way in which we can equalize the political powers of city and country constituencies is to make the quota for country electorates 20 or 25 per cent, lower than that for city electorates.

It was only after 'honourable members in this House had expressed their views upon the Victorian distribution that the Commissioners' proposals were taken back and carried out on the lines suggested, which the Attorney-General now says are expressly provided for in this section of the Act. If the Minister can suggest anymeans by which the expressed intention of Parliament; can be carried 1 into' effect in every State in the case of a redistribution, the amendment could be withdrawn, but otherwise I think it should be carried to a vote, because the section -of' the Act does nof really carry the margin as far as it is possible to do according to the interpretation placed upon the provision by the New South Wales Distribution Commissioners. do not propose to support the amendmentI quite well remember the discussion that was nothing took place upon the inequalities of the Victorian _ distributions. It was pointed out as being rather curious and open to criticism that the electorate which geographically was the largest in Victoria should also have the largest quota of electors.

They are not entitled, however, to accept the principle' t h a t we are decentralizing agents,. and entitled to say that, because a district is. a country district', it is, therefore, entitled to more representation in Parliament, than is a metropolitan district. I was one who held that there was a curious-anomaly, m that the Commissioners had used their discretion in a way which resulted in a large tract of country having.a very large number of electorsr by comparison w it h others. It was the view of some of us that the flexible provisions' of the Act might well have been employed to make the position otherwise. But the point that the honourable member now wishes to make is something quite different, and is objectionable from our point of view. believe in the principle of one-vote-onevalue. Residents in the city have their advantages and their disadvantages. do not accept the view that the people of the country cannot record their votes. They have the advantages of country life, which they go to the country toenjoy, and. they have their facilities of communication. to town they are only too glad to get back again! not labour the matter further than to say that to interpret the existing, provisions asfavorably as possible to country in terests is quite different from establishing the principle, as a fixed injunction on the Commissioners, that they are to say that country districts must have more representation than city districts. That principle I cannot agree to. The honourable member for Batman( Mr : Brennan) has mademuch of the principle of one-vote-one-yalue; bub really what is at the bottom of the idea is to furnish an equal value of the franchise to each individual. No' one can reasonably claim that at present the person living in a distant country electorate has the same That facilities for recording hisvote as has; a person in town. The aim is, as faras possible, to get an equality of value in the franchise. The proposal this afternoon is not a danger from that: point of But there is a give view, for it. goes no further than does the present Act . Dr.. EARLE PAGE It does not go so far. far;, but it does lay down definitely what is not, perhaps, correct in theory, according to the honourable member for Batman, but is certainly found correct in practice. An y one who has lived, in the country and in. the citv knows, whether headmits it or. not, that the man in the country, or the woman, particularly, has not. anything like the same opportunities for recording the vote as has the man or woman in town. All that we are asking is that the value of the franchise in each case shall be made as nearly equal as possible. If a man is given a -thing he cannot use it is of littl e value, and we wish to make the franchise of equal value to every individual. The votes will still remain at equal value-w e do not propose to interfere in any way with the valueof We the vote, for that is a question which is settled for good and all. We have-agreed that one-vote-one-value is the correct I idea, and in common honesty we wish to make the franchise of equal value to every man and woman in Australia. That is ali the amendment proposes. If honourable members will look at the amendment from a practical, stand-point, instead of harping on thetheoretical side, they will And when they come see that, the proposal is abundantly justified.

But if f he matter of difficulty in getting to the poll is to be taken into consideration, it would be logically necessary to instruct the Commissioners, further, to provide a smaller number of electors in Gippsland, for example, than in Corio; for the latter division has f a r greater facilities for travel. If areas are to be consulted it would be necessary to give to divisions in Queensland and Western Australia ten times fewer electors than to those in Victoria. The honourable member for Robertson said that, under existing facilities for voting, electors in some parts of the country are actually unable to attend a polling booth in order to record their votes. If the proposal under review is embraced in the Act the votes of those people will be given no greater value than they possess to-day. That is to say, they are of no value whatever, since they are not recorded. is misquoting me. ber said that there were many people who were unable on polling day to record their votes. How can their case be met by instructing the Commissioners to decrease the numbers of electors in country divisions? And in what manner should the Commissioners be instructed in respect of such electorates as Corio, Ballarat, and Bendigo? Are they to be regarded as country, or as city electorates? are some country divisions in which the facilities for votine, over the greater part of their area, at any rate, are similar to those provided in metropolitan divisions.

265,. Motion (By Mr Groom) Proposed,"Tammany's pollution of representative government. The influx of new Labour (members is controlled in New South Wales by the junta at Macdonell House. Sitting members live in perpetual terror of the tyranny of this Tammany junta. -The procedure is that nominations are invited, and they are subject to endorsement by the Tammany junta at its unfettered discretion. Then comes the party selection. The whole machinery for the selection of these candidates in New South Wales is also at the unfettered discretion of this corrupt junta at Macdonell House. The powerful machmery of the .Australian Workers Union Central Branch, its funds, and its organizers are utilized, together with the corrupt practices of hired mercenaries, hangers-on, and professional personators. The whole of this machinery is operated for the purpose of continuously intimidating the public men of the Labour movement. It is almost an impossibility for any Labour member in. New South Wales to obtain a selection in defiance of the corrupt crowd in control at Macdonell House. The enforced silence of Labour's public men in New South Wales in the presence of extensive and thinly veiled criminality is their unspoken acknowledgment of their fear of the power of this junta. The Industrial Section. first acts of the Bailey-Lambert coterie, which controls the central of the Australian Workers Union, was to organize a star chamber in Sydney, misnamed the industrial section, an unconstitutional body, which had no standing or authority under the constitution: and rules of the Australian Labour party, and which held the undated resignations of the members of the Central Executive. Before it the Central Executive was carpeted weekly, and had to present their reports and take their instructions. This corrupt assembly set about undermining sitting Labour members of Parliament, and engineering its own members into their places. In 1917 the President of this so-called industrial section was a man named Samuel Rosa, and the secretary, John Mauritius Power, now a member of the Legislative Council, and president of the Macdonell House Labour party in New South Wales. the honourable member's remarks on the Those two men endeavoured to capBill? Mr J. H. Catts. ture the Eederal seats of East Sydney and West Sydney in circumstances of unparalleled corruption and rottenness, at that time unprecedented in the Labour movement of New South Wales. The Labour movement had not then become accustomed to these corrupt practices. The selection of Rosa was upset, and Con Wallace, whose name was third on the ballot, was given the selection for West Sydney. East Sydney, 1917. Power was the man who defeated John West, the sitting member for East'Sydney, for the selection by the corrupt use of the Australian Workers Union votes in the control of Maltese, who were unable to speak English, and were living in boarding-houses in East Sydney. As I pointed out on a previous occasion in this House, in answer to an interjection by the honourable member, I was instrumental in having this East Sydney selection upset, and saving John West's political life. We brought the Maltese priest to the Australian Labour party executive. He acted as interpreter for the other Maltese, who could not speak English, and it was found that one of Power's agents, the present presiding genius of this Tammany junta, a Mrs. Andrews, had gone to Hie Worker office and bought a number of copies of The Worker, One of the in which the official ballot-paper was printed. She had cut out these branch ballot-papers, and by some means had induced the Maltese, who had Australian Workers Union tickets, to detach the voting slips. She also got them to sign their names on the flaps of envelopes, and marking the ballot-papers herself in favour of Power, they were sent in and counted as postal votes. In that way John Power defeated John West at the Labour selection for East Sydney in 1917. It is fitting that this gentleman, who started his career officially in the Labour movement with a corrupt selection ballot, should be, at this time, when Tammany is at its height, and when no effort is being made to cloak -the corruption which stalks abroad unashamed, the chairman and presiding genius of this rotten corporation.",47,Pairs

OATTS I am moving that the third reading of the B ill be postponed so that the Government may have an opportunity to institute a public in quiry and to frame a new B ill providing for Government control of the selection ballots for the nomination of candidates for seats in Parliament. The 1919 JSTarnoi Selection. In this case the selection was a fraud. It was proved at the 1920 Australian Workers Union Convention that 250 faked Australian Workers Union voting slips were used. A number of these were locked away in the head-office safe of the Australian Workers Union. ordered a criminal investigation/ A l though this matter was dealt with in open conference, The Worker newspaper and the official report of the Australian Workers Union were censored so that the rank and file of the movement throughout Australia should not know the rottenness that was going on per medium of the machinery of their organization. The forged slips disappeared from the safe of the head office of the Australian Workers Union. These facts prove the complicity of high officials in the Australian Workers Union, as well as editor Boote, with corruption in the selection ballots. The 1919 Oxley Selection. In this case the local branches selected a young schoolgerald, now member of the Legislative Assembly, who was then secretary of the Timber Workers Unioni n Sydney, by a manipulation of faked union yotes, overrode the selection of the genuine Australian Labour party branches throughout the electorate. The Oxley electorate covers 14,000 square miles of territory, and it was alleged that 750 members of the Timber Workers Union were scattered over that huge area, yet no fewer than 743 votes were recorded in favour of Fitzgerald, and the young schoolmaster, who had spent years in organizing the Labour movement in the electorate, was turned down. Fitzgerald was returned to Parliament; but it transspired afterwards that there were only 150 members of the Timber Workers Unioni n the electorate. The 1919 Goulburn Selection. Labour selection by the branches in the Bailey's head should Baileyt r y to put country selection was manipulated to pro"" the boot in "" at any time. vide a seat in Parliament for Tarn-, many boss Bailey. . A t the time. I Selection. was not acquainted with Bailey and his methods, having only recently met him. TomA r t h u r , one of Bailey's henchmen, who was in Bailey's office, was appointed returning-officer in Sydney to control the selection for this country seat. He used Bailey's office for the purpose. P. C. Evans, then general secretary of the movement, won the selection; but sufficient corrupt Australian Workers Union votes were used after the returns were in to give the selection to Bailey. In this case I have a signed statement from Dick McDonald, an old Australian Workers Union organizer, to the effect that Bailey put in 300 crook votes. An Convention other statement from W . Minter, a prominent member of the Clerks Union, is as follows: . Mr Buckland, an officer of the Central Branch, Australian Workers Union, bad been in the Goulburn electorate during the progress of this selection ballot, and had just returned to the Australian Workers Union office. In the presence of myself iand a number of other persons, Mr Buckland pointed to packages of Australian Workers Union postal votes which had been got ready to be admitted to the .ballot, but which had not been required, and had not been used. He said, ""We have been challenged witih the admission of crook Australian Workers Union votes. As others did that kind of thing, why should we not do the same?"" Mr Bailey, who was present, said to Buckland, ""You are a damn fool. You are practically telling these men that .we did it."" Buckland said, "" You know we did. You know perfectly well. Look at all these voting papers left over that we had no occasion to use."" Bailey swore at Buckland, and wheeled on his heel and walked out of the office. By the way, Buckland is now seeking selection against the sitting member, H . P. Lazzarini, in the same district. This matter came before the Australian. Workers Union convention in 1920. A committee was appointed, and went to the Australian Labour party's office to obtain these ballot-papers-so that the Australian Workers Union convention might make a scrutiny. The selection ballot had only iust been taken, but it was found that the ballot-papers had again disappeared. The general secretary, Mr Carey, professed surprise, but admitted to several persons, myself included, that he had spirited the ballot-papers away, and in This tended to hold them as a weapen over The 1919.

Mr Bains, organizer for the Liquor Trades Union, signed a l l the Liquor Trade faked union tickets himself, signing them C. Bains. Mooney, managing director, Catholic Insurance Company, signed some of the faked tickets, and other signatures were made by other persons promiscuously in tbe committee rooms. the cases of these forgeries there were originals of the various signatures and other particulars that were copied. The clerks in the committee rooms supplied each member of the impersonating gang with the name and address of some person from the electoral roll in the district on a slip of paper, and the union ticket or pence-card was made out in the name of the voter to be impersonated. The gangs were sent to operate first on one polling booth, then return to the committee rooms for fresh supplies of tickets and instructions, and then operated on another polling booth, and having gone round the whole of the booths they came back to the committee rooms and commenced the same procedure again. Scouts were sent out from the committee rooms to bring back reports as to the best booths for the operations of duplication and personation. These scouts reported that at the Pyrmont booth :it was an open go, that an unlimited number of votes could be polled there provided a union ticket of any sort could be produced. A t the Belmore booth, where Mr Magrath, the secretary, Printing Employees Union, was deputy returning officer in charge, more than 2fi per cent, of the votes were challenged by the scrutineers, and these votes were placed in separate envelopes for investigation after the close of tbe booth. A t the count Mr Magrath said he proposed to treat them all as valid votes, and asked had anybody an}' objection? Nobody objected, with the exception of myself, and I urged that the unchallenged votes be first counted and the challenged votes forwarded to the returning officer, Mr Bates, for his investigation and decision. This demand was disregarded, and the whole, of these votes were admitted without scrutiny. challenged votes been investigated, there is no doubt the fraud would have been exposed. In the ordinary course of events rule 6 voters (the union voters) should have signed their name and address in a book for that purpose when they produced their union ticket to vote. But this procedure was not followed at a l l in the Belmore booth, so' that once a voter left the polling booth there, waa no record of who he was supposed to be. In the case of the challenges, tbe name and address of the person supposed to be voting was written, down by the deputy returning officer, Mr Magrath, on the envelope. There were eight dozen dead marines (empty beer bottles) in an adjoining room. The place was clearly a beer saloon all day. The booth They were obviously forwas f u l l of drunks at the close of the polling. In the It took over half-an-hour to get them out of the polling-ibooth.

In some cases Ted. A t the Belmore booth I ascertained that for every league member who voted there were twenty rule 6 votes. In This evidence of criminality, graft, and corruption is capable of almost indefinite expansion. The Political Labour movement in New South Wales has gone, and its place has been usurped by an unscrupulous Tammany gang ready to sell the interests of the workers aud the community generally to the highest bidder, ancl which seeks to obtain control of Parliaments only that it may extend its bribery and corruption to the Departments of State, including the administration of the Police and Judicial Departments. Boss Bailey actually tried to organize a number of Sydney police into his central branch, Australian Workers Union, but ithe Inspector-General of Police and Mr Dooley, then Chief Secretary, frustrated this bold enterprise of Tammany. It is the duty of the Government to searchingly inquire into all the matters set forth and facts and allegations relevant thereto, in order that our Parliaments and public administrations may not be manipulated by and for a corrupt Tammany organization that would soon reduce our public affairs to the level of the worse days and phases of its notorious prototype in New York.

Counsel then instructed the accused to withdraw his plea of notguilty and to plead guilty. Hisi Honour: What!

Mr C. C. Lazzarini, M . L . A . , then gave notice in the New South Wales Labour Caucus of a motion for a public inquiry into the charges of corruption. 7th August the Macdonell Housej u n t a threatened the expulsion of members who demanded a public inquiry into Labour corruption. That is borne out by the Evening News report. The Australian Workers Union organ, The Worker, also made a brutal attack on these men -16.8.22 . 9th August the New South Wales Labour Caucus, by twenty votes to five, demanded a searching public inquiry into the corruption charges contained in my speech.

I take that matter from, a report of the Sydney Daily 12th August the Macdonell House junta refused the State Caucus demand for a public inquiry into the corruption charges which I had levelled. upon a report of the Sydney Herald. 15th August there was a further counter-charge by the Macdonell House junta that Mr Dooley, the New South Wales Labour leader, had the Australian Labour party's books faked to provide branch membership qualification for MrJ .

(Vide Daily Telegraph report.) 17th August the Federal Labour Caucus received a latter from the Parramatta State Labour Council demanding action for a public inquiry into corrupt practices. Messrs. Lavelle and Nicholls, M . ' s H . R . , moved that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) should ask for a Royal Commission of In quiry. They were ruled out of order by Mr Charlton, however, on the ground that the matter was one for the Macdonell House executive. 2nd September a conference between the Macdonell House junta and the State Caucus was held. Mr Lambert accused Messrs. Lazzarini, Mutch, and Loughlin of sowing seeds of discord The minority were Messrs. in branch leagues, and demanded their expulsion. Mr Charlton, who was present, opposed a public inquiry, although the northern miners demanded it. A resultless meeting adjourned was for a week. This is from a report in the DailyM a i l , Paddy Minahan's paper. 9th September a second conference of the Macdonell House junta and State Caucus was held regarding a public inquiry. It was adjourned at 11 p.m. for another week. It proved resultless. 16th September the conference of Macdonell House and the State Caucus was resumed, and Messrs. Dooley and Dunn, with two members of the Macdonell House Tammany, were appointed to issue Telegraph. a statement to the leagues and unions of New South Wales explaining the position -Sydney Morning Herald report. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. That fact is based Charlton), from his place in this House, Morning read an affidavit. The gentlemen concerned want to say that the whole of my charges have been replied to. That affidavit is a perfectly harmless document. If every word of it were an abominable falsehood no action could be taken against the person making it . It has not been lodged in a court of law. It is not in the hands of anybody who could take action. Some of it s points side-step the August the State Labour charges made .agaj/nst the person concerned. A t any rate, this charge was based ou the signed statement of a Bed Cross matron; the charge was not mine. In other instances, the charges were obviously so true that the Australian Labour party and Macdonell House got into a f u r y of impatience to fill up some of the gaps which had been exposed by tlie statements given to the public. Mr Bailey, M . L . A . , and Alderman Lambert issued denials. What else could they do? But a carefully prepared affidavit, read in Parliament, is a totally different proposrijbion from putting the Gibbsi n the witness-box, from which he could be sent to gaol if deemed' guilty of perjury, and in which he could be cross-examined upon his statements. These vague denials of Messrs. Bailey and Lambert, and other men involved, go no further than would the denials of any other class of law breakers charged with any other type of offence. That is to say, they would be expected to plead not guilty to the accusations levelled against them.. This fact remains: I am the only public Labour man who is asking for a public inquiry. Brookfield asked for it? Mr J. H . CATTS -He did not ask for it . that he did. Mr J. H . CATTS -On 6th July, job. I quoted some of Brookfield's statements, to the effect that he intended to ference to put up a fight there. was there and then that I put up a fight. I am sorry, indeed, that the f a t a l acciin, in order to find out the source dent occurred to Brookfield on his way to that conference. A t any rate, the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) is now pleading in effect that these charges of mine are true. self when I care to take the opportunity to do so. But I repeat, that when Brookfield was making charges similar to those which you have since made, you gave h i m no assistance. You tried to hound him out of the Labour movement. Mr J. H .

It is a fact that some forged voting slips were found to be attached to some of the ballots; but the Returning Officer, who was the agent for the Australian Workers Union at Wee Waa, detected thoseslipSj and brought them under the notice of the union, which impounded them with the intention of having them inspected. I have been told that the honourable member for Cook at one time knew a great deal about locks, and was very efficient in ferreting out things. However, that is no businessof mine. The ballot in question could not be described as corrupt, because the agent of the Australian Workers Union, who was Returning Officer, promptly brought the forged papers under the notice of the union, which took action in regard to them. I have a good idea as to who it was who forged those slips, which could be detected at a glance as forgeries. They were certainly never received as good votes nor counted. The honourable member made many references to MT.. John Bailey, member of the Legislative Assembly, and used words regarding him that,.to my mind, had no application. He spoke of a "" Tammany gang"" and of "" this corrupt gang of burglars.""

That, being so* it is a strange thing that the honourable member himself should have travelled all over the Goulburn electorate electioneering for Mr John Bailey, and that he should have written him a congratulatory letter on his election. The honourable member spoke of the corruptness of the Australian Workers Union machinery.. That machinery is not under my control.. It was under my control some time back; but I voluntarily handed over the position that I held in it . He said, too, that the Australian Labour party is controlled by the corrupt machinery of the Australian Workers Union.. He spoke of the tentacles of the Australian Workers Union enfolding it, or something to that effect, and said that it intimidated Labour members, and tried seats.

There is absolute disproof of the honourable member's statement that the Australian Workers Union machinery was operating through the Australian Labour party to engineer sitting men out of their seats, so that they might be occupied by meu controlling the Australian Workers Union.

Indeed, the honourable member was so ruffled that the venom almost oozed out of his mouth when he was uttering his vindictive words. said that, when Mayor of Sydney, I had promised a certain person a good job, or something like that, if he would personate voters for me at the Sydney municipal election.

I regret that there were certain cases of impersonation in the Sydney municipal elections just as there are cases of impersonation in all parliamentary elections, and yet, because one young fellow was proved guilty of impersonating and was unfortunate enough to receive three months' imprisonment, the honourable member has the audacity to come to this House and make the unscrupulously mendacious statement that I actually arranged with men to personate voters for me. MrJ . H . CATTS I did not say that. ber went very close to saying it . If he did not say it straight out, he inferred it . Although the young fellow in question was an employee of the Sydney City CouncilI did not know him. think I would remember him to-day, although I did see him a little time after he was arrested for the alleged offence. had supported the young man's family during his imprisonment it would be an admission of guilt. family were in a position to support themselves. The honourable member would have it that this young man asked me to to p u t hi m back in his job. It was not a, very good job. It was navvy ing or similar work on the roads of Sydney. In any case, how can the honourable meml>er prove his statement that this man voted for me? Once a ballot-paper goes into the ballot-box I am not likely to know the name of the person for whom the vote has been given. He may, or may not, have voted for me. I shall not mention his name, but from information received, I have been led to believe that his family have never been supporters of the Labour party. In all probability therefore, he did not vote for me or for auy Labour candidate. I am sorry to have to mention these matters. It is getting right down into the gutter. I have never listened to more miserable, contemptible, He and dirty arguments than I have heard to-night from the honourable member. The honourable member has said that the recent Cook ballot was corrupt, but I know nothing about it . I had no more to do with it than the honourable member had"". Mr J. H. CATTS I did not charge you w i th that. my organization, which has been slandered by the honourable member. There may have been a certain amount of irregularity in the ballot in question, but the fact that the organization, after investigating the matter, ordered a new ballot does not make the organization itself corrupt. The honourable member says that Mr TomA r t h u r, whom he describes as being a disciple of Mr Bailey, was to be engineered into the Cook seat, and that the corrupt Australian Workers Union and Australian Labour, party machinery was to be employed for the purpose. As a matter of fact, neither the Australian Workers Union nor the Australian Labour party took any part in the Cook selection, and the man who obtained selection at the first ballot also obtained I do not selection at the second ballot, and the Mr. A r t h u r referred to was defeated. I am not prepared to say that the honI f the honourable member orable member for Cook( Mr J. H . Catts) printed the forged tickets he has in his possession.

I am not an expert, and cannot say whether the tickets in question were printed on certain machines or uot, but I know that there are some machines in Sydney, although I have not patronized them, on which crooked work can be done. I do not say that the honourable member is a partner in the running of those machines, but I know that he is interested in certain printing works in Sydney, The honourable member criticised Mr Fitzgerald, M . L . A . , and said that that gentleman got his first selection corruptly. He said that there were 700 timber workers spread over 14,000 miles of country on the north coast. I am a bushman of many year's training, and I have travelled a great deal in Australian States. Therefore, I am aware that there are more than 700 timber workers in the timber belt in the north of New South VVales, and if they voted for their secretary in the selection ballot that is all I know about the matter. However, it is absurd for the honourable member for Cook to come into this House and endeavour to attack the character of a member of the State House who compares much more than favourably w it h himself. The honourable member also referred to a Mr Dick MacDonald, who is, according to his own statement, a self-confessed criminal and forger. How can the House place any reliance on a statement made by a man of that calibre? I know him, but w ill say nothing in detriment of his character. I am not dirty enough to come into this House and, under the cloak of privilege, use the slanderous words which the honourable member has chosen to apply to men outside, calculating to do them in j u r y and prevent some of them from earning a living. Mr Dick MacDonald was not an old organizer of the Australian Workers Union in. that sense of the word, but he was in a very bad way in Sydneyi n 1918, and as he was an acquaintance of mine I used the power that I possessed under the rules of my union to appoint an organizer for a month or two. Mr J. H . CATTS He was appointed to organize the police of Sydney. have been a bad undertaking if the honourable member's statement were correct, which it is not. It is absolutely incorrect.

CATTS I can prove it . ber says now that I , along w it h other gentlemen in Sydney, were going to corrupt the police force in Sydney. MrJ . H . CATTS -You were going to attempt to do so. ber has also made a very serious statement about Mr Carey, the general secretary of the Australian Labour party m New South Wales. He has said, in effect, that Mr Carey informed him that he stole the ballot-papers in the Goulburn selection ballot, where Mr Jack Bailey was selected and proposed to. hold them over Mr Bailey's head as a weapon if ever that gentleman endeavoured to put the boot into him,. That is also an absolutely incorrect statement, and a cowardly fabrication aimed at the character of a man whom I thoroughly believe to be an honest and decent citizen. The honourable member has made the further statement that Mr Bailey manipulated the Australian Workers' Union ballot in order to get Mr Brown, a Sydney solicitor, selected for the Eden Monaro seat in the Federal Parliament. That also is a statement that is absolutely incorrect and cannot be borne out by facts. MrJ . H .

The purpose of the measure is to give effect to the proposal indicated in the Budget statement for the removal of the war surcharge upon the land tax. The circumstances in regard to land taxation in Australia in general, and in the Commonwealth in particular, are well known to honourable members. The Commonwealth land tax was first introduced in 1910 for a definite purpose and as a definite act of policy. It was designed to endeavour to break up large estates, and 30 it was not at any time regarded as a 10 revenue measure. stated, and was clearly expressed by the party to which the honourable member bec Lamond, Hector longs.

357,20 Mr Bruce,"That has been oftenestates, and the promotion of closer settlement, but was intended purely and simply to raise revenue for warpurposes. This charge was placed upon land because it was one of the easiest sources from which revenue could be obtained . of sympathy with the honourable member. Land is an object that cannot be removed, and is certainly an easy victim of taxation. Whilst the circumstances of the moment demanded that a revenue tax should be placed upon land, it is clear, and I think that every party in the House w ill agree, that it should be removed at the earliest moment. There might, at first sight, be some suggestion of opposition from honourable members of the Labour party, but I have sufficient confidence in their sense of justice to> believe that they do not wish the continuation of a special tax on one class of the community. The surcharge of landtax is an additional income tax, or a capital tax, levied on a particular class of property,, and it is neither just nor proper to impose taxation in this way. Those who say thatproperty should be taxed to a .greater extent than it is are on sound and logical ground if they move for the increasing of taxation on all classes of property; but they are on unsound ground when they say that one particular class of property should bear a burden not imposed on other classes of property. It was stated in the Budget that the repeal of the surcharge would be proposed. Our financial circumstances are not all that we would wish, but they have improved sufficiently to allow us to carry out this promise. We are^doing nothing at this stage to interfere with the land tax,, which-, has been in operation in the Commonwealth for many years as part of a policy designed to achieve a certain result; all we are proposing is the removal of ai surcharge i m posed in pursuance of noother policy than the raising, of additional revenue.. It has been, suggested that this isanother sop to a particular class,, b u t that is not so.. The proposal, is. based, on. definite principles o£ equity,, and it. is> a measure of relief that is rightly introduced as soon, as our financial circumstances permit of it being put intoeffect.

Charlton) is not present, and as fie: would like to say"" something on the B ill I ask for an adjournment of the debate:. 1 the Opposition is sick, journment was only a f ormaL one,, because I was confident that it would be refused. Do the Government propose to apply the "" gag "" to thediscussion of this measure?. The super tax which it is proposed, to repeal was not imposed by the party with, which I am. connected, but was brought forward by the present Government in 1918. We are-, now asked to discuss a; B ill to amend the Land Tax Act 1910-1918-, and to> repealthe. Land Tax Acts of 1918-1919. and 1920.. Thiswi l l bring the law back to where it stood when the Act of 1'910> became law: That Act was a Labour measure,, designed to bring the lands of the country into fuller use by taking them out of the hands of the few, and putting them into those of the many. It was a wise and beneficial measure, and has brought about great indust r i a l changes. Millions of acres which were in pastoral occupation have since been tilled, and the immense production of wheat, oats and barley that has resulted has increased the revenue obtained by the various Australian Governments through income taxation,, has increased our exp o r t a t i o n, thus enabling the State Governments to meet t h e i r obligations in foreign markets,, and this has in turn increased our importations, and swelled our Customs: revenue-. Since the present Government have been in office there has been a falling off in agricultural production in this country. The present Government in 1918, for reasons which they considered to be just, imposed a super tax.. The Treasurer is now trying, to repeal that measure,, and would give the impression that the super tax. was imposed by a Labour Government.. As a matter of fact: there, was not a Labour Government in poweri n 1918. and the super tax wasreally imposed by the present Government. There are still a number of large estates, which have been untouched by theoperationof the Federal land tax.
