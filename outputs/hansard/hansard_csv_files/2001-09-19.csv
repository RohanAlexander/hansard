The second point is that it excision from the migration zone of certain clearly will not apply to Australian citizens, islands and territories of Australia. as the earlier bill did. Importantly, as I read The reason we can accept the amendout before, the earlier bill attempted to comments, particularly those contained in the pletely override the rule of law in Australia; new border protection bill, is that it is an enit would have applied notwithstanding any tirely different piece of legislation.

The third reason we can support the bill is This is not simply a power for the sake of that the government has taken on board our concerns regarding the exercise of force. We must recognise that when parliament authorwas to remove persons from the Tampa and ises the use of coercive force it must do so in put them on the Australian naval vessel the a responsible and prescribed way, not at Manoora before transporting them to Nauru. large, not with absolute discretion.

It provided for the removal of a vessel, tion where the use of force is authorised namely the Tampa-not the people off the subject to the requirements that trained offivessel onto another vessel.

It will have major long-term implications for the nation’s economy and international reputation. Ansett has played a major role in the nation’s infrastructure, providing services which are essential for the ongoing functioning of the economy. Along with Ansett employees, many businesses in my electorate of Swan which provide a range of goods and services to Ansett face an uncertain future. Gate Gourmet, which provided in-flight catering, is one example. The state’s resources sector also relies on air services to many distant locations without which the work force and essential supplies cannot be moved. The ripples from the collapse of Ansett will continue to spread out across the whole community. This is a collapse that did not just happen. It was allowed to happen by the failure of the Howard-Anderson government to adequately fulfil its responsibilities. It was allowed to happen by an irresponsible government. A responsible government would have recognised the magnitude of this collapse and acted swiftly and effectively. The employees of Ansett, their families, the workers in associated companies who face an uncertain future, regional communities now largely cut off from metropolitan Australia, tourists, sporting groups and business people all deserve an explanation from the Howard government. They deserve an explanation as to just how it was that a national government sat back and did nothing to prevent this collapse, and then after Ansett had collapsed, why the government continued with its inaction. This government saw no necessity to effectively monitor Ansett. In fact, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services should resign. If he did not know what was happening with Ansett, he is incompetent. If he knew what was happening and did nothing, then he is derelict in his duty. Now that Ansett has collapsed, this government has no policy for ensuring that all affected workers receive their full entitlements. Why has the government not sat down with its New Zealand counterparts, Ansett’s administrators, unions and other airlines, to try and resolve this situation? If Ansett is beyond rescue, where is the government’s mechanism to ensure that all workers, both those employed by Ansett and other associated companies, receive 100 per cent of their entitlements? If only the Prime Minister could act with the same speed with which he acted when his brother’s company went to the wall. The Prime Minister has proposed a bandaid solution that attempts to protect workers’ entitlements, but it will not protect 100 per cent of these entitlements. Only Labor has a national scheme under which all employees are covered for their unpaid wages, accrued annual leave, long service leave, termination and redundancy arrangements and superannuation payments. Labor’s plan is based on a small contribution of 0.1 per cent of payroll to fund the scheme. The Howard government seems to have forgotten about Ansett workers and all those affected by this collapse. Those affected will not forget at the ballot box later this year. Once again, the government is asleep in the cockpit, the plane is on autopilot and it is desperately low on fuel.",123,Naccho From 1991 Until His Untimely Broome Regional Aboriginal Medical Serv

242,Mr Wilkie (Swan) (9.52 A.m.),"The collapse of Ansett Airlines is an event which hasWednesday, 19 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31053 United States of America: Terrorist Attacks Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (9.55 a.m.)-I wish to support the motion of condolence moved in the House on Monday, 17 September. On Tuesday, 11 September 2001-at a time chosen to ensure that the maximum number of civilians would be at work in the targeted buildings and with the planes loaded with fuel to ensure the largest possible impact-unknown terrorists succeeded in killing thousands of ordinary men and women going about their lawful, peaceful occupations. The attack took place on American soil but Australians also felt the blow-at first reeling in horror and outrage and now united in sorrow. We join with the United States, having invoked the ANZUS treaty, in trying to ensure that this abhorrent action is an aberration, not a precursor to a new world order where ordinary men and women live in fear and nowhere is safe. Over 5,000 civilians are still missing, presumed crushed in the rubble. Over 50 Australians are amongst those missing, along with victims from more than 20 nations. On behalf of the people of Murray in northern Victoria, I want to offer my most profound sympathy for all the victims and their loved ones. In the strongest possible terms, we condemn this calculated act of hate. The people of Murray have never hesitated in answering a call to help defend our nation or the freedom of others threatened by tyranny or oppression. Many individuals have sacrificed their lives or personal liberties for our greater security or that of other nations. Like other Australians, we know that justice and freedom come at a price. We acknowledge our need to stand by allies at this time, with carefully targeted action aimed precisely at those responsible. I want to quote what John Grey Gorton said on his return from the Second World War. He spoke on behalf of the 17 returned servicemen from Mystic Park, Shire of Kerang. He said: We cannot expect to make a new and better world by the exercise of brute military force. We can only expect to achieve the kind of world we want by the use of our brains and effort during peace. We fought only to preserve, for our children, and ourselves that conception of political freedom and justice, which was being attacked by a tyrannous power. These words are not about vengeance, although John Gorton suffered more than many; they are about the restoration and preservation of freedom and justice. It was not only office workers who lost their lives in the immediate attack. Civilian firemen and police also died in their efforts to fight the fires and usher the survivors to safety. No doubt their courage and the calming reassurance of their professional and humane response helped ensure panic did not lead to an even greater loss of life in the smoke-filled stairwells. On behalf of the people of Murray, I want to praise the work of these people: the firemen, police and rescue workers. They remind us of what it is we need to aspire to and protect: the performance of selfless service for others, especially in adversity, and love, not hate, for fellow man. Finally, I want to add my voice to the motion in encouraging all Australians in the wake of these appalling events to display those very qualities of tolerance and inclusion which the terrorists so assaulted. The Australian nation, and Murray in particular, is a multicultural, multiracial society. We aim to see all treated with respect and dignity. May this be a time of recommitment to the values that make us a civil society. Ansett Australia Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (9.58 a.m.)-I rise to speak about the collapse of Ansett and, subsequently, Kendell Airlines. This collapse has and will continue to heavily impact upon the Tasmanian economy. Nearly 500 local people within Launceston were, until Friday, employed with either Ansett or Kendell. The bulk of these jobs were in the Launceston call centre. The collapse has impacted on our tourism industry, as one in nine people in Tasmania are employed in this industry. Tasmanian exporters are facing an uncertain future. 31054 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 September 2001 The impacts upon Tasmania following the crash demand attention from the federal government-attention that we are not seeing. Ansett has been in difficulty for some time. The industry knew it; the general public knew it, but apparently the minister for transport did not know it. The minister has claimed that he was unaware of the level of difficulty faced by Ansett until the weekend before last. That proposition is laughable-laughable if the consequences of the minister’s obvious incompetence were not so severe. The facts are very simple. The Australian government was aware of the difficulties faced by Ansett. The chairman wrote to the minister in June, and the CEO wrote to him in April. Only weeks ago, staff begged him for help. There is no escaping the fact that the collapse of Ansett is, in some part, due to the policy and administrative failure of the minister for transport. The government’s job is to risk-manage our economy. I call upon the House to take actions to ensure that northern Tasmania does not need to suffer any longer than is absolutely necessary. The government must at first take every action to get Ansett flying. If they fail to do that, there are other tasks that they must undertake. They must safeguard the entitlements of former staff, ensure the adequate provision of air services, passenger and freight, to Tasmania, and provide a structural adjustment package to ensure that there are employment opportunities in Launceston in the future. The community of Launceston has been hurt: from the bloke who owns the freight company and used to employ 10 people to the kiosk at the airport that is only operating until it runs out of stock. There is 23-year-old Matthew, who has a seven-month old baby and has just purchased a new home. Karen, who was due to settle on a new house last Thursday, will lose her deposit. The child-care centre had a lot of clients from the call centre. I think what the child-care centre is doing embodies the local spirit. This centre is waiving fees for Ansett parents. I call on other organisations to have the same kind of spirit. for members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading That the bill be now read a second time. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (10.00 a.m.)-The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 is one that Labor will be supporting. It contains three related sets of amendments to streamline the current administrative arrangements concerning the way in which Medicare and nursing home benefits are reclaimed where a person has suffered a compensable injury, either through WorkCover, transport accident insurance or some other form of legal recovery of medical expenses. Specifically, the bill intends to streamline the administration of the compensation recovery program, managed by the Health Insurance Commission. It intends to make consequential changes to the act governing charges under the program and make consequential amendments related to the change from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to the Administrative Review Tribunal. The bill will reduce the requirements in cases which involve settlements of less than $5,000, reduce the notification requirements, simplify the method of calculating debt, and allow the minister to vary the percentage amount for advance payments. The explanatory memorandum states that these measures are estimated to save the Commonwealth $24 million over four years and will reduce the administrative costs both for insurers and legal firms.

244,"Debate Resumed From 30 August, On Motion By Mr Mcgauran:","Wednesday, 19 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31055 Commission will report on the impact of this legislation and the realisation of savings in its future annual reports. This is a useful piece of legislation and, as I said at the start, the opposition will be supporting the bill. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (10.02 a.m.)-The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 was an amendment to the acts which have the objective of preventing double dipping. Double dipping is where claimants receiving Medicare or nursing home benefit with respect to their compensable injuries later receive compensation for medical costs as the successful conclusion to a judgment or settlement of a claim. Double dipping is where they do not repay these benefits to the Commonwealth. The acts are designed to allow the Commonwealth to recover these benefits. It is not uncommon for local MPs to see problems relating to this act. Sometimes we see people who have received payments and then find that the Health Insurance Commission is claiming it back. A 2001 review of the act by Mr George Pooley found that the legislation was complex and labour-intensive in its requirements. The review opted for a streamlining option which delivers some savings and has unanimous support amongst stakeholders. They looked at three options: retaining the status quo, a streamlining option or applying a levy. This streamlining option, which is the one that they have recommended, has savings of over $25 million over the next four years. What this bill specifically does is, firstly, allow for removal of the notice of claim prior to judgment or settlement. The reason for this is that many claims never get that far. Secondly, it allows the use of statutory declarations to extend the time frames if no further services were provided. Thirdly, it sets a proposed threshold of $5,000 as opposed to $166.60, and amounts below that threshold will be defined as ‘small amounts’. This reduces the number of settlements and judgments that the Health Insurance Commission will be interested in. The reason for this is the cost of recovering these small amounts outweighs the revenue that they receive from getting them. Fourthly, it extends the time for validity of the notice of past benefits from three to six months and, fifthly, it reduces the current administrative burden of the compensation recovery program. These amendments together will reduce the administrative burden on the Health Insurance Commission, insurers and claimants. Looking at the streamlining option, which is the one that is contained in this bill, the cost of this to government will be that there will be a greater reliance on statutory declarations. This means that there will have to be tight fraud controls and audit procedures. There are already some in existence. There will also be reduced total recoveries. But the benefits will be a decreased number of reported settlements and judgments, a decreased issuing of the notice of past benefits statements, decreased complaints because of the sliding scale that has been used in the advanced payment option, and there will also be a decreased administrative cost of $25 million. Another benefit to the government is that this option had unanimous stakeholder support. There will be a cost to business: this option still maintains some compliance cost. The benefits to business will be a reduced reporting of claims, reduced administration of reported claims, an ability to use the advance payment option, and there will be reduced costs of $2.9 million. For individuals, there will still be some compliance costs that have been retained, but there will be benefits. Those who receive compensation of less than $5,000 will no longer be required to comply. Those who have claims greater than $5,000 will be able to give a statutory declaration if there was no Commonwealth benefit received. There will also be a decreased need for a notice of past benefit. We estimate that individuals who come under this will be $11.3 million better off. 31056 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 September 2001 This bill represents an improvement. It is workable and acceptable to all. It does involve a net recovery of $19.9 million, which is better than what we currently have but less than what would have occurred under the levy. I have noted that the opposition supports this bill. This bill essentially has technical amendments, which will involve streamlining the act and preventing double dipping. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.07 a.m.)-I rise to support the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. Like previous members, I see this as a piece of legislation that streamlines a bill that is already operating. The bill will specifically streamline the administration of the compensation recovery program managed by the Health Insurance Commission, make consequential changes to the act governing charges under the program and make consequential amendments relating to the changes from the AAT to the Administrative Review Tribunal. This piece of legislation is refining the Health and Other Services Compensation Act 1996, a piece of legislation that was introduced to stop double dipping by successful claimants for compensation whereby they could receive both a Commonwealth and a workers compensation, or a compensation benefit of some sort. Whilst it has been a step forward, there were still some problems with it. A review was conducted by the former Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner, George Pooley, who was appointed in March 1999. He reviewed the operation of the act and recommended some changes that would make the legislation more workable. This is something that has had bipartisan support in parliament since its inception, but it has had some opposition from insurers and lawyers along the way. Prior to becoming a member of parliament, I worked in rehabilitation with a lot of people who benefited from workers compensation or who were sometimes victims of the workers compensation system. One of the big problems these people had once they received a settlement was the waiting period, the long time they had to wait before they could access the money that had been awarded to them. The original piece of legislation enabled 90 per cent of the compensation that they received to be paid to them, but 10 per cent was held by the Health Insurance Commission. If it was a small settlement, that quite often created a problem for those people. One aspect of this legislation which is particularly pleasing is the fact that people who receive settlements of $5,000 or less will be exempt. That will get around a lot of the problems that those in receipt of workers compensation have had. I am sure that members other than me have made many phone calls to the Health Insurance Commission, chasing up the 10 per cent that has been withheld. It really was a complicated administrative system that caused hardship. For those people that were involved in compensation, be it workers compensation, motor vehicle accident compensation or public liability compensation, it created hardship at a time when they needed to put it behind them and get on with the rest of their lives. Also, the complexity of the system actually increases the cost, not only to government but to all of those people involved in the process. Right from the beginning, when the original act was introduced in 1996, I think this legislation has been a step forward. I think that we really need to continue to focus on improving the system so that all parties involved in it can benefit from it. Over the years people who have been involved in the workers compensation system have had to come to terms with a lot of problems and issues along the way. One of the main issues that they have had to come to terms with is the adjustment to their disability and to their changed life and circumstances. Allowing the payment to people involved to be exempt where it is only a small sum and streamlining the system will actually improve it not only for those who administer it but for those who are benefiting from receiving a workers compensation settlement. In conclusion, I would like to say that I am very happy to support this legislation Wednesday, 19 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31057 because I see that it will make the system work better and will assist those people who have received compensation payments. stration) (10.12 a.m.)-I must say that the expedition with which this bill has proceeded through the Main Committee is proof positive that members of parliament are certainly not paid by the word. The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 proposesjections. This bill proposes to amend the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Act 1995. Acts were passed to ensure that when plaintiffs went to court to recover damages for personal injuries they would repay to the Commonwealth the cost of any Medicare and residential care benefits received because of the injuries. As has been already outlined, the bill arises from a review of the acts undertaken for the government by the former Commissioner for Superannuation, Mr George Pooley. Mr Pooley found that the compensation recovery program covered by the acts has proven cumbersome and burdensome for all parties. He made a number of recommendations to improve these processes. These new arrangements will be simpler, more efficient and will keep impositions on claimants to a minimum. Simpler claiming and administration processes will allow the speedier release of final compensation settlements or judgments and reduce the worry and red tape for recipients and their families. BeforeI conclude, I want to refer to some remarks made by the honourable member for Jagajaga in her contribution. She asked if the Health Insurance Commission could report on the implementation of, and the savings achieved from, this measure in its annual report. I have been informed that the minister would be happy for this information to be made available, so I ask the opposition whip to convey that message to the member for Jagajaga-unless she picks it up during her daily reading of the Hansard record. I thank the honourable members for their support for these important amendments to the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 and to the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Act 1995. I commend the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 to the chamber. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.

249,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (10.17 A.m.),"The Commonwealth Inscribed Stock31058 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 September 2001 istrar under the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill instead of, or in addition to, the Reserve Bank of Australia. Unfortunately, both the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech by Minister Abbott were not overly elaborate on the reasons for, and consequences of, this bill. Accordingly, I do have some questions that I want to ask the minister, and I will come back to these in due course. I understand that certain initiatives in the bill stem from CLERP paper No. 5, which deals with electronic commerce. That paper was circulated in 1997 and a number of initiatives in that paper have already been implemented. The initiative relating to this bill is in part 6 of the the regulations under that act currently require the transactions and transfers of legal title in Commonwealth government securities be settled through a paper based system. The Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act, therefore, does not allow Commonwealth government securities transactions to be settled electronically. That paper also discusses how the absence of an electronic system to settle transfers is being dealt with by the Reserve Bank. The paper states: However, there is nothing in the CIS Act prohibiting the introduction of an electronic system for the transfer of beneficial interests in, or other choses in actionthat is, thingsrelating to, CGS. In practice, the concept of granting a chose in action in relation to CGS has been developed to overcome the existing impediment to electronic transfers of the debt instruments themselves presented by the CIS Act. This concept works as follows. Legal and beneficial ownership of securities lodged into the Reserve Bank Information and Transfer System ... by a member passes to the RBA. The RBA then grants to the member a chose in action. The chose in action is then transferred through RITS. The chose in action entitles the member to direct the RBA to deliver to the member securities of a specified description and face value. The CLERP paper then concludes: It would, however, be preferable to amend the CIS Act to allow the electronic transfer of the direct beneficial and legal interests in CGSthat is, Commonwealth government securities. Accordingly, proposal No. 6 in CLERP paper No. 5 is that: The Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911 and Regulations will be amended to enable the electronic transfer of the direct beneficial and legal interests in Commonwealth Government securities (CGS). This will enable transactions in CGS to be settled electronically, as well as through existing paper based means. That proposal is implemented in the first two aspects of this bill that I described earliernamely, the bill creates a legal framework for the electronic transfer of Commonwealth government securities and it enables the Commonwealth to create equitable interests in Commonwealth government securities. This is not controversial. However, the CLERP paper is silent on the third aspect of the bill: to enable a body corporate to be appointed as a registrar under the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill instead of, or in addition to, the Reserve Bank of Australia. The Reserve Bank is currently the registrar under the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill. The most recent annual report of the Reserve Bank says that the bank provides registry services on behalf of the Commonwealth government, the South Australian Government Financing Authority and a number of other domestic and foreign institutions. The services provided by the Reserve Bank include the issuance of securities, maintenance of ownership records, payment of interest and redemption of securities at maturity. The Reserve Bank annual report from the previous year says that the cost to government through its Wednesday, 19 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31059 agency, the Australian Office of Financial Management, for the operation of the registry declined by 19 per cent during that year. A further decline of around 20 per cent has been forecast for the year 2000-01. One of the first questions that need to be asked of the minister is about the cost to the government if, as contemplated by this bill, a non-government entity performs the functions now performed by the Reserve Bank under the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act. This question needs to be asked because this government has an appalling record on outsourcing. The report by the Australian National Audit Office into the government’s information technology outsourcing program was highly critical of the management and implementation of the information technology outsourcing program and sceptical of the savings to be realised. When the information technology outsourcing program was launched by the Minister for Finance and Administration in 1997, the Hon. John Fahey stated: The Government is committed to achieving the best value for its information technology dollar, to support the delivery of services at the lowest cost to the taxpayer. Later, the minister said that the government estimated that the information technology outsourcing program would save taxpayers approximately $1 billion over seven years. Those savings have not been realised. They were spurious and the contracting of information technology has not been achieved at the lowest cost to the taxpayer. In fact, a vastly different outcome has occurred. I am aware, for example, that in the tax office, where information technology was outsourced to EDS, the number of staff involved in the tax office’s information technology area fell only slightly but you had an information technology contract in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars going to EDS. The net result of information technology outsourcing there was that a great increase in resources-both tax office and outsourced resources-went into this area, a very poor outcome from the perspective of the taxpayer following information technology outsourcing in that area. I am also concerned to ensure that there is confidence in the settlement, transfer and registration of Commonwealth government securities. Commonwealth government securities provide the benchmark yields from which the rest of the debt market prices its risk. It is essential that they maintain their characteristic of being ‘risk free securities.’ I note that the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, in his second reading speech, said: These reforms will increase business confidence in the effectiveness and reliability of electronic transfers of Commonwealth government securities by providing a certain and secure framework for electronic transactions in the Commonwealth government securities market. I would be very concerned if the Reserve Bank processes were not providing a certain and secure framework for transactions in Commonwealth government securities. Accordingly, another issue I wish to explore concerning this bill is how the registry service provided by the Reserve Bank in accordance with the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act interacts with the Reserve Bank information and transfer system. According to the Reserve Bank’s annual report in 2000, that system: ... provides its 143 members (representing 267 organisations) with facilities for the electronic settlement of transactions in Commonwealth Government securities (CGS). The system handles over 99 per cent of CGS turnover in the market ... The system also provides facilities for electronic tendering for CGS, automatic interest and maturity payments for securities lodged in the system and for settling the interbank component of equity transactions on CHESS, the Australian Stock Exchange’s electronic settlement system. RITS is also Australia’s real-time gross settlement system and is the means through which banks and other approved institutions access their Exchange Settlement accounts with the RBA. According to the CLERP 5 paper, the financial system inquiry noted that the real time gross settlement system to be implemented, which has since been implemented, will represent 31060 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 September 2001 world’s best practice. I hope that the minister will be able to further explain these issues to me and also explain what consultation there has been on aspects of this bill dealing with the outsourcing of functions performed by the Reserve Bank. I have indicated to you that there are a number of questions I would like to ask the minister and seek a response from him on, either in terms of consideration in detail or some way in which the minister can come back to the opposition and provide a formal response. I will indicate these questions now to give the government as much opportunity as I can to respond to them. They are essentially: (1) what is the cost to government of the Reserve Bank providing the registry services required under the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act; (2) under what terms, including the cost, would another entity be appointed as a registrar under the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act; what measures would be put in place to ensure that the yield on Commonwealth government securities does not incorporate any risk stemming from a nongovernment entity providing the registry services; (3) what entities has it contemplated may be appointed to be a registrar under the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act; (4) what consultation was there on this bill; (5) what is the interaction currently between the Reserve Bank’s registry system under the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act and the Reserve Bank’s information and transfer system; (6) what would be the effect on the Reserve Bank’s information transfer system if the Reserve Bank was no longer the registrar for Commonwealth government securities under the act; (7) are there any concerns that the Reserve Bank could not provide a certain and secure framework for electronic transactions in the Commonwealth government securities market; (8) could there be any effect on the risk attached to Commonwealth government securities from the changes proposed in this bill to the settlement and registration of Commonwealth government securities and what advice has been provided to the minister concerning this issue? The opposition is interested in seeking responses from the government to these important questions. I indicate, however, that on the information provided to us we are supportive of this bill. Amendment Bill 2001 is a continued part of the government’s package in reforming the economy and the methodology by which the economic transactions take place. It is part of the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 1999, the Electronic Transaction Act 1999, the Corporations Act 2001 and the Financial Services Reform Act 2001. We have an bill here which is line with the government’s reform agenda. Of course, I note that those members opposite would historically have needed to raise large sources of Commonwealth funds to fund their debt, having raised $96 billion of Commonwealth debt at the peak of the Hawke and Keating governments. The current Leader of the Opposition left the government as the Minister for Finance with a $10 billion black hole. So, to fund these particular operations, Commonwealth bonds are required, and this is a tidying up operation of the government to ensure that we remain internationally competitive. I notice the member for Corio has fortuitously arrived in the chamber. He will have very little knowledge of these matters, but hopefully he will listen carefully to the erudition of the member for Corangamite.

251,Mr Mcarthur,"Madam Deputy Speaker, as usual the member for Corio is causing disWednesday, 19 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31061 monwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911 really needs modernisation, because it allowed for securities to be transferred by a paper system. It is interesting that, when the act was established, it stated: The Treasurer may establish a Registry for the inscription of stock at London in the United Kingdom. So that is how far back we were relying on the paper transference of money, which is very much part of the modern government. Currently, the Reserve Bank system creates a legal property right known as ‘chose in action’. This legal right-the chose in action-then gets transferred once it is placed on the Reserve Bank transfer. The Reserve Bank transfer member holds no proprietary interest; he or she merely directs the transfer. So you have an old approach, which this bill is trying to modernise. This bill removes the chose in action approach. This now allows for a direct electronic transfer and the ownership of the security, in keeping with modern arrangements on the stock markets around the world and the bills that governments of Australia raise. The bill in detail allows for the creation and transfer of government securities. It takes into account the fact that the securities are now bought and sold electronically, as are shares on the share market and in the same way as individual Australians use electronic transfers in their own banking arrangements. It brings the government operations into the modern age. The main objective of this bill is to increase the flexibility in the Commonwealth government securities. It allows for the appointment of a non-government clearing facility for securities so that it is not just a monopoly of the Reserve Bank. The Commonwealth government securities are dead instruments. The examples of this are treasury bonds and treasury notes. The government raises these treasury bonds and treasury notes through the Australian Office of Financial Management. The trade of these securities is very much part of the monetary policy of the government, be it the Howard government or be it another government. It is interesting to note that the Commonwealth securities were worth $74 billion in the year 2000, which gives a clear indication of the magnitude of the trade involved; $74 billion is a lot of money in anyone’s language. In any one day, the market turnover is $3 billion of Commonwealth bonds. The improvement of electronic transfer and the identification of the buyer and seller will improve efficiency. The inscribed stock treasury bonds will have their title recorded in a register rather than in the form of a certificate-again, a modern practice which is being instituted in the stock markets-and will be as legal title. The Reserve Bank currently has an electronic securities transfer system and this system currently handles 99 per cent of the securities trade. The government is improving the arrangements for the economic conduct of commerce in Australia and the government operations in an electronic age. I commend the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill 2001, which is part of the reform package that the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Hockey, has been instrumental in bringing about. I have had a number of discussions with the minister about the importance of the Corporations Act 2001 in bringing Australia into line on a competitive basis with other trading nations, and this bill is part of that reform process. Whilst it is not headline stuff, it is important to ensure that the fundamentals of the Australian commercial system work well. It is in the modern age, it is effective and it is legal. I commend the bill. a.m.)-I thank the member for Corangamite for his words of support for the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill 2001.

The member for Corangamite is the custodian of the legacy of former member of parliament Bert Kelly, and he does a fantastic job for his constituents in delivering better quality services, particularly in relation to financial services. I also thank the member for Wills for his contribution to the debate. I understand that the member for Wills has raised a number of questions-or that he has been the conduit for a number of questions. I apologise to him for not being here when he asked those questions, but I undertake to take those questions on notice and get him some answers. I have not seen all the questions, but certainly we are prepared to be as helpful as we possibly can in a bipartisan manner to address any concerns that the opposition might have. I undertake to make my officers available to assist the opposition with their detailed queries. To remind the House, the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill 2001 takes us into a new age for the trading of debt market securities and, perhaps arguably, it is long overdue. We are enabling a dematerialisation of the market. That is, we are shifting from paper based trading to electronic trading in debt markets. As we have witnessed in relation to other markets, it in fact has a significant positive impact on liquidity. In relation to financial markets there is perhaps no factor more important in a market than ensuring that liquidity is in play. Other factors, obviously, such as transparency and integrity are also vital ingredients for good markets, but for a market to truly reflect developments on a microsecond by microsecond basis you need to be able to have a reasonable level of liquidity in the marketplace. Therefore, anything governments can do to improve liquidity in a market is of vital importance. It is also vitally important to ensure that we protect transparency. Australian markets are generally very good at being transparent. Transparency is directly linked to the integrity of a market. If the markets are transparent, if investors, traders and agents in the marketplace are able to determine all the factors that can affect a price and, at the same time, there is a reasonable level of liquidity, then the markets develop their own integrity. And if there is some inappropriate practice in a marketplace then everyone needs to have confidence that, through a process of transparency, they are able to identify it and that the appropriate authorities can seek appropriate redress. This bill will open up the conduct of the Commonwealth government securities market to clearing and settlement facilities involved in the broader operation of the financial markets. It will make it clear that non-government clearing and settlement facilities regulated under the Corporations Act may be appointed by registrars under the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act in addition to, or instead of, the Reserve Bank. It will also create equitable interests in Commonwealth government securities. That will hopefully further improve liquidity in the marketplace rather than simply relying on the legal interests held by the Commonwealth. The bill will also provide for regulations to be made that provide for the transfer of legal or equitable interests in Commonwealth securities in accordance with the act or by applying provisions of the Corporations Act to the transfer of interests in Commonwealth government securities. This bill will increase business confidence in the effectiveness and reliability of electronic transfers of Commonwealth government securities and improve the working environment for that trading. We are obviously entering an overall period where markets are becoming much more sophisticated, where they are becoming 24-hour places of operation, and it is vitally important",133,Representatives Main Committee
254,Mr Hockey,"Today is not the day to make a comment like that, sunshine! Today is notWednesday, 19 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31063 that governments maintain level heads and retain sovereignty over their markets during these challenging times. I am not just referring, obviously, to what has happened in the United States over the last two weeks, but more generally. Markets rely, as I said a little earlier, on liquidity. Closely linked to liquidity is volume. For example, the greatest threat to equities markets around the world is the fact that the cost of raising capital is higher in a less liquid market than it is in a liquid market. Take, for example, New Zealand. A number of companies have left the New Zealand Stock Exchange to list either in Australia. I think in one case in Singapore-or offshore. The main driver of that is not particular New Zealand interests; it is the fact that the cost of raising capital in a small equities market is greater than if you were raising capital in a much more liquid or larger market-for example, London. That is one of the reasons the dual listing structure is very attractive to a number of companies in Australia. It means that they can raise capital overseas cheaper but at the same time retain their position on the Australian Stock Exchange. Today the New Zealand Stock Exchange has a total market cap of around four per cent of the Australian Stock Exchange, which is extraordinary. The Australian Stock Exchange has been greatly buoyed over the years by demutualisation and privatisation. That has helped to significantly increase the cap of the Stock Exchange. Look at some of the companies that are in the top 10 stocks today compared with, say, 10 years ago-the Commonwealth Bank, AMP, Qantas, NRMA and a number of other companies-that were either government owned or mutuals a few years ago and today they are listed, or they are part of larger conglomerates like Woolworths is part of the IEL group. The market has changed quite dramatically over the years, and that is a good thing because it has helped to increase the size and scale of the equities markets in Australia. But at the same time we face our challenges in our marketplace. Australia is blessed with very sophisticated markets. Our derivatives markets are very sophisticated. We have excellent bond markets, various capital markets and in particular derivatives traders. We in Australia have developed some of the most sophisticated financial products in the world. That is not an idle boast. That is reflected in the fact that a lot of Australians are very highly sought after in foreign markets, particularly London and, as we realised in fairly stark terms quite recently and quite sadly, New York. Australian traders, marketers and researchers are very highly prized because we have a very sophisticated market. The question is how we develop scale. With governments of all persuasions quite rightly paying down debt, we have seen an enormous reduction in the comparative scale of the government bond market in Australia. But I understand that in only the last two days we have had a massive seachange in the Australian bond markets with the corporate bond market now passing in size the government bond market. As members of parliament, we would all be rejoicing that in fact the government is not the biggest borrower in the marketplace today. today is really the day to really drill into the opposition. there have been some state governments of Labor Party persuasion that have been as committed to reducing government debt as the Commonwealth coalition government has been. There was a blip. It was a $96 billion blip whereas, as you would know, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am sorry to paint the chair as partisan and that is not our intention of course-in 1983 there was, I understand, $16 billion of Commonwealth debt accrued over 82 years, and,",134,Representatives Main Committee

258,Mr Hockey,"Yes, but there was a paydown. To give them their due, at a state level31064 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 September 2001 to the great credit of the Labor Party, they blew that debt out from $16 billion to $96 billion within 13 years. That was the most extensive line of credit I have ever seen for a government; that is why I say all credit to them. But the truth is that we had to pay it back, and we have paid back $50 billion of that $96 billion so far, with more to come, through prudent financial management by a coalition government. What we have seen is a diminution of the public sector bond market and the semi-government bond market, but bear this in mind: you can have an essentially debt-free jurisdiction and still issue bonds responsibly. The Queensland government has done that over the years to maintain liquidity in the Queensland bond market and in the semi-government bond market, as it is known. But that is certainly not the case when you are just accruing debt and spending it as a government, which, as we all know, is highly irresponsible. It leaves you no room to move on a rainy day. It is good to see the corporate bond market growing because that is adding liquidity to the marketplace. It means that corporations, instead of borrowing money from overseas, are able to borrow money in the Australian market in Australian dollars and, therefore, are able to finance things here without sending interest offshore. Instead, hopefully they are sending interest to the mums and dads of Australia, whose superannuation funds in many cases are invested in domestic corporate bonds. So overall I think this is a very good bill. The bill is long overdue. We look forward to a more liquid market. We look forward to improving transparency. We look forward to lowering the costs of trading in this marketplace. Certainly in relation to the questions raised by the opposition we on this side of the House only indicate goodwill.

Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. detail, to provide the minister with an opportunity to respond, if he wishes, to questions which the opposition has. The minister’s second reading summing up-the hymn of praise to the government’s prudent financial management-is a tad provocative. There was no reference to foreign debt blowing out from $200 million to $300 million. The reference to prudential financial management might not wash quite so well if you are a worker with Ansett or a customer with One.Tel or a policyholder with HIH. One is tempted to talk about the way in which this government has messed up aviation, tourism, insurance, communications, et cetera. I might be straying a bit from the bill, so I will get back to the questions which are specifically on our mind here. The minister, as he indicated, did not have the opportunity to hear them in the second reading debate so I will go through them. He has flagged the prospect that the government may wish to take these matters on notice and provide us with an answer subsequently. I would not be offended by that. I am happy for the minister to be a conduit for the answer, as he suggests I have been a conduit for the question. My questions are as follows-and if he does want to say anything about them now he is very welcome to do that.

Fifthly, what is the interaction currently between the Reserve Bank’s registry system under the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act and the Reserve Bank’s information transfer system? Sixthly, what would be the effect on the Reserve Bank’s information transfer system if the Reserve Bank was no longer the registrar for Commonwealth government securities under the act? Seventhly, are there any concerns that the Reserve Bank could not provide a certain and secure framework for electronic transactions in the Commonwealth government securities market? Finally, could there be any effect on the risk attached to Commonwealth government securities from the changes proposed in this bill to the settlement and registration of Commonwealth government securities, and what advice has been provided to the minister or has been received by the minister concerning this issue? a.m.)-There is a number of detailed questions there which I am happy to take on notice. But one thing I understand-and I may be proven wrong on this-is that the yield in relation to a bond is specifically related to the risk associated with the payment on the bond. I make this perfectly clear here and on the Hansard record: we want to maintain the absolute integrity in the clearing and settlement of this market. As far as I am concerned, I would hope that nothing would be done that would in any way lessen the integrity of the clearing and settlement procedures in relation to Commonwealth inscribed stock. That is essentially unrelated to yield, because when you are looking at the yield from a certain product, no matter what it may be, the marginal impact of the integrity of the clearing and settlement is not there unless there are substantial issues about integrity of clearing and settlement. Under those circumstances, I just say to the member for Wills that, firstly, on the question relating to yield-which is the one that I can particularly answer-that is a matter for factors other than clearing and settlement generally. Secondly, if there are any attempts in any way to negatively impact upon the integrity of the clearing and settlement procedure, they need to be remedied immediately. If the opposition have any concerns about that they should bring them to our attention as soon as possible. Certainly, there is a very steely determination from the government to maintain full integrity, transparency and accountability in relation to clearing and settlement. From our perspective, that will have no impact on the yield from the stock. Bill agreed to. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 29 August, on motion by Mr Anthony: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr O’CONNOR (Corio) (10.58 a.m.)-From the opposition’s point of view, the Social Security and Veterans’ Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 2001 will be supported in its passage through the House. There is some tragedy in relation to this particular bill in that the government is winding it up before the member for Corangamite will be able to access it. I think that is going to be one of the tragedies of this",136,Representatives Main Committee
260,Mr Hockey (North Sydney,"Minister for Financial Services and Regulation) (10.5531066 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 September 2001 bill. I notice the euphoria of the government coming in from the cold, as we say, in polling terms. The honourable member who spoke in the debate previously happened to mention the polls, and of course the honourable member for Corangamite will no doubt be buoyed by them. It has been a long time between drinks for the government in the polls. As the honourable member for Corangamite knows, we harbour fond hopes of winning the seat, and nothing has changed in light of the polls. The measure of the government’s desperation in holding onto the jewel in the Liberal crown in Victoria was the appearance of the Prime Minister in Corangamite. I do not think we have ever seen a Liberal Prime Minister, only one driving through the seat: the Lord of Nareen used to drive through the seat on his way to Melbourne. But now we have the Prime Minister, that great urban lawyer, pretending that he knows something about rural affairs in the seat of Corangamite. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs De-Anne Kelly)-Member for Corio, while wide ranging debates are generally accepted, I think we might make a mild reference to the bill! Mr O’CONNOR-I was alluding to the intent of the bill, Madam Deputy Speaker; perhaps I have not made that particular point clear. It deals with retirement assistance for farmers and it was in that context that I directed my comments to the member for Corangamite. This scheme was announced in 1997 as part of the government’s Agriculture-Advancing Australia package-that great and original package from the coalition that basically rebadged most of the good schemes that were put in place by the Labor Party at the time. I guess that is one of the skills you have when you come to office: you pick the eyes out of the good things that have been done by the previous government. Of course, that will be the philosophy that the Labor Party will employ when we come to power after the next election, although it will probably be slim pickings. But we will scour what has been done by the government over their five wasted years and, if there is anything that missed the wreckage, we will most certainly adopt it. This particular scheme originally allowed farmers a three-year window of opportunity, which began on 14 September 1997, to give farms and farm assets with a value of up to $500,000 to the next generation, without affecting their access to an age or a veterans’ affairs pension. The opposition supported the passage of that legislation through the parliament when it was put up by the government. Of course, like everything that the government says, we heard the claims by the then minister-that great exaggerator, the Deputy Prime Ministerwho at the time announced to the rural sector that this was the greatest thing since sliced bread. This was the creme de la creme of schemes to effect the intergenerational transfer of farms. He raised great expectations that there would be some 10,000 farmers with the capacity to access this particular scheme. Of course, the drumbeats went out in rural and regional Australia, like they did with multiperil crop insurance and a host of other things, and we saw the spectacular failure of the government’s policy in this regard. As I understand it, to date only 2,000 farmers have made use of the scheme. I commend those farmers for the actions they have taken under the scheme. Even the member for Corangamite, who, on his vast properties in the Western District, counts sheep day in, day out, can understand that there is a difference between having 10,000 in the pen and 2,000 in the paddock. I say to the member for Corangamite: is that not so? Mr O’CONNOR-We know that those skills are not transferable from farm to the House. But when he gets out there, breathing the fresh air on the farm, he knows the difference between having 10,000 in one paddock and 2,000 in another paddock. That is what your minister said at the time with respect to the number of farmers who would access this scheme-that",137,Representatives Main Committee
261,Mr Mcarthur,"They’re not much good for counting in the House!Wednesday, 19 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31067 it would be 10,000. This was going to be the great government initiative to effect the intergenerational transfer of farms. Of course, what happened? We now see that 2,000 have used the scheme. The reason why you were able to ratchet up the figure of 2,000 was that you extended the scheme. It was no good; the criteria were too tight. The NFF told you that; the New South Wales Farmers Association told you that. One of the honourable members who is present in the chamber is from New South Wales. It is good to see New South Welshmen in here, because normally when we speak on agricultural affairs the two squires from the Western District, the members for Wannon and Corangamite, speak in these debates. The honourable member from New South Wales would knowMr O’CONNOR-Parkes, is it? I am sorry, I am obviously elevating him beyond his station. I acknowledge the honourable member for Parkes in the chamber today. I understand that he is leaving parliament and that it is going to beMr O’CONNOR-It may well be that, but I think the parliament is going to be a bit less for your going, honourable member for Parkes, quite frankly, and that is the view of members on this side of the House. I will get back to the matters in hand. The honourable members for Corangamite and Wannon were part of that cabal that trotted around the rural industries and rural districts of Australia trumpeting this great initiative and, here we are, talked up to 10,000 but actually delivered 2,000. They are serial offenders when it comes to policy. I will confine my remarks to the rural sector because I think it is illustrative of just how hopeless this particular government has been over the last five years. In the first place, we had the wool industry fiasco and the sale of the stockpile. This always gets the honourable members excited because they really do not like to know the truth. But when Pauline speaks, some members of the Liberal Party jump. It is like the sheep dancing out in the paddock, or perhaps it is like the sheepdog that leaps up on the back of the sheep. When Pauline rattled the can, the honourable members, spooked as they were, suspended sales from the stockpile. Let me tell you, friends: the polls will not spook us, not like Pauline spooked you when you suspended the sale of wool from the stockpile. But it does not end there. The tale I am telling here is about failure of policy, the failure of policy in the instance of dairy deregulation. The honourable member for Corangamite was lauded by the minister here as the Bert Kelly. We know him in my electorate as Captain Zero. He has the electorate over the other side of the river. He is the zero tariff man. He is the man that would have destroyed Ford Australia. There would have been no car industry if we had not defeated you in that election, way back when. Honourable member for Corangamite, you might know a bit about sheep, but I do not think you know much at all about dairy. If your influence in the bowels of the coalition had been as profound as you claim, I would have thought we would have had a different attitude to dairy deregulation. What we got was a disaster, and I will relate it to this Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 2001, because it is dealing with the intergenerational transfer of farms. Let us have a look at dairy deregulation and what it has done to the age profiles of the dairy industry in this country. As we know, one of the vehicles into the dairy industry traditionally has been sharefarming, where young dairy farmers not only gain expertise in running an enterprise under the guidance of an owner but they",138,Representatives Main Committee

What has been the impact of the coalition’s dairy deregulation on that particular section of the dairy industry? As we went around Australia with a task force looking into this failure of coalition policy, what we found was that many sharefarmers took the money and ran, and left the industry. Some very good young people who would have stayed in this industry and lowered the age profile of the industry actually left it as a result of government policy. In this Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme, we have a failure of policy. In relation to the capacity of young people to earn an income in the dairy industry, the government’s policy has failed. I go to exceptional circumstances: here where you demand consistency of policy what have we had? We have had procrastination and decisions made on a political basis-another example of policy failure. I go to quarantine. This would be something that would be close to the member for Hinkler, another one of the good guys on the National Party side. He is one of what we call the ‘rural socialists’ in the National Party who is probably so far to the left of the member for Corangamite he would fall off the breakfast plate. As far as quarantine is concerned, we had a flurry of activity in the budget. The coalition must think that the farming community is stupid. We know that the audit report was done well in advance of the budget. Of course, the budget comes down and the minister says, ‘Hey presto, we have got here a great initiative of $600 million on quarantine’! I am talking about policy failure here. Of course we know why the government did that. But if you go one step back and have a look at the Senate committee reports on salmon, apples and chicken meat you realise just how bad the government has been in that quarantine area as far as policy is concerned. I am mentioning these areas because I think this reinforces the point I am making on the floor of this chamber today: we are debating a bill which, on the government’s own criteria, is a failure. The issue for the rural sector in the future is going to be lowering the age profile of people in the industry. I do not cast any aspersions here. I know that there are some members in this place who can run half marathons and I commend them for that. They do that when they are almost at retirement age. I think that is an extraordinary feat. But the question is: how are we going to get young people into this sector? The honourable member for Corangamite has got a few clicks up on the old age meter and so have I. We both consider ourselves in our prime as far as life is concerned. But the simple fact is that the age profile of farmers has risen over a long period of time. The dairy industry is one industry we could look at: the age profile there is somewhere in the region of 58 or 59. How do we encourage young people into agriculture and how do we effect that intergenerational transfer of farms? Obviously this particular scheme has not really addressed the latter. As far as the former is concerned, I think there is a great task now facing the sons and daughters of people who are raised on farms. The honourable members for Wannon and Corangamite will relate to this. Maybe they play polo out there on the fields of the Western District. We working class lads from Alvie only had football to play in the winter and maybe tennis or cricket in the summer. We did not play polo or any of those sorts of games down on the flat lands of Nareen in the Western District. Nowadays young people growing up have multiple choices as far as their sporting directions go which were not available to somebody like me when I grew up in the Western District. Today there are competing occupations, and it is more difficult for the sons and daughters of young farmers when the objective of the family is to send them away to be educated. They do taste the good life in city environments and then they see in a comparable sense that significant incomes can be earned in other occupations. It takes a long time for them to work through that experience and finally come back onto the farm. There is another thing at work Wednesday, 19 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31069 here, and that is of course the decline in services. Here the government is particularly culpable, because in its first years it drove the boot into rural and regional Australia. That is why we have the MV Tampa, we had the trip to the United States and now we have this as far as the Prime Minister is concerned. One of the reasons why young peopleMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs De-Anne Kelly)-Member for Corio, ‘wide ranging’ does not mean ‘all encompassing’. I think we will try to restrict comments to the bill in question. Mr O’CONNOR-Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I will accept your guidance on this. I am trying to draw a picture of why young people are not coming back onto the farm, and I mentioned the decline in services which has taken place over the last five years. The government must be held responsible for that. There is now a general unwillingness on the part of many urban spouses to partake of the country experience because these services are not available. All of this relates very directly to how we effect the objective of getting more young people on farms, and this is the subject of the legislation that is before us here in the Main Committee. I think industries in agriculture must take some of the responsibility for the encouragement of younger entrants into their particular industries. It cannot be left to government alone. Many industries have developed discrete pathways where young people get access to a rural experience, obtain some skills and make their way through a series of steps to the point where they can own their own farm. But of course governments must also look for successful ways in a policy sense to encourage that lowering of the age profile and to attract new young entrants into the sector. I think there is a job to be done in the education system, because we are now finding that there is not only a lack of understanding of the length and breadth of the occupations that are available to people in Australian agriculture but a general lack of understanding in cities about country life in general. Governments do have a role to play there. Perhaps the criteria that were employed in this particular scheme were somewhat strict. This was not an easy program to access according to the NFF and other farming organisations. There were a number of eligibility criteria but the main ones were that you had to have long-term involvement in farming, you had to have a total income of less than the applicable age or veterans’ pension rate for the three years prior to the transfer and you had to be of age pension age or reach that age before the scheme’s end date. These were fairly strict criteria and not many farmers were able to access the scheme. The bill that we are debating here today amends the Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 to enable farmers who are otherwise qualified for the scheme and who have submitted an application before the cut-off date of 30 June 2001 to finalise the transfer of their farm within a specified time frame after 30 June 2001. For most qualified farmers this will be a period of three months from the date that the department of social security and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs advise them that their application has been approved. This is not the first time that this particular scheme has been amended by the government. I would have thought that the issue we are discussing today would have been dealt with in the original bill that extended the scheme, but it was not and of course it is the subject of debate here today. As I indicated earlier-and the member for Corangamite will be pleased about this-we will certainly not inhibit the passage of the bill through the parliament. Our only disappointment is that the government is going to wind this scheme up before the member for Corangamite can access it. the Social Security and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for",139,Representatives Main Committee
264,Mr Lawler (Parkes) (11.20 A.m.),"I thank the member for Corio for those comments on31070 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 September 2001 Farmers) Bill 1998, though I must say that at various times during his discourse I was wondering whether I was actually in the right chamber. His comments gave an inkling of why the opposition have not let loose with any policies. Some of the words spoken by the previous speaker-he said that a responsible government would take policy from the previous government and pick the eyes out of it-clearly explain why they have no policies on the public record at the moment. It is because they clearly just want to carry on with the policies that this government has started. One of the reasons a number of farmers have not partaken in this scheme might be that when this government came in it found that the previous government had left the agricultural sector absolutely on its knees. Some of the reforms that this government was able to bring in-not the least of which was bringing interest rates to some sort of manageable levelmeant that there were some farmers who could actually afford to stay in the industry who otherwise would have had to get out. That might be some explanation. The previous speaker made some comments as to eligibility for the scheme. I do not think the government need make any apologies for that. We are not in the business of handing out money and opportunity to those who do not need it. This bill was designed to assist those farmers who were caught in a difficult social position-often with two families on the one farm. Their inescapable situation was that they were unable to extract themselves from that arrangement and still maintain some sort of lifestyle on the pension. I speak in strong support of the Social Security and Veterans’ Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 2001. Retirement assistance for farmers in financial difficulties was originally one of the key components of the very successful Agriculture-Advancing Australia scheme. I briefly mention the great success and gratitude expressed by people in the western division who have embraced the West 2000 concept put forward by this government and recently extended as part of the Agriculture-Advancing Australia scheme. As previous speakers have said, it was introduced by the government in 1997 as part of a sustained approach to provide economic impetus and support for the rural sector. Since then the package has delivered unprecedented backing to all elements of the agricultural industry through enhanced competitiveness, viability and therefore profitability. At the same time the Advancing Australia project included provision to assist those farmers struggling to cope financially. This was in the form of the Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme. This bill simply seeks to extend that assistance to farmers who have not been able to finalise the transfer of their farms to the next generation before the 30 June deadline this year. Since being introduced in September 1997 the retirement assistance initiative has served as a reassuring safety net for many hundreds of retiring Australian farmers and their families in my area. The retirement assistance scheme allows older farmers to transfer their farm to the next generation without jeopardising their access to age pension payments or service pensions. This bill seeks to extend this invaluable scheme’s benefit to those farmers who contacted Centrelink prior to 1 August and were told they would qualify for the scheme. These farmers can still qualify for assistance under the scheme, provided the transfer is finalised within three months from the day of the Centrelink contact and confirmation of their eligibility. In doing so, this bill allows more farmers to utilise the scheme and its considerable benefits and to pass their farm operation on to the younger generation without penalty. This retirement assistance most benefits farmers who are confronted with financial difficulty because their farm business is, as I said previously, trying to provide a livelihood for two families when in reality the operation only has the capacity to support one. It does so by removing the significant barrier to the transfer of the family farm from one generation to the Wednesday, 19 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31071 next-that being, a delay in the retiring farmer receiving pension assistance. They are able to pass on their farm to their children as a going concern, confident that the new owners will be able to make a more viable living, and they will receive pension support immediately. From a broader community perspective, maintaining the farm in family hands will foster economic confidence and allow long-time farm couples to retire in dignity and comfort. This extension of the scheme will not change the key eligibility criteria. If the opposition believe, as I understand the previous speaker does, that the limitations are a bit severe then perhaps at some distant time in the future when they may find themselves in government they may be able to make the changes that he wishes to make. Nevertheless, the conditions that have applied for the past four years are, amongst others, that the net value of the farm must be no more than $500,000; the retiring farmers must have owned the property for at least 15 years or have been actively involved in farming for 20 years; the retiring farmers must have had an average income of less than the age pension rate in the previous three years; and the next generation to which the property is being handed must have had an active involvement in the farm for the three years prior to the transfer. By extending access to this worthwhile program, the government will have contributed to a stronger farming community and allowed older farmers, including numerous armed forces veterans, to retire, having placed the family farm in safe hands. Coupled with federal initiatives, such as the recent $18 million farm innovation program to financially back innovative ideas in the farm sector, this government is constantly making ground in boosting the fortunes of primary producers. Such an approach is particularly critical in my electorate of Parkes in western New South Wales. As it is a predominantly sheep and wheat producing area, the impact of a generally declining world wool market and, until recently, plunging commodity prices has had a dramatic and long-term effect. Emerging alternative farming methods and products, ably supported through the funding efforts of this government, augur well for the next generation of farmers who will take control of the farm operation. Freed from the burden of trying to provide income for two families, the farm’s chances of remaining a viable income source are increased. We have to point out, however, that in the state’s far west, the options for alternative farming-that is, farming other than sheep grazing and wool producing-are a little bit more limited, and earlier drought conditions have greatly aggravated the economic situation for people in that region. But here the prospects for two-family farm operations are most dire, and it is in these communities where support mechanisms, such as retirement assistance for farmers, are most needed and most appreciated. It is essential that governments continue to offer incentives and support to the farming communities that are the cultural heart of areas such as western New South Wales. The more farmers’ offspring that can be kept on the land, the more a confident sense of economic security and stability can be maintained in our smaller rural communities. The curse of the asset rich but cash poor farmer is well recognised, and by extending this assistance scheme we continue to right the wrongs of fiscal circumstance for older farmers on less profitable holdings. Small communities rely heavily on the economic well-being of the surrounding farming operations and, as a result, the balance between remaining a service town and becoming a virtual ghost town is a delicate one. By striving to provide both the initiative to excel on the one hand and a safety net for embattled, older farmers on the other, this government is meeting its commitment to the people in the non-metropolitan heartland of this country. In areas hardest hit by the reversal in the fortunes of traditional produce, this scheme is a common sense approach to delivering the best outcomes for individual farmers and the wider communities in which they live. I commend the bill to the House. 31072 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 September 2001 Social Security and Veterans’ Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 2001 by saying that Australia’s agricultural industries are vital to our national prosperity in terms of export and employment and as the economic foundations of our regional and rural communities. I do not share the pessimistic view of the member for Corio, and I am quite sure that his figures about young dairy farmers are quite wrong. My understanding is that, with the deregulation of the industry, a lot of younger people, certainly in Victoria, have been attracted to it. Provincial cities, like Bundaberg, rely on agriculture to drive their economy-sugar and horticulture and, to some extent, beef cattle and, to a lesser extent, dairy cattle. These all contribute strongly to the economy of the area. Travelling further west to Childers, the economy is completely reliant on agriculture, as is the Boyne Valley on cattle and timber. Further north, the Miriam Vale Shire is a major cattle producer, with some small crops in the area and, I might add, some very innovative dairy farmers. I interpose here for a moment to compliment Mr Bruce Polzin who, when the dairy deregulation measures came into place, instead of retreating from the industry actually built his own boutique factory-a very ambitious move which he did, I might add, without government assistance; and it grieved me that he could not get government assistance. He built a factory-I guess it would have cost somewhere in the order of $1 million to $1.25 millionand he now turns out a quality of milk which he calls Baffle Dairy. It is beautiful milk which is available in both full cream and trim. In addition, he makes the old non-homogenised milk in which the cream comes to the surface-and it is a long time since Australians have seen that. The extraordinary thing about it is that, in every store you go to in the Bundaberg and Gladstone areas that carries this milk, even though there is a slight premium on the price, it is enormously popular because people like the taste of it. field day. He had his milk there and he was testing his flavoured milk-and, again, it was enormously popular. We hear a lot of talk about gloom and doom in primary industry, but a lot is happening. Even in my own electorate, in addition to Bruce Polzin with his very innovative approach and the involvement of some of his neighbours who produce milk for his factory, farmers in Childers are growing a variety of tree crops and small crops. Bill Trevor, who is the mayor of that shire, is arguably the largest grower of zucchinis in Australia. John Dorrian makes guacamole from his own avocados and sells it in bulk to the various dip manufacturers and people who make paste and the like in the delicatessen field. David De Paoli grows a variety of chillies and presents them in very attractive vacuum packs. His chillies are now in high demand all over Australia and he has also developed a huge export market to the Middle East. His presentation of the various colours of chillies in the vacuum packs is particularly attractive. The Steinhardt family has developed a method of serrating vegetables into various forms-some with oils, some in natural form-and they are using a special process whereby the vegetables maintain a shelf life of up to six weeks. They are all very innovative people. At the other end of my electorate, the great farmers of the Yarwun-Targinnie area are arguably the best pawpaw growers in Australia and they also grow a variety of tree crops. SoI do not share the pessimistic view that the member for Corio has. Australia’s traditional strength as an exporter of primary produce continues to underpin our national economic performance. This year, our primary industries will generate about $24 billion in income. It is pleasing to see the recovery of the beef industry and also the comple-",141,Representatives Main Committee

It is a tough year for sugar producers, but they are hanging in there and, in my own area, hopefully in the next 12 months some of the sugar farmers will be growing chicory as a second crop. Since 1996, the coalition government has provided a stable pro-growth business environment, characterised by low interest rates, low inflation, a more flexible labour market and a tax system which rewards enterprise. They are four very important ingredients. They are not always talked about in the context of farms. Remember the days when interest rates were up at 17, 18, even 20 per cent, with high inflation, high unemployment and all those things. When you are in an environment where they are not present, there is a greater incentive to do something about it. Again, referring to the member for Corio’s contribution, it is in an environment like that that young, well-educated people will go back to the land and have a go. The government has done a great deal in that field to reward enterprise and to show young people that there is a future in farming. Australia has enjoyed a sustained period of high growth on a scale not seen since the 1960s and matched only by the performance of the United States. Just seeing the words ‘United States’ brings to mind the success that the government has had through the Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, being able to get more of our lamb into the United States. That was an enormous win for Australia and the minister should be complimented on his negotiations. The government has also sought to redress the neglect of the previous government in areas vital to agriculture. I found the presentation of the member for Corio disingenuous in the sense that, in the 13 years when Labor was in power-and I do not want to be unduly political in this speech-there was not much happening in the bush. Some of the measures, like the wool stockpile, have been there to haunt us ever since-or until recent times, anyhow. One of our best packages was Agriculture-Advancing Australia, which put together a comprehensive set of measures to strengthen agriculture. The AAA package-as we refer to it-was introduced in 1997 and extended again in the year 2000. It will inject $800 million into agriculture and fishing industries to support education, training, innovation and adjustment. This support complements $180 million a year that the government devotes to research and development in that sector. As successful as the AAA package has been, the government recognises that the future of agriculture is dependent on more than measures that enhance competitiveness and efficiency, as important as those are. The purpose of this bill is to amend the provisions of the Social Security Act and Veterans’ Entitlements Act applying to the Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme. The amendments will enable qualifying farmers who were unable to finalise the transfer of their farm by 30 June 2001 to transfer their farm after that date and continue to qualify for the RAFS. The RAFS was introduced as part of the Agriculture-Advancing Australia package announced by the Prime Minister and the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, on 14 September 1997. It provided assistance for older, low income farmers who wished to give away the farm to the younger generation without having their pension entitlements affected by the age pension assets and gifting provisions. Prior to 1997, I saw some terrible cases in my first years in parliament-especially under the previous government. Quite often you would see a situation where two sons had grown up on a farm which may earlier have been reasonably successful and each son had married and three families were then living on the farm. That became a trap as dad moved towards retirement or passed the retirement age and three families would be trapped on the farm, with the boys wishing to take over the farm but the father not able to gift the farm for fear of losing social security entitlements. 31074 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 September 2001 It was a tragic thing. In fact, I saw families who were trapped in a poverty cycle well below the social security level. It was a dreadful circumstance. It was one of the most appalling things to see. It was almost government-and I am not saying capital ‘G’ government; I am saying small ‘g’ government-imposing a structural poverty on people. I think that the RAFS has gone a long way to ameliorating that grave injustice. My personal view on it-it is not the government’s view and I do not pretend that it is-is that $500,000 is perhaps too low a limit. I would like to see it perhaps in the range of $650,000 to $750,000. No doubt that will be a challenge for us in our next term of government. While the RAFS commenced on 15 September 1997, it was also open to farmers who had gifted their farms to a near relative in the five years before that date. To qualify, a farmer must have owned the farm for at least 15 years or must have been involved in farming for 20 years, must be an Australian resident or living in Australia, and must be of age pension age or had a partner who was of age pension age on or before 30 June 2001. The farmer must be legally transferring their farm to a person of the younger generation who had been actively involved in the farm enterprise for three years preceding the transfer and must be on an average income for three financial years before the farm transfer or for the three financial years prior to 30 June 2001-whichever was the earlier-equal to or less than the age pension rate. As I said earlier, a lot of people in those circumstances were getting less than that. Another feature of the scheme was that the net value of the total farming enterprise being given away had to be less than $500,000. We should have that in our minds should this scheme be repeated or should something similar to that be done in the future-a challenge for a future government. When announced, the RAFS was intended to run only to 14 September 2000 and it was estimated to cost $77.6 million. It was extended to 30 June 2001 at an estimated cost of less than $7 million. In the first year, 716 farmers, including spouses, accessed the scheme through either Centrelink or Veterans’ Affairs. A further 212 farmers were assessed as eligible once they transferred their farms. In the second year of the scheme, 846 farmers, including spouses, accessed the scheme through Centrelink or Veterans’ Affairs, and a further 165 farmers became eligible once they transferred their farms. Some 1,500 in total were assisted as of 28 March 2000. This is by no means an isolated measure. The government has also listened to the concerns of farmers in implementing the changes to the treatment of private trusts and private companies to ensure that succession planning for farms is not adversely affected. It is also providing a $17.4 million over three years extension to the Rural Financial Counselling Service, a very important measure. Something the previous government never could understand was that farmers provide the backbone of regional Australia, and farmers were seldom listened to before. In 1996, 21 per cent of farmers were aged 60 or more. The government has put in place measures to assist farmers in succession planning and to assist those who were already too old to benefit from these changes to the industry. Another example of this common sense approach to farm families is the family assets test that applies to dependant claimants for youth allowance. Normally for youth allowance the family asset limit is $438,250, but a 75 per cent discount for farm and business assets applies to the family assets test. That has also been of great assistance to people on the land and to the young people who live with them. Farm help is another example. Its origins are in the Family Farm Restart Scheme that was announced in the AAA package in September 1997. The four key components are: income support payable for a maximum of 12 months at the Newstart allowance rate, with a partner component; a re-establishment grant of $45,000; the obligation to obtain professional advice on future viability, and a $3,000 grant to assist with that; and a retraining component of $3,500. I think you can see that the government has been concerned. It is a structured measWednesday, 19 September 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 31075 ure. It was put in place-and this extension is part of this-to help those farmers who were caught in a poverty trap and particularly those who were having trouble towards the end of the scheme unloading their farms in the requisite time limits. I think we should take a more optimistic view of the Australian farm community. It is now enjoying, in many commodity areas, the best prices since the 1960s. We are seeing the benefits of good trade promotion. We are seeing the benefits of innovation on farms. We are seeing the re-establishment of older Australians, with appropriate social security benefits, off their farms. I have no hesitation in commending this bill to the House. like to acknowledge the contribution made by the member for Hinkler, who is a fierce defender of rural Australia and, in particular, Queensland. I was very interested to hear the stories about pawpaws, homogenised milk and other things that are happening in his area. I would like to share with the chamber some stories about rural produce in the seat of Richmond. I hope the member for Hinkler will choose to come down and enjoy our produce one day. BeforeI get to the substance of the Social Security and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 1998 I would like to reinforce some of the comments that he made: there certainly is a very buoyant renaissance happening now, particularly with commodity prices, in agriculture. It has taken a long time to come about. The range of assistance packages that the Liberal-National Party government has introduced over the last six years has helped underpin a lot of those rural communities. Most recently we introduced a package for the dairy industry. We were asked to do so by the dairy industry, principally because the states failed to honour their responsibilities. Other areas of agriculture are doing extremely well at the moment-for example, beef. It is good to see that my beef producers, particular those in the Tweed and Northern Rivers region, are now getting prices which they have not received for 10 to 15 years. We are seeing a much higher increase in commodity prices for cereal crops, as mentioned by the previous speaker, and for lamb, for wool and for pigs. I recall that it was not that many years ago that the industry was, allegedly, on its knees. Pig prices are now at record highs. In the horticulture industry, macadamia nuts have benefited from the low Australian dollar. I would like to salute all our growers on the north coast. They are doing a magnificent job with their exports, particularly to Europe and to the United States. Other boutique horticulture industries are lychee and blueberry farming. Robyn Amos and Otto Saeck from the lychee farm at Newrybar are doing a terrific job. But there does need to be continuing caution with commodity prices, particularly in the sugar industry, which is still struggling, and in our fishing industry. The purpose of this bill relates to RAFS-the Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme-which was put in place in September 1997. It was our view, and certainly that of the community, that extra assistance had to be given to the farming sector, and particularly to older farmers who wanted to transfer their farms on to the next generation in order to qualify for RAFS. The RAFS has provided a three-year window of opportunity for low income, age pension age farmers and their partners to gift the farm to the younger generation without affecting their access to social security payments. The legislation provides for the scheme to finish on 30 June 2001. Without changes to the legislation, farmers who would otherwise be eligible under the scheme but have not been able to transfer their farm assets by 30 June 2001 would have been prevented from accessing the scheme. That is why we had to extend it. So the effect of this bill is to extend the RAFS to farmers who have contacted Centrelink prior to 1 August 2001 to inquire about their eligibility for social security payments relying on RAFS. They will still qualify for assistance under the scheme even though the transfer of the farm was not completed by 30 June this year. The",144,Representatives Main Committee
268,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Minister for Community Services) (11.47 a.m.)-I would31076 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 September 2001 transfer will need to be finalised within three months from when they are notified by Centrelink that they will be eligible. Farmers still have to meet the other qualification criteria for the scheme as they stood at 30 June 2001, such as being of age pension age and, most importantly, meeting the means test. Details of the proposed changes were communicated broadly via a media release on 12 July 2001. The Social Security and Veterans’ Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 2001 is required in order to give that extension. BeforeI conclude, I want particularly to thank the ministers who were responsible for this scheme back in 1997-the then minister for agriculture, the current Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, who was followed in the agriculture portfolio by Minister Vaile and then Minister Truss. I thank those in the respective departments-my department and Minister Truss’s department-who have worked long and hard on the initial legislation and on extending it. I also acknowledge the work that Centrelink has done across the country in giving assistance to rural communities. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Main Committee adjourned at 11.53 a.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Australian Defence Force: Military Justice (Question No. 2689) Mr Price asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 7 June 2001: (1) How many Service personnel have contacted the Burchett audit team to date. (2) How many complaints are the subject of investigation. (3) When will Mr Burchett reporting his findings. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Burchett audit team contacted 2,350 serving personnel in some 41 military establishments. The audit team received a total of 586 formal contacts either in written or oral submissions. (2) There were 30 complaints that were referred to appropriate authorities for investigation. (3) Mr Burchett handed his report to the CDF on 12 July 2001. CDF has accepted all the recommendations. An edited copy of the Report has been released to the public. Australian Defence Force: Military Justice (Question No. 2837) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 8 August 2001: (1) Does Defence currently maintain a centralised case flow management system in order to ensure that the military justice system is operating efficiently and to prevent unnecessary delays with individual cases before court martials, Defence Force Magistrates and summary authorities. (2) In particular, does Defence currently monitor progress with (a) notification of laying of charges, (b) the steps proceeding to trial and (c) the result of any trial; if not, has the need to introduce such a system been identified by the Judge Advocate-General. (3) Does Defence currently utilise a structured system of directions hearings to ensure that appropriate preparations are being made for a trial; if not, has the need for such a system been identified by the Judge Advocate-General. (4) Has the Judge Advocate-General noted difficulties with the ready provision of statistics on the operation of the military justice system; if so, would the proposals referred to in parts (2) and (3) assist in overcoming these difficulties. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) No. However, once a court martial or Defence Force Magistrate trial is convened informal centralised monitoring by Defence Legal Service occurs. (2) (a) No. The laying of charges are currently single service command based decisions. As such charges are monitored at unit level and at some superior headquarters. (b) No. The laying of charges and the proceeding to summary or court martial/Defence Force Magistrate trial are currently single service command based decisions. As such proceedings are monitored at unit level and at some superior headquarters. Local legal officers provide legal advice at various stages of the process. (c) Yes. The need to introduce case flow management procedures has been identified by the Judge Advocate-General. Paragraphs 32 to 40 of the Judge Advocate General’s Report for the period 1 January to 31 December 2000 refers. Mr Burchett QC has also recommended the introduction of a similar system in his recent Report on Military Justice. (3) No. The need for such a system has been identified by the Judge Advocate-General. Paragraph 38.b. of the Judge Advocate-General’s Report for the period 1 January to 31 December 2000 refers. (4) Yes. The proposals in parts (2) and (3) may assist in overcoming these difficulties. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Noise (Question No. 2854) Mr Murphy asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 9 August 2001: Further to the answer to question No.2303 (Hansard, 6 August 2001, page 29177), in light of the fact that the aggregate movement of aircraft to the north of Sydney Airport up until 31 May is 29.4%, when compared to the promised Long Term Operating Plan target of 17% for aircraft movements to the north, (a) upon what basis does he claim that the Government has addressed the aircraft noise issue by providing for a substantially more equitable sharing of noise and (b) what does ‘substantial’ mean in light of the facts on aircraft movements for Sydney Airport, with particular reference to aircraft movements to the north of that airport. Under the Government’s noise sharing plan the Sydney Airport Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) residents in areas to the north of the Parramatta River have received significant noise benefits. I am advised by my department that the Long Term Operating Plan has brought about an approximate 40% reduction in the number of landings from the north compared to the arrangements in place under the previous Labor Government. By opening the east-west runway it is now possible to rotate the runways in use so that areas are given a break from aircraft noise for at least some periods on most days. In fact there were no landings over the north for more than a quarter of the days in the year 2000. Prior to March 1996 all aircraft taking off to the north had to use the main runway and travel to the Parramatta River before turning towards their destination. Under the LTOP, departures to the north are shared between the two parallel runways and almost all aircraft taking off from the main north-south runway turn toward the north-west before reaching the Parramatta River. Health: Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (Question No. 2871) Mr Kerr asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 21 August 2001: (1) Has his attention been drawn to recommendations implemented by the Minister for Health and Aged Care following recommendations by the Medicare Specialist Advisory Committee regarding funding of hyperbaric medicine. (2) Has he received advice that the restriction of the use of hyperbaric medical facilities is likely to increase the number of amputations for conditions currently treated conservatively through high pressure oxygen; if so, will he undertake to examine funding directly through his portfolio, expenditures the Department of Health and Aged Care will no longer meet for the care of veterans. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) I understand that the impact of the Medicare Specialist Advisory Committee (MSAC) recommendations is to amend the current Medicare Benefits Schedule to limit access to Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) to patients with conditions of decompression illness, gas gangrene, air or gas embolism, diabetic wounds, or necrotising soft tissue infections. This means that veterans with wounds related to peripheral vascular disease and soft tissue radionecrosis would no longer be able to access publicly funded HBOT for treatment of these conditions. The MSAC assessment report found there was insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of HBOT for either of these conditions. Based on evidence currently available, it cannot be concluded that excluding veterans with peripheral vascular disease from accessing HBOT will have any effect on the incidence of lower limb amputation in this group. However, following concerns expressed by the hyperbaric medical profession about the potential impact of withdrawal of HBOT for these indications, the Department of Health and Aged Care has agreed to maintain interim access to the use of HBOT for wounds related to peripheral vascular disease and soft tissue radionecrosis. While these items will not appear in the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), due for release in November 2001, funding of benefits for these indications will continue until 1 May 2002, by which time MSAC should have considered a further submission from the profession which may or may not provide more evidence for the efficacy of HBOT treatment for these conditions. The Commonwealth’s position will be reconsidered again following MSAC’s determination of this matter in May 2002.",147,Representatives Main Committee
