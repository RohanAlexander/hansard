I submit that an honourable member may not address to a Minister a question arising out of an answer just given, and especially he may not frame a question in such a way that it is in the nature of a speech to his constituents on a subject in which they are interested. in the' House of Commons, and the same practice has grown up in this House, for a member to ask a question to elucidate an answer to a question just submitted, so long as any further questioning does not amount to cross-examination of the Minister. The bonorable member for Angas is in order, if his desire is to elicit information; but, if his intention is to convey information to the House, the question is out of order -The answers to the honourable memI ask the honourable member so to frame it that he may obtain the information that fae desires"" ready supplied to me seems to be contradictory of that obtained from the MinI am merely asking for information.

Isi t now proposed to remove the whole of the temporary footpaths in Canberra, and replace tliem with permanent ones, as has been done in the vicinity of Parliament House? 2. If so, does this mean that tenants wil l be expected to meet portion of the extra expenditure to be incurred? Sir NEVIL LE HOWSE -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The Commission's policy is gradually to provide for permanent footpaths both in commercial and residential areas. current financial year, it is not proposed to proceed with the construction of permanent footpaths other than in the Manuka centre and official areas. 2. Under the provisions of the Eoads and Footpaths Kegulations each lessee is required to pay half the cost of permanent footpaths constructed opposite his leased land. Home and Territories, upon noticeWith reference to a question asked by the honourable member foiMelbourne on the 15th instant, to which the Minister replied that "" there are approximately 100,000 acres of freehold land in the Federal Territory that has not yet been acquired from private owners, and no valuation has been made of those areas ""-is this reply in conflict w i th the Third Annual Report of tlie Federal Capital Commission, wherein it is stated that "" there are still about 4G,000 acres of freehold land in the Territory, but it is not at present required for an}' public purpose, and there is no immediate need, therefore, to justify its acquisition""? 2. Will the value of such land be increased by delaying its acquisition, or w ill its price be fixed by the enabling act passed for such purpose? swers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The amount of freehold land in, the Territory is approximately, 40,000 acres; but, in addition, there are over 50,000 acres of land held under conditional purchase or conditional lease tenure from the State of New South Wales, which the holders have the right to convert to freehold at any time upon fulfilment of certain conditions. For the purpose of indicating the area of land in the Territory which had not been valued for acquisition purposes, it was necessary to refer to the whole of this in thc answer to the question asked by the honourable member for Melbourne on the 15th March, 1928. 2. For the purposes Of acquisition, no. Section 10 of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act of 1910 provides that in determining the compensation to which the owner of such land is entitled, the value of the land shall be taken not to exceed the unimproved value of the land or the interest therein of the owner on the 8th day of October, 1908, together with the value of his interests in the improvements on the land at the date of acquisition of the land. of March, the honorable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) asked me the following questions:1. Isi t a fact that the Federal Capital Commission intends to build garage accommodation for fifteen cars at the Hotel Acton, six at the Hotel Ainslie, and twelve at the Hotel Wellington ? 2. Is there already a greater demand for garage accommodation than could be supplied During the by the proposed new provision? 3. Do these hotels lose a great deal of business because motor tourists prefer not to visit establishments where they cannot garage their cars? 4. Does the Commission intend to pursue its practice of failing to supply sufficient garage accommodation ? 5. Isi t a fact that the failure of the Commission to supply garage accommodation has already cost motor car owners resident in or temporarily staying at tliese hotels large sums of money for damage and depreciation sustained by cars which are constantly exposed to thc weather? I am now in a position to advise him as follows:1. Tenders have been invited for a garage to accommodate fourteen cars at the Hotel Acton, and it is proposed to provide accommodation for an additional six cars. Provision is being made for the accommodation of seven cars at Hotel Ainslie and twelve at Hotel Wellington. 2. A t the moment. Yes: but the demand will decrease when Parliament is not in session. 3. I have no information on this subject. 4. It is considered that the provision of garage accommodation for persons permanently located in Canberra is a matter for private enterprise. The provision about to be made is regarded as reasonable in the circumstances. 5. Cars parked in the open must be expected to depreciate more quickly than those which are garaged. Many of tlie cars, however, were purchased by their owners with a f u l l knowledge tliat garage accommodation at tli« hotels was not available. . (AUSTRALASIA) LIMITED . BEAM SEBVICE. MrE .

48,Mr C. Riley Presented The Report Of,"-Agreed toThat so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as will enable Notice of Motion, No. 4, General Business, in the name of Mr Brennan, to take precedence for this < J move That, in the opinion of this House, the action of the Government in regard to certain notorious income tax evasions known as "" the Abrahams cases"", the history of which discloses improper and unprecedented bargaining on thc part of the Government with self-confessed malefactors, and grave failure to safeguard the revenues of the Commonwealth, is repugnant to right practice and out of harmony with correct and settled principles governing the administration of the criminal law. I move this motion on bebalf of the Opposition and with the concurrence of its Leader. It arises out of what was described by the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) in a speech which he delivered in this House a little over a week ago as "" a series of frauds perpetrated in connection w i th the evasion of income tax by the three brothers, Abrahams"". The situation was also summed up in the judgment of Mr Justice Starkei n these wordsIt is plain on this material that the defendants operated together and possibly witli others systematically to defraud the Commonwealth. Investigations by omcers of the Income Tax Department have been proceeding since 1920 into matters which arose out of an audacious application made by one or more of these brothers to defeat, in the courts, the assessment of their incomes made by the Commissioner of Taxation. From that time what might be described as a guerilla warfare bas been waged upon this firm , its subsidiary companies, Surprise visits have been paid to their questionings and examinations have taken place; and proof has been found of the use of faked documents, dummy companies and the names of dead or fictitious persons to defraud tbe Commonwealth of its dues. Banking accounts have been gone into which have been numerous and complicated enough to baffle even tbe Treasurer of the Commonwealth. To all these persistent efforts on tbe part of the taxation authorities to ascertain tbe ( B y leave) facts, persistent and determined opposition and obstruction has been offered by the suspected persons. Even during the investigations these gentlemen have either themselves or through tbeir numerous agents continued to f a l s if y their returns and rob the Commonwealth. The investigation officers have found at their various places of business, butts removed from cheque books, obvious alterations in accounts, and deceptions practised in records contained in ledgers, cash books and other books of account. Whenever one of these three persons has been asked aii awkward question it bas been bis practice to say, "" That was a matter entirely within tbe management of my brother."" If it were not Louis, then it was Charles, and if not Charles then Emanuel; but it did not happen on a single occasion that the person who was questioned was able to give the investigation officer any information. Tbe inquiries were conducted witb commendable industry by the officers of the Taxation Department. Eventually on tbeir advice, search warrants were obtained and forcible entries made into certain places of business and' private residences occupied by the principals in tbese cases, or by one or more of their numerous dummies. True to character, when the authorities expressed tbe determination to blow open certain safes, these gentry or one of tbem stood by and refused either personally or through representatives, to hand over the keys. Even when one safe bad been blown asunder tbe man Bartlett, wbo was an agent of tbese brothers refused to hand over a key wbicb be bad in his pocket for another safe, and that also had to be forcibly, opened, to enable its contents to be impounded by the authorities. Scarcely dummies and instruments. had the last echo of these explosions died away before tbese persistent tax-evader? various places of business; were on tbeir knees begging for terms from tbe officers of tbe Commonwealth. One of the most striking features of tbese deplorable cases is that the taxation authorities, having pursued tbeir inquiries w itb keen intelligence and perseverance up to the stage at wbicb they bad in their possession, apparently, the whole of tbe papers for wbich they had so long inquired, when the matter",21,Facilities

50,Mr Brennan (Batman) [ 3 . 2 ],"Icame into tlie hands of the Government, it immediately fell down upon its joh, and began to traffic with these malefactors as though they were citizens of probity and good name and had not been guilty of any offence much less conspiracy against the Commonwealth. The Attorney-General stated that he accepts f u l l responsibility for the action taken by the Government. My answer is, in the first place, that the honourable gentleman cannot escape responsibility, even if he would. I am bound to add that all the responsibility does not rest upon him personally; it has to be borne by the administration as a whole. The speech of the Attorney-General presents for consideration a number of vital principles, the sanctity of which is endangered by tbe procedure adopted in tbese cases. The honourable gentleman has issued a challenge to and to the country, and the Opposition takes up the gauntlet and joins issue with him. -wrongdoers should have been charged witb conspiracy or other appropriate charge in a court of criminal jurisdiction before a jury of tbeir own countrymen. a serious offence in tbe eyes of the law. monwealth Crimes Act tbatAny person who conspires with any other person{a) to commit any offence against the law of the Commonwealth, or (b) to prevent or defeat the execution or enforcement of any Commonwealth Act or any regulation therenever mind reading further. Admit it under, or (c) to effect any purpose which is unlawful under the law of the Commonwealth, or (nt) to effect any lawful purpose by any means which are unlawful under the law of the Commonwealtli. or (e) to defraud the Commonwealtli shall be guilty of an indictable offence. Penalty: Imprisonment for three years. There are undoubted facts upon which theseaccused persons might have been successfully indicted under almost every one of tbe several beads set out in that section. Clearly there is an overwhelming case against them. Tbe Attorney-General preferred that tbe Commissioner should take certain proceedings under the Income Tax Assessment Act; by virtue of an agreement Mr lirennan. entered into between tbe Crown and these admitted malefactors, they were not charged with a criminal offence in the strict sense of tbe term. Tbey were made defendants in a highly respectable, quasi-civil action in which their solicitor entered a defence ou their behalf in these simple terms: "" The' defendants admit tbe truth of the whole of the plaintiff's case herein."" Tbat was the defence in answer to charges running into twelve to thirteen pages of closely typewritten matter, setting out a long series of allegations of deception, intriguing, conspiring and evading. Mr Speaker, in the course of your own experience as a distinguished member of tbe profession which you adorn you have probably seen accused persons enter tbeir pleas in quite different circumstances from these. Legal this party members like tbe honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Maxwell) and others have seen defendants in the dock I submit that these under tbe searchlight of public observation, witb tbe public on the ground floor and tbe press in the galleries, quaking at the knees, confronted with a record of tbeir ill-doing and called upon to answer Tbey bave committed tbe question, "" Do you plead guilty or not guilty?"" But by this agreeI t is provided in tbe Comment, these gentlemen were permitted to sit in their offices and listen to tbeir solicitor reading the record of tbeir fraudulent dealings with the country that bas rendered them so much service. Possibly, growing weary before balf the record was read, tbey said, "" Tut, tut; all. Let us get on with some other business."" And there, for tbe moment, for tbem, the matter ended. Tbe Income Tax Act provides machinery for collecting arrears of tax and for imposing penalties upon those who are in default. Tbese provisions are useful, and tbey are suited to certain cases. Tbey tend to safeguard the revenue and to enable the Crown to secure payments, and additional payments by way of penalty, from defaulting taxpayers. But they were never intended to, and they do not, in fact, supplant the law of this country which deals as a matter of public policy witb grave criminal acts, and especially sucb acts as are alleged in this case against the Commonwealth and the taxpayers as a whole. Yet, while they were permitted to enter their plea in a dignified and perfectly gentlemanly way, as defendants in what I h.ive referred to as a quasi-civil action-on e hardly knows how to describe it, having regard to the oblique methods adopted by the Government-those.wh o assisted them in their wrongdoing were thrown to the wolves. They were charged before a competent court in the ordinary way, and I.have a record of the cases. It was part of the agreement that they should be so charged and that they should plead guilty. A more extraordinary provision was never included in any agreement: that persons, not parties to it, should be required to certain serious charges involving fraud and discredit. Bartlett, who stood by while the safes were being torn open was one victim. Eor furnishing a false return he was fined £100. Eanny Cohen and Myriam Hyams were similarly charged and fined. Louis Hyams was fined £100 on the first . charge and £50 on the second charge. Other defendants were fined £100. All of them were mulcted in suitable amounts for costs. These were the dummies and underlings, but it was thought unnecessary that their employers-the millionaires-shoul d be dealt with in the same way as these mere instruments. I submit that cases of far reaching and persistent fraud sucb as this come peculiarly within tbe category of those that should be dealt witb under the heading of conspiracy, but even if that is not so, the action of the Government in this case Justice Starke, who has pointed out that the arrangement made by tbe Crown trespassed upon tbe province of the judiciary. Tbe Government bas dealt witb this case politically and at tbe best on the basis of expediency, when it sbould have been dealt witb judicially and from the standpoint of bigb public policy. No one bas ventured to father the opinion that a charge of conspiracy would persons. I shall show that there is overwhelming evidence that it would lie, and in this regard a very important fact is that tbe Government bas not ventured to place on the table the opinion of tbe counsel upon wbich it acted. I say, to put it mildly, that it is a great pity that etiquette and precedent sbould be weakly pleaded wben a case of this kind comes up for discussion iu tbe ' national parliament; a case wbicb involves, in a certain sense, tbe very safety of the nation itself. We have been refused that opinion. I shall not place the worse inference that can be placed on that fact, but shall content myself with saying that tbe Government may not rely on tbe contents of a document wbicb it does not dare to produce. deliberately withheld that document? to publicly plead guilty declined to produce it . Mr W. R. given ? said that it is not the usual practice to produce counsel's opinion. that tbe Government bas given, but then the case is not usual. If the opinion ' ; i any way justifies tbe Attorney General's action, he should, in the interests of the Government have tabled it. I take leave to challenge tbe honourable gentleman to tell this House that be is satisfied that there were no sufficient grounds upon wbicb those persons could have been indicted for conspiracy. Tbat is a daring challenge, and I have sufficient confidence in tbe Attorney-General to b«3lieve that he would not misuse bis position as tbe leader of tbe bar to mislead this House upon this question. established that an agreement to commit an offence is an indictable conspiracy, no matter whether tbe principal offence is punishable on indictment or not. The principal offence may be a minor offence, yet an agreement to commit it is a conspiracy. In this case there was an agreement to commit, not a minor offence, but a grave series of offences, and that was a conspiracy. The Attorneynot lie against these General bas, I think, admitted that an indictment for conspiracy would lie, but he bas made some remarkable statements in explanation of the fact that sucb a presentment bas not been",22,Abrahams Prosecutions

57,Mr Maxwell,"O r upon any other.filed. One is that ""where proof is available of tbe actual offence it is usual to proceed on that charge and avoid the difficulty of proving tbe agreement or conspiracy. He instanced tbe case of an agreement to commit burglary. He said, rightly, that when two or more persons break into a house at night that is usually donepursuant to a conspiracy, but the Crown is satisfied with charging the delinquents, if it can lay tbem by tbe heels, with tbe crime of burglary, not witb conspiracy. Tbat is perfectly true, yet tbe illustration is unfortunate for tbe Attorney-General, because the Crown puts sucb men on trial before a jury on tbe serious charge, and that is exactly what we say sbould bave been done in this case. Further, the Attorney-General said that be was not uninfluenced-whic h I think, clearly means that he was influenced, although that form of speech was designed to temper tbe crudeness of the declaration-by tbe fact that he saw no reason why honest taxpayers sbould not receive tbe benefit of a contribution from dishonest taxpayers. All right-minded persons, whether lawyers or laymen, will agree that that excuse is as dangerous as it is specious. If it were valid, many an embezzler, or conspirator, indeed, possibly many another criminal, would be in the happy position of being able to plead restitution in bar of prosecution; and most of them would have a great deal less to restore than tbe Abrahams brothers have been required to pay back. But not only is restitution not admitted as a bar to prosecution, but tbe law sets its face so sternly against any practice of the kind that there bas grown up a separate offence known as the compounding of felony. The' action of tbe Government'in compounding this offence, whether it be a felony or something .else, is open to serious criticism and censure. The principle to which I have just referred is as old as it is well founded; it rests on public morality and security, and upon that old maxim, not always respected, that there should not be one law for the rich and another for the poor. The Attorney-General made much of tbe allegation that nothing in tbe agreement gave to the' Abrahams brothers immunity from 1 prosecution. I presume he meant any kind of prosecution. Mr Brennan. said that be would not bave entered into, or permitted any one else to enter into, sucb an agreement. Of course, be would not; indeed, if be bad made such an agreement, or sanctioned the making of it by any person under bis authority, he would, I think, have been guilty of an offence himself. There was no agreement in writing, but an agreement was implied as clearly as if it bad been written and sealed that there would not be a particular kind of prosecution, and that the only kind of prosecution that these culprits really fear. If there were not, bow does the Attorney-General account for the frantic efforts of these tax evaders, bidding in rises of hundreds of thousands of pounds, to settle? According to the agreement, the consideration for which Abrahams brothers disgorged their money so freely, was that their papers sbould be returned and the proceedings brought to a speedy termination. Does anybody believe that that was the real import of tbe agreement ? Obviously, it was not. Having regard to their eager disgorging, it is evident that tbe hidden meaning of the document was that these defaulters were to be saved from the dock, and from that they bave been saved. There was not, and, in the circumstances could not be, a written agreement; but, strangely enough, it was with these persons of clouded probity, whom the agents of the Commissioner had been , fighting for six or seven years, who bad defrauded tbe Crown, treated its officers witb contempt, refused to deliver up tbeir keys, or to allow tbeir books to ba inspected-it was witb tbese persons that the Minister allowed to be made an unwritten arrangement as between gentlemen. Presumably tbe standard of gentility recognized by him was that embodied in the saying, ""Money makes the gentleman."" It bas been suggested, although never alleged, . that there was barely sufficient evidence upon wbicb tbese malefactors might have been successfully charged with conspiracy, and the Attorney-General pointed out that such a charge would involve extradition of tbe fugitive delinquents, and lengthy proceedings during which ""the lawyers would have had the time of their lives."" That cheap gibe about the legal He profession might have come more fittingly from lips other than those of the Attorney-General, the chief lawyer of the Commonwealth. My view is that in making that statement the Attorney-General was playing to the gallery. As to whether there was evidence upon which a charge of conspiracy could have been founded, I shall quote a few sentences from the report of the proceedings before Mr Justice Starkei n the H i g h Court. Honourable members should take the opportunity to read from the file in the library this in teresting report, which would for m a very intriguing scenario for a film. Mr Justice Starke saidThe whole case seems to be based upon conspiracy. Why were they not prosecuted for conspiracy under the Crimes Act? the circumstances of the case, as the facts were ascertained after the raid and on thc certificate of the Attorney-General, it was determined that there was not sufficient chance of getting a conviction before a jury. 1"" hesitate to say of so distinguished a member of the bar as Sir Edward Mitchell anything more than that that statement is a masterpiece of justifiable evasion-justifiable , because he bad his brief, and had to submit sucb reasons as occurred to b i m at tbe moment. ference would be that they might have been committed to gaol. dence at the time these facts were discovered from which there may be a strong inference drawn, but subject to great difficulty of proof. Sir Edward bad here weakened slightly. thc Attorney-General to decide; that is a matter for a jury. I respectfully concur. General told us of tbe issue of a search warrant, and the raid upon the business premises of tbe Abraham brothers, and he saidThe search resulted in definite evidence oi fraud., Then he added these remarkable wordsDetailed examination of the papers would probably have occupied eighteen months. I do not know whether tbe honourable gentleman desired that observation to be taken literally; it seems to me in credible. Buti f the watch dogs of the department, in tbe course of an investigation extending over a few hours were able to obtain what the Attorney-General described as "" definite evidence of f r a u d , "" what might tbey not have found during an examination extending over eighteen months ? The matter is placed outside tbe realm of argument by the further observation of Mr Justice StarkeI t is plain on this materialand that material was before the Crown at all material timesthat the defendants operated together, and, possibly with others, systematically to de fraud the Commonwealtli. MrE . RILEY T h a t is common sense. judicial finding of clear conspiracy, and, but for the risk of overloading the proofs, one might refer to some observations by the Commissiouer, who is referred to in the' preamble of this most questionable agreement as having said that he was satisfied that he was in possession of the whole of the information, and sumcient. to enable h i m to make the assessments. He could not bave been in possession of sufficient information to make those assessments without having suflicient evidence on which to found a charge of conspiracy against the delinquents. There is in this case the clearest evidence of what tbe judge described as a widespread conspiracy. Indeed, tbe defendants in tbeir frantic desire to come to a settlement, made sucb admissions, and such a lavish surrender of money, that if tbey bad been arraigned upon a charge of conspiracy, it is perfectly obvious that tbe case would not bave extended over months and years, but that they would have entered a plea of guilty on tbe first day of tbe trial. Theni f their counsel bad been in a Tbe Attorneyposition to say for them standing in tbe dock, "" Your Honour, these persons bave made ample restitution,"" tbey -might still have evaded gaol. We would not complain of an exercise of clemency of that kind, and in such circumstances the public conscience would have been satisfied. But we say that clemency sbould bave been exercised by a judicial and not an executive act, and in the f u l l light of day in the courts. But what really happened? Feeling that they did not deserve clemency, as they did not desire trial, tbese men rushed the Government with offers for a settlement.

I do not know that I have seen a statement amounts. pressed the position in the dignified manner appropriate to his office by saying that first the defendants made one offer that was refused; then they made another offer that was refused, and then they made a third offer that was accepted. When the first offer was made, thc Government said "" Get the behind me, Satan."" Wben another £100,000, or let it be £200,000-wha t does it matter? -wa s added to the offer, the Government said "" Get the behind me, Satan; but not so far behind."" When a third offer, of £500,000 was made, then, and not till then, did the Government, accustomed to tliink, act and speak in terms of money prices, say, "" Satan, after all, you're a sport; we accept it."" In this connection I think that I should be permitted to quote from one of the papers laid upon the table of the library by the Attorney-General. affidavit subscribed by Mr Birch, apparently a most vigilant, enthusiastic .and capable officer of bis department, wbo has been in the forefront of those carrying out these investigations. Paragraph 19 begins in tbese termsShortly after the warrant had been executed, tbey pleaded guilty in this bonorable and documents and papers removed as aforesaid, offers of settlement were received by the Crown Solicitor and counsel for the. plainplea-thei r highly respectable defence tiffs from counsel acting for the defendants. Counsel advised the Crown Solicitor, however, that the offers made should not be submitted to the Commissioner until hasty examination of the documents seized had been made aud somo opinion formed as to what evidence had been obtained. refused: but counsel for the defendants persisted in increasing, on each refusal, the amount of his previous offer, until finally an offer was made to pay the sum of £500,000, together with;the sum of £10,000 for costs, and to plead guilty in this honourable court to taxation prosecutions averring fraud, and to abide by such judgment as this honourable court should think fit. I make some comments on this paragraph. My first remark is that every succeeding offer was an additional reason why all offers should bave been rejected, if rightly appreciated and understood. In the second place, wby do we find these words, "" tbe offers made should not be submitted to tbe Commissioner until hasty examination of tbe documents seized had been made""? For seven years Mr Brennan. the department had pursued tbese men, of the precise and sought the opportunity that was now The Attorney-General exin tbeir bands to get their papers. The officers of the department had made these searches. They bad followed tbese men from State to State. They bad suffered insult and ignominy in tbe discharge of their duties. Yet wben tbey had got everything in their hands, when they had blown in the defendants' safes, and had gathered in their papers, the Government, I repeat, fell down on its job and declined to press tbe prosecution home. A "" hasty "" or perfunctory examination was stipulated of papers which it took years to discover. And why did tbe affidavit say, further, that counsel for the defendants "" persisted in increasing"" the offer ? There is a note of complaint in that. The suggestion is"" Tbey should not have made it so bard as they did for the department to resist tbe offer. Tbey should It is part of an not have offered us so much. How could they expect us to keep on refusing an offer bounding up by hundreds of thousands of pounds at every leap?"" Then the defendants agreed to ""plead guilty in this honourable court."" I may not be in possession of the f u l l facts, because 1 have not all the papers; but where have court ? "" I quoted the terms of their in tbe circumstances that I have mentioned-and I have already shown in what material particulars that plea differs from that witb wbicb criminal lawyers are familiar. The underlings were proThe offers were, therefore, ceeded against by way of information a criminal procedure; the principals by actiona civil ""proceeding. I leave that aspect of the case for the moment. I say that this tendency of those not represented by bonorable members on this side to speak, and think, in terms of price in matters of public morality is to be deprecated. There are some things too precious to be sold at any price, and too dear to be bought at any price. One of those things is the pure administration df the criminal law. After all, what bave tbese prime delinquents suffered ? It is true that the extraction of £500,000 from persons of this type of mind must have been a very painful major operation; but the average man asks"" What is it to part w it h half a million, when one lives in the serene atmosphere of many millions "" ? Verily, what is half a million in such circumstances? they were making a lot more. pertinent. In the phrase rendered i m mortal by the Treasurer, they havo "" dropped the l o o t "" ; but have they dropped all the loot? That is one of the points that arises, and it is germain to that portion of my motion that speaks of the safeguarding of the revenues of the Commonwealth. It is not unreasonable to suppose that these defendants have garnered into their already swollen coffers hundreds of thousands of pounds in excess of the money that, with penalties-and in some cases double and treble taxation-the y bave so reluctantly, in the first place, and so eagerly at last yielded up. The Attorney-General himself has supplied information and evidence, in this regard. In tbe speech to which I bave referred be statedHis Honour apparently had not considered the fact that Parliament had expressly conferred upon the Commissioner the power of assessing what may be properly described .as penalties to the extent of double tax. If treble tax is desired, proceedings -must be taken in court, and for a period limited to three years. This fact was pointed out to His Honour in the afternoon of yesterday. Double tax on £140,000 would be £280,000. which would mean a total sum of £420,000 claimable by the department, in addition to the £354,000 referred to. If one adds £420,000 to £354,000, one bas a much larger sum than that wbich, after all the Commonwealth prides itself on having collected from tbese defaulting taxpayers. doubt that, if tbe Government had not grown tired of receiving and rejecting offers in settlement, tbe defendants would bave offered still larger sums; but tbe parties reached tbe stage that is eventually arrived at by all bargainers. The Government began to wonder, as one does in playing a game of poker, looking at tbe faces of tbe other players, whether the defendants might be relied upon to go a little higher. One asks whether, if the Government bad put tbe matter to the test, theset gentlemen who were so eager to settle the case, might not have cheerfully gone up to the amount of £700,000 odd, which, according to tbe Attorney-General himself, there was pretty clear evidence, was due. ber w ill read on be w ill find that I spoke to the contrary. of tbe bonorable gentleman's speech before me; but I bave tried to do b i m f u l l justice in that regard. My recollection is that he said that there was evidence of that. Erom my knowledge of human nature, and tbe special knowledge that we have of tbese defendants, the inference is not only reasonable that tbese additional hundreds of thousands of pounds were due, but also that still further hundreds of thousands could justly have been collected from them. There are no similar cases; but ] submit that view as a reasonable inference from all tbe facts, and from our knowledge of cases perbaps remotely parallel. I have said that all. that tbese men bave been called on to do bas been in the nature of a more or less partial restitution of what belongs to the Commonwealth. Not only have we these proofs of successful acts of swindling, wbich have gone on since the Commonwealth taxation laws were first established, but I am reminded of an interjection made by the bonorable member for Melbourne ( D r . Maloney), wben tbe Attorney-General was speaking. Wben the Minister said that there was evidence of these frauds going back to 1915, the honourable member remarked, ""Yes, and much longer than that."" Tbe Attorney-General, without any attempt to score off tbe bonorable member, replied that federal income taxation was introduced only in 1915. \, Honourable There is not the slightest members on that side of tbe chamber, w i th less knowledge and not so good memories as tbe bonorable member for Melbourne, thought that tbe Attorney General bad scored at bis expense. The honourable member knew perfectly well, however, as I know, that for more than a quarter of a century these men have borne a name synonymous witb f r a ud and dishonest dealing in every department in which they have operated, either by themselves or through their agents.

69,Mr Latham (Kooyong,"Attorneyby thera. Originally, there was no evidence of fraud, but as the investigations proceeded, many suspicious facts were brought to light. Since 1924, the whole time of a very capable officer of the Taxation Department, Mr Birch, and from a later date, the time of another able oflicer, Mr Neale, has been devoted to an endeavour to disentangle the facts in relation to the business transactions of these persons, so far as it was necessary to do so for the purpose of ascertaining the full extent of their liability to Commonwealth income taxation. The position was extraordinarily complicated. One of the affidavits, which is available for perusal by honourable members, shows that it was necessary to make an examination into the financial affairs of 28 separate individuals, seven companies, and twelve partnerships, to endeavour to ascertain the exact amount of taxation which the Abrahams brothers should pay. It will therefore be realized that the investigations required a great deal of time and a high degree of skill. By 1924 the omcers of the department had satisfied themselves that serious frauds had occurred, but they considered that there was no evidence available upon which a definite charge could be laid, and that they were only at the beginning of their investigations. The honourable member for Batman asked, iu the course of his speech, how it happened that two of the principals were allowed to leave Australia. I have made inquiries into that matter from officers of the Taxation Department, and I am informed that in 1925 the solicitor for one of the brothers notified the Investigation Branch of the department that his client desired to travel abroad. He drew attention to a certain legislative provision was decided to exercise this new power, which enabled the Commissioner of Taxation to require a deposit on account of liability to taxation from persons who intended to leave the Commonwealth, and asked what sum should be deposited. The Commissioner fixed the amount at £150,000. At that time no charge had been laid against any of the brothers, and no facts were in the possession of the department which justified them in asking for any arrests to be made. But instructions were given to the Home and Territories Department, which controls the issue of passports, that a passport Mr Latham. was not to be granted to any of the brothers without the approval of the Taxation Department. By some means or other, two of the brothers succeeded in getting out of Australia, and their whereabouts bave not since been discovered. Honourable members will appreciate the difficulty which the officers have bad in dealing ' witb the case ou this account. The honourable member for Batman has said something about defendants standing in the dock to answer charges. The difficulty has been, and still is, to get the defendants into tbe dock, for no one knows where two of these persons are. It is all very well to talk about proceeding against individuals when thoy are available to be proceeded against, but there is no known means of presenting persons on a criminal in order charge except by putting them in tbe dock. Diligent inquiries bave been made to ascertain where tbese persons are, but, notwithstanding information which has been received from time to time that tbey are supposed to be here, there, or somewhere else, they have not been discovered. Tbe investigation into the affairs of these persons continued during 1925, 1926, and 1927, but no satisfactory evidence was obtained upon which tbe Commissioner of Taxation thought that be would be justified in proceeding. Accordingly, a conference of counsel engaged in tbe case, namely, Sir Edward Mitchell, K . C , Mr Owen Dixon, K . C , Mr Dixon Hearder, Mr Robertson, and Mr Gorman was held, with myself, to consider the matter. During the course of tbe investigations tbe Crimes Act bad been amended -in 1926-and power was provided for the law authorities to issue search warrants in such cases. It and to search eight houses or offices which were occupied by tbe defendants or their agents in Melbourne. As the honourable member for Batman bas pointed out, extreme steps had to be taken, and most drastic measures adopted, before tbe persons authorized to make the search were able to complete their investigations. parture of the two Abrahams brothers? might explain how they came to obtain passports.",30,Abrahams Prosecutions

72,Mr Let,"The Attorney-Generalthey left Australia without passports. It is believed that they went away as members of a crew. That is how it is usually done; but what really happened in this case is not known. I think it will be agreed that at this stage, at all events, tbe Government Avas not animated by any feeling of friendship towards tbese persons. Tbeir offices and private bouses were compulsorily and thoroughly searched. I was severely criticized for authorizing, in connection with the case, the search of a solicitor's office, but I conindividuals concerned, and' that there sidered that tbe interests of tbe public justified me in ordering that to be done. ""WbenI was approached by tbe LawI n stitute on this matter, I defended and justified my action. Tbe evidence obtained by means of tbese searches established definitely that there bad been a fraudulent understatement of income to a large amount; and also a fraudulent evasion of income taxation. At thc same time, the case was extremely complicated. The frauds were effected largely by means of tbe establishment of companies wbich were separate legal entities from tbeir shareholders or the Abrahams brothers, and were used as a means of obscuring the income of all tbe parties concerned. Very many of the acts done were not done by the individuals personally, but by some other person acting under a power of attorney. sheeting home of personal responsibility. Difficult questions of law were involved. One of tbese was whether the income of the companies wbich were formed was all to be regarded as being really the income of individuals. As a general rule, it would be impossible to establish the proposition that tbe income of a company was to be regarded as the income of an individual. The advice of counsel was taken on this matter, and it was decided to proceed upon tbe basis that tbe Abrahams brothers were to be charged income taxation in respect of all the income of tbe companies wbich they had formed. It was upon that basis that tbe Commissioner acted in all subsequent proceedings. element in the case, however, is that there is room for serious argument and doubt as to whether it would be held, if the point were contested in a court, that all those [150 ] companies could be regarded as agents for individual taxpayers. If that contention, were not upheld, a large portion of tbe claim wbich the Commissioner of Taxation has made upon tbe Abrahams brothers would disappear. Tbe question then arose as to the proper action to take to protect the public interest. Tbe considerations which weighed with the Government and with myself in advising it upon this matter, were, first, that there sbould be adequate punishment of all tbe should be a complete vindication of the law; secondly, that there sbould be a proper public exposure of all tbe persons concerned in tbe fraudulent transactions wbich bad occurred; and, thirdly, that the revenue should be protected. Tbese matters were considered by the five counsel whose names I bave mentioned, together witb tbe Crown Solicitor, the Solicitor-General, and myself. I advised tbe Government as to the general course to be pursued, though tbe multifarious details involved in carrying out that course were left to tbe Crown Solicitor and to counsel. Two courses were open. One was a prosecution for conspiracy under tbe Crimes Act, witb a penalty of three years' imprisonment or a fine of £300, together with prosecutions under tbe Income Tax Act. Tbe other was a prosecution under the Income Tax This made very difficult tbe Act only. I considered whether it was proper and possible, having regard to the public interests concerned and to all tbe circumstances, to prosecute upon a charge of conspiracy, wbich might result in the imprisonment of those concerned. In considering that various matters bad to be taken into account. Primarily, conspiracy to commit an offence is itself an offence, independent of whether' or not the offence is committed. Conspiracy consists in the agreement to commit an offence. I am not aware of any case where a charge of conspiracy bas been brought in which there has been evidence of the commission of tbe actual offence. It may be that there are such cases. I was perfectly prepared in this case to advise tbe An important Government to adopt both courses if I could see that there .was anything like a reasonable chance of success, and if tbe procedure was justifiable in the interests of the public and the vindication of tbe",31,Abrahams Prosecutions
73,Mr Latham,"It is presumed thatlaw. As was suggested by tbe bonorable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) there are various types of conspiracy wbicb bad to be considered in relation to this matter. There was no direct evidence of an actual -agreement among tbe three Abrahams brothers to break tbe law. Was there, then, sufficient indirect evidence of an agreement to justify submission of tbe case to a jury ? Under our system of jurisprudence it is tbe duty of the lished in the House of Commons and tbe Attorney-General, in tbe case of indictable offences, to determine whether there shall be a prosecution. He determines, upon a consideration of the facts, whether the legal evidence justifies tbe person concerned being placed upon trial. It is not as tbe bonorable member for Batman seemed to suggest, by citing Mr Justice Starke, for a jury to determine whether a person,should be tried upon a particular offence. That must be determined by the executive authority charged with the administration of the law. Had proceedings for conspiracy been taken it would have been necessary to see that there was evidence against each defendant of his implication in the agreement, wbicb would have been tbe foundation of the charge. It would bave been necessary to establish against each defendant-ba d we bad all tbe defendants, which we had not-tb e existence of a conspiracy by evidence admissible against bim, and not merely against bis brothers; also the fact that be was a party to that conspiracy. Tbe matter was carefully examined by counsel, by tbe Crown Solicitor, and by tbe Solicitor-General. honourable member for Batman stated that tbese opinions had not been laid upon tbe table of tbe House and made available for publication, and complained that I had relied on what I described as "" tbe universal practice of Parliament."" There are reasons wbicb should satisfy honourable members that the course suggested is not a sound one when the Commonwealth is a litigant. closure of counsel's advice would convey information to tbe opposing litigant while the court. It is desirable that tbe Commonwealth should be .in at least as good a position as any person in tbe community to obtain absolutely independent advice from the Bar of this country. Mr Latham. independent advice, in accordance witb tbe generally recognized rule, can be obtained only upon the understanding that it is treated as confidential. In the public interest counsel's advice cannot properly be disclosed. Tbat this is well recognized may be seen by reference to tbe recognized authorities on parliamentary procedure, May and Bonrinot, wbicb clearly state the principle estabCanadian Parliament. These matters were considered by counsel and by the officers of my department. I acted rightly in obtaining the best advice available, but I must bear responsibility for tbe action which I advised tbe Government to take. As tbe honourable member for Batman justly said, I cannot evade that responsibility. I bave never sought to evade it. I considered all tbe information available. There were the serious difficulties of proof to which I have referred, arising from the existence of companies wbicb are separate legal entities or individuals; many acts were done by persons acting under a power of attorney, and, therefore, could not be charged as the personal act, of the principal to the power of attorney. Conspiracy is a notoriously difficult charge to prove. Generally it is adopted only as a last resource. Wben it is impossible to charge a person successfully witb tbe commission of an actual offence, and where it is plain that there bas been a breach of tbe law, a conspiracy charge is sometimes laid, but it is a rare procedure. TheI n a conspiracy case what is evidence against "" A "" is not evidence against "" B "" and "" C."" In this case two of the three proposed accused were beyond tbe jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, aud it was impossible to stand them in the dock. It may be unfortunate, but that was so. That was tbe set of circumstances to wbich I bad to address myself. I bad to act at the time. I could Tbe disnot wait indefinitely on the chance that inquiries which were being made would some day prove successful, by locating the case was still before the whereabouts of the other two men. I was also influenced by tbe knowledge that a delay of many months might bave quite serious results. A f u l l examination of the documents would take many Tbat months. In saying that I am acting on information supplied to me, as I have not personally read the documents. It would have taken a still longer period before the prosecution could have been brought into the courts. One taxpayer, Alfred Abrahams, was here. Honourable members will recognize that, as the matter is still in a sense in the hands of the court, I labour under some difficulty in saying anything which may be used even now against the interests of the Commonwealth. But I am at liberty to say that the evidence of conspiracy-as distinct from fraud-agains t Alfred Abrahams was so particularly weak as to be almost negligible. There was no evidence upon which any responsible law officer could properly bave put the only available defendant upon his trial. I these legal considerations to the House, to give any ground for the suggestion that I bave any doubt as to what tbe facts were. I bave no moral doubt that there was a great and far-reaching conspiracy. prove the allegations by legal evidence against tbe only individual wbo could bave been made to answer the charge. An attempt to reach tbe other two brothers, wbo were tbe real principals in tbe matter, would have involved great delay, enormous expense, and tbe result would necessarily have been uncertain. When tbey were found, extradition proceedings would be necessary; and we do not know from which country they would have to be extradited. months, or even years, the matter might bave reached tbe stage of trial. In tbe meantime all other proceedings would have to be held up, awaiting tbe termination of tbe criminal proceedings. It is not tbe ordinary practice, and it would not be proper to proceed civilly against any person wbo is answerable to a criminal charge in relation to the same subject matter as that with wbicb tbe civil proceedings deal. Prosecution for conspiracy held tbe prospect of indefinite delay, and, in tbe meantime, there would bave been no way whereby tbe Commonwealth revenue could be protected. I submit to honourable members that that was a circumstance wbich it was proper for me to take into consideration, although the honourable member for Batman bas seen fit to suggest that in no circumstances sbould it bave entered into consideration. in addition to other lapses, the honourable gentleman bad lost money on tbe transaction. stood tbe bonorable member. Even though we bad searcbe'd safe deposits, and actually bad in our bands a tremendous sum of money in Commonwealth bonds, there was no legal method of obtaining anything on account of the liability as taxpayers if a conspiracy charge had been lodged. All civil proceedings would have had to wait for an indefinite period until tbe defendants were brought to Australia and duly charged. do not wish, in submitting I decided, therefore, that if there were any other means available to vindicate the law, to expose and punish tbe defendants, and to secure what was justly owing to the revenue of the Commonwealth, it would not, in tbe circumstances, be Tbe difficulty was to proper to institute proceedings for conspiracy on the remote chance of convicting only one of tbe principals, and of securing a sentence of imprisonment against him, witb an extreme penalty of £200 as an alternative to imprisonment. That conclusion was tbe result of the best and most earnest consideration that could be given to tbe case after obtaining advice in highly qualified quarters. It would, I am prepared to concede, be open toAfter many anybody else to come to a different conclusion. But my conclusion was as I bave stated. Tbe considerations which weighed in my mind were those wbicb I bave mentioned, and no others. There was, and is, no agreement not to prosecute for conspiracy. Tbe whole agreement is contained in tbe document which is available to bonorable members. An agreement not to prosecute for conspiracy would, itself, bave been an offence under tbe Commonwealth Crimes Act, which contains a special section dealing with compounding an offence against the Commonwealth law. I am at least sufficiently instructed in law not to render myself liable to a penalty of three years' imprisonment for doing what the honourable member for Batman bas practically suggested that I have in",32,Abrahams Prosecutions
74,Mr Brennan,"I did not. I said that,",34,Abrahams Prosecutions
75,Mr Latham,"Then I misundersubstance, or in effect, done. Nothing of the kind was done at all. With regard to conspiracy, the. question arose whether the acceptance of the offer would be a satisfactory means of vindicating the law, punishing the offenders and giving f u l l publicity to their frauds. Had there been no such offer, it would have been necessary to take the only other means afforded by law. The legislature bas dealt specifically with income tax offences, bas provided severe penalties for them, and bas laid down the procedure for enforcing penalties. It is important that bonorable members should understand precisely what Parliament has done in relation to income tax offences as evidenced in tbe legislation of the Commonwealth. The Income Tax Assessment Act of 1915 provided that tbe Commissioner might, in the case of a person understating his income, charge-an additional 10 per cent., which amount, if thought fit by the Commissioner, might be remitted. Section 60 of that Act reads:Any person who, with intention to defraud, in any return understates the .amount of any income, shall be guilty of an indictable offence. Penalty; £500 and au amount equal to treble the amount of income tax which would have been avoided if the income stated in the return had been accepted as the correct income. Section 61 reads:Any person, who, by any wilful act, default, or neglect, or by any fraud, art, or contrivance whatever, avoids or attempts to avoid assessment or taxation shall be guilty ' of an indictable offence. Penalty; £500 and treble the amount of tax payment whereof he has avoided or attempted to avoid. In both instances tbe offender would be tried before a jury because the offences are made indictable offences. provided. were tbe precise offences of wbich evidence was discovered in this case. In 1915 Parliament provided that offenders were to be tried before a jury. In 1918 the law was amended by extending tbe powers of tbe Commissioner to enable him to impose double taxation upon any person who failed to include any assessable income in his return, or included deductions to wbicb heijwas not entitled. It also provided that the Commissioner might remit tbe additional tax or any part thereof. Those provisions are contained iu section 59 of the consolidated act of 191.5-18. fraud "" included in that section ? vision a large discretion was vested in and a heavy responsibility imposed upon tbe Commissioner in the ad""ministration of taxation laws. At the same time the provisions relating to "" intention to defraud"" were left unchanged, except that section 61A, a new section, provided that a prosecution in respect of an offence against either two of the last preceding sections-wbic h I have already read-nia y be commenced atany time within three years after tbe commission of the offence. Accordingly, in respect of the last three years, offences involving fraud were to be prosecuted before a jury, and treble tax would be imposed. The power of the Commissioner to charge double tax was not an arbitrary power. He could only impose double tax when the facts warranted it. Tbe procedure then was to impose the extra tax upon the offending taxpayer, and if he were not content to pay it, tbe Commissioner would bave to sue for it and would bave to prove bis case. Honourable members will see that Parliament entrusted to the Commissioner large discretionary powers in determining tbe amount of penalty to be imposed for taxation offences. In 1922 tbe law was again altered, but tbe provision allowing tbe Commissioner to impose by way of penalty a discretionary amount up to double tax was retained. Sections 68 and 69 relating to offences involving fraud, were altered, and it was provided that sucb offences sbould no longer be indictable. Tbey were made simple offences. Tbat meant that income tax offences involving fraud wbich hitherto were tried before a jury were, instead, to take tbe form of actions for penalties. Tbat is tbe law as it stands to-day, and I bad to be guided by it wben considering what proceedings were to be taken. Trial by jury, when involved accounts are under tbe consideration of twelve men in a box, is not always a satisfactory method of dealing with taxation offences. I presume that that is one reason why the law was altered in 1922. Honourable members will, I hope, perceive the significance",34,Abrahams Prosecutions

I , bave already given to tbe House tbe names of the counsel employed by the Commonwealth, and some of them at least are known to every bonorable member as worthy representatives of tbe bar of Australia. Isi t likely that those gentlemen would have recommended the Commissioner of Taxation to enter into an agreement possessing the features which tbe honourable member for Batman has sought to attach to it? Surely ..be mere fact that those gentlemen were prepared to recommend the making of tbe agreement is in itself very strong Commonwealth.

99,Mr Latham,"I think tbe honorlaw Lad not been altered and tbe offences were still indictable, tbe procedure would have been different. Tbe agreement dated 26tb September, 1927, was drawn up by tbe Grown Solicitor, and was settled by counsel for the CommonAvealth. I did not see tbe agreement until after it was signed and completed. I cannot be expected to supervise all the details of my department; accordingly I left the details of this matter to the Crown Solicitor and counsel. The honourable member bas referred to that portion of tbe recital which set forth that the defendants were aged and in ill-health, and I agree to some extent with his comments thereon. HadI seen tbe draft of tbe document, I would not bave sanctioned a recital in those terms. Nevertheless, I must support my officers, and I recognize that tbe agreement was settled by the solicitors representing both sides. The penalty of £500)000 was arrived at as a round sum, wbicb appeared to be properly payable by way of taxation and penalty, and as not being excessive. If tbe proceedings bad been con tested it would have been necessary to prove intention to defraud in respect of every separate item and figure. would have been very difficult; indeed, it could not bave been accomplished in respect of all items. In regard to some, the defendants might have been able to prove that there'bad been a mistake, and in respect of others tbey might successfully have urged that there was no evidence of intent to defraud. Assuming everything in favour of tbe Commissioner-that bis view of the law was correct as to the propriety of regarding the income of the companies as income'of the individuals, and that there was intention to defraud in every error that could be discovered by an analysis of tbe accounts-the departmental officers calculated that he could under the powers conferred upon bim by tbe act, without goirig to court at all, have imposed taxes and penalties for tbe twelve material years amounting to £662,000. It was not possible to prove this claim in its entirety, but it was thought proper not to deal with the matter without full publicity, and for that reason tbe three yearsin respect of wbich prosecutions could be instituted under the Income Tax Assessment Act were made the subject of proceedings which came before the High Court. In view of all tbe circumstances-and bonorable members will realize that there were many relevant circumstances other than those referred to by the honourable member for Batman -it was decided to accept an undertaking by .the defendants''to pay £500,000, of which £200,000 was to be paid at once. Tbat money was to be applied to tbe payment of tax, tbe Commissioner's penalties, and any penalties wbicb might be imposed by tbe court. In tbe opinion of our advisors, tbe court was free to fix such penalties as it thought proper, and tbe Commissioner would be content to accept tbe balance of tbe £500,000 in satisfaction of his claims. Wben the eases came before tbe court, tbe defendants admitted all tbe facts alleged. Tbe judge expressly stated, and accepted the position, that there was no promise that tbe defendants would not be prosecuted for conspiracy. I think that tbe honourable member for Batman, in citing portions of tbe remarks of Hi3 r Honour, might bave read bis final observation upon this matter, given not in tlie course of argument upon a preliminary, Tbat view, but in his considered judgment, that there was no promise not to prosecu' for conspiracy. But I said that it was clearly implied. mission. Honourable members will recognize that it is necessary for me to set before tbem what actually occurred, and to make some comments upon it. Tbis necessity bas arisen from the course adopted by -the court in refusing to make an order, either for the plaintiff or tbe defendants, and adjourning tbe case sine die. At the same time. I hope that any comments I make will be consistent with the fullest respect for tbe judiciary. His Honour expressed the opinion, during the bearing of tbe case, that the penalties provided by tbe Income Tax Acts were extortionate -. It was at once said by counsel that that was a matter for Parliament and not for the judiciarv. I suggest that it is entirely for Parliament to say whether or not a treble tax is a proper penalty. In his",37,Abrahams Prosecutions

101,Mr Latham,"I welcome tbe adjudgment, His Honour said that the sum It will be seen that His Honour, -in tbe of £500,000 was ruinous and excessive, circumstances of tbe case, exercised his and that such an exaction was contrary judicial discretion by declining to give to law.

On-these facts, nobody could be certain of tbe proper amount of taxation payable. But1 proceed witb my account of the proceedings before the High Oourt. On the afternoon of tbe day upon wbich His Honour bad given judgment, Sir Edward Mitchell attended before tbe court, and pointed out that tbe action before it related only to a period of three years. He explained that tbe agreement related to twelve years' evasion of taxation, that tbe £354,000 that His Honour bad mentioned related only to three years, and that of that sum only £266,000 was in issue before the court, the £500,000 relating to twelve years. Tbis error was tbe foundation of the statement in tbe original judgment that the amount exacted was ruinous and excessive. I naturally bave difficulty in discussing tbe however, upon examination of the statejudgment of the court; but I ask the indulgence of honourable members to allow me to say that, in dealing with this matter, I did not consider whether that sum of £500,000 was ruinous or not. I was, I admit, not concerned with that aspect of tbe case, wben tbe defendants themselves were prepared to offer that sum. In fact, my mind never adverted to that matter; but, if it bad, I would have left the defendants to consider whether or not the amount tbey were paying was ruinous. Many persons have been ruined by breaches of tbe law. His Honour was, unfortunately, plainly in error as to the facts wben be gave bis judgment, upon tbe basis of wbicb so many comments bave been made. ber for Batman does not agree witb Mr ties; but it appears to be a well-estabJustice Starke in criticizing it as a ruinous payment. other view. him. I venture to agree absolutely. generally that what was pointed out to him affected only the amount. I suggest that the amount is very important, and is, indeed, an essential matter, as tbe foundation of a portion of the judgment originally given. His Honour said that tbe arrangement whereby the agreement was arrived at as to tbe penalties was objectionable in law, and, putting tbe matter shortly, was wrong. The statements made by the court raise some interesting considerations. If tbe court had held that tbe agreement was either beyond the power of the Commonwealth authorities, or was illegal because it was in breach of some definable principle of law, then, obviously, it would have been void and of no effect, and no penalties, ruinous or otherwise, would have been imposed by it on the defendants. Tbe court was at liberty to do what it thought proper. The position appears to be that the court's statement was based on the opinion that tbe agreement was valid; that it was objectionable, originally because it was thought to be excessive, and finally, because no sucb agreement should have been made, but tbe whole matter ought to have been left to the judiciary. It seems, ment made by His Honour in adjourning tbe case, that tbe court considered that the agreement was a valid one. It is a common practice for parties to arrive at an agreement that a judgment sbould be obtained in certain terms. Sucb an agreement does not bind the court. It is still left to the court to determine tbe propriety of giving a judgment for one party or the other. But tbe court does generally give judgment for one of the parties. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth a statute was passed which prohibited the compounding of penal actions by a common informer, and that statute is in force, certainly in Victoria, and possibly in other States of tbe Commonwealth. A common informer could not compound an action for penallished legal principle that tbe Crown is entitled to compound for sums due to tbe Crown recoverable on penal action. The law was not argued at all before His Honour, and, therefore, I have not tbe benefit of a discussion upon it, nor of a judgment of the court; but apparently tbe action taken by tbe court shows that the document stands as a valid agreement. The matter is now under, consideration as to whether it is necessary or desirable to take further proceedings for the purpose of clarifying the law. It -would appear that uo practical object is to be gained Vy",38,Abrahams Prosecutions

105,Mr Latham,"His Honour saidpursuing tlie matter further. The revenue has been adequately safeguarded, and the actions of the defendants have been fully exposed. Every man and woman in Australia is aware of the frauds committed. The defendants have suffered large penalties which, while fully punishing them for their offence, will act as a powerful deterrent upon any oue inclined to imitate them. Indeed, I understand that the action taken has already had a wholesome effect in that direction. I venture to suggest that, if the advisors of the Government had adopted any other course they would have laid themselves open to keen criticism. It would have been said that the Government had embarked upon long and expensive litigation with very doubtf u l results, in which there would be long delays, with little chance of a conviction, and relatively small advantage to the revenue. If that course had been followed, and it had subsequently been, revealed that the defendants had offered to admit the offences with which they werecharged, and to pay £500,000 to the revenue, there would have been a positive storm of criticism. It would have been said that the Government was guilty of vindictive conduct in pursuing tbese men,' that such a procedure would have been void of common sense, and regardless of the revenue and interests of the country. The action of the Government was taken after the fullest consideration., after obcourts for tbe present case.. Tbat is the taining tbe best advice obtainable, with a f u l l sense of responsibility, and witb tbe principles to which tbe bonorable member for Batman has alluded very clearly in mind. I ask the House to say that the allegations made in this motion are not supported, and to say, further, that the best and wisest course was adopted by tbe Government in circumstances which, I think honourable members will admit, were circumstances of very great difficulty. honourable member for Batmaa( Mr even to 1917, wheu officers of tbe departBrennan) served tbe public interest by raising this question in Parliament today, and bad bec-failed in this he would not have been doing bis duty by the people of Australia. There is a clear indictment running right through his speech. An issue bas been raised wbicb ought not to be evaded by tbe Attorney General, or by any other representative of tbe Government; but it has been evaded. There bas been spun around the whole question a cobweb of evasion andlegal jargon. Nevertheless, there stands out this one plain issue, which the Attorney-General has not answered, for tbe simple reason that be cannot do so. There were three persons in this country, known to tbe Government to be criminals, who have not been prosecuted, and whom no attempt bas beeu made to prosecute, under the criminal law. Arguments bave been submitted to show tbe difficulty of conducting a prosecution, but if difficulties were allowed to stand in the way 50 per cent, of tbe criminals now charged in our courts would never be prosecuted at all. In many cases the charges are not proved because of the difficulties in the way, but that is not a reason, for failing to prosecute. I put it to the Attorney-General that if tbase gentlemen had not come clown handsomely with £500,000, no amount of difficulty would have prevented tbem from being prosecuted. Tbe Attorney-General, in bis criticisms of Mr Justice Starke, said that there was no precedent for a judge not giving judgment, either for tbe defendant or f6r tbe plaintiff. Perbaps not, but I venture tbe opinion that there is no precedent in the records of tbe point that His Honour stressed. Tbe Attorney-General endeavoured to show that tbe judge was under a misapprehension. Let me emphasize this point to show the soundness of the opinion given by Mr Justice Starke. The judge never once wavered rigbt through tbe proceedings from tlie original stand which be took up that it was not within tbe province of the Government to usurp tbe powers and functions of the court. The Attorney General has admitted that tbese investigations go back to 1918, or ment first got on to the track ot the defendants because they made tbe initial blunder of tbeir career in testing tbe assessment of tbe Commissioner of Taxation. The Attorney-General further said that in 1924 they were satisfied that there",40,Abrahams Prosecutions
106,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [5.35],"Tbewas serious .fraud. They were satisfied in 1924 even before tbey saw tbe documents wbich subsequently came into their possession. Then two of tbe Abrahams, bo said, left tbe country by some means or. other. Tbat, I say, is one of tbe worse of tbe half-dozen evasions of which the Attorney-General bas been guilty to-day. One would imagine that we bad read nothing about the matter, and that tbe only person who knew anything concerning it was tbe Attorney-General. What was done in regard to tbe departure )f these men from Australia? Tbe omcers of the Taxation Department were satisfied iu 1924 that there was serious fraud. Yet in 1925 these men left Australia, although tbey bad at that time on tbeir track an officer of the department specially detailed to watch them. as I know. I was told that no officer bad been detailed to watch tbem. dictment even stronger, because, on tbe Attorney-General's own admission, the department was satisfied in 1924 that, there was serious fraud; yet no watch was put upon the men concerned. to watch hundreds of suspects if that course was generally followed. the departure of Emanuel Abrahams was circulated at that time. was true. We are trying to find out. able gentleman satisfied now that the man bas left Australia? Apparently """"ie cannot say whether the man has left tbe country, or where be is, but he can accept a plea of guilty from bim, and enter into an agreement witb bim. tleman will look at tbe agreement, be will see that it was entered into by an attorney for the defendant. Mr 'SCULLIN -The Attorney-General ought to know that no attorney can sign an agreement on behalf of any one until he has secured the authority of tbe person concerned. If there is a criminal action pending, and an attorney knows the whereabouts of the person charged, he can be dealt with in order to make him disclose that knowledge. Wbo is sheltering this man? Tbat is another matter which ought to be investigated. Writs were issued against tbe defendants, and pleas were entered by them. The defence was practically that tbey would plead guilty to anything with which they were charged. Tbe legal representatives of tbe Government say, in effect, "" We cannot find the defendants, but we can enter into an agreement with tbem."" How does tlie Attorney-General know that this precious agreement will ever be honoured? What proof has be that it will ever be carried out. of securities, and guarantees for tbe rest. honourable gentleman know that Emanuel Abrahams will not turn up and repudiate this agreement? to see him. opposite think that that is humorous, because every member who sits behind tbe Government knows that these men are criminals, and that there is no chance of their ever coming back and repudiating the agreement lest tbey should suffer the penalty of their offence. If tbey bad not come back, and no £200,000 bad been made available, an attempt would have been made by the Government to find and prosecute tbem. Just imagine the head of the legal department'of the Government saying that it was not advisable to pursue the defendants because it would be necessary to obtain their extradition, a course wbich would involve expense and delay. If some poor unfortunate person, probably as a result of bis circumstances and environment, committed a burglary, stealing, perhaps, only £10, he would be extradited from whatever country be may have fled to, uo matter what the time or expense involved. Tbe wheels of the law would be set in motion, and assistance of all the criminal investigation organizations of the world would, if necessary, be invoked for tbe purpose of bringing that person back to Australia.

He buttressed that argument witli the further plea that if ""the Government made available tbe opinions of counsel, it would give away its case to the other side. He said that litigation was still before tbe court. But is it? Is there any intention on tbe part of the Government to prosecute these persons on a criminal charge or to take any further action against tbem? I say quite definitely that there is not. Thus tbe argument of tbe Attorney General is specious. Tbe case has been taken out of the field of litigation by the signing of this agreement.

""Wby then sbould there be any difficulty in proving the facts in a law court? to prove, not fraud but conspiracy. point in a moment. It bas been said that the Abrahams brothers bave not been granted immunity from prosecution. It is true that no specific provision in the agreement grants sucb immunity, but it is unquestionably implied. On the statements of tbe investigation officer. Mr Birch, and the Attorney-General, to-day, these persons have defied and obstructed tbe department for years, and even went to the extent of forcing the officers of the Crown to blow up safes wbich contained their papers, when they could quite easily have banded over their keys. That shows tbe utter contempt and contumely witb wbich they have treated the department. It is a significant fact that immediately the Abrahams' books aud documents came into tbe possession of tbe Crown, tbe representatives of tbese law-breakers took steps to arrange terms of settlement. One of the terms of agreement is that immediately upon tbe completion of the agreement tbeir books and documents sbould be returned. In other words tbe Crown undertakes to return the only evidence it has upon which it could sustain a criminal charge. Does not that imply immunity from criminal prosecution?

Sir Edward Mitchell, during tbe discussion on this point, said, "" In tbe Income Tax Act there is no provision for imprisonment."" His Honour then pertinently observed, "" There is tbe Crimes Act."" I suggest to tbe Attorney-General that be might give consideration to another section of tbe Crimes Act, under Section 29B of the act reads Any person who imposes or endeavours to imupon the Commonwealth or any public authority under the Commonwealtli by any in writing, with a view to obtain money or any other benefit or advantage, shall be of an offence.

"" When His Honour said that it was a ruinous and extortionate penalty, counsel observed that the court was under a misapprehension, and that although the frauds complained of had extended over a period of twelve years, the Government was only being recouped for losses which had extended over three years. That shows quite definitely that the Government was dealing with these persons with kid gloves.

Tbe Attorney-General said to-day, in emphasis of this aspect of the case, that it would be difficult for tbe Crown to prove tbe offence. Wben that point was put to His Honour by Sir Edward Mitchell, Mr Justice Starke saidThat is not for the Attorney-General to decide. That is for the' jur y to decide.

Nevertheless that is what the Crown bas done. Apparently the Crown takes the view that it may do something wbicb a private individual may not do. Tbe Attorney General .also went on to emphasize that one reason wby tbe Crown bad decided not to prosecute was that it would take eighteen months to examine the documents. Supposeit would take eighteen months, is that a reason wby there sbould be no prosecution? Tbe evidence is clear on tbe point that tbese frauds date back at least twelve years. A zealous officer of the Taxation Department bad been working on tbese cases since 1918, and as the bonorable member for Batman bas shown, during tbe whole of that time be was treated witb contempt and contumely. He made one attempt after another to get evidence to justify a prosecution, and when the case had been prepared tbe Attorney-General, speaking for tbe Government, in effect said-""We will not prosecute, because it would take eighteen months to examine tbe documents."" The reason advanced by the Minister is, of course, too absurd for serious consideration. If it would take tbe departmental experts eighteen months to examine tbem, there would not be sufficient room, in the business premises of tbe firm to bold all the documents and books associated with these fraudulent practices. As I have said, it took ten -years to gather tbe eviissued under the Crimes Act for a search dence of fraud, and yet when this was in the possession of the Crowni t accepted £500,000 in settlement of its claims, and banded the books back to tbe firm. We have been told by one of the officers that when the first offer was made by Abrahams brothers it was declined, the departmental officer stating that before accepting the offer the department wished to make a hasty examination of the documents. Before there was time to make even that hasty examination, there came another offer of more money. The senior investigating officer, Mr Eobert James Birch, in a sworn statement concerning his inquiry into this case, saysMany returns were lodged fraudulently. traced. Still another was Albert AbraMany returns were made pursuant to a conhams, and tbe only information that could spiracy to defraud the Commonwealth and to did His Honour mean? evade provisions of the Income Tax Acts, and contrary to the provisions of the Crimes Act Books and documents were wilfuly concealed from me In 1917 Louis. Abrahams appealed in Western Australia against an assessment, and was unsuccessful. As a result of investigations in Western Australia, I formed the opinion tliat extensive frauds were being committed by Alfred, Emanuel, and Louis Abrahams. will observe that Mr Birch swears as to his belief that frauds were being committed by the persons mentioned. goes on to say that in 1925 be came to .Melbourne, paid a number of surprise visits to Abrahams brothers' premises and discovered certain documents not previously produced, because tbey bad been withheld from bim during bis former investigation. He added that other books seen on! former occasions bad since been mutilated. He stated further that while he was making these investigations be received a telephone message from the department instructing bim to return at once to the office, but suspecting a ruse, be refused to leave, and learned subsequently that no telephone instruction bad -been sent to bim from the department. Tbese were tbe methods which tbese people employed to prevent tbe investigations from being made. Mr Birch goes on to state that in 1925 Emanuel Abrahams, whom they were examining, became ill . As a result tbe examination was postponed, and Emanuel Abrahams surreptitiously left Australia. In August of last year a warrant was to be made; but tbe officers were obstructed in every possible way. Safes had to be blown open, as has been described, in order to make tbe investigation, tbe keys to tbe safes being held by tbe defendants. Mr Birch gives further evidence as to a number of fictitious shareholders in concerns controlled by this precious band. Among tbem was ""Henry Abrahams,"" who was described as a shareholder in several companies, for wbicb there were 30 separate banking accounts.

The indictment of tbe honourable member for Batman was totally misrepresented by tbe Attorney-General, who suggested that the honourable member for Batman wished the Abrahams brothers to be proceeded against in the police court, where tbe maximum penalty would be a fine of £200. was the inference to be drawn from tbe. remarks of the Attorney-General. aspect of tbe case at all. I was referring to a prosecution under section 66 of tbe Income Tax Assessment Act.

Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. journed for dinner I was referring to the point made by tbe honourable member for Batman that there was a glaring dis, tinction between tbe treatment meted out to tbe agents of the Abrahams brothers and that meted out to the principals themselves. The seven "" dummies"" were prosecuted for actions committed by them iu connection with tbese frauds. The marked difference between tbe treatment of those men and that of the Abrahams brothers was clearly demonstrated in the speech of tbe bonorable member for Batman. The Attorney-General questioned the accuracy . of tbe bonorable member's statement, and because tbe honourable member for Batman adhered to his legal interpretation as well as to bis common-sense deductions, he got into trouble with tbe Deputy Speaker, wbo was on the point of "" naming "" him. I wisb in passing to drive home a further point made by tbe honourable member for Batman, which tbe Attorney-General was at some pains to disprove, as to the differentiation in tbe treatment vf tbe Abrahams brothers and their "" dummies."" Even Alfred Abrahams, tbe only brother in Australia, and so the only one who could have appeared before the court, was not placed in the clock. But the seven "" dummies "" were. Tbey were subjected to the humiliation of appearing in tbe dock and pleading guilty to tbe charges levelled against them.

The honourable gentleman thereby indicated that the Government has again fallen down on its job. Why did the Government go to tbe court? It is interesting to read tbe statement of counsel briefed by tbe Commonwealth Government. The Judge asked why counsel came to him, since the Government bad entered into an agreement. Counsel said, "" We come to tbe court to obtain judgment in regard to the balance of the money which amounts to about £300,000."" Tbe question that naturally arises in tbe mind of tbe average person is that if there was no implied agreement that tbese people should escape from criminal prosecution, provided that tbey offered sufficiently attraccuted for conspiracy, that would have tive terms-and altogether three offers, the last reaching £500,000, were madewby did they agree to tbe maximum penalty that could be imposed on tbem under the income taxation law? In all probability the £500,000 offered is £200,000 iu excess of tbe maximum penalty provided. Were those men philanthropists, anxious to make a donation to the Commonwealth to help it over stringent times? Only one common-sense inference can be drawn. The Judge is accustomed to trying cases and sifting evidence, and be was not deceived. Nor will tbe public of Australia be deceived by any legal phraseology uttered by the Attorney-General in tbe endeavour to cloak the actions of the Government. The Abrahams brothers agreed to pay' tbe maximum penalty, and something in addition, merely because they saw looming in the future a criminal prosecution -and gaol. That was suggested by tbe Judge in the most unmistakable terms. The whole argument of tbe Attorney General stressed one thing. He said "" We would bave found it very difficult to prove a criminal charge."" What a weak case the honourable gentleman apparently considered the Crown had! I ask honourable members to go through the files dealing with the case, to read tbe sworn information of the officers of the department, and then ask themselves Honourable members should bear in mind, particularly, the fact that the moment that the department laid its hands on tlie books and documents the Abrahams brothers made an offer to settle, an offer which finally assumed thc enormous dimensions of £500,000.

Only by tbe tax evaders of this country, and there are a number of them. Tbis case is not an isolated one. Exposures bave been made previously of tax evaders receiving lenient treatment from the Government. If tbe Abrahams family escaped detection for twelve years there must be many othertax evaders still undetected.

Is this Government so afraid of a charge of vindictiveness? It did not seem so very much afraid of such a charge wben dealing witb tbe deportation cases. Becatise the men concerned were industrialists and belonged to tbe working class of Australia, because tbey were unable to find £500,000 to adjust matters, tbey were subjected to very harsh treatment by tbe Government. Wben an bonorable member of tbe Opposition interjected this afternoon, calling attention to tbe vast difference between the treatment meted out to those industrialists and to tbese self-confessed scoundrels, an honourable member on tbe Government sideI believe it was tbe bonorable member for Eawkner( Mr Maxwell), stigmatized tbe suggestion as an unworthy one.

V in dictiveness, indeed! We on this side are not alone in our views on this case; we are supported by the highest authority that can give an opinion on the'case, and that is the judge of the H i gh Court who heard it. We have the support also of a large section of the public, and the press of Australia. Let me quote what the Melbourne Age said on the 9th March last.

In conclusion, I would say that wben tbe A t torney-General attempted, to prove that Mr Justice Starke considered that tbe action of tbe Government was oppressive be endeavoured to mislead tbe public in regard to the attitude which the judge adopted. I repeat what I said earlier: The judge did say that tbe monetary penalties were extortionate, but he went on to suggest that the Abrahams brothers were willin g to pay those extortionate monetary penalties in order that they might be freed from a criminal prosecution .which would render them liable to be sent to gaol. Reading tbe two statements side by side, there is no suggestion that the judge considered tliat tbey were not being let off lightly. On the contrary he said in very definite language that they should have been prosecuted as criminals. He asked Sir Edward Mitchell why they had not been prosecuted criminally. I join with the bonorable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), in charging tbe Government with having taken a wrong action.

The honourable member for Yarra was amazed at tbe suggestion that eighteen montlis might be occupied in thoroughly sifting tbe mass, of documentary evidence relating to the case. If tbe bonorable member had experience of big law cases he would know that in some of tbem. tbe sifting of evidence takes much longer than eighteen months. I remind bim of tbe interminable chancery proceedings described by Dickens in Bleak House, and of modern litigation in wbicb counsel bave been engaged for years. It is not possible to employ 100 men to sift accounts relating to a single subject. Half a dozen men might be put on tbe job of collating and arranging the evidence, but finally the whole must be co-ordinated, condensed, and mastered by one brain. I have known two or three years to be occupied in preparing tbe evidence for an action at law. The criticism of tbe Attorney-General in this regard is not fair. This attack upon him is liable to be misunderstood by people outside Parliament wbo do not know his character or our high opinion of his integrity; they will be apt to think that be bas been trying to bide something of which be is ashamed, whereas we know that be bas been doing bis duty frankly and fearlessly.

If the two missing Abrahams' brothers return to Australia, and evidence is available wbich will justify a prosecution for conspiracy, tbey will be helped in tbeir defence by tbe attempt of bonorable members opposite toextract from the Attorney-General tbe that is now in the possession of the Crown. Not one bonorable member has the temerity to say that tbe Attorney-General has been other than thoroughly honest in this matter. No one on either side of the House will accuse bim of having acted improperly for tbe purpose of personal or indirect gain. Tbat being so, tbe administration of justice is not in danger while under his control. So far as bis exercise of discretion is concerned, I point out that he had no alternative, because tbe men escaped at a time when be bad no evidence that would justify bim in concluding that he could prosecute tbem successfully. Eveu to-day we are told there is no such evidence available. Tbe only avenue open to bim, therefore, was to get as much as possible back into tbe coffers of the Commonwealth. It is to bis credit that he took tbe action he did in that direction. He did not bide tbe agreement; be did not put it away in a departmental oflice drawer. On tbe contrary, be allowed tbe f u ll light of day to fall upon it by taking it before tbe court.

That tbe court did not pass judgment on it was not the fault of the Attorney-General. I think I bave clearly demonstrated that -tbroughout this case the Attorney-General has shown bis bona fides. I should like now to offer a few comments regarding tbe motive behind this motion. It was a wise move on the part of tbe Opposition to select a skilled controversialist like the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) to present its case. Possibly no other member of the Opposition could bave put it before the House more effectively. His object was to present it in sucb a manner as to suggest that he was acting witb perfect impartiality; that he was out to protect the fount of justice which was in danger from some unknown source, and to make it appear that the motion had been moved in a non-party spirit. Unfortunately for tbe Opposition, even tbe bonorable member's undoubted ability was not suflicient to make tbe effort successful. . His colleagues did not loyally assist him to carry out his object, and at one stage one of evidence tbem interjected, "" Tbis is a nice weapon to use at tbe next election."" ber name tbe interjector ? some politicians are-ho w their spine quivers when an election looms in viewthe bonorable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), in inviting us to support the motion, reminded the House that there was a growing opinion in tbe press and on tbe part of tbe public in favour of tbe view wbich he was then expressing, and that. we ought, therefore, to be very caref u l bow we acted. The honourable member let tbe cat out of the bag. If public opinion is being promoted along wrong lines by means of untruths and the misrepresentation of facts, we must face the situation bravely, and correct tbe wrong impression. Honourable members on this side are not weak-kneed enough to endorse this attempt to besmirch for political purposes tbe character of a man whom we all honour. Those wbo ask us to agree to this motion to condemn tbe Attorney-General, knowing in tbeir hearts that be bas done tbe right thing, are not fit to be the representatives of tbe people. ever bad my opinion of tbe Attorney General' may be, however poor my opinion of him and his administration,' I never thought that it would become necessary for bim to seek the assistance of sucb a miserable apologist as tbe honourable member for Barton( Mr Ley).

Let me read what be saidI t is plain, on this material . . . . that the defendants operated together, and possibly with others, systematically to defraud the Commonwealth. The bonorable member for Barton would have us believe that Mr Justice Starke made no sucb definite statement. Tbe question involved is not merely one of individuals; but whether it is possible in this country, at this stage in our development, for certain favoured persons systematically, year after year, to act in defiance of the criminal code and to purchase immunity from punishment. By its action the Government bas answered that question in tbe affirmative. Among its supporters are men who, by tbeir 1 interjections, bave shown that tbey place the interests of the Treasury before the principles of equity and justice.. Tbey have made it clear that, in tbeir opinion, because the public treasury needsI should like to make it cash, men witb money wbo offend against tbe law sbould be allowed to buy themselves out of tbe penitentiary. According to them, no man wbo bas money enough to keep outside of prison need be detained behind prison walls. Let us for a moment consider tbe individuals concerned in this case. The members of the Abrahams family are not. unknown to the public. On the contrary, tbey bave bad a long and notorious career in Victoria. Tbeir record, not for ten, twenty or even 30 years, but for 40 years is known to tbe public. Eor 40 years the members of tbe Abrahams family bave bad widespread publicity; and that publicity bas always been in Nothing connection witb something dirty, contemptible and fraudulent.

There is hardly a crime of wbicb memI ask bers of that family bave not been suspected or accused, and in some cases, found guilty.

Proceedings were stopped, and then ""Poor devil! Poor Louis is sick. Suspend the investigations if they inflict physical and mental suffering upon him. It does not matter if he has robbed the country of over £500,000."" Then Louis disappeared overseas. In this case, I point out, there is no Gabriel. Probably you, Mr Speaker, like myself, have travelled fairly extensively over Australia, and have been surprised at the effectiveness of the intelligence system health. Nobody seemed curious to know of the Federal Taxation Department. It seems to have the all-seeing eye of God, so far as ordinary small taxpayers are concerned. It seems to have the very claws of the Devil with which to reach out for such men; and to have even the power to read their innermost thoughts. From day to day, one hears of somebody trying to escape from his obligations; but whether he goes to Cairns or Fremantle, in his attempt to elude the department by leaving the country, he finds an oflicial connection with this and certain land tax at his heels. With untiring zeal, the department traces the offender, compels him to face his obligations, and incidentally causes him to lose his passage money. But, in the case of Louis Abrahams, or Kidman, or others of that ilk, a diftice Starke bas said, for years tbe Abrahams have evaded the law. Tbey should have been prosecuted; but tbey were not. What that learned judge remarked in connection witb this case, Judge Edwards said about Kidman, another of tbe clique of enormously wealthy persons wbo were able to stifle tbe department's inquiries and make the law a dead letter. Tbey could go abroad without paying their income tax, and tbey could remain out -jf tbe country if tbey wished to do so. By and by Emanuel said ""I, too, feel very sick. I am suffering in body and mind."" And so, again, the departments suspended its investigation. The next it learned, apparently, concerning Emanuel was that he also bad gone overseas. Then Alfred refused to disclose tbe books, and again an officer recorded that by devious means this family was defeating tbe processes of the law. Gabriel, who was said to have been guilty of taking a gift of £650, was suspended! sbould like to ask, was not the evidence produced in connection witb that case, in wbich tbe officer appeared in bis own defence? Mr Anstey. these rieoole, and was told to report from timeto time. He said that be did, but the department replied, in effect, "" The liar. He did not report."" A special watchman was appointed to do nothing more than report tbe movements of these persons; but, apparently, wben tbe Abrahams brothers disappeared, nobody asked where tbe sick men bad gone. There was no inquiry concerning the state of their when tbey could be expected to be convalescent, so that the investigations might be resumed. If a report was made, it waa suppressed. Tbis is one of tbe most scandalous affairs that bas ever come under public attention in this country, not merely because of tbe doings of tbe individuals concerned in it, but also because, following upon what transpired in disclosures, the Government bas apparently laid down tbe dictum that men witb enormous wealth can purchase immunity from the operation of the law. Tbe Government bas said, through its Attorney-General, ""We bad no assurance that we could prove conspiracy."" It bad ample proof. If there was any doubt about tbe matter, tbe Abrahams brothers, of course, were entitled to tbe benefit of the doubt. If there was any likelihood-of their escaping the operation of the law it was blackmail on tbe part of tbe Government to take any money from tbem at all. But tbe fact is that from 1915 up to tbe present time, tbe amount of taxes for wbicb tbey bave fleeced tbe country, together witb tbe penalties that they bave escaped, is not less than £1,000,000. Tbe Government bas compromised with them by accepting £500,000! Whether tbe compromise is £500,000 or 5s., the Government bas compounded a felony. That view is confirmed not only by daily newspapers that bave investigated tbe case, but also by men wbo have' responsibilities connected with the High Court, and bave no association with tbe Government.

I shall follow tbe example of the honourable member in one respect, and that is by endeavouring to be as brief as possible in my remarks. Tbe speech made by tbe Attorney-General this afternoon, and, if I me upon it. may say so, the remarks by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) also, covered the whole field adequately, and anything that other bonorable members could say would be largely recapitulation ; but I sbould like to refer to certain respect. If there is any truth in tbe asserstatements that have been made, and to note, some differences in the methods of attack from the other side of the House. For instance, the honourable member for Batman said that tbe Government bad omitted to safeguard the revenue, and had taken too little from the Abrahams family. "" Have they,"" he asked, "" got all tbe loot?"" The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), on the other band, said that tbe Government had insisted upon payment of tbe maximum penalty, and something over. Apparently, he followed the lead given bim in tbe judgment of His Honour Mr Justice Starke, of whose views I wish to speak witb all deference. bonorable member has not followed tbe argument on that point. down the quotation from the bonorable member's speech as he made it. I was interested in his reference to tbe ""loot,"" because we bave beard so often of that word, and I think that I bave quoted tbe honourable member correctly. It is quite The partiality natural that there should be a variation of opinion on this matter, because of tbe different judgments given by Mr Justice Starke in view of bis different knowledge of tbe circumstances at different times. As I listened to tbe honourable member for Yarra, my mind went back four or five years to tbe long debates-whil e we were sitting in Melbourne-concernin g alleged concessions to rich taxpayers. I remembered the appointment of a royal commission to consider that matter, and I recalled tbe decision arrived at on the charges then Some of his references made by tbe honourable member I recollected also the statements made concernwbicb tbe Opposition thought would serve a useful purpose at tbe last election. I , personally, derived the greatest satisfaction from questions addressed to me on the hustings on that subject, because I found that I knew rather more about it than those wbo questioned Something has been said about one law for the rich and another for the poor. I am certain that those making that statement do not suggest that our judges are in any way open to criticism in that tion, then, so far as Australia is concerned, tbe law certainly bas a leaning in favour of tbe poor. In a country in wbich only one taxpayer in 30 pays direct Commonwealth taxation, surely there cannot be any suggestion that tbe law runs against the poor. I have frequently seen poor persons who could not afford to put down the money which tbey were called upon to pay, exempted from payment by the court until such time .as they should be able to do so. There is no truth in tbe assertion that in this country the law gives a greater advantage to tbe rich than to tbe poor; if it has any leaning to either side, it leans towards the poor. I dp not approach the question under discussion to-night as a lawyer. I do not know that I could do so adequately, even were I to try. As tbe bonorable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) has said, "" I bave not the f u l l facts, inasmuch",57,Abrahams Prosecutions

He was advised by tbe Commissioner of Taxation, the Crown Law officers, and five counsel wbo are known throughout Australia as leading members of tbe Victorian bar.

But what did Mr Owen Dixon sav on tbe subject? in a position to tell tbe honourable member. that matter. quote what Mr Owen Dixon said, because I have not tbe opinion, nor bas the honourable member for Batman. I make no complaint on that score. Wben tbe Attorney-General says that be took this action on the advice of five leading counsel, I accept his word, and I do not need tbe production of the papers to be better assured on 'the point. In any case, in the bracing tbe blowing-in of safes appear last resort tbe matter went to Cabinet, and I shall say a word on that point before I conclude. The advice of all tbese persons was that a certain course of action should be taken, and it was taken. What other attitude could the Attorney General bave taken up? If a criminal prosecution had been instituted, and failed, does any one suggest that tbe delay had brought under my notice a case in wbich would have been occasioned would have been of any benefit to Australia? I think that I am rigbt in saying that no property could bave been seized while that prosecution was in progress. It bas already been emphasized that it would probably bave taken a very long time to bring proceedings of that sort to an end. Of course, in a matter like this the Attorney-General must take tbe responsibility, and on this occasion he is not shirking it ; but he would have put himself in a position which required considerable justification, if be bad taken a course of action which was directly opposed to that which be was Sir Edward advised by counsel to take. In Australia the man at the helm. Every one professes to know much about these matters. I confess that I am not in possession of all the facts in tbe Abrahams case-n o one is-bu t a perusal of tbe newspapers shows that some of tbem bave reached definite conclusions iu some cases, I think, upon insufficient information. If the Attorney-General had done other than what he did there would have been just as much outcry fro m tbe ( other side as there bas been because of the action he has taken. It would bave been said that be was foolish: that be had a very vague chance of succeeding in a .prosecution, and yet had gone on witb it and lost everything. Tbat point would bave been particularly emphasized, because we know that the bulk of tbe money wbicb appears to be due was recoverable through tbe course of action taken. A great many speakers appear to bave overlooked tbe fact that it is due to the vigilance and skill of tbe Taxation Department, and also of tbe Crown Law Officers, that the matter has gone as far as it bas. Witb considerable difficulty, I suppose, aud at any rate, after tbe most careful thought, they embarked on what bave been described as kid-glove methods, thougb methods emto me to be fairly drastic. I need hardly repeat what bas already been emphasized -tba t tbe Attorney-General need not have brought this action against the Abrahams brothers because a penalty' could bave been applied by tbe Commissioner of Taxation without any hearing.

The whole crux of tbe position is that in a case of this kind, where so many intricate ancl involved details are concerned, the final decision must be left to tbe man at the helm, who in this case is a good man aud he should be trusted. Tbe Government bas not adequately answered tbe case stated by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), and supported by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin). Tbe bonorable member for Barton( Mr Ley) bas misunderstood the motion if be thinks that it is directed against the Attorney-General personally. Its language is plain. It certainly impugns the Government, not on the ground that Ministers individually have been dishonest in tbe Abrahams case, but because, in tbeir capacity as administrators, tbey bave not aijted properly. The motion challenges the action of the Government in regard to certain notorious income tax evasions, known as tbe Abrahams case, tbe histor-v of which discloses improper and unpredecented bargaining on the part of the Government witb self-confessed malefactors. charge made by tbe bonorable member for Batman, wbose charge has not been answered. The Attorney-General went to some pains to traverse tbe history of tbe case. He endeavoured to give tbe impression that there wasi'not sufficieut ground to sustain a charge of conspiracy. But the honourable member for Barton went further. He said that there a conviction for conspiracy. Tbe bonorvariance witb that of Mr Justice Starke, Without flattering tbe Atwbo said that tbese persons bad conspired together systematically to defraud tbe Commonwealth. He further made the remark that there bad been a widespread conspiracy. A justice of tbe High Court does not lightly make a comment of that sort. There must have been in his mind the strongest possible justification for tbe statement be made. Yet bonorable memI bers on tbe Government side bave endeavoured to make light of the offence of been related by tbe honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey). I bave not heard tbe bonorable member's story of tbeir career challenged from tbe opposite side of tbe chamber. Apparently, for a long period tlie Abrahams have been engaged in nefarious practices, and especially in offences against the Commonwealth law. Tbeir history must have been known to the Commonwealth authorities. Of course, it was known to the income tax officers. Tbey bad been engaged in investigating the malpractices of the Abrahams family. It must also bave been known to tbe Attorney-General, and, no doubt, to the whole Cabinet. Yet, knowing the real character of tbese delinquents, the Government entered into a gentleman's agreement witb them. The Attorney-General did not answer tbe charges made by the bonorable member for Batman in regard to th?.t agreement; he carefully avoided tbem. The honourable member for Batman pointed to one or two significant features of this agreement. He showed that provision was made in it that persons, wbo were not parties to tbe agreement sliould plead guilty to certain grave offences with which they would subsequently be charged. He showed also that the agreement was Tbat is the gravamen of the made with other parties who themselves were self-confessed criminals. The Attorney-General avoided the principal charges and contented himself witb quibbling upon other less significant points. Tbe High Court justice who reviewed this documert made some very caustic comments on it, and tbe Attorney-General was not able to explain tbem away. Tbe judge said that tbe agreement trespassed",59,Abrahams Prosecutions
205,Mr Theodoee (Dalley) [9.25],"on the province of the judiciary. That was a very severe censure. The judge continued"" And the arrangement is contrary to the policy and plain intention of the Act."" I suppose there is no one more competent to express an opinion on Commonwealth law than a justice of the High Court, and one of them makes that severe commentary on the action of the A ttorney-Gener al. never had a decision reversed? not been reversed. The fact that a High Court judge may have had a decision reversed, is no ground for refusing to accept a decision or a comment he may subsequently make. If we adopted tbe doctrine that a judge's opinion in sucb circumstances is no longer of any value, we should bave to amend tbe whole system of our judiciary, and provide for the removal of judges whenever their decisions were reversed. Can the honourable member inform me whether this judge has bad a ruling reversed by tbe Full Court? Tbe bonorable gentleman remains silent. I do not pretend to have any special knowledge of the legal complexities of tbe present case, but this is the position as it appears to me, after having listened to tbe Attorney-General last week aud again this afternoon:. This is not by any means an ordinary case of evasion of income tax law. It is not a case in wbicb there have been evasions arising from bona fide mistakes; nor is it a case in whicli there has been anything in the nature of an ordinary attempt at avoidance of income tax liabilities. Asa matter of fact, what is involved is a widespread conspiracy to defraud, and indulgence in corrupt practices, and the persons wbo bave been guilty of tbese heinous offences, not once but upon many occasions over a period of years, are tbe parties with whom tbe Attorney-General has entered into an agreement to let them off with a fine when they might bave been liable to fine and imprisonment. The Attorney-General recognizes tbe weakness of that part of his .case, because sel upon whose advice tbe Attorneyhe says in effect, "" We bad an opportunity of getting this fine, but we have given no assurance to tbe culprits of immunity from prosecution."" The Attorney-General would bave answered the case of the Opposition if he bad been able to give an assurance that bis department would zealously apply tbe law to these culprits as soon as tbey could be arrested, and action taken. But be has avoided-giving any such assurance. He could clear tbe matter up now. Let bim answer by way of interjection whether be intends to launch a criminal prosecution against tbe Abrahams brothers or any one of tbem, when it shall be practicable to do so. They should be prosecuted, because there is a strong case for a charge of conspiracy. They bave escaped entirely tbeir responsibility for the crime of conspiracy, which the High Court judge alleges against tbem, and wbich no one has seriously denied. Let us take tbe charge of conspiracy first. It is admitted from both sides of tbe House, that tbese men are probably guilty. Does tbe Attorney-General desire to sheet that charge home to them, -or are tbey to be exonerated from it, and tbeir offences condoned because tbey bave made a large money payment?

The question is, would a court of law accept the word of the Attorney-General, or any one else, who was depending for hia defence on documents which he would not produce ? It is a matter of producing in full the evidence to those who are charged with the task of examining the case. ral say that the Abrahams paid £500,000 to have a charge withdrawn when there was no case against them? a fact that in cases of crimes against the Commonwealth, persons are able to evade imprisonment by a money payment. If tbey have sumcient funds behind tbem they are able to escape the full punishment to wbicb tbey are liable. I believe that is the explanation of the present case. If it had been an ordinary taxpayer wbo bad faked his accounts and falsified bis balance-sheet, he would now be behind >rison bars. But because these persons ! lave millions of pounds behind tbem, and are able to buy themselves out of the responsibility of their crime, they can go scot-free, and are able freely to carry on negotiations witb tbe Attorney-GeneralI agree that it and enter into a gentleman's agreement with tbem. Tbe bonorable member for Barton justifies tbe action of the Attorney General in a manner different from that adopted by any one else who bas spoken from that side of the House. He applauds .the Attorney-General, not because of the justice he has shown, or because of his strict administration of the laws of the Commonwealth, but because of bis business acumen. Tbis is a new principle to be considered, a new qualification for tbe Minister who presides Commonwealth. He is to be a man of business acumen, and he is to come to tbe aid. of the Treasurer "" in a year like this."" Apparently in a year like this the Commonwealth Government is having a bad time financially. It might even be faced with a deficit, and, therefore, tbe Attorney-General is to be accounted very successful if be shows business acumen in tbe administration of justice, and comes to the aid of a necessitous Treasurer! useful man in Queensland a few years ago. Mi-. THEODORE -Yes, be would bave been very welcome there. I ask the Attorney-General whether he has considered the effect upon State revenue of his action in entering into this strange, inexplicable and mysterious agreement with the Abrahams brothers ? If these culprits bave been defrauding the Commonwealth revenues, there is a strong presumption that they bave also been defrauding tbe State revenues in those Statesi n wbich tbeir income are derived. We know that there exists an arrangement between tbe Commonwealth and States Commissioners of Taxation, whereby tbe departments' may exchange information to prevent conspiracy to defraud, and to detect evasions of tbe income tax law. In this case the evidence collected by the Commonwealth Government would, no doubt, be very material to tbe .State Income Tax Commissioner.

If the documents bave been returned, much of the evidence whicn would be vital to the States in establishing tlieir claim will not be available. These tax-evaders are not so discriminating that they will defraud only the Commonwealth, and not tbe State. Yet this agreement has been entered into without -consultation with the State crown law authorities or the State Income Tax Commissioner. I maintain that the charge of making an improper and unprecedented agreement with culprits wbo bave acted fraudulently bas been proved against the Government. There is convincing evidence that these persons conspired to defeat tbe laws of the Commonwealth, and that Ministers acted very improperly in entering into au agreement such as that wbicb has been laid upon tbe table of the library. motion readsTliat, in the opinion of this House, the action of the Government in regard to certain notorious income tax evasions known as "" the Abrahams cases,"" the history of which discloses improper and unprecedented bargaining on the part of the. Government w it h self-confessed malefactors, and grave failure to safeguard the revenues of tlie Commonwealth, is repugnant to right practice and out of harmony with correct and settled principles governing the administration of the criminal law. The honourable member for Batman( Mr General said that he was quite satisfied Brennan) bas practically challenged members of the legal fraternity on this side of the House to disagree with his statement of tbe case. The agreement, in connection witb tbe case under which these proceedings were taken, is dated the 26th September, 1927, and was entered into between tbe Abrahams brothers and the Commissioner of Taxation of tbe Commonwealth of Australia, under tbe powers conferred upon, bim by tbe Income Tax Assessment Act. Tbe punitive provisions of that act differ somewhat from those of the criminal law; but it is not my intention to take up the time of the House in discussing certain phases of this matter wbich have been very fully debated by tbe honourable member for Batman, who was answered by tbe Attorney-General( Mr Latham). In my opinion this agreement differs from others of a similar nature made by tbe Commissioner of Taxation under this section in three respects only: First, because of tbe magnitude of the sum involved; secondly, because of tbe complexity of tbe circumstances associated with tbe proceedings; and, thirdly, because the agreement was referred to the court. Tbe magnitude of tbe case must be apparent to every bonorable member, as no less than £750,000 is said by members opposite to be involved, and tbe amount wbich tbe Abrahams brothers have covenanted to pay approximates £500,000. We need refer only to some of tbe points which other speakers bave mentioned to realize tbe complex nature of tbe circumstances. No fewer than 2S persons are implicated and six or seven companies are involved, tbe partners in which total twelve. We can readily see that a case involving seven companies, in wbicb there are twelve partners, and in wbich 28 persons are implicated, made an investigation exceedingly difficult. any rate tbe number I have mentioned shows the complexity of the transactions which bad to be inquired into before the taxation officials could really obtain tbe evidence they desired.

237,Mr Hurry,"There may be; but atevidence of fraud of this nature, especially in cases where so many persons are involved. It has been said that, when the safes and strongrooms in the premises occupied by the Abrahams brothers were forced open, a room f u ll of documents was confiscated, and that it would take eighteen months to unravel the transr actions which those documents recorded. That is sufficient to show the complexity of the transactions. third point I mentioned was that this agreement differs from others, inasmuch as it was referred to the court for a-judgment. The Income Tax Assessment Act provides that the Commissioner of Taxation may enter into such agreements. That act was passed by this Parliament. also passed a Crimes Act. sioner of Taxation took action under the act which I have mentioned. This agreement contains a recital which is as follows :And whereas the Commissioner hus upon the recommendation of the counsel employed by him and the law officers of the Commonwealth decided to accept the hereinbefore recited offers of the taxpayers and to enter into and execute this indenture. That was done on the advice of probably the most eminent counsel obtainable in Australia. I think every one will admit that the bar which gave that advice could hardly have been strengthened. It consisted of Sir Edward Mitchell, KC., Mr Owen Dixon, K . C , Mr Dixon son. member know what advice they gave? ment was entered into in accordance with their advice. A good deal has been said concerning Mr Justice Starke's remarks at the bearing. In a transcript of the proceedings on tbe resumption of tbe court after lunch, when His Honour was referring to the various considerations which these barristers bad in mind wben tbey gave tbeir advice to the Attorney-General or tbe Commissioner of Taxation, Sir Edward Mitchell is made to sayMightI respectfully submit this view, that practising lawyer knows, it is very diffithese ferred to must have been present to the minds of counsel advising the Attorney General, and must have been present to the mind of the Attorney-General before he determined on certain action. Counsel here are [151] perfectly willing that Your Honour should see the opinion in writing which counsel for the Commissioner and the Attorney-General unanimously gave. These five eminent lawyers, supported by the Crown Law officers, considered all the facts before they came to a decision. Sir Edward Mitchell further saidI t was signed by all of them. I am quite willing that my learned friend should have a copy also and use it . so that Your Honour can see that nothing was overlooked and every. The thing was done in strict propriety. We do not desire that it should be published or that any one should see it except my learned friend, Mr Ham, and Your Honour. What could the Attorney-General do in such circumstances? He could not sift all the evidence, but had to arrange for that to be done by others before he made up his mind. The Attorney-General read tbe opinions which they expressed, and upon these he relied in arriving at bis decision. What could the Government do but enter into thisagreement? It is strictly within the law which Parliament passed giving the Commissioner of Taxation power to enter into such an arrangement. There must be dozens of cases in wbicb tbe Commissioner of Taxation has exercised tbese powers. same magnitude.

Tbe Crown Law authorities cannot prosecute all the defendants, because tbey are not bere to prosecute. As every matters which your Honour recult to prove conspiracy in some circumstances.

I regret that, owing to an arrangement made by tbe Prime Minister and .my leader to limit speeches, I was unable to take part in the debate on the motion submitted by tbe bonorable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), concerning tbe Abrahams income taxation frauds. I wisb now to say a few words on behalf of tbe Jewish race to which the Abrahams family belong. I feel certain that no decent Jewish man or woman in Australia bas any sympathy with tbe Abrahams brothers. I believe that, on tbe contrary, tbey take the view that justice would nave been done if the Abrahams had been more severely punished than they bave been. No race bas suffered so much as the Jews. It may be that the criminal tendencies of tbe Abrahams family are the result of generations of persecution of tbe Jewish people throughout tbe world, and tbeir greed bas been developed to sucb an extent that tbey bave become the most detested conspirators in Australia. I believe that if the diadem of glory wbicb history bas placed upon tbe memory of the sacred martyrs of old could be bestowed on a nation or a race, it might fittingly be bestowed on the Jewish people, for their demeanour in the face of bitter persecution. I bave it on tbe most, reliable authority that even since the signing of the Armistice, over 200,000 Jewish men, women and children bave been massacred in the various countries of Europe, principally in the Ukraine. I feel it incumbent on me to say a word for the Jewish people because, during tbe last Bowden, E. K . few months I bave heard repeatedly tbe Marr, C. W. C. statement, "" Ob, tbey are Jews, so what Cameron, D. can you expect?"" I believe that if the Eodgers, A. S. Crown had demanded £1,000,000 from the Perkins, J. A. Abrahams brothers for immunity from Seabrook,A. C. prosecution, the money would have been forthcoming, because it is understood that tbey are worth anything from £4,000,000 to £8,000,000.

The bonorable member must not discuss tbe motion that has jusf been disposed of. of a Jewish rabbi has suffered very mucb at tbe hands of these people, find that Mr Rintel nearly lost his life owing to an explosion of a gun wbich bad beev sold to him by tbe Abrahams brothers. I am sure, therefore, that there would bave been no regret amongst the Jewish people in Australia if the Abrahams had been punished much more severely. I understand, also, that it was competent for the Governments to seize tbe whole of tbeir property and hold it till tbey returned. I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister for Repatriation an important matter affecting totally disabled ex-soldiers. Recently the Government undertook to make provision for the transport of all seriously disabled soldiers, and tbe sum of £10 per month per man was set aside for that purpose. At that time. I pointed out that owing to the manner in wbich the instruction had been drafted, certain seriously incapacitated ex-soldiers would be debarred from participation in tbese benefits,' which were intended to apply only to soldiers, wbo were confined to a wheeled' chair or cot. ThoughI am a disabled ex-soldier myself my lot is not to be compared with ex-soldiers with double amputations, and I can assure bonorable members generally that it is impossible for tbem to appreciate fully bow soldiers in that plight feel tbeir disability. Tbe otber^ day I accompanied an ex-soldier witb a double amputation above tbe knee M the Repatriation Department in Sydney in order to put his case before the authorities. That man was able to get out of the car and move about on two little stumps 3 .or 4 inches in length. When in the prime of life he was a man 6 feet in height, but",65,Abrahams Prosecutions

The Deputy Commissioner for Repatriation in Sydney( Mr Barrett) informed me that the regulations which, I presume, had the approval of the Minister, precluded that man from participating in the benefits recently granted to totally incapacitated ex-soldiers. He was able to cross the pavement and reach his office without assistance. In other words, he couiu not receive the grant because be was not .confined to a wheeled chair or a cot. I ask honourable members to try to visualize that man, now only as high as my waist, whereas prior to bis disability be was over 6 feet in height. ance merely because, by his determination, be has adapted himself to these pegs, and is able to cross a pavement instead of being carried. There are three such disabled men in Sydney, two of whom have persevered witb these stumps, and are able to move about a little. The third has made no attempt to wear tbe Stumps, and be is the only one of the three receiving the allowance. I ask the Minister to give instructions to the Repatriation Commission that sucb men, witb double amputations, shall receive the allowance irrespective of tbeir endeavours to assist tbeir locomotion. I give tbe Government credit for granting the allowance; but I urge those in authority to insist that deserving cases shall receive it .

My excuse for bringing this matter forward is that I bave urged it previously in this chamber, on several occasions. I know that tbe Ministry is interested in extending civil aviation in Australia; but I regret that there has been little activity in that direction for some time. Last year a large amount of money was available for the purpose, and I hoped that this service would be instituted then. Wyndham is probably tbe most isolated post in Australia. At this time of the year it has a mail service only once every two months. Its residents feel that it would be helpful to tbem if tbeir area were affiliated witb Commonwealth territory. The Government would display a sympathetic spirit if it inaugurated this air service before the next wet season began.
