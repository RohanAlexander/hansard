The price of wheat below f.a.q. isfixed .by the State Government, but naturally such price is dependent upon the price fixed by the Australian Wheat Board for -f.a.q. wheat.

Isi t a fact that the Government refused to accept the recommendations of the Permanent Head and Public Service Commissioner, and called upon the latter to make another recommendation, giving as a reason for such action that nautical as well as adnrnis'trative experience was necessary for a proper discharge -of .the duties of tlie position? 5. Isi t correct that the officials occupying ^positions corresponding to that of the Director .[-56] of Navigation in a l l the great English-speaking countries, namely, in Great Britain, Canada, United States of America, and New Zealand, are none of them nautical men, or possessing any nautical experience? 6.

WOOL TOPS AGREEMENT . ister, upon noticeWhether the Government is prepared to allow to the Australian wool-growers in respect of the wool supplied to the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company under contract for the manufacturing of wool tops, the same share of profits in such wool as if it formed part of the wool sold to the Imperial Government? In Committee (Consideration resumed from l o t h A p r i l , vide page 1263): Clause7 agreed to. Clause S(1) The Commission shall consist of three members who shall be appointed by the G overnor-General. (2) A duly authenticated organization, recognised or acknowledged by the Minister as being a body representing returned soldiers throughout the Commonwealth, may submit to the Minister a list containing the names of not less than three persons from which the organization recommends that a selection be made of a person to be appointed as one of the Commissioners, and the Governor General may appoint a person selected from that list to be one of the Commissioners. glad to hear the Minister 3ay last night tliat there was no justification for the statement i u the press that persons had already been selected as members of the Commission, and I then expressed the hope that, those whose names had been mentioned would neither be prejudiced nor favoured thereby. has the right to a f a i r run. 2 provides that a duly authenticated organization recognised or acknowledged by the Minister as representing returned soldiers throughout the Commonwealth may submit to him the names of not less than three persons from which a selection is recommended of the person to be appointed Governor General may appoint as one of the Commissioners a person selected from that list. [56]2 tion should be recognised as the only body eligible to submit names. As I have already pointed out, the trade unions represent from 70 per cent, to 100 per cent, of the workers in the various trades that are organized, but the Victorian Government has never asked them to recommend persons for appointment to Wages Boards. Instead of that being done, a ballot of those employed in a trade has been taken, and there should be a ballot of the soldiers to ascertain the name of the person whom they would recommend for the position of Commissioner. Later, I shall move an amendment to that effect. I do not know -whether the Minister has given the reason for the appointment of a Commission of three members. I understand that originally pensions claims were dealt with by a Board of three, but that it was found more convenient to allow the Deputy Commissioner of Pensionsi n each' State to deal with the work, ancl that the determination of questions arising in connection with the granting of pensions has thus been considerably facilitated. A Commission of three members with a quorum of two would require the investigation of every case by at least two persons; and that would be likely to occupy more time than if the work were done by one person. I am informed that in Victoria alone pension cases are being dealt with now at the rate of about 1,000 a week. In New South Wales the number would be greater, and there are the other States as well. to war pensions? soldiers' pensions. The Minister may reply that very soon all cases w i ll have been dealt with, at any rate, so f a r as the initia l stages are concerned. But he Every applicant must be aware that in connection with Sub-clause old-age pensions and war pensions the review of cases has occupied a considerable time. It is unwise to depart from the salutary rule of allowing one man to deal with all minor cases. No doubt it is necessary that major and special cases should be dealt with by the Commission as a body, but if one member is able to a Commissioner, and the deal with minor cases and details the work w ill be expedited, and the soldiers w ill benefit accordingly.

This means, of course, that the Minister -will have to decide whether an organization is "" d u l y authenticated""; but my suggestion leaves it open to any organization throughout the Commonwealth to submit three names. Even supposing an organization represents only a fraction of the soldiers, what harm is done by allowing that organization to submit three names, seeing that the power or discretion of the Minister is not curtailed in any way? A wider latitude would be given and the possibility of any favouritism or political patronage prevented. Further, if my suggestion is accepted it w ill remove the necessity for a ballot, which, though in theoi y admirable, is a cumbersome and expensive method of arriving at a decision. Already there are too many elections in Australia. soldiers are scattered a l l over the Commaonwealth, and we can quite imagine -what it would mean to take a ballot »of all the returned soldiers from the far (north of Queensland to the remote limits of Western Australia. or nearly every soldier, is connected with some organization; and my suggestion opens the door to all, while, as 1 have .already said, the power or discretion of the Minister is not interfered with in any way.

I cannot help thinking, however, that it would be quite impracticable to take a ballot.

It would of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr .Mahon), for in this way we should have nominations from bodies representing all the returned soldiers.

The men are scattered all over Australia, working their way u p into the remote parts of Queensland, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory, and we all know the time and expense involved in organizing for a general election. Any Returned Soldiers Association is generally organized on a Federal basis, and is, therefore, able to make definite representations to the Government of the day.

Mi-. GROOM -We ought to be sure that the recommendations come from Organizations of weight. It would seem that the minds of the supporters of the clause are not big enough to realize that Australia is a very large place, and that it is necessary that the representation of the soldiers on this Commission should be as nearly perfect as possible. Unless proper representation of tbe men is secured, there must be much discontent. They are all strongminded men, who have seen something at the other side of the world, and they have now a larger conception of their position in the community. The amendment, in my opinion, would remove a cause of possible friction, and we realize that the men themselves must feel that the members of the .Commission are heart and soul with the repatriation cause. The success of the scheme depends on those who are made responsible for its administration, andfchey,of course, must be men in whom the soldiei's have every confidence. Even should there be dissatisfaction with the -personnel of the Commission, the men would have the consolation of knowing that they had had a voice in its selection if the amendment be adopted. I do not like the clause as it is at present, and either of the amendments approaches what I desire. my amendment in favour of the amendment suggested by the honoi able member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Mahon). Amendment, by leave, withdrawn, moveTliat the words ""A duly authenticated,"" -line 4, be left out, with a view to inserting in lieu thereof the word ""Any."" I also desire to move the omission of the words, ""recognised or acknowledged by the Minister as being a body."" I take it that the object of this clause is to secure that ithe soldier appointed upon the Commission shall be truly representative of the soldiers of Australia, and I think the amendment will attain that end. Any organization may make a recommendation. It is only a recommendation, after all, for the guidance of the Government; and, naturally, the organization which, in the opinion of the Minister for Repatriation, most truly represents the Soldiers will receive the greatest consideration. The Minister would attach more importance to the proposal of a large and influential Organization than to the recommendation of a body which may represent only a few returned men. diers' organizations might jointly recommend one man. better, but this amendment would secure that the appointed soldier, whoever he might be, and by whomever he might be recommended, would be representative of all the soldiers in Australia. I am inclined to vote against the whole clause. We have been informed by the Minister that the bulk of -the work has been already completed, and that the task of repatriation is well in hand. That being so, why create a new Commission? We have been told that the present body has done excellent work. What better work will the new Commission perform? Will it change ithe policy upon which the present Commission 'has based its efforts? I have been careful hitherto not to criticise the work of the Commission, realizing that it has faced a gigantic task. But I say now that the Commission has really done nothing very big or important. Week after week it has paid out sustenance money. In Sydney, I have often seen hundreds of men waiting to make their frequent and regular registrations, in order that they should not be deprived of the sustenance allowance. Had the Commission done something really big, had it subsidized municipal bodies, or even ' Government Departments, to carry out public works, and so provide employment for hundreds >>f returned men, it would have had a",24,Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill

I am prepared to assist any Commission to solve the problem of repatriating all our men; but what qualifications are the proposed new Commissioners to possess in order to secure appointment?

Let the present body carry on for the next twelve months or so, by which time, apparently, the work will have been established upon 'a permanent basis. Unless the Government can indicate the nature of the qualifications which it will seek in the new Commissioners loath to intervene, but must again ask the honourable member to confine himself to the amendment. portunity to discuss the principle contained in the clause as a whole. If returned men are to be consulted with respect to the appointments of the new Commission, those appointments should be made upon as broad a basis as possible. I hope the Government will not be guided merely by the recommendation of the largest body of returned soldiers, but will look first to the qualifications of the nominees. The sole fact that a nominee is a returned soldier -who has the confidence of the largest organization, should not be sufficient. SinceI have been ""closely in touch with very many returned soldiers, and am familiar with their immediate wants and future requirements, I am of opinion that the amendment will sufficiently meet their case as far as representation on the Commission is concerned. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has stated that he sees no reason why the present Commission, whicli has done such good and useful work, should not continue. I am satisfied that we are only now entering upon our grave responsibilities so far as concerns the securing in life of our returned soldiers. I am not so much concerned with those who have acquired technical and other education, because they are not placed in the same position of responsibility as returned men ivho are settling upon the land. It is very necessary, therefore, that the soldiers should be represented on the Commission 1 must, by some one who understands their immediate requirements in respect of land settlement. I have had occasion to visit two soldier settlements >in my electorate, and, although at present the men are more or less satisfied with their conditions, and are hopeful of their prospects, I am convinced that unless some person is appointed to the Commission who possesses an intimate knowledge of their needs, and a deep sympathy with them also, a great many of our soldier settlers will find it hard to carry on. They have set out in the hope that prosperity shortly awaits them. ""We all know that the amount of I am money at their disposal is limited. Unless the new Commission possesses very deep sympathy with and am intimate knowledge of the requirements of new settlers, I will take a later opI fear that failure must face many. It has been stated that in many instances land has been acquired at more than its true value. In my own electorate that has been the case, but adjustments are being made, and the soldier settlers expect that the reappraisements will satisfy them in regard to values. The areas, in most instances, are insufficient. During the past year, many settlers in my district have had to battle against one of the most appalling droughts in the history of Australia.",25,Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill

The question of the appointment of a Commissioner is not before the Committee. The question Hinder consideration is the omission of certain words relating to the class of returned soldiers who are to have a voice in the appointment of a Commissioner. The honourable member will have an 'Opportunity of dealing with the broad 'question after the amendment is disposed of and the clause is under consideration. tent myself by stating that I support the amendment of the honourable member for -Kalgoorlie ( Mr Mahon). my opinion, Iflie amendment will do nothing to alter the position as set out in the Bill. The proposal of the Leader of the Opposition. ( Mr Tudor), that all returned soldiers, irrespective of membership of organizations, should have a voice in the selection of the representative of the soldiers on the Commission, would -have had ;i considerable effect, but seeing -that it would entail a ballot, it is impracone body in New South Wales which is ticable. Otherwise I would agree with it. The present proposal is to give to -any small number of soldiers who form an organization, of returned soldiers the right to nominate a representative for the consideration of the Minister for Repatriation. Such a body might not have more than one member in. each .State, but nevertheless it would be an organization of returned soldiers, and, under tlie proposal of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Mahon). Would be entitled to submit a nomination to the Minister. Thus innumerable nominations might be submitted, representative or not representative, of returned soldiers, and possibly the whole thing might result in chaos; biit in any case it would not make a ha'porth of difference in the position. The amendment does not seek to take away the final right of the Minister for Repatriation to select the "" Commissioner who is to represent the returned soldiers, and it is obvious to every one that his selection will be made from one of the three nomineesI thought we were discussof the Returned .Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, which is the biggest organization of returned soldiers. The inclusion of the suggestion of the honorablemight be very useful to an honourable member oil the public platform, where he could say, "" I advocated that you should have an equal chance for your organization "" ; but such a statement would not be correct, because actually nothing of thesort will occur. The amendment will not really alter the position one iota. Therefore I oppose it. port the .amendment of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Mahon).. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) has given away the"" whole show,, because the underlying principle of the clause as it stands is that the 'Organization which the .Minister knows will give him the member of the Commission hedesires to appoint is the only body he will recognise.

If we restrict the area of selection, we shall possibly create a feeling of distrust among the great body of returned soldiers outside the Imperial League. We ought to demonstrate to the soldiers that they can have the utmost confidence in the Repatriation Commission; and, in order to do so, we should make provision that all soldiers shall nave a voice in the selection of the men who comprise it. Tliere is no danger in the proposal of the lionorable member for Kalgoorlie. If the Minister is afraid that some of the various organizations will recommend men who are incapable of carrying out the duties of Commissioner, the final selection lies in his hands, and he ca-n reject any nomination' he chooses. On the other hand, he ought to give all the returned soldiers, regardless of their polimen can go through the farce of nominattical opinions, an opportunity of having a voice in the selection of the men who are recommended 'to him for appointment.

89,Mr Anstey,"I simply rose to re-elected by the returned soldiers to represent them on the Commission without interference by the Minister or anybody else. I had intended prior to the speech made by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) to outline a further amendment which would give every returned sailor and soldier, quite independently of any organization, a voice in the selection of a member of the Repatriation Commission. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) has said that the proposition made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) is impracticable. I would remind him, however, that there are members of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers League living in the most remote parts of Australia, and that even if a selecnominations from which the Minister tion were made from nominations submitted by the League, ballot-papers would have to be sent to these men just as would be necessary if the men were allowed, a direct vote on the question. I should like sub-clause 2 to be so amended that it would readA selection sliall be made by tbe returned soldiers throughout the Commonwealth of a person to be appointed as one of the Commissioners and tlie Governor General shall appoint the person selected to be one of the Commissioners. That would do away with any final selection by the Minister for Repatriation. Eveni f the clause were amended as proposed by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Mahon) two or three men would be nominated by an organization, and from that number the Minister would make a final selection. That would not carry out in its entirety the promise made by the Prime Minister to our soldiers in France. soldiers wherever they may be shall have an opportunity to elect their own representative on the Commission. In a later part of the Bill it is provided that if any Commissioner proves himself unfitted for the task he may he displaced, so that we might safely make the amendment I have, suggested. I have listened with interest to the speeches made on this clause, and am pleased that the Minister in charge of the Bill has signified his willingness to accept the amendment proposed by. the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Mahon). I have been a prominent member of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League from its inception, and was for some time on the council. At first I felt that that organization should represent the returned men in the selection of a representative on the Commission ; but we must realize that there are a number of men outside that organization who should have a vote. The amendment as accepted by the Minister will give every returned man in Australia an opportunity to join with his brothers in nominating certain representatives. Every man will have a chance to vote on the question, because there is nothing to stop a man from joining the League or some other body, which could put forward would make a final, selection. The clause as proposed to be amended will carry out in its entirety the promise made by the Prime Minister that the men would be allowed to nominate their representative tin the Commission. I support the view put forward by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey), because during my long political experience I have found that Ministers are ready to interpret the word ""may"" in an Act of Parliament in a mandatory sense when it suits them to do so, while in other cases they will not. In a Bill providing for the salary of the GovernorGenerali t was set out that it ""may not exceed"" a certain sum. A. member of the Labour party was successful in securing the substitution of the word ""shall"" for the word "" may,"" with the result that later on when Lord Hopetoun, despite his splendid record, declared that the allowI desire that our sailors and ance of £10,000 per annum was insufficient, the little word "" shall"" prevented Australia being robbed of an additional £10,000 per annum for the Governor General. Under the clause as it stands the election of a representative of the soldiers on the Repatriation Commission would be as difficult as the election conducted for the Doge of Venice, in connection with which candidates went before nine different committees before a final selection was made. If an officer and a ranker were nominated, would the Governor General select the ranker? Amendment agreed to.",28,Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill

The. amendments accepted by the Minister have the effect of widening the provision to permit of any organization which may be representative of the whole of the soldiers submitting a list. Therefore, it w i l i be for the soldiers to make such arrangements as they may think proper for the purpose of the submission of names, much as is done in this Statei n connection with the appointment of Wages Boards. pointment of Wages Boards, all those connected with an industry, whether unionists or not, have a voice; but the clause as amended allows only the members ""of the recognised organizations to submit a list. ments which have been accepted permit of an organization being formed to represent the whole of the returned soldiers, and from its list of three names a selection will be made by the Minister. It has been suggested that we should provide that one of the three names so submitted shall be accepted by the' Minister. there are two objections. The first is that the recognised phraseology of an Act of Parliament concerning the actions of the Crown or of the Crown's representative is "" may,"" not "" s h a l l "" ; and, secondly, if we used the word "" s h a l l "" instead of "" may "" we should do away with the Government's responsibility for the selection, and it is desirable that the Minister shall be held responsible for these appointments. He ought to be accountable to Parliament for what he does in this matter. Every one knows, of course, that by an outside body it is the almost in variable rule of Governments to accepc that nomination. In this case three persons are to be nominated, one of whom may be selected, but the Government should be made responsible for the selection. Any Government which failed to accept a nomination such as is provided for would, of course, bring upon itself much trouble, and that is a thing that Governments seek to avoid. Consequently, they are only too glad to recognise the spirit of a provision such as this. In my opinion, the provision as amended gives effect to the promise of the Government, and is couched in proper phraseology, and members may rest assured that the nomination w ill , in accordance with well-established practice, be accepted. honourable member for Maribyrnong that he can move the omission of only so much of the sub-clause as has not been already dealt with by the Committee. my opportunity.

Effect ought to be given to the wishes of the returned soldiers in regard to this appointment. It is quite immaterial whether we say that the Governor General"" s h a l l "" or "" may"" appoint a Commissioner from among the men nominated by the soldiers, but we should ascertain what the majority of the soldiers desire, and give effect to it. I suppose this matter is not. likely to 'be re-opened, but if it is considered impracticable to take a ballot of all the returned soldiers throughout the Commonwealth, whether or not they are members of organizations-and I can hardly understand the fanatical adherence of honourable members opposite to the principle of preference to unionists in this matter-w e should, in the last resort, having got a number of nominees from the different organizations, create such machinery as will enable them to make a selection from amongst their number. The Governor General might then appoint such person to be a representative of rJie soldiers upon the Commission. tent for the organizations themselves to come to some agreement. may themselves agree upon one nominee, but if they do not-and I think it more than probable that they will not, because we know that there aTe political antagonisms amongst returned soldiers, as there arc amongst others-patronag e will ultimately rest with the Government. That was never intended. The intention was that this appointment by the soldiers should be real, and not fictitious. Therefore, I support the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), and the honorable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) in their efforts to secure a real choice by the returned soldiers, aud not merely a. nomination by the Government as to the particular organizations which shall berecognised. I do not think the returned soldiers are being given a square deal.

We have been told by the Minister that much of the repatriation work has already been finished. of employment and vocational training; and these depend on circumstances. stances will prove to be such that the men will soon get back into private occupations. I do not know what the salary of the Controller is to-day, but if he is to have increased responsibilities, and, therefore, increased pay, we ought to know The Cabinet must have made its mind up on the matter, for it is not one for the Department to determine. I trust that the very best men will be obtained for these positions, and we ought to know what they are to be paid. [2.19] I endorse the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), because, in my opinion, Parliament and the country have not had that information, which is their due. No doubt the initial stages of the repatriation scheme have been exceedingly important. We have been reminded by the Minister forRepatriation again and again that there, were no precedents to go on, and that entirely new ground had to be covered. Surely the initiation of a scheme of the kind, the laying down of a broad plan of operation, is as important as any subsequent part of the business can be; and we ought to know the why and wherefore of this special Commission. Clause 11, which deals with the powers and duties of the Commission, infers that the members will have a direct responsibility, inorable member for Wakefield ( Mr dependently of the Minister, in initiating expenditure of amounts not exceeding £5,000. That, of course, is a big responsibility. £1,500 a year. ought to know how far the principle of independence in this regard is to go, and I submit that we have not had sufficient information to satisfy the public or Parliament. I may say, indeed, that I have an open mind as to whether I should support the appointment of any Commission in the absence of more justification. It always seems to me that members of Parliament do not take notice of one salient fact. Mr Speaker receives £1,100, and is appointed only for the life of Parliament, or for so long as the party to which he belongs holds office. This officer, every three years, has to face the electors,, whereas appointments such as we now are considering are generally made for a longer term-in this instance, five yearsWhen Mr Denison Miller was appointed Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, the term was seven years, and that term was renewed by the Government when Parliament was in recess. Moreover, Mr Miller's relative, Mr K'irkpatrick, is getting possibly thousands out of those unfortunate repatriated soldiers. Not only that, for there is a combine which includesan insurance company, and it is time to consider the two questions together. I shall certainly not vote for this clause unless the amount of the remuneration is set forth. Had it not been for the fixing of a certain sum of money in the case of the Governor General, Lord Hopetoun would have been given £20,000 a year instead of £10,000, which is the salary of the present Governor General. This is not our money, but the money of the public; and it is only right that we should know how these officers are to be appointed, and how much they are to be paid. I am offering no factious opposition, but if the information I ask is not forthcoming, I shall be compelled to voteagainst the clause.

[2.38] I differ from honourable members who. contend that the financial responsibility of the Commission, namely, up to a sum of £5,000, is too wide. This factor has a close connection with the question of salary. If the Commissioners are to be wholly under the control of the M in ister, and may not expend even as much as £5,000 upon their own responsibility, Minwhat will be the use of paying them high salaries ? A first class clerk might as well be aippointed' to run the affairs of repatriation. I do not suggest that the Commission should have anything to dowith matters of policy, but that it should be given f u l l administrative powers. I hope its freedom of action, up to the disbursement of £5,000, will not be restricted. Unfortunately, Departments, and even Ministers, have a bad habit of evading their financial responsibilities through spending more than the authorized maximum by means of carrying, out works in sections. the same. we are not going to force the Commission to submit every littl e project to the M in ister. I repeat that if the powers of the Commission are to be almost entirely cut down, it will be absurd to pay high salaries. Naturally, the Commission should be bound to work upon the basis of the Government's policy; but tlie Commissioners might as well be paid £500 a year if their duties are to extend no further than those of glorified clerks.

Neither the work of land settlement nor the administration of the War Service Homes Act falls within the province of these Commissioners. They will simply be called upon to carry out that branch of repatriation work directly undertaken by the Commonwealth. If this means that at the end of three years we are to have two Pension Departments in Australia, this .Commission administering war pensions, and the Treasury administering invalid and old-age pensions, we sire again setting up that dual system of control to which so much objection has been raised in Australia. My proposal to limit the term of office of these Commissioners to three years will not prevent the Government from renewing their appointments. The work of repatriation is a matter which has been created by the war, and is of a temporary character. I hope that we shall not perpetuate any expenditure that we can get rid of. We have heard it repeated over and over again that, as soon as possible, all expenditure associated with war activities will cease. That is my reason for proposing to limit the period of the appointment of the Commissioners. 'The Minister has asked me how we can expect men to offer their services for such a limited term. That objection will not apply to Commissioners who are selected from members of the present Repatriation Staff, and as regards the gentlemen chosen from outside «* the Service, it will not be so much the terms of the appointment that will attract them as it will be a desire among the soldiers themselves to select men who can help to unravel their problems. No doubt the soldiers' organizations contain very brainy men, who will come forward at a salary of £1,000 a year to help to solve the problems of repatriation for their comrades. In any case, Parliament should show some evidence of a desire to get rid of war expenditure and of needless departments as quickly as possible. I want to see the work effectively carried out for the balance of the period of repatriation, and if I thought that my amendment would in any way limit the effectiveness^ of the Commissioners' operations, I would not move it. any term of office? to mem drawn from outside the Service, but in taking a forecast of repatriation work, I cannot conceive that in five years time there will still be need for active administration. There may be the work of the collection of loans advanced to soldiers, and there will be the matter of the administration of the War Pensions Act, but I object to the inauguration of a new Department to deal with a branch of the work which is likely to. outlive the other activities of repatriation, and which means the creation of two Pensions Departments, and two sets of officers to do work which one Department could effectively undertake.",36,Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill

The money so far expended on repatriation has been distributed, with good intentions, sometimes wisely and sometimes unwisely; but it is not going to be of any permanent benefit to the soldiers who have been assisted. system. would urge now, as I suggested some time ago to the Government of New South Wales, and later on to the Government of the Commonwealth, the adoption of a definite comprehensive scheme that would permit of the settlement of 50,000 or 75,000 soldiers in an area where already there are a certain number of homesteads, so that it would not be completely given over to soldier settlement. There occur to me immediately two suitable areas. One is in the Clarence and Richmond Rivers district, while another is in the southern part of New South Wales and the, northern part of Victoria. would' lend itself to such a proposition. In both cases power plant, could be installed by harnessing water very cheaply. Eighty per cent, of the area consists of Crown lands, so that there ought not to be much trouble about its resumption. If a power scheme were developed, we should be able to establish not merely settlements of returned soldiers, but secondary industries the honourable member to confine himself to the question before the Chair. the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wannon. am pleased that the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) has submitted this amendment, and that at least one member of the Country party has promised to support it. It is a fair and reasonable proposition, and, I think, will meet with the support of most membe'rs of the Opposition. We must not forget that this clause provides for the setting up of new administrative machinery. The Commission, under the amendment, will have three years to demonstrate its fitness for the work; and at the end of there can be no doubt that whatever Government is in power will re-appoint it for a further term. This House is elected for a period of only three years, and I think the amendment is a cautious provision to make. If it be agreed to, we shall be able lateT on to negative the clauses providing for the administration of the war pensions scheme by. the Repatriation Department. The InvalidI and Old-age Pensions Branch of the Treasury is undoubtedly the best in the Commonwealth, and it should not be superseded by an outside body in the administration of war pensions. [3.11] I shall support the amendment, since I am just as doubtful as I was previously as to the wisdom of appointing a Commission. Its success or otherwise must depend upon the developments of the immediate future. There are three sections ef repatriation work. In the first place, we have vocational training, which,, under ordinary conditions, should Each come to an end some five years hence. Then we have the war pensions section, and finally the section dealing with the building of homes. It is very doubtful whether the war pensions system could be better administered than it is by the Treasury at the present time We are not likely to have in the Repatriation Department men who will give greater satisfaction than have the Treasury officers who have been charged with the administration of the war pensions scheme up to date. vice side of the Department will extend over far more than five years. need a Commission to deal with the medical side? agree with the right honourable gentleman.

The Department has made up its mind that in Victoria it can do this work more effectively and more cheaply itself than by letting contracts. I am not in a position at the present moment to show that that is so; but I remind the Minister that things may change considerably. Under the present abnormal conditions, the Government may be justified in the course that it is taking in Victoria, but three or four years hence things may be very different. In South Australia, 500 homes have now been completed, and contracts have been let for another 500. I ask the Minister to send one of his officers to see what is being donethere under the contract system. If he does so, it will be found that the houses are cheaper and better built than those that are being put up in Victoria. The ceilings, instead of being 9 feet high, are nearer 12 feet. member is now going beyond the amendment. what the report will be if the Government sends a competent officer to South Australia. If the work is to be done by the Department, the best and most efficient .administrator is needed to supervise it, and such a man cannot be got for £1,500. Indeed, we could afford to pay £5,000 for the right man. the Minister whether the Commission is not to be responsible for this work ? make the term three years, instead of five years. [3.18] I am in favouirof the amendment. At the commencement of the repatriation activities, I urged the Minister to adopt the system which he is now adopting; but it seems to me to be rather late in the day to make these new proposals. The foundation work of repatriation has now been practically finished, and it has been carried out, so far as the Central Administration is concerned, by the Minister and his principal officer, who has been drawing a salary of only £900 a year. Nowi t is chiefly the finishing work that remains; yet for that is proposed the appointment of a Commission, consisting of a chairman, to receive £1,500 a year, and two others at £1,000 a year each; so that we shall be paying £3,500 for routine and supervisory work, which, as every one knows, is much easier than the laying down of foundational principles. sioners now, and the new Commissioners will take their place. sent Commissioners are honorary, and we have to pay only their expenses. the extra Minister for Repatriation. be needed for the present. My objection is that we are setting up quite unnecessarily a costly Department for which there is not sufficient work. Senator Millen has said over and over again in public that the business of getting the men back to their civil occupations is practically finished, and even if he had not said it , we ourselves would know that to-day there are comparatively few of the 300,000 soldiers who returned who are still looking for employment. Only some 25,000 men still remain to be repatriated. Yet it is at this stage that we are asked to authorize a very costly new system. Senator Millen and his officials have earned the thanks of the community for the efficient manner in which they have carried out the difficult work of organizing the Repatriation Department. The difficulties I ask of that work have been nearly surmounted, and what now remains to be done is .merely the amending of regulations, the extension of benefits, and mere routine capacity for organization that was needed in the early stages of repatriation. Therefore it seems to me that the proposal of the Returned Soldiers Association, which is what we are now considering-becaus e I am sure that if the Cabinet, unshackled by promises, could look only at the work of repatriation in its present stage, this proposal would not be before Parliament should go to Queensland. sentatives of each State must speak for that State.

There is, 'however, nothing in -the Bill .to .arm the Commissioners with power to interfere. If there were, there might be some justification for their appointment. I see no justification for the expenditure contemplated in the Bill, which is to extend over a period of five years. Personally, I do not -think that there -will be work for ,the Commissioners for a period of three years, unless the payment of pensions is handed 'over to them as an -excuse for the continuance of their office. The pensions work is now being done efficiently; fewer complaints come to us in regard to the Pensions Department than in regard to any other. But now, after probably 75 per cent, of the pensions work has been done, we are .asked to create a new staff to take over duties that are now being performed efficiently by other officers. That is not economical, aajd the change is not warranted by the facts of the case. No reason has been given why the present pensions arrangements should be disturbed in order to find work for these Commissioners, who otherwise will have very little to do.

The Executive must be responsible for everything that) is done by regulation. that the Commission shall, subject "" to the. control of the Minister,'' be charged with the administration of the Act. The idea is to vest in one body many powers which at present are scattered through various Departments.

As to the powers of the Commission, I should like to give some illustrations of where improvements could be made in .administration. settlers, particularly on the Yanko irrigation area, the Commonwealth Government make available to the State Government of New South Wales an amount equal to £625 for improvements, but the men are not allowed, to spend this We have' provided money as they like. They cannot buy the particular, class of farming implements which they think suitable, whereas civilian settlers on the same area, with the same grant from the State Government may purchase their implements at discretion. Then, again, as we know, men who intend to get married are given a furniture grant, but those who go on the land, and are also desirous of getting married, have to purchase the furniture out of the £625. given only £35 for furniture. sistance in the country, too. be purchased for that amount now. amount is better than nothing. Another source of complaint is that different rates of sustenance allowance are paid in town and in country. In the country only a small amount is allowed, on the principle, I believe, that the men who receive it are not so much under the supervision of the officials as are the men in the city. The absence of Local Committees to , supervise these men is no reason why not they should not be paid the same amount as are the men in the city. I can bear out what the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) has said in regard to the war service homes. I am sure that all who have seen the homes are convinced of the fine work the Commission is doing; but no honourable member has mentioned the most pleasing feature, namely, that every man employed in the building of such homes, in most centres, is a returned soldier who has been vocationally trained. That speaks volumes for the efficiency of training, and no doubt does much to overcome the difficulty of the shortage of labour. Despite the. explanation of the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom) I must support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor).

In spite of what the Minister for Works and Bailways( Mr Groom) has told us, I venture to say that, under this clause, the Commission will go much further in its activities than, perhaps, we are prepared to allow. The repatriation scheme extends into muuy branches of our national life, and as the Leader of. the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) has said, the Commission, under the powers proposed, might even build a railway, seeing that they have to find-employment.
