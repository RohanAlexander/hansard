Wednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMITfEE 5267 Wednesday, 12 May 1999 Second (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Airport Economics written by Mr Leon Warren, who is a member of a Campbelltown anti-airport group. Mr Warren is one of many residents of Western Sydney who have taken a keen interest in the government's proposals to build Sydney's second airport at Badgerys Creek. One of the important issues addressed in Mr Warren's book is the suggestion that employment growth will result as a consequence of the second airport. On page 37, Mr Warren refers to a forecasting model used to estimate employment growth set out in the draft environmental impact statement on the Badgerys Creek airport. In this model it is suggested that the range of employment growth identified in Australia and overseas studies is between 500 and 800 passengers per job for direct employment and between 400 and 700 passengers per job for indirect employment. Mr Warren, in reference to this modelling, said: The model in this case is subject to both airports in Sydney operating at their maximum capacity. The assumption suggests that employers increase their staffing levels automatically each time they exceed 400 or 800 parameters. It does not take into account improved productivity gains and increased workloads that would be borne by existing staff. Take banks, for instance, even though their profits and the gross national product has been rising, banks are shedding staff and closing branches allover Australia. Reference is made in this book to the general fall of employment in the aircraft industry. TheF AC annual report shows that in 1996-97 the total work force in this industry was 1,180 compared to the 1992-93 figure of 1,366. At the same time passengers per employee rose from 34,271 in 1992-93 to 51,316 in 1996-97. As to whether Badgerys Creek airport will generate a large number of jobs, we have only to look at the promise of jobs made in the EIS into the third runway. I quote from Mr Warren's book: The Department of Arts, Sports, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, in its environmental assessment report on the third runway, noted that an estimated 17,500 jobs could be generated in the airport subregion between 1995 and 2010 as a result of the operation of the new runway, with a further 27,000 jobs generated in the wider Sydney region. No attempt has been made to measure the employment impact of the third runway, but productivity gains and reduced employment numbers reported by the F AC and airlines would indicate that there has been no employment gains. I would like to congratulate Mr Warren on his important contribution to the Badgerys Creek airport debate and wish him and his organisation well in their future campaign.

250,Mr Cameron Thompson (Blair),"I want to address the committee on two meetings5268 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 12 May 1999 and various other local dignitaries, including Bernie Sutton, the mayor of Gatton Shire and the former Deputy Premier of Queensland, Bill Gunn. The reason for this meeting was anger at what is perceived to be the demise of the Gatton campus of the University of Queensland. This is an important facility. When it was taken into the University of Queensland, it was done on the understanding that a leading facility would be developed at Gatton-a facility that would lead Australian health and agricultural research into the next millennium. That, unfortunately, has not happened. What we see out there is growing concern at what is perceived to be the demise of the college. It seems that academics at St Lucia would like to see that University of Queensland involvement in agriculture and veterinary sciences consolidated into the St Lucia campus for their own academic ends. I do not think that is something that industry groups in agriculture and with veterinary concerns would support. I would like to see further support for the maintenance of the University of Queensland Gatton campus. It was a great relief to me last night to see the investment that the government is planning to make in relation to research into genetics. It seems that,· for example, the government understands what the university does not and that genetics is a revolution that is waiting to happen. We need a great deal of academic research and investment in that area. ""Since then there has been a meeting between representatives of the University of Queensland Gatton campus and the Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie. Unfortunately, there has not been entirely a positive outcome. People who are concerned about the needs of agricultural industries in Queensland have to stand up and come forward and speak to the Premier. I have certainly spoken to the federal education minister, Dr Kemp, and I believe there is growing concern in this regard. I would like to see more members speaking up because, without support for agricultural research, we will be doomed. (Time expired) Work for the Dole Scheme Ms HALL (Shortland)-This government has continually applauded its efforts in introducing a Work for the Dole Scheme. It is a scheme that has targeted the most vulnerable, unemployed youth in Australia and a scheme that the government has expanded in this year's budget. The government expanded the Work for the Dole program and it is now targeting unemployed Australians aged between 25 and 34 years-Australians who this government has failed, Australians who cannot find a job. It is a program that is penalising the victims of unemployment. Unlike the LEAP and Jobskills programs that Labor had in place, it does not provide any formal training. The people that are involved in the Work for the Dole program go away with nothing. They do not go away with any training that they will be able to take to another job. It is rather about the mutual obligation that these young unemployed Australians have to receive their money and not about assisting them to move from welfare to work. I have had a number of young people in my electorate come to see me about problems that they have been experiencing with Work for the Dole. There was a young girl who has put a lot of effort into retraining and preparing herself to enter the work force. She has undertaken secretarial and receptionist courses. She is working voluntarily for some agencies within the area, but she is not doing enough hours to satisfy the requirement that would prevent her from having to work for the dole, so she has been directed to do labouring work building a bridge. This is a young person who has used her initiative to train and prepare herself to enter the work force in her chosen field but, because of the program this government has in place, she Wednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 5269 is being forced to go out there, interrupt her preparation to enter the work force and build bridges. Another young person came to see me very recently. I might add that it was the parents of these young people that contacted my office because they were so angry about the way their children and young people were being treated. A young boy went along to a session where they talked about theWork for the Dole program and signed up for it. What he signed up for was a labouring program but he thought he had signed up for a marketing program. He did not tum up for the labouring program because he was going along for the marketing program in a week. He had his youth allowance stopped simply because it was not explained to him fully. Once again, it was the most vulnerable people in society being penalised. (Time expired) Capital Gains Tax Dr WASHER (Moore)-If you had to name one aspect of our tax system that will leave Australia on the starting blocks as we enter the new century while Qthers take advantage of exciting ages before us, it would have to be the level of capital gains tax in this country. Our current level of capital gains tax categorically ensures that Australia cannot compete with other countries when it comes to attracting the necessary venture capital. The fact that Australia has a wealth of intellectual assets in our scientists and researchers in areas such as health and agriculture and biotechnology makes this situation even more frustrating. It is time to follow the example of the US and the UK and significantly lower the rate of capital gains tax, particularly for R&D investments. Governments in these countries have recognised the need to remove tax disincentives, to invest in new companies and to create new and lasting job growth. Australia, in the words of one commentator, is in danger of becoming irrelevant in an area where it should be a leader. This is why American pension funds, which are the largest source of venture capital in the world, have not invested one cent in Australia. They have around $80 billion in capital to invest and most of it stays in the US, where investments held for longer than five years attract a capital gains tax of only 18 per cent. The rest goes to countries with similar generous capital gains tax levels. These pension funds are probably the most prudent investors on the planet. Why, from a business point of view, would they invest money in ventures that are often high risk and take many painstaking years to yield results if, in the end, most of their returns are eaten up in tax? This also applies to Australian investors and, indeed, to the companies and researchers themselves. We are risking the loss of our brightest innovators, who will simply take their business to countries that encourage and nurture R&D. What is the point of investing in the education of young Australians if they are not going to benefit from their enormous potential? Why become 'world leaders in health and research and biotechnology if we cannot profit from these developments? We cannot underestimate the impact of lower capital gains tax levels on jobs growth in Australia. As part of a business tax revolution that includes lowering the company tax to 30 per cent, I agree with BRW's Robert Gottliebsen when he predicts that, when we look back, this may be more significant than the GST. The problem has been identified by both the Ralph report and the health and medical research strategic review, chaired by Peter Wills. I hope the option of lowering the rate of capital gains tax, particularly for R&D investment, is transferred into legislation as soon as possible. 5270 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 12 May 1999 Brisbane Airport of the decision by government senators in consultation with and with the support of Senator Colston to oppose a Senate inquiry into the Brisbane Airport master plan. The details of this master plan are well known to the residents of Brisbane. Essentially; they involve the future construction of parallel runway which would have a huge impact on the residents of Brisbane's south side and north side-altogether some 100,000 persons. I register my condemnation for three basic reasons. The first is this, and it is perhaps the most important: to date we have not had any form of objective analysis by anybody as to any alternative runway option. We have simply had this one option put before us and had it said to the community, 'Take it or leave it.' The only option therefore available to the rest of the community is to look to a Senate inquiry as a vehicle through which alternative runway options might be examined. The public at this stage do not have a database, do not have objective information on which they can be convinced that this is the only viable alternative for Brisbane's future air transport needs. The second basis for my condemnation is this: Senator Colston, who supported government senators in the Senate on this matter, has absolutely no track record at all on airport matters in Brisbane-none whatsoever. It is simply an opportunistic intervention by him to support government senators in their hour of need in order to produce a 38-all vote and thereby prevent it from proceeding. My third reason is this: it simply delays the day. The Senate numbers will change as of 1 July, and this motion will be put before the Senate again. It is at that stage when I look forward to this inquiry proceeding, its terms of reference being accepted and the prospect of public hearings being held across Brisbane's south side so that the truth of this matter and the interests of Brisbane's residents may be properly served. Home and Community Care Program witness the signing of a new home and community care agreement between the federal Minister for Aged Care, the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop MP, and South Australia's Minister for Disability Services, the Hon. Robert Lawson MLC. As the secretary of the government's health and aged care policy committee, it gave me great pleasure to be present at this event, as the care of our aged is a very important issue in my electorate of Makin. People in Makin and elsewhere want to have the opportunity to remain in their own homes for as long as possible without having to seek institution care. The new agreement signed last week will take effect from 1 July 1999. The Home and Community Care Program is a joint Commonwealth and state program which provides community care for frail, older Australians as well as for younger people with disabilities and their carers. An amount of $823 million a year is spent on this worthy program, and, in my home state of South Australia, 55,000 people are assisted by the program, which provides home help such as cooking, cleaning and washing as well as transport, food services, personal care, community nursing, home maintenance and respite care. Home and community care funding in South Australia for this year is $72.6 million, representing $44.8 million from the. Commonwealth and $27.8 million from the state government. This represented an increase of $2.2 million in the current year. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the South Australian",155,Representatives Main Committee

252,Mrs Draper (Makin),"On Thursday of last week, I had the opportunity to attend andWednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 5271 government led by Premier John Olsen for agreeing to a contribution of $27.8 million for the Home and Community Care package, bringing the total funding to $72.6 million. The most important aspects of the new agreement are: reduced duplication between the Commonwealth and state governments; increased service efficiency; emphasis on quality assurance and measuring standards; increased availability of post-acute care; and involvement of the private sector to ensure that the best possible providers are selected. These measures underline our commitment to ensuring the best possible care for our elderly and infirm. This commitment is further evidenced by the measures included in the Treasurer's 'right for the times' budget, a budget for the new millennium. These measures include an enhanced primary care package for our older Australians and people with chronic conditions and, equally importantly, it contains more funding for respite care. The Home and Community Care Program has allowed many people in my electorate of Makin to continue to live in their own homes while receiving the care that they need. This makes an enormous difference to their quality of life, their dignity and their happiness. I commend the government for expansion of this program and for the dignity and quality of life that it has made possible for so many people in my electorate of Makin. Multiculturalism multiculturalism made by the National Multicultural Advisory Council in its recent report titled Australian multiculturalism for a new century: towards inclusiveness. The report, published in April 1999, was written, as I understand, after extensive community consultation. The report advocates an attitudinal change which, if Australians are to attain our national aspiration of social harmony, is absolutely necessary. The electorate of Lowe, which I am privileged to represent, is one of the most culturally diverse electorates, with some 40 per cent of the population being born overseas and more than 30 per cent being born of non-English-speaking background. Lowe has a large community from Italian, Greek, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Lebanese and Sri Lankan backgrounds. The Lowe community prides itself on social harmony and warm acceptance of diverse customs and culture. I am relieved to see that Australia has finally discarded its policy position of the 1950s, where a white Australia was the only politically acceptable Australia.

255,Mr Kerr (Denison) (9.59 A.m.),"This debate deals with two related bills-the Customs5272 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 12 May 1999 first bill proposes to amend the Customs Act 1901 by introducing a new reporting and registration scheme for bulk cargo consignments of high volume, low value cargo into Australia. The second bill proposes to amend the Import Processing Charges Act 1997 to reduce the screening charges to apply to those who register as special reporters under the scheme to be established by the first bill. The Customs Act requires pilots of aircraft and owners of ships to report to the Australian Cu-toms Service information about cargo intended to be discharged at a port or an airport in Australia. The Australian Customs Services uses these reports to screen cargo and to carry out its responsibility to protect Australia against the importation of prohibited goods. The proposed reporting and registration scheme that these bills envisage is designed for high volume cargo such as documents and consolidated mail orders which are valued at less than $250 per consignment and transported by specialist operators. Currently, such consignments are reported at a consolidated level and the Australian Customs Service relies on physical random checks to inspect individual consignments. The new scheme is intended to allow operators who register as 'special reporters' to report cargo at a consolidated level, provided the ACS has access to their computer facilities where information relating to individual consignments is stored. Operators by registering would be aware and agree that the Australian Customs Service would have access to their relevant computer databases and would be able to make necessary privacy and security arrangements if this is a matter of concern to them. The powers to the ACS under new subdivision D would ensure compliance by special reporters with the conditions and requirements in amendments to division 3 which establish the new registration and reporting scheme. These powers appear to be comparable to existing powers and provisions of the Customs Act which deal with search warrants in respect of things believed to be evidential material. This scheme is intended, effectively, to enable a smoother transition of product of this nature through the border control, to enable Customs to work with those who are registered under the scheme to undertake appropriate checks through the course of their import. As the scheme will be less expensive to manage than the current arrangements, the government has made consequential proposals to reduce the charges for reporting under the new scheme. That, of course, is a consequential and, I assume, not unwelcome concession by the government in relation to the arrangements that they have proposed. In relation to the working of Customs, this is an agency which is in considerable crisis at the moment. Customs has faced challenges which, plainly, it has failed to discharge, not the least being the two instances whereby large vessels sailed down the east coast of Australia and beached-one in Queensland and one in New South Wales-avoiding coastal surveillance. We are aware that there have been large and increasing consignments of illicit materials, particularly drugs, coming into this country at a rate which the government concedes is such that the availability and purity of those drugs is higher than ever before. Of course, this has had consequences Iii Minister Vanstone's own administration of the department. Her department is operating with a crisis of morale. Within Customs, there is a real sense that the arrangements that the government has put in place necessary to provide support to them have been inadequate. There are now currently major inquiries being pursued as to the future arrangements that should apply in the area of the management of Customs Wednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 5273 resources. It is widely believed that Customs Minister Amanda Vanstone has lost the fight to prevent the breaking up of the Customs Service. and therefore one would expect debate to range somewhat more widely than if the debate was on one bill only, what the honourable member is now saying is well beyond the purview of either bill. I ask you to ask him to come back to the legislation before the chamber. for Finance and Administration. In recalling the honourable member for Denison, I am sure he will stick to the contents of both bills. to a debate on the second reading of the bill relating to Customs, that I not speak in relation to the administrative arrangement for Customs when these matters plainly flow from changes in the processing of arrangements internally in Customs. saying. Please proceed. that the minister has lost the fight to keep the Customs agency in the form it is now. There have been major breakdowns in the framework for the protection of Australia-s border security. The arrangements in this bill are supported by the opposition; they are convenient and appropriate. But that should not prevent us, in a debate of this nature, drawing attention to the obvious fact that the agency that is the subject of this legislation is due for a major shakeup, and to ask how that shake-up is going to be effected. Reports that have been received from a number of sources suggest that the federal government is about to strip somewhere between 1,200 and 1,400 staff from the agency. There is an intention to create a new agency, Border Australia, to be set up with an amalgamation of these staff from Customs, 500 from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and 80 from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. And Customs is set to lose its commercial functions, which, reports suggest, will be transferred to the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, which will be responsible for the commercial side of Customs, for tariffs, anti-dumping and collections. So the functions now in this bill which are presently in the Customs agency will in fact be stripped from Customs and transferred to the Department of Industry, Science and Resources. Moves in this direction were first proposed in a secret report to the Minister for Finance and Administration, John Fahey, in a bid to gain efficiencies and cost savings in border control. That so-called Sturgess report, named after its author Gary Sturgess, who is a former key adviser to the Greiner government, was handed to the Howard government last September. The secret report-the opposition has sought access to that report on a number of occasions and has been refused-is understood to have recommended the setting up of a single border agency and also to have been critical of the management of Customs. The report is also understood to have suggested that the new single border agency could be established outside the Public Service Act, with a corporate structure similar to that' of Employment National, which of course has raised fears within the Customs Service of future outsourcing and privatisation. At the time of that report it is understood that Minister Vanstone opposed its implementation and succeeded in retaining the present structure. But the failures of Customs over recent times have weakened the minister's position.",159,Representatives Main Committee

260,Mr Kerr,"I was simply making the point that Customs is in crisis. It is widely reported5274 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 12 May 1999 The current government, after the recent election, has dusted off the recommendations of the Sturgess report. It is now part of a review which is being conducted, with Max MooreWilton as the chair, as part of a departmental task force set up to look at coastal surveillance and associated matters. It appears from reports that the decision has already been made, although not yet announced, that Customs will be broken up into a new Border Australia agency of the kind that I have indicated, bringing in resources from AQIS· and Immigration, and that Customs will lose these commercial services that are presently the subject of this legislation. In other words, the structure that is presently in place will entirely he left. I cannot imagine what present functions undertaken by the Customs Service will be left as stand-alone agency functions for Customs if these reports are correct. The Sturgess report was commissioned to get cost savings and to set up the border control process for possible privati sation. Labor rejects any quick fix on this. The weakness in Australia's border security needs a more comprehensive solution than simply dusting off an old, presumably rejected report and re-presenting it as a solution to a major problem that it was not designed to address. We will not be satisfied with rebadging a cost saving report. Labor is extremely wary of pea and thimble tricks after the 'cost savings' of the government on law enforcement during its last term. In relation to cost savings of the government during its last term, I was interested that the Treasurer, Mr Costello, referred last night in the budget speech to initiatives on law enforcement, particularly what he called creating a safer Australia. That took me back, because I used to be justice minister. I remember a report called the Justice Statement, which I was instrumental in the carriage of during the Keating government. The Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, and I announced that in Queensland. In the Justice Statement there were a number of initiatives. Those initiatives were cut by the incoming government. What was inchided in those initiatives? What a surprise: the safer Australia initiatives and all the initiatives that were highlighted by the Treasurer, Peter Costello, last night. There they were, bold as brass. They are damn good initiatives. But what a budget backflip-programs that were cut by the Howard government during its first term, announced by me as justice minister as part of the Justice Statement and the safer Australia initiatives, being recycled as government initiatives in the budget. What we are concerned about here, in relation to the customs area, is that we have seen cuts right across the law enforcement areas, and the consequence of those cuts-leading to a morale loss in agencies like the Australian Federal Police and Customs-has been to weaken the capacity of those agents to be the front line law enforcement agencies that this country requires. So we are now seeing catch-up responses, renewing funding initiatives which were cut during the previous term of this government, rebadging those as Liberal government initiatives and-the worse in relation to Customs, I fear-that a proposal that was designed in the context of the previous government's attempts at cost cutting and rationalisation will be re-presented to the Australian community as if it is an answer to the crisis facing the Australian Customs Service in terms of border· surveillance. That is not going to be good enough. When I indicated that the opposition had heard these reports-we had heard that the government had already made these decisions and that announcements were likely in the near future-Minister Vanstone responded by saying that I was the subject of misleading reports Wednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMfITEE 5275 and my information was wrong. That puzzles me. Obviously, when my colleagues who are sitting opposite were in opposition they would have had similar reports when initiatives of this nature were in contemplation. I have had a number of reports which suggest a degree of credibility and strength on those matters beyond that which is merely speculative. The timing of the announcement and when the change will occur are something of which the sources were not aware, but the fact that those decisions had been made and were certainly widely understood throughout the department and the agencies I do not believe can be gainsaid. We put that on record as a marker of our concern about the future. We do not want to see a recycled report, a design for an entirely different purpose, being dressed up again as a comprehensive response to what Australia needs by way of an effective border surveillance mechanism. We need to look at new initiatives. Perhaps we need to look at a type of coastguard structure. We need to look at these things more thoroughly, and there should be public input. There has been no consultation whatsoever with any of the commercial users of Customs. When there have been previous changes mooted in the administration, there has always been an undertaking to consult, not just with the unions, but also with the commercial sectors that are affected-the airlines and the shippers. They have not been consulted, notwithstanding undertakings that they would be. Secondly, the reports as to what went wrong in relation to breaches of border security have not been made public. This is a shameful thing. When Minister Vanstone was challenged after the first boat instance, she set up her own inquiry to ascertain what went wrong and who was responsible. Somebody had to take responsibility. The minister said that she would not comment on the factual basis or responsibility until she had that report. Then a second boat sailed down the coast. It got as far as northern New South Wales. that she was broadening her inquiry, that she wanted to identify what went wrong and who was responsible. She said that she would not make comment until she had that report. A deadline for that report was imposed by the Prime Minister. That was the end of last month. The government has that report. It will not release it. The minister will still not explain what went wrong and who is responsible. Even Premier Kennett said that somebody has to take responsibility for these failures. But what we have now is a resi)Qnse from the government that says that these reports have just gone into the Max Moore-Wilton inquiry, and when Max Moore-Wilton tells them what they are going to do with the reorganisation that they have talked about previously they might consider releasing those reports'might consider'. There was a clear impression left in the mind of the community by the minister and the Prime Minister that when these· reports were received they would be put out before the Australian community so that the Australian community would know that somebody accepted responsibility for these mishaps and that action would be taken to address that problem and responsibility would stand where it should fall. It is not good enough for a government still not to speak on those incidents after those inquiries have been made, after the minister has that report, and after she must be aware of where the fault lies. AllI can think is that the blame must be politically embarrassing because if the blame were not politically embarrassing those reports would be out in the public domain.",161,Representatives Main Committee

264,Mr Kerr,"I think you made some public comment at the time. Again, the minister said5276 MAIN COMMITfEE Wednesday, 12 May 1999 Why should the Australian public and its parliament, having been promised that the minister could not speak in relation to what went wrong until she had the reports, tolerate the minister still not speaking about what went wrong in two of the most publicised and significant breaches of Australia's border security after she has received an official report from her investigator and after those reports are in her hands? What possible excuse can she provide? It is a complete contempt of the public. But worse than that, it is an effective misleading of this parliament, because those assurances were given that there would be an independent inquiry, that the minister could not speak in relation to those matters until she had that report. What is the implication drawn from that by reasonable people after they heard her say that when she had that report she would be able to detail how these events could have transpired, what went wrong, who was taking responsibility, what the processes for accountability were and how this was going to be prevented in the future? We have not heard one word. There has been silence. What we understand, however, by way of the political reality, is that the issue has been taken out of her hands entirely. She has been left as a cipher on the sidelines. When she is asked questions about the Sturgess report-the Sturgess report was the report that I mentioned before, about the possible future of Customs and its integration into other border agencies-she says, 'It's not my report. It was a report commissioned by Minister Fahey. I can't answer questions about it,'-and this was in Senate estimates-'but maybe I'll be able to say something about it at the next meeting of the Senate estimates in a fortnight.' That is in a week's time. Again, that fits in with the fact that decisions in relation to the Sturgess report have already been taken, not by the minister, but by Max Moore-Wilton and his group, who have not had any public input; who have not called for submissions; who have not consulted the commercial community; who have not had discussions with the affected employees, their professional associations or their trade unions; but who obviously have gone back to the Sturgess report as a basis of what they intend to do. The minister is being left out of the loop. Her opposition to the implementation of the Sturgess report seems to have been overridden. She is now having an imposed solution, firstly by Minister Fahey, who set up this inquiry into her turf, which she fought off successfully in the first instance. Now it has been passed on to Max Moore-Wilton in the Prime Minister's department. She is trying to bury the reports that she commissioned herself about what went wrong with customs operations on her watch and will not answer questions about it, because she passed those reports to Max Moore-Wilton. She is being eliminated as a minister other than in name. She has not got effective control over the future and the administration of her own department. A minister who is a minister actually administering her department would have given the Australian public what she promised them implicitly by saying, 'I will commission an independent report on what went wrong' -by presenting that and saying, 'I accept responsibility for these mishaps. I have identified the failures in the system. I am taking responsibility. I am addressing the question of responsibility. If there have been acts of omission or negligence, I will ensure that they are pursued. If there have been those within my employment who have failed, I will address that. If there have been physical or technical problems in equipment and surveillance, I will identify that and address it.' If you had a minister with control over her portfolio, those would be the responses that we would be hearing now. Instead, we have a minister whose future is being decided not by her, Wednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 5277 but rather by the Prime Minister's office in an inquiry process which has no input-or, I suspect, very little input indeed-from the minister herself. I suspect that these are decisions that are being taken by other than her and imposed upon her. That is why, when pressed on these issues, we continually find a refusal to table materials which in any other circumstances would be tabled. There is no plausible reason why a report, commissioned by the minister in the aftermath of two of the most serious instances of breaches of border security, is to be withheld from the public with no undertaking now to provide that report, even after Max Moore-Wilton completes his larger inquiry into the structure of customs arrangements. No undertaking to table it has been given. What we are to understand essentially is that no-one is going to take responsibility for what went wrong in the past. Nobody accepts political responsibility in the Howard government for mistakes. Nobody will address the failures of equipment, performance or personnel in relation to incidents that were on the front pages of newspapers causing concern-and not just to Labor members. It might be predictable that the opposition spokesperson on justice and customs would draw attention to these matters. That is part of the role of opposition, to highlight deficiencies in government administration and call ministers to account. In this instance, the concerns that I expressed were expressed in stronger language by colleagues of the minister. Backbench members who resided in New South Wales and Queensland expressed those concerns in stronger language than I used. I was anxious to have the matter resolved so that we had systemic solutions that would prevent this occurring in the future. They were angry that this could have been allowed to occur. I thought the most telling remark, as I mentioned before, was from Premier Kennett, who said, 'Somebody must take responsibility.' But what do we have? We have the no responsibility account. We have the cover-up approach. The minister cannot talk before she has a report; she will not talk after she has a report. When does she talk? She never talks. She never speaks to us about what goes wrong. We have just had two huge amazing episodes ofMr Pyne interjectingon the back bench about the factional infighting of the South Australian Liberal Party. I am certain she takes a very loud and active role in that. But in these instances, she is paid by the Australian community as minister responsible-as Minister for Justice and Customs-to be the political administrative head of a department of state-sharing it with the Attorney-General, but a joint administrator of the Attorney-General's Department, specifically charged with the responsibility for the Australian Customs Service. When a major development occurs which demonstrates a weakness in her administration-it is on the front pages of newspapers all over the country, and is the subject of criticism by her own parliamentary colleagues and by the premiers of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria-she says, 'I cannot speak on this issue until I have a report.' When she receives the report, she says, 'I cannot speak on this issue now that I have a report.' What is expected? That we will forget about it and that, with the administration of a key department of state with one of the basic responsibilities that Australia has of protecting its coastal security, an incident like this can happen without any public examination put on the table for the Australian community to be reassured that somebody is acting in their interests and that faults and failures are being addressed?",163,Representatives Main Committee
265,Mr Kerr,"She might talk about all sorts of things. She might have edifying conversations5278 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 12 May 1999 This is not part of Max Moore-Wilton's brief. Max Moore-Wilton is not set up to examine what went wrong. Max Moore-Wilton has a much wider brief to look at what departmental arrangements the government will impose on a minister who has failed. So when are we going to hear? We still have no undertaking that there will be any accountability on this issue. The fundamental tenet of political government in Australia is what is called responsible government. What does responsible government mean? It means that, when you accept the commission of the Governor General to become a minister, you accept political responsibility for what occurs within your portfolio watch. This government is spurning that basic convention. We want to see that report. We will not be happy with half-measures in relation to customs services. We will not be happy with halfmeasures in relation to accountability. We will not be happy with the recycling of the Sturgess report, as if it is a response to these serious issues which need a much more systemic response from a government to assure the Australian public that these instances will be addressed thoroughly and properly. comment pursuant to the point of order raised by the honourable parliamentary secretary. The content of these bills, as with many, is very specific and quite explicit. However, the relevant factor is the long title of the bill. I will not read it in full. But both of these bills end with the words 'and for related purposes'. When the government drafts a bill with the words 'related purposes', anybody can draw a very long bow indeed. So for the information of all members, I make that point that the long title of a bill is the relevant area when we are looking at relevance. on the Customs Amendment Bill (No.2) 1999 and the Import Processing Charges Amendment Bill 1999, which basically is mechanical in its scope. It is about introducing a new registration reporting scheme. Among other matters, it permits owners of ships or aircraft who are already registered users under the air cargo automation system or the sea cargo automation system under section 67(c) of the Customs Act 1901 to register as special reporters under the scheme. Mr Deputy Speaker, the member for Denison certainly has drawn a very long bow. What a beat-up! This is basically a mechanical bill produced by a department to speed up the efficiency of processing of high volume, low value goods coming into the country. We have had a monumental beat-up by the member for Denison on matters which ranged to illegal immigrants coming into the country, as if there were no boat people or illegal immigrants who came into the country during the 13 years the previous administration was in office. In his extraneous examples-we have not seen this or that report-he fails to commend the minister for the excellent changes and reforms that have been carried out. Over the past few years, my previous life has been involved in tourism and there has been a remarkable turnaround in the general approach and efficiency in the way in which Customs handled people and processed documents coming through Sydney and other airports around the country. The minister and the officers of the department need to be commended for the way in which they responded to the challenge right across the board. The Minister for Justice and Customs is one of the outstanding ministers that we have had in this area. I have racked my brains and it is very difficult to remember any leading reforms that were carried out by the previous speaker, the member for Denison, in this area.

267,Mr Baird (Cook) (10.29 A.m.),"It is my pleasure to speak on behalf of the governmentWednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 5279 and then spent the rest of the time having this broad ranging debate on all matters nefarious. It is a small technical bill; it is about improving efficiency. A collection of documents-letters, legal documents, small mail-order consignments--come into the country and the process at the moment makes it difficult to follow them. The Customs Act 1901 requires that everything needs to be consigned and provided to the customs officials. This bill allows for greater efficiency in this new age of technology . We could have had a word of commendation from the member for Denison to the minister and the officers of the department to say, 'Well done!' because they have recognised that the world has changed. A new technology is in place. We no longer have the comprehensive program providing all the information in the world for people to go through. The information is simply put on the computer for the customs agents to look at, and this simplifies the whole process. What could be more straightforward than that? The member for Denison could have sat down after two minutes. He could have commended the administrators who brought this forward and left it at that. But, of course, he would have had to commend the government and the minister for what they have done. There are different arrangements for the organisations in how they handle it. This bill provides different arrangements because of the disparity that currently exists between couriers and freight forwarders. There are efficiencies for couriers where they get a particular advantage in this process. It will do two things: it will improve the administration through the ability of downloading information when required and it will provide the ability to simplify the costing. This cognate bill proposes to reduce the amount of screening charge from $2.40 per line in each cargo port to $45 for an electronic cargo report. So what do we have? For the government it is going to be cost neutral, and that is important. So there is no basic change for the government. This is about providing assistance to those who use the service-the airlines, the freight forwarders, the couriers who come through. Also for the government it provides the ability to download the information from the computers so that they can check it out pretty quickly and, if required, do a check for illicit drugs coming into the country. We have heard the member for Denison talk about the problems of drugs coming into the country. Here is an example where we are making it easier for officers to simply check what is on the consignment and download the information, if required. It also provides for the officers to gain access to the specific facilities where this material is stored and be able to see if there are any illicit drugs or whether it conforms with the description as provided in the computer. There are various aspects to the bill in relation to registration. In order to report high volume, low value cargo in this scheme, the person must apply for registration as a special reporter. Once they are given that recognition and that registration, they are able to report electronically on the customs information that is required and provide a less detailed cargo report. Upon registration, the special reporter must comply with the conditions that are established. If at any time there is a breach of these conditions, they may lose their licence and they will not have that special ability. They have that licence for a period of two years, and obviously that can be taken away from the chief executive officer of the Customs Service. There is a monitoring warrant that can be issued, as set out in the bill, so that these officers can go to the facilities to check out and make sure that the requirements are met. Currently, we have different arrangements that parties are involved in, and everything needs to be reported in a fairly longwinded approach to the whole exercise. But this will provide a more 5280 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 12 May 1999 targeted approach for cargo consignment for a particular mail-order house, for cargo comprising reportable documents, for cargo comprising other goods of a kind prescribed by the regulations. This is good change; it is good administration. I commend the officers for it. It will be cost neutral. It will mean less compliance cost for those people who are forwarding their documents overseas, which is going to be a continual trend as we have more and more documents-legal documents, company documents-sent offshore as the Australian economy diversifies and expands and as we have more investment, not only from overseas sources into Australia but vice versa. To have the longer requirements of the current legislation is unnecessary with modem technology, and this is an appropriate way to go. The member for Denison's attacks on the government are without substance. It is an administration that has performed well. It is performing efficiently. It is reducing costs. It is undertaking these types of changes, which is what efficient administration is about: to look at the current arrangements; to ask if there are changes that need to occur with modem technology. There is a simpler way of doing it. Let us get on with it, let us reduce the cost for those freight forwarders and exporters that are involved in day-to-day trade. This bill shows the initiative of both the minister and the public servants who are involved in the administration of this act. I commend them for it. I believe that the changes that we have seen will assist people involved in bringing documents into the country. It should have been done a long time ago. The member for Denison, who claims what great things he did, had 13 years to implement such changes. Technology is not a new thing in this country, nor are computers. We should have done it a long time ago but, thank goodness, we have brought it forward today. I commend the minister and the officers who have been working on this bill and amendments.

I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Cook on his erudite words and I commend them to the honourable members opposite. It is, however, very sad when the honourable member for Denison rises in the chamber on a bill which is non-controversial, a bill which he himself admitted the opposition is supporting, and wastes close to half an hour seeking to criticise Minister Vanstone, who is doing an absolutely outstanding job as Minister for Justice and Customs. The Customs Amendment Bill (No.2) 1999 proposes to amend the Customs Act 1901 by introducing a new reporting scheme for high volume, low value cargo arriving in Australia. As well, a screening charge in relation to cargo reported under the high volume, low value reporting scheme outlined in that bill will be introduced by the Import Processing Charges Amendment Bill 1999, which amends the Import Processing Charges Act 1997. Running through the speecby the honourable member for Denison was criticism of the government's approach to customs. He suggested that we were not diligent but were in some way being dilatory as far as our obligations to the people of Australia are concerned. He claimed also that morale in the area of customs was declining and certainly not in a very good state.

268,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance andWednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 5281 I will point out some of the major initiatives under our government with respect to Customs. Over the period 1995-96 to additional estimates 1998-99, Customs annual appropriations have increased by $82.1 million, or 22.1 per cent. This year staffing within the border subprogram is currently at a record level, estimated as 165, or eight per cent, higher than in 1995-96. The following major initiatives over the life of the current government have been approved for Customs: a technology upgrade program, at $27 million over three years; an upgrade of the Customs marine fleet, with eight new vessels, at $58 million; the National Illicit Drugs Strategy, at $34.5 million over four years, for improving Australia's coastal surveillance and detection capacity in the Torres Strait; the upgrading of cargo examination facilities and the development of a new cargo profiling system, at $4.3 million; and an improved intelligence analysis. Also, the government's Tough on Drugs policy statement, announced during the 1998 election, has foreshadowed the allocation to Customs of an additional $31.65 million over four years for the purchase of sophisticated cargo examination technology, the creation of specialist search teams and the deployment of an additional marine crew in the Torres Strait. One might listen to the huffing and puffing by the honourable member for Denison. He obviously relishes his very limited time in the sun-he had half an hour here and he was determined to ram down our throats half an hour of complete claptrap and irrelevance, with false criticisms of the minister and her performance. If you listened to him, you would think in this matter that the Labor Party had been an absolutely paragon of virtue. for his intervention. Let us just look at what the Labor Party did during its time in office. It made a number of reviews of the situation relating to Australia's coastline. In 1983, the now Leader of the Opposition, the then Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, conducted a review of Australia's peacetime coastal surveillance and protection arrangements. He considered the creation of a separate coastguard but discounted it on the basis of cost. In 1986 there was a report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure, entitled Footprints in the sand. Two years later, in 1988, there was a government commissioned review of civil coastal surveillance arrangements, called Northern approaches. In 1990 there was a report entitled Risky Business: the 37000 kilometre challenge by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which reviewed Customs and, in tum, Coastwatch. The report of a 1993 committee of review of the Australian Customs Service was entitled The turning point. That also looked at Coastwatch. Former Minister Schacht, who was Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction from March 1994 until March 1996, was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald as saying: It is clearly impossible to resource such a task to provide lOOper cent guarantee of no undetected incursions. The opposition wants to criticise this government when we have done more than any other government with respect to Customs and seeking to detect these incursions-whereas their own minister, when they were in office, said that it was impossible to guarantee such an event would not happen. Also, you will recall, Madam Deputy Speaker, that under the Labor Party in office there were a large number of undetected arrivals. For instance, on 9 September 1994 there was one",168,Representatives Main Committee

So these people are absolute hypocrites. They come into the chamber and they criticise the government when we are the government which is absolutely and resolutely determined to make sure that the Australian community receives the protection that, indeed, we believe ought to happen. This minister, Minister Vanstone, has done an outstanding job. On behalf of the government I am very pleased and honoured to reject the false accusations and criticisms made of Minister Vanstone and the government. There was also a suggestion by the member for Denison that we were somehow soft on crime. Everyone was riveted to the television sets throughout the nation yesterday as the Treasurer delivered what was an outstanding budget document. One only has to look at the headlines in all of the newspapers to see that this government is right on track. We are delivering good, sound, responsible economic management as we move towards the next millennium. When one comes back to the Attorney-General and the justice portfolio of which Minister Vanstone is minister, it should be noted that an extra $245 million over four years was set aside in the budget last night. In particular, the budget provides $35.4 million to the Australian Customs Service for increased search capacity, the purchase of X-ray technology to enhance the capacity for drug detection at the nation's borders, the creation of specialist search teams, and the additional marine crew to improve surveillance in the Torres Strait. This is in addition to other new budget initiatives such as an additional $6.5 million to the Australian Customs Service for the Sydney Olympic Games to ensure that the extraordinary volume of people and goods entering and departing Australia for the Olympics are efficiently facilitated whilst simultaneously maintaining appropriate border controls. There is also $41.6 million over four years under the government's tough on drugs initiative to expand our capacity to intercept drugs before they reach Australia's shores and to attack distribution networks in Australia. So this government is doing more than any other government. This government rejects absolutely the false accusations made by the member for Denison, who is suggesting that in some way we are participating in a cover-up, that we are not carrying out our responsibility to the Australian community. Minister Vanstone responded to accusations by the member for Denison in a media release dated 7 May. She said-and I quote, and it is very hard to improve on the minister's own words: Duncan Kerr is either a victim of an elaborate hoax or he has completely lost his marbles. Madam Deputy Speaker, I will let you decide which of those two the member for Denison finds himself in. Either way, he ought not to be standing up and making false and misleading criticisms of the minister. We all know about the departmental task force which has been set up to look at coastal surveillance with Mr Max Moore-Wilton as chair. Answers to questions about undetected vessels will clearly be given in this particular context. The minister rejected absolutely what the member for Denison has said and pointed out that it is a pity he has not bothered to get his facts right. That really dismisses the absolute nonsense uttered by the member for Denison during 30 long and tedious minutes here in this particular chamber. Wednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMI1TEE 5283 Mr Martin Ferguson-Talk about the pot calling the kettle black there. I know the member for Batman was not there, and he obviously feels embarrassed that he is part of a party that has such an absolutely disgraceful record over such a long time. I would also like to point out that the member for Denison is confusing the Sturgess report with the Prime Minister's task force reviewing coastal surveillance. These are quite separate matters. I mentioned before that the Prime Minister's task force is chaired by Mr Max MooreWilton and has representatives of Defence, Customs, AFP, Immigration and PM&C. This task force will report by 30 June. The report by Air Commodore Heggin into the arrival at Holloways Beach was received by the minister on 30 April, which was only a few days ago. This was raised at Senate estimates, and some of the facts which were revealed there indicate that no prior information was received by Coastwatch on the vessel and the report has also been passed to the task force for consideration with the Scotts Head beach arrival. Returning to the two items of legislation before the chamber, it ought to be noted that all cargo arriving in Australia is required to be reported under the Customs Act. It is basic to Customs' ability to fulfil its border protection responsibilities that people transporting cargo to Australia report to Customs the details of the cargo intended to be discharged here. I suspect that no reasonable people, not even some of the unreasonable people opposite, would disagree with that proposition. Customs is then able to screen the cargo report to protect the Australian community from the importation of illicit drugs and prohibited goods. These bills deal with a particular type of cargo, which is the high volume, low value cargo. The screening charge was introduced in 1997 as a co.st recovery measure and is charged on each air cargo consignment valued at less than $250. Such a consignment must be reported to Customs, although it does not require a customs entry. These bills propose to introduce a reduced screening charge for people who are eligible to join the high volume, low value reporting scheme. At present, people reporting high volume, low value consignments pay $2.40 for each consignment. However, under the scheme, such people will pay an amount of $45 for each bulk consignment which has been put together by the people transporting the consignments to Australia. To be affected by these bills, the reporting of the cargo should ensure that each consignment does not exceed $250 in value and that the customs duty and sales tax payable does not exceed $50. Because of these restrictions, such consignments will pose a low revenue risk to Customs. These bills will enable high volume, low value cargo to be properly reported to Customs. This sector of the transport community has grown dramatically, with some 120,000 consignments arriving each week at Sydney airport alone. The high volume, low value reporting scheme proposed by these bills will enable high volume, low value consignments to be properly reported. The scheme will utilise electronic technology to enable the people reporting such consignments to provide Customs with access to their internal electronic databases, so that Customs may electronically screen the details of each consignment. To perform this screening task, Customs is currently developing the advanced cargo profiling system. The system is being developed at a cost of $2.8 million under the government's National Illicit Drug Strategy.",169,Representatives Main Committee
271,Mr Slipper,"You guys ought to apologise for your inactivity during 13 years of rule.5284 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 12 May 1999 These bills propose to make the scheme available to all people reporting such consignments, whether they arrive by air or sea. These bills will enable Customs to perform its screening responsibilities more effectively and at the same time provide arrangements for industry to more efficiently and properly report high volume, low value cargo.

Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs Kelly)-If no member wishes to consider the bill in detail, I will put the report question forthwith. The question is that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Second Reading Debate resumed from 31 March, on motion by Mr Reith: That the bill be now read a second time. Act 1946 has had a long and illustrious history of 50 years of assisting the trades skills needs of Australia, but, provided we work out appropriate transitional arrangements, like much other legislation of that time, it may have had its day. In passing, I refer to the fact that the Tradesmen's Rights Regulations Act 1946 was developed under the emergency provisions of World War II. It was an initiative of the Chifley Labor government. In fact, I think the records will show that this bill is potentially the last act of the postwar reconstruction period on the books of the parliament. The act was initially aimed at assisting troops returning from the war to re-enter the civilian work force and, in doing so, participate in the postwar reconstruction of the nation's economy and major development programs on the government's agenda. At that time, that was exceptionally important. One has to think about the nature of the young men and women who went to war in the period from 1939 to 1945. They were, in essence, children of the Depression. Many were forced to leave school at an early age because of economic necessity. Because of their war service, or alternatively the employment opportunities offered under",171,Representatives Main Commi1tee
272,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (10.57 A.m.),"The Tradesmen's Rights RegulationsWednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 5285 civilian rehabilitation programs in the immediate period postwar, many got for the first time ever the opportunity of trade or skills training. In that context, I think we must acknowledge the importance of this bill, whilst at the same time in a non-political way we work across the parliament to try and develop transitional arrangements that continue the thrust of what the bill sought to achieve in days gone by. On that basis, I refer to the fact that the act assisted in the development of skills, particularly in a number of industries-namely, the metals, electrical and shoe trades-and also provided recognition for those who developed their trade skills in industry during the war. But whilst that was the initial intent of the bill, its importance grew in the years soon after it was initially introduced. I refer to the fact that in 1952 the act was amended to also provide for the formal recognition of the trades skills of migrants. There are many migrants now in retirement in Australia who came to Australia as part of a major work force to help Australia rebuild in the postwar period. Those like our own children of the Depression who got trade training during their period of war service, or in the period immediately after the war, very much identify with what this bill enabled them to achieve, from both a personal and a family point of view. Therefore, in addition to assuring the quality of work of the overseas trained workers and those at home-namely, the informally trained Australian workers-in the 49 prescribed metal and electrical trades, the act has been used to encourage skilled workers in times of skill shortages. One value of the act was that, until recent times, it was the only body that provided a nationally accepted qualification, as there was no uniformity in trade training and recognition systems across the states. It was therefore exceptionally important, nationally, to ensure that between the states we were able to create a sense of uniformity with respect to the quality of the tradesperson that was produced as a result of a variety of training programs around Australia. For over 50 years, the act has played an important role in our industrial relations system and in the operation of the skilled labour market. It has also, since the early 1950s, played an important role in the administration of Australia's migrant program and the settlement of skilled migrants into the work force and the community. Generations of migrants to this country have benefited from the act as it has allowed recognition of earlier skills and training and has provided the necessary skills upgrades to enable those skills to be utilised for the benefit of the whole Australian economy. However, times change, and times have changed from the original intent of this act. The time has now come to move on as a large proportion of the provisions in the act have become obsolete and the question arises about the continued relevance of the committees established under the act. Since the implementation of the act over 50 years ago, as a community, we have seen significant changes to our education and training policies, programs and even philosophy. Fewer Australian residents are developing their skills informally, and those who do have increasing access to alternative means of having their skills recognised on a national basis and therefore understand the importance of the changes before the House today. Migrants who have not had their skills assessed as part of the migration program also have access to these alternative mechanisms for domestic recognition. Training in the Australian Defence Force is now also linked to civilian training qualifications, which is exceptionally ---5286 MAIN COMMI'ITEE Wednesday, 12 May 1999 important. This has meant a continuous decline in the number of applications for domestic recognition under the act over the 1990s. The committee of review found: This'decline will continue and the future outlook for demand for recognition under the act is such that it will not be possible to maintain an efficient and economically viable domestic skills recognition service under the current arrangements. The committee then went on to make its recommendation. It said: The act should be repealed and domestic recognition should be provided under the arrangements for skill assessment and the issuing of national qualifications, including the infrastructure of registered training organisations, being put in place under the Australian recognition framework. The review committee also identified, and it is interesting to note, a range of implementation and transition issues which they felt needed to be resolved before a firm timetable for the cessation of activities under the act could be decided. In that context, at the conclusion of my remarks today, I will seek to move an amendment which goes to the importance of trying to resolve across industry, from the point of view of an employer, trainer, union and worker, the nature of what transition arrangements might be appropriate to make the bill workable. It is the areas of implementation and transition that arof concern to those of us on this side of the House as we have seen too often grandiose schemes in the areas of education and training promulgated by the government without the skills and resources provided to make them viable. On the issue uf the transition arrangements I might also say that, following discussions with the department, who have in tum consulted the government, there is an understanding that we have to develop appropriate transition arrangements. Because of the importance of that, we want to avoid what has previously occurred. We do not want another farce like the literacy and numeracy program which aimed at increasing the skills of the unemployed to enable them to become more competitive, but failed to provide the trained teachers, back-up resources and, most importantly, funds to achieve the desired results. While current assessment procedures are not uniform across the states, overseas skill recognition is primarily paper based, but a practical assessment is undertaken if deemed necessary. Under the proposed legislation-and this in many ways represents the nature of the times and the change in the nature of training in Australia today-only paper based assessment would be undertaken. This assessment process would be tendered to registered training organisations. We must ensure that those registered training organisations are capable of doing the job. The concerns we have with this bill relate to the competency systems, whether or not paper based assessments are adequate, and the implementation of a satisfactory transition mechanism. The committee of review report notes that both unions and industry-yes, industry employer organisations across a range of industries-have expressed the concern that registered training organisations are not yet equipped to perform the tasks allocated to them, and that no satisfactory transition mechanism is in place. I am pleased to note that, following a proposition brought forward by the Australian Labor Party in the Senate, these issues will be taken up by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee, which is to report back in August of this year. I believe it is important that we ensure that the necessary replacement mechanisms are in place before the legislation is enacted, to guarantee that the standards of the act are maintained. The review also addresses these issues and recommends that: Wednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 5287 Detailed consideration should be given to the implementation arrangements and the lead time for winding up activities under the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act. The fact that that has been recognised in the review, and the consultations with the department, who also recognised the need for the transition arrangements, are the very reasons we bring forward the amendment that in due course I will move today. It is clearly in line with the thinking of the department and in line with the review's recommendations, which have in turn been discussed with the minister, who has indicated his willingness, following consultation, to develop appropriate transition arrangements and, in doing so, to agree on a reasonable timetable to make sure that we get this transition right. The review then went on to identify a range of implementation and transition issues which need to be resolved before a firm timetable for the cessation of activities under the act can be identified. In submissions to the review, and in consultation with the review committee, some employer and employee organisations expressed concerns about, for example, the implementation and· quality aspects of the Australian Recognition Framework. Industry also expressed concerns-and I can understand why-about the registration and auditing of registered training organisations which appeared to reflect the view held by industry that it should have a role in these activities. The view of industry was that it would be appropriate for the arrangements and infrastructure developed under the Australian recognition framework to ultimately directly provide the means for skills assessment for migration purposes. They believed that this would entail prospective migrants overseas seeking skills assessment for migration purposes through a government managing agent, which would be the relevant Australian authority under the niigration regulations and which would engage selected registered training organisations on a competitive tendering basis to undertake the assessments. . The review said that it would also be appropriate to establish a broad based consultative committee, comprising the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and industry and community representatives, which the government managing agent would consult on the criteria for selecting registered training organisations and in monitoring their performance. The review concluded that the government managing agent should operate until the Australian recognition framework infrastructure has developed further and been tested against its quality assurance benchmarks and until a core of registered training organisations develop significant experience in overseas skill assessments. It may be appropriate for that reason for skill assessments for migration purposes to be directly undertaken by the appropriate registered training organisations without the participation of the managing agent. It is in that context that we on this side of the House, firstly, recognise the historic importance of this bill. It has been part of the skilling and the rebuilding of Australia in the postwar reconstruction period. It has also been part and parcel of enabling many people from overseas to come to Australia and, in doing so, to have their skills properly recognised-the end result being that they have been able to pursue a reasonable standard of living in Australia. Secondly, the nature of training in Australia has changed and, therefore, we have the proposition before the House to repeaUhe Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act. It is understood on this side of the House that time does move on with respect to this issue from both a domestic and an international perspective. It is on that basis that I will move the second reading amendment. WhilstI understand the government will not support the second reading amendment today, and despite the ignorance of some members on the other side of 5288 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 12 May 1999 the House about discussions that have occurred between the opposition and the government about the importance of this bill and the need to involve industry, union, worker and training representatives in the development of a decent transition mechanism, I am pleased to say that that work will be undertaken by a Senate committee. There will be a report back to the Senate and, (ollowing consultation between the department and representatives of the various parties interested in this bill, I am hopeful that, side by side with the repeal of the bill, we will have an agreed transition mechanism. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the Bill not be proceeded with until details of transitional mechanisms are provided which guarantee a smooth transfer from the existing arrangements to the new system."" I commend the amendment to the House. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs Kelly)-Order! Is the amendment seconded? the opposition's position on this matter this morning, some 16 minutes to simply tell us that they agree with the legislation but that they would like some transitional arrangements. The government is very proud of the fact that there are now some 200,000 apprenticeships in Australia-an all-time record. Three years ago apprenticeships were at a three-decade low-an appallingly low level-because of the neglect by those opposite when they were in government. Today, of those 200,000 apprenticeships, approximately 1,200 applicants come under the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act. I want to go straight to the core of the amendment that has just been moved, because there are already provisions in place and the opposition, along with all other parties, will be involved in ensuring that these transitional arrangements are satisfactory. In repealing the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act, hopefully by 30 June this year, the Australian Recognition Framework will have been in place for 18 months and will be bedded down-18 months in which we could have seen its operation and been able to learn from it. Repealing this act will enable a full year's cost saving in the 1999-2000 budget but, of course, this is not a savings measure. It is simply that the legislation, as rightly pointed out by the member for Batman, which actually served a very valid purpose and served it very well for 50 years, is no longer relevant. Part of any forward thinking government is to in fact repeal legislation which is on the books and which is no longer relevant to today's society. Does anybody agree with what we are doing here? The bottom line is that all of the states have already been consulted on this issue and they are all in agreeance that this should occur and that the federal government should move away from the obligations it has held in the past in the determination of people's trade qualifications. The trade qualifications that we are referring to here are predominantly for electrical and mechanical engineering. Although the bill does repeal the act, there is a need, as has been pointed out, for transitional arrangements to protect and save the rights-for example, by following the finalisation of applications for recognition on hand at the date of repeal. The bill does provide for Henry VIII type regulations to be made for this purpose. The transitionary matters are to be dealt with by regulation, not through legislation. The minor parties have already indicated that they have a problem with this, but the minister has indicated that he will be preparing an exposure draft",172,Representatives Main Committee
273,Mr Emerson,I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,176,Representatives Main Committee
274,Mr Brough (Longman) (11.14 A.m.),"It has taken the member for Batman, representingWednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 5289 of the regulations for discussions with the minor parties, the opposition and any other interested parties. The repealing of this act is supported by all state and territory governments and by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The Australianlndustry Group supports the repeal in principle and would obviously also like to see these transitional provisions in place. In 1991 there was a review of this act undertaken by the previous government. That review recommended that the act should continue 'until national standards and processes have been developed and unless and until it can be demonstrated that a more effective mechanism [than the act] can be put in place'. These conditions have now been met-as we have pointed outand the training packages and the Australian Recognition Framework are now working and have been working for some 18 months. The aims of the national training framework are to provide a more flexible and simpler regulatory environment. All the industrial relations legislation that we have put before this parliament has been about ensuring that we do in fact have a system which is modern, flexible and adaptable to a changing work force. The national training framework comprises two elements: training packages and the Australian Recognition Framework. I encourage the opposition to be involved and to make comments on the exposure draft of the regulations-and I am sure they will. I also strongly encourage them to support the bill as put forward. The act which has served the country well for 50 years will be replaced by more updated legislation, putting the responsibility for determining the qualifications of these qualified electrical and metal tradespeople in the hands of those who are best qualified to do that. I commend the bill to the House. Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Repeal Bill 1999, as outlined by my colleague the member for Batman, is that we will support the bill, but with an amendment, the terms of which have been outlined. The purpose of the bill is to repeal the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act 1946, which has provided for an alternative trade skill recognition procedure to the traditional apprenticeships system for certain trades since 1946. The legislation that came into force in 1946 was one component of Australia's postwar reconstruction effort. I think it is fair to say that it is a component of that effort that has, as the member for Longman has said, served Australia very well. The act was amended in 1952 to provide for the recognition of the trade skills of migrants after their arrival. In effect, the purpose and ambit of the act were expanded. The functions of the act have been further expanded by having the organisation which administers the act-Trades Recognition Australia-make assessments of overseas individuals wanting to have a skills assessment in order to qualify under the immigration points system. Thus, the TRA is noted as the relevant authority under migration regulations-that is, pursuant to the Migration Act 1958-for the skills assessment of prospective migrants in most trades. The TRA has assessed and recognised trade skills of those who have not completed a traditional apprenticeship as a young person but who have nevertheless acquired the relevant skills for that trade. We agree that, while this act served Australia very well right through the postwar reconstruction period, its time has gone and it is now time for a replacement to it. As my colleague the member of Batman has outlined, however, we have concerns with the transitional provisions and that is why we have moved our amendment. Indeed, under the proposed legislation, only a paper based assessment would be undertaken. This assessment process would be tendered out to registered training organisations. We have some concerns",176,Representatives Main Committee
275,Mr Emerson (Rankin) (11.18 A.m.),"The position we are adopting in relation to the5290 MAIN COMMITfEE Wednesday, 12 May 1999 with the fact that only a paper based assessment would be made, and quite a few of the key stakeholders are concerned that inadequate transitional arrangements for that have been made. I hope the government will fulfil its commitment to ensuring that there is proper consultation on these transitional arrangements. I would like to make a comment on recognising the training and improving the skills base of the Australian community. Since this government began three years ago to slash Labor's job programs under the Working Nation program, the number of long-term unemployed people has actually increased to 212,000. That is a stubbornly high number of long-term unemployed people in Australia. Disappointingly, last night when the budget came down, there was precious little for the long-term unemployed or, more fundamentally in a sense, for lifting the skills base of the Australian economy and community. Our concern is that, with the abolition, the effective removal of the Working Nation program-a very large and successful program-nothing really effective has been provided in its place. There have been announcements of apprenticeships but we find in the budget forecast that the unemployment rate is predicted to be stuck at 7Y2 per cent. That bodes badly for Australia's future as we seek to take our place in the international community, when we lack the skills to compete effectively in the information age. We are very concerned that the government is not demonstrating a commitment to lifting the skills base of the Australian community. That is a disappointment. We are concerned about the transitional arrangements being proposed here. We support the bill. It is legislation whose time has come, in our view. But we implore the government to lift its gaze beyond measures such as this to the wider task of enhancing the skills base of the Australian economy. If we do not do that, we are in for a very difficult time in the information age of the new millennium. member for Rankin for the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Repeal Bill 1999. However, I challenge what he has had to say in relation to the skills base in this country. I am not certain where the member has been in the last couple of years but I suggest he looks at the number of apprentices who now have been engaged. It is a record number. The government has placed great emphasis on these areas because we recognise that the apprenticeship system is so important to this country. Certainly, in the vocation that I come from, it got to the stage where you could not get skilled people to work for you. It is very difficult indeed, and we need to continue to enhance the skills base in this country. In relation to unemployment, yes, the budget papers have indicated that by and large in the next 12 months unemployment will remain about where it is at the moment. I think you should look in the longer term, at what might happen after the next 12 months. I would put to you that there will be a continuing downturn in the number of unemployed in this country and that will be welcomed by both your side of the House and ours. In relation to this bill, the government has embarked on a review of redundant acts and there are probably 90 to 100 of those. There has to be some housekeeping from time to time. I think that in housekeeping we find some things that quite raise our eyebrows. This particular act is 53 years old and perhaps it is time now-the government believes it is time-that it should be retired and taken off the statute books. That is the reason for the bill before the Main Committee this morning. Certainly, the government recognises that the particular act served its purpose well after World War II. It certainly aided the transitional arrangements after the",177,Representatives Main Commitiee
276,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (11.24 A.m.),"I welcome the support this morning from theWednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 5291 war. It aided servicemen who had gained experience during the war in having their skills recognised and it certainly helped in the resettlement of those servicemen. It is my understanding that by about 1951 the object of the original act was achieved. It did continue. Its value has been that it has enabled nationally accepted trade qualifications to be issued underneath it. We are currently running a parallel system. We have got this particular old act operating and we have got a new national framework called the Australian Recognition Framework. The new framework is in line with the reform processes that the government has been putting in place over the last four years, and they have worked very successfully indeed. You have to recognise that you do not stay living in the past, that you move forward, that you look for new and better ways of doing things, and, certainly across many facets of workplace relations, the government has put in some marvellous reforms. The Job Network in my area has done wonderfully well, much better than the old CES system did, and it is a tribute to the kinds of things that you can achieve if you look at meaningful reform processes. I am confident that the Australian Recognition Framework will, in fact, be a suitable vehicle to replace the current act that we are considering repealing today; Certainly, the services that can be provided under the Australian Recognition Framework can now be delivered on a nationally consistent and competitive basis. I note that the old act applied predominantly to the metal and electrical trades-and, of course, I have some experience in those. It was always very difficult when you had someone come to you to be employed in electronics, which is the field that I was in, to make sure that their qualifications were consistent and their abilities were well understood. In relation to the amendment that has been moved by the member for Batman, I would say that it is simply not necessary to slow down this bill now. I fear that what we are seeing in the Senate-the frustration, the roadblock and the logjam-might be coming to the House of Representatives side of the parliament because the transitional arrangements will be looked at by a Senate committee. That will be looked at in a timely manner. It will take some time for this bill to ultimately get to the Senate. We on this side of the House think that there is plenty of time to make sure that those transitional arrangements are settled. We would suggest to the other side of the House that it is not necessary to amend this particular bill today and we will be opposing that amendment because we do not wanno see this bill further delayed. I therefore commend the bill to the Main Committee. Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.30 a.m.)-I rise to support the amendment as detailed by the member for Batman. I must say that I disagree somewhat with the member for Herbert. The issue is not slowing down the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Repeal Bill 1999; rather it is making sure that when the bill is enacted, when it does become law, it will work and the proper transitional arrangements are in place. It is not about leaving things to chance; it is about making sure that the replacement procedures really work. The Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act has played a very important role in Australia and has contributed enormously to the reconstruction of Australia post World War II and to the employment opportunities and well-being of many Australian workers. There are many Australian workers who have returned from war and Australians who have immigrated to Australia and become Australian citizens. It applies to the metal, electrical and shoe trades, as has already been mentioned by other speakers. The act came into effect in 1946 as one of the components of Australia's postwar reconstruction. As the member for Batman noted, it 5292 MAIN COMMTITEE Wednesday, 12 May 1999 was an initiative of the Chifley Labor government. It assisted soldiers who had made an enormous contribution to Australia's war effort to return to their pre-war trades-trades that had changed somewhat and trades that they had been absent from for some time. It also recognised the new skills that these troops had developed while they had been in the Australian armed forces. The act was further extended in 1952 to cover migrants and to recognise overseas qualifications. I believe this is a very important role because there is a great variation in the qualifications workers receive in overseas countries. On paper they do not translate uniformly. Also, what can appear to be a very high, detailed qualification overseas, when it is actually compared to the Australian qualifications, does not match and is not of the same standard. When we are looking at industry and workers, we want to make sure that people who are employed in Australia have proper skills. We do not want to see the skill base of our work force in any way debased. Also, we want to make sure that those workers who are working in trades such as the metal trades and electrical trades do not cause any danger to other workers. There is also an occupational health and safety issue when you are looking at the skills that workers take to the work force. We must make sure that people working in electrical and metal trades are not going to endanger their fellow workers and are not going to endanger themselves. I just touch on that briefly; t will deal with that a little more later. The Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act was reviewed in 1995. As a result of that review it was recommended that it be replaced by adequate training and assessment processes and that they should be in place before the act is repealed. I believe that the transitional arrangements are absolutely imperative. If they are not in place and if we do not have adequate assessments in place it can put the whole process in jeopardy. As I mentioned at the start, it is not a matter of slowing it down; it is a matter of making sure that it will work and that those people who are currently involved in the process are not going to be disadvantaged. The other concern I have is in relation to the registered training organisations. I believe that we have to be very careful that these organisations have the necessary expertise. We have all seen with the tendering process that took place in Job Network how organisations that did not have the necessary expertise were granted tenders. It was the unemployed workers in Australia who were gravely disadvantaged. I have recently been talking to a constituent in my electorate who completed a training course by one of these 'fly-by-night' job placement organisations that received a tender in the first round of the Job Network process. This person received a qualification and was employed, then lost the job. That person was out of pocket to the tune of $1,000. We must make sure that those sorts of incidents do not happen here. We must make sure that those people assessing the qualifications of people seeking to have their qualifications recognised meet the Australian standards. . The other thing that I am also a little concerned about is the assessment process. Pen and paper assessments are fine and they need to be completed. But in an area like electrical and metal trades, it is also extremely important that a person has the practical expertise. It is no good recognising the skills of somebody in the electrical trade who does not have the practical expertise or the ability to perform those tasks. Quite often, the only way that you can assess that is through doing a practical assessment and not through the pen and paper examination. I am concerned that, by not giving due concern to the issues that have been raised by the member for Batman and by not making sure that the transitional arrangements are in place, Wednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 5293 it will affect workers within those industries and will erode the skill base of Australia's work force. I feel that it is time to change. It is necessary that the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act 1946 be repealed. It has served its time. It has really contributed to Australia's development and reconstruction, but now we need something that is in line with our current training and apprenticeship schemes. The only way this will happen is if the process goes through the proper procedures. This will happen only if the transitional arrangements are in place. With those words of caution, I conclude my comments. In doing so, I urge members to support the amendment. to repeal-the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act 1946--is now 53 years old. With the progressive evolution of skills training over those years, that 1946 act has outlived its relevance and its usefulness. As previous speakers have enunciated, it had a very real role to play postwar in assisting returned servicemen going back to resume their civilian lives, and for others such as migrants and so on. The repeal of the act was a result of a major review of its current relevance. That inquiry concluded that a large proportion of the provisions of the act had become obsolete and no longer had any useful purpose. It also concluded that domestic training reforms, particularly the development and the implementation of arrangements for skill assessment and the issuing of national qualifications under the Australian Recognition Framework, were removing the underlying rationale for the act. The thing that tells the story is the use and the number of applicants. In 1997-98, there were only 1,218 applicants compared to 1991-92 with 5,249 and 1982-83 with 10,142. Clearly, the rationale for the act has been eroded to the point where its existence is no longer warranted. Nonetheless, the rights of small-in fact, diminishing-numbers of people should never be overlooked or ignored. The government has quite rightly given an undertaking that transitional arrangements will be put in place to allow the finalisation of any applications outstanding at the time the act is repealed. That undertaking is very welcome. It is also important to note that all state and territory governments-including state Labor governments-support the ARF. Of course, the states and territories have the major role in its implementation and they appreciate that continuation of the current act would be counter to the direction of vocational education and training policy agreed to by all governments. I note that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry also support the repeal of this legislation. I spoke earlier of the need for a sensitive transition to the new arrangements after the abolition of the 1946 act. The review committee did identify a range of implementation and transition issues which will need to be resolved before a firm time frame for the cessation of activities under the TRR act can be identified. These issues were outside the scope of the review and will need to be taken up in the implementation of any government decisions flowing from it. It surely is cumbersome, confusing and inefficient to have different systems to recognise all of the various trades. Under existing arrangements, Trades Recognition Australia, which administers the 1946 act, provides the trades assessment and recognition service for a long list of skills in the metal and electrical trades from armature winder to welder first class, in the areas of blacksmithing, sheet metal, engineering and boiler making.

It begs the question: why should there be a dual system? Naturally, the government has moved to ensure that there is a single and efficient system. I agree wholeheartedly with the minister that the Commonwealth has no place ultimately in the migration skills assessment field and that assessmeni.., should be undertaken on a free competition basis directly by registered training organisations established under the act. The government has laid down stringent criteria, which would allow RTOs to be eligible for this task, and I believe the criteria will be acceptable to employers, unions and the community generally. I am sure we are all aware of the critical importance of ensuring that all tradespeople, irrespective of the origin of their training, meet the same uniformly high standards. One of the key criteria is the establishment of a broad based consultative committee, including industry and community representatives, whom the government would consult on the criteria for selecting RTOs and in monitoring their performance. The active involvement of industry and community representatives in this important work will not only ensure that the very highest standards are established and maintained but, equally importantly, allay any fears that substandard qualifications are being accepted. The trades training system that has d-veloped in Australia over the past 50 years has provided us with an extremely capable and well-skilled work force. We can all rightly regard our tradespeople generally as being professional and well suited for their task. I do not believe there is a sound reason for the amendment that the opposition have proposed. The minister has taken into account the sensitive needs of a transitional phase, and I am very pleased to give my support to this bill. 1946 was first introduced to recognise the skills of workers not fomlally trained as tradespeople to fill trade skill shortages which arose from the rapid expansion of defence industries as part of the war effort and from the enlistment of qualified tradespeople into the defence forces. The Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act is administered by Trades Recognition Australia, which provides a trade skills assessment and recognition service in prescribed trades for permanent Australian residents. Trades Recognition Australia is part of the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. It is operated nationally, with offices in each state and territory. The postwar migration boom raised the need for a means of assessing and recognising the trade skills of migrants so that they could be fully utilised. The Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act was amended in 1952 to meet this need. The amendments changed the prime focus of the act from the recognition of domestic trades skills to those of migrants. The Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act 1946 is the national mechanism for the recognition of metal and electrical trade skills developed through iIiformal training on the job, training in the Australian defence forces, and formal training or experience on the job overseas. In recent times these sources of skills acquisition accounted for 10 per cent, 15 per cent and 75 per cent of TRA applicants respectively. Almost half of Australia's tradespeople are in occupations covered by the act. Central trades committees at the national level determine criteria for recognition and broad matters of policy. They consider applications for pre-migration assessment of trade skills from prospective migrants, and they undertake internal reviews of decisions by local trades committees and skills advisers. These trades-qualified departmental officers-the skills",181,Representatives Main Committee
278,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (11.44 A.m.),"The Tradesmen's Rights Regulation ActWednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 5295 advisers-who are also accredited workplace assessors under the. National Training Board standards, assist the committees by undertaking initial assessment of applications and preparing documentation for their consideration. Australian recognised trades certificates are accepted by employers and unions as the equivalent of the completion of an Australian apprenticeship and are accepted by the TAPE system for entry in post-trade courses. The Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act serves three important functions. It facilitates harmonious industrial relations in the metal and electrical areas by providing an agreed means for recognising trade skills and avoiding disputes over access to types of work and wage levels. It facilitates labour mobility and the efficient operation of the labour market by assuring employers about the skills of their workers, and contributes to the development of the skill base of the work force by facilitating access to further training and by increasing the number of qualified tradespeople legally able to train apprentices. It ensures appropriate points for skill are allocated to prospective migrants as part of the migration process, and facilitates postarrival settlement. To be eligible for recognition, applicants must provide evidence that they are capable of performing the full range of trade duties normally undertaken by, and to the same level of skill as, a tradesperson in Australia. The assessment process examines the qualifications held and the scope and nature of the work undertaken by applicants, through a combination of documentation, interviews in Australia and overseas, on the job inspection and trade tests. Formal training criteria for the trades, identifying training equivalent to formal training, has been developed for at least 44 countries. For non-criteria countries, the criterion is that the applicant is able to demonstrate that they have a minimum period of experience performing the full range of work, and to the level of skill ordinarily done by an Australian tradesperson, and that they are capable of performing that work in Australia. The minimum periods are six years for the metal trades and seven years for the electrical trades. A major streamlining of the TRA process occurred in 1989 through a greater reliance on documentary evidence and by computerising the initial assessment. The process to adopt competency based assessment began in 1994. The crucial factor in this was the support for change from the tripartite central trades committees and the TRA skills advisers. Today the majority of applicants are assessed solely on the basis of documents. This looks at formal qualifications, the length of relevant experience, and the scope and nature of that experience. TRA clients pay a fee to have their skills assessed. The application fee is currently $390. If the service is to remain accessible to people, the fee must be kept as low as possible. As the current fee only covers about 40 per cent of TRA's running costs, with the rest coming from government funding, it does represent a significant subsidy to applicants paid for by Australian taxpayers. It is also important that the cost to budget be kept as low as possible. According to the most recent available statistics, from October 1997, the full year overseas application level was about 3,000. In December 1998 a report of the legislation review of the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act 1946 was presented to the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. The committee found that, while the TRR Act has played an important part in the operation of the skilled labour market and the settlement of skilled migrants into the work force, a large proportion of the provisions in the act have become obsolete and domestic training changes are removing the underlying rationale for the act. 5296 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 12 May 1999 The committee concluded that TRA's reassessment methodology and procedures for domestic recognition and migration assessment have generally been valid, reliable, accurate, fair and efficient in the context of the TRR Act and the general domestic training and industrial environment in which it has operated. During the 1990s there have been significant fee increases, but clients are still not paying full cost recovery. The TRR Act has not imposed direct costs on employers, but has provided benefits to them through reduced recruitment and operational costs. The TRR Act has also provided benefits to individual clients in the community, and the committee reported that there is a high level of satisfaction on the part of individual clients, individual employers and industry in general. In relation to the migration skills assessment function of the TRA, the committee's conclusions were essentially the same as for the domestic program. That is, the TRA has provided benefits to employers through reduced costs in recruitment and operational costs. It has provided benefits to the community by ensuring successful migrants have the appropriate skills. It has provided benefits to individual clients by assisting them in their post-arrival settlement, by providing them with a high level of confidence about the recognition and acceptance of their skills in Australia. There is a high level of satisfaction with the TRA on the part of individual clients, individual employers, industry, the migrant community and, indeed, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Those things notwithstanding, the committee recommended repeal of the act. It said that one of the reasons it did so was that the net trend for migration skills assessment has been downwards over the course of the 1990s as a result of changes to the size, composition and administration of the migration program. I join the previous opposition speaker, the member for Shortland, in expressing some words of caution. I wonder whether the report has adequately taken into account whether there is likely to be increasing pressure on the federal government from all states and territories for additional skilled migration in the immediate future. Moreover, it seems to me that there is likely to be a need for us to rely less on documentation as the sole means of verification if it is possible that forged documents will emerge from non-criteria countries. The committee concluded that assessment should be undertaken by skills assessors who meet the requirements of the relevant training programs engaged on a fee-for-service basis. Currently, clients pay $390 when they tender their application. If fee for service is introduced and there is a free-for-all in this area, you could have applicants facing charges of up to or even in excess of $3,000, which would be well beyond the capacity of most Australian residents, let alone prospective migrants. I tum now to the circumstances surrounding the review. It is my understanding that most of the bodies which were asked during that process of evaluation said that they were happy with the system. I note that migrant organisations may be concerned by the changes because they could lead to migrants being inconvenienced by the new arrangements and even having to pay exorbitant costs. During the review, Trades Recognition Australia had offices in every state, but they are being dismantled before this legislation is passed. I understand that there were 12 officers in Canberra handling overseas cases but that has now been reduced to two or three, that where there were seven officers in Victoria there are now two, and that there have been similar reductions in other states. So three or four in New South WalesI think now are going to one; Wednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 5297 three or four in Queensland, now two; and the one person in South Australia, the one in Western Australia and the one in the Northern Territory have all left on packages. Further to this effective dismantling of Trades Recognition Australia, it has been alleged to me that the director, Mr Glen Newton, was eroding the TRA services essentially from the time he took up his appointment in 1991, that he was involved in helping to select the committee members for the review and that, whilst the review was under way, he formed a company and registered a training organisation of his own. He was the head of the secretariat supporting the committee, according to appendix C of the report, but whilst the review was under way he trained people with public funds to later recruit them for his own company. According to my information, while the review was being carried out, as head of the secretariat conducting the review-or at least in a private capacity-he sent letters to some staff seeking expressions of interest to work for his company. During the course of the review the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs was told that their department had the capacity to carry out the premigration assessments. They were told that the overseas classifications unit would take over the role despite the fact that the unit would prefer the current arrangements to remain. According to information given to me, the registered training organisation established by Mr Newton has tendered to do the TRA job and it is also my understanding that Mr Newton has taken a package from the department with the intention of reappearing, doing the same work as a successful tenderer to the government as the head of an outsourcing company. The question that arises here is: will the taxpayer be better off by this kind of arrangement? I have to say that I do not think that it is appropriate that the director responsible for tradesmen recognition in Australia could be seeking expressions of interest from his staff with a view to offering them work for his company while he is still a director. I think that if this has happened then it has damaged the credibility of the department and the review process. It has also been alleged that Mr Newton, as a director, damaged the integrity of practices within the TRA that had been built up over a period of many years. For example, it had been the custom and practice to inform applicants if their proposed application had little or no chance of success, thereby saving them the fee of $390. So in the past, applicants were told not to waste their money if they had little chance of success. Under instructions from Mr Newton, officers in the department were told not to give the applicants any information. They were specifically told not to give free assessments. You have the situation where the department is seeking to effectively maximise its income at the expense of clients. Similarly, in the past, unemployed people did not have to pay if they wished to make an application. This practice was also changed and we had a move to full cost recovery with a new fee structure being introduced by the minister for workplace relations. This included an assessment costing $390 and a trade test, if required, costing $270. If an application is unsuccessful because the requirements have not been 'met, then the charge is the average of the trade test fees. I am concerned to ensure that these fees do not increase dramatically to an excess of $3,000 per person-well beyond the reach of most applicants. I further note that it has been alleged that Mr Newton issued a direction that assessors be able to reject applications rather than send them to the tripartite committees. Originally we had a process where the assessors provided advice to the committee with a recommendation. The skills assessors were then given the authority to refuse applications, which obviously meant that the applications did not go on to the tripartite committee. A consequence of all of 5298 MAIN COMMITfEE Wednesday, 12 May 1999 these changes has been that the application rate has dried up because no information has been provided at the counter. Migrant organisations may well be concerned by these changes, and the legislation should not pass until the community and industry have had an opportunity to respond to the report. I think that these concerns need to be put before a proper review process and properly aired so that those who want to have their skills recognised and would have done so under this system are not disadvantaged, and that is why I strongly support the opposition's amendment. (11.59 a.m.)-in reply-I thank all the members who have contributed to this debate on the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Repeal Bill 1999. I thank them for their interest and the comments they have made. I appreciate the fact that many people have been associated with this system for many years. We appreciate the work and commitment that they have undertaken over a long period of time. The government, in reviewing these matters, has received certain advice from the committee which was established to review the act. It is very clear that the introduction of the Australian Recognition Framework from 1 January 1998 has removed the underlying rationale for the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act 1946. That is the basis upon which we are proceeding. It is a reflection not on the work that has been done, but simply that the passage of time and the establishment of this new framework have rendered the act no longer relevant. Therefore, we are proposing to the parliament the repeal of the underlying legislation. In respect of the proposal of those opposite that the introduction of the repeal be delayed, I understand their concerns about transition arrangements. I think their concerns are validly made and I think we do need to look at transition arrangements carefully. You need to understand, too, that time has moved on a bit. When the review was undertaken, the ARF was about to start, but it now has started and we have had the passage of time since. I think the concerns about transition have been rather overcome by the sequence of events and the passage of time which has since elapsed. The bill does, however, provide for regulations to make transitional and savings provisions. The member for Batman, for example, will be consulted on the draft regulations-as will employer and employee organisations and other interested parties. We think a better way to manage this is to involve the interested parties in the consultations on the regulations, rather than delaying the passage of the legislation. The regulations will allow for resolution of applications lodged before repeal. As I say, the framework is now already in place and I think we have before us every reason to be confident that there can be a smooth transfer. I understand the issue about the cost raised by the member for Wills, but of course this reflects the fact that the numbers have been decreasing so, in a system where there is some reimbursement by applicants, the fact is that there are upward pressures on cost. In fact you would be facing higher costs if we were not to make the changes that we are proposing. Mr Deputy Speaker, in our view, continuation of the act would be inconsistent with the national recognition of vocational education and training policies and initiatives, which have been agreed between the Commonwealth, states and territories. That is a very important point to make. The establishment of the ARF is a joint effort. It is giving Australia a modern system, and the Commonwealth, in its participation in that, I think has certain underlying or consequent",182,Representatives Main Commi Itee
279,Mr Reith (Flinders,"Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business)Wednesday, 12 May 1999 MAIN COMMIITEE 5299 obligations. The approach that we have taken to the tradesmen's rights legislation is the right one, given what is happening nationally and what has been agreed, as I say, between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories. Opposition members are concerned about premigration assessment for migration purposes, which is not affected by this bill. I should note that existing arrangements for assessment by Trades Recognition Australia of migrants overseas already do not require on-the-job assessment, so this is not something which will change. Their concerns, therefore, I do not believe are well founded. Opposition members are concerned about integrity issues where assessors receive fees for services and whether recognised training organisations are capable of on-the-job assessment. These are issues to be considered by the Senate committee. We have initiated or certainly welcomed the establishment of that Senate committee and I am sure they will look at some of these issues. It should be noted that the Australian Recognition Framework does include quality assurance and audit arrangements in which the states and teqitories have key roles. I should also say, in respect of the claims made by the member for Wills in respect of Mr Newton, to my knowledge he is a respected officer in the Australian Public Service. I think there are implications in the comments from the member for Wills which are entirely unjustified for somebody who has worked hard for the Commonwealth as a public servant for a long time. He is well respected. What you mentioned in fact raised no allegations of impropriety. Obviously I will have a look at what you have had to say but there is absolutely no basis for what you have said, and I think it is pretty inappropriate that you should get stuck into a respected public servant who has worked very hard in this area for a long time. I do appreciate the interest that members have in this, but we have followed through in a very open process. The committee did a good job in reviewing the legislation. I believe that we are following the right course. We are happy to talk to the opposition and other interested parties about the transitional arrangements. There is a process to make sure that is done professionally and in a competent way. On that basis, I commend the bill to the House. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. I will put the report question forthwith. The question is that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.
