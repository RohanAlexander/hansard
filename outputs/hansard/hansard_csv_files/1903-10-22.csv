In my journeys through Australia. I have-been enabled to see for myself how wonderful the resources-ho w rich the products of your country are, and how splendidly loyal are the people. I have full belief that United Australia will take a high and worthy rank among the nations of the world, and add her contribution to the welfare and the glories of the British race, and aid the mother.country to fulfil her great Imperial mission. 22nd October, 1903. &8 October, 1908.

10,Mr Poynton,"I desire to make a-fchis House. I -wish it to be clearly under-sfcood that I had no such idea in my mind. I fully acknowledge the good work which bas been done, both in State and Federal politics, by the right honourable and learned member for South Australia, and I have nofc the slightest reason to cast any reflecfcion in a general way upon the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. Minister for Home Affairs, I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether he will take the House into his confidence at the .earliest possible date in regard to the -electoral rolls of Yackandandah, and whether he considers that a horse's nosebag is a proper receptacle for the rolls of the free and independent electors of both -sexes 1 Would he treat the plans for the transcontinental railway in the same manner 1 I should further like to know whether we will give the House an opportunit y to recover and purify these parliamentary rolls at an early date ? to be in my electorate, and, although I am intensely grateful to the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne for taking an interest in that town, I wish to assure him that it was one of those places to which I specifically referred -the other this subject. to the Minister for Home Affairs who took a special note of it . I thoroughly agree that a good deal of confusion has -occurred in regard to the rolls, and in that locality, as well as in others, their rectification is undoubtedly necessary. I strongly urge that so important a matter, not merely to candidates, but to the whole of Australia, should receive attention at the hands of the Minister. That is only one instance in which there has been confusion. All around Wodonga, and various other -towns in the same electorateI do not think it is necessary fco give their names-the immediate and earnest attention of the Government is required to the remedy of existing evils. Sir PHILIPFYSH (Tasmania-Post master-General) -In the absence of fche -Minister for Home Affairs, I can suggesfc no other remedy at the present moment than to summon the offending horse to fche Bar of fche House. I presume fchat it has eaten up the Yackandandah rolls, under the impression that they were chaff. that these rolls have probably disappeared owing to the absence of horse-feed in the particular town referred to, will the Government consider the advisability of suspending fche fodder duties t Minister for Defence, whether the civilian officials in his Department are fco be compelled to join the Defence Forces and wear uniform, and, if so, by whose authority ? In speaking of this matter the other evening, I was in error in stating that the clerks in the Department were to be compelled to join the militia forces. As a matter of fact, no compulsion is being directly applied, but an endeavour is being made to achieve the same result in an indirect way. A General Order statesIt is, however, most essential that all responsible omcers in the Ordnance Department should have the status of officers or non-commissioned officers, and employees in the Department cannot look for advancement to positions of responsibility unless they have military status. evening when discussing I desire to ask the Minister whether he I submitted the name approves of the adoption of the course proposed, and if not, whether he will inform the House what action he intends fco take 1 fche honourable member's question, I desire to say thafc no instructions to thafc effect have been given.
