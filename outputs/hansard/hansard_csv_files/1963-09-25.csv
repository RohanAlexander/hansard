Petition received. | \ Minister whether he has read a statement by Sir Philip McBride, a former Minister for Defence and currently president of the Liberal Party of Australia, in these terms: "" Australia's cost structure has been moving steadily and remorselessly against the wool grower, and in recent years wool-growers have been gripped in a cost-price squeeze "". Wool-growers have expressed grave concern to me about this trend and have asked that assistance be given them in the important wool promotion campaign. In view of the statement by Sir Philip McBride, what does the Prime Minister intend to do to assist this important industry? Will he make a statement immediately indicating the Government's intention to help wool promotion, as proposed b'y the Labour Party? had an opportunity to read what Sir Philip raised and give him an answer subseMcBride said, although I am sure that if quently. I had heard him I would have listened to him, as I usually do, with very great respect. I gather from what the honourable member said that Sir Philip was making some reference to the operation of the terms of trade in recent years in relation to Australia's exports of primary products. If so, all I can say is that such a statement said very frequently by my colleague, the Aborigines. Minister for Trade, and from time to time -and I hope not without some effect-by me. Territories give the House any information about the Pacific Games held recently in Fiji? Were any of the Territories under games? tories of Papua and New Guinea and Nauru were both represented at the Pacific Games which were held earlier this month in Fiji. The games were attended by teams from all of the Pacific territories and most of the well-recognized sports such as athletics, swimming, boxing, tennis and basketball were contested. From the reports I have received, it was a most successful gathering, not only in the sportsmanship WOOL. displayed but also in providing a meeting place for the people of the Pacific. They had an opportunity to get to know each other and to compete against each other. I am very glad to say that the two teams from our Territories distinguished themselves in a way of which we can be proud. Immigration: What inquiries, if any, were made by his department before permitting Sydney's mutilation murderer, William Macdonald, to migrate to Australia from the United Kingdom?

A being proceeded with? arc planned for operation in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. One will bc located at Carnarvon and thc other one al Darwin. In general terms, they have been located according to certain technical requirements of thc National Aeronautics and Space Administration. They are to be used principally in connection wilh observation and control of thc forthcoming Rendezvous space vehicle tests, and for control of orbiting astronomical and geophysical satellites which will be launched in the near future. The station at Carnarvon is finished except for the installation of equipment. The station which is to be established at Darwin will require no buildings. It will consist of two instrumented vans, which will require thc construction of only hard-standing areas and an antennae system. Both the stations should be ready for operation in thc very near future. the Minister for Air. The honourable gentleman knows of thc acrobatic team, the "" Telstars"", which is based at the Royal Australian Air Force aerodrome at Sale in Gippsland, Victoria. Has he had an opportunity to see this team in action? If so, can he say how it compares with similar teams of the Royal Air Force and United Slates Air Force? to see the "" Telstars"" in action at Laverton one day last week and they were witnessed by a very large number of people. I think something like 80,000 or 90,000 people attended that display. During Air Force Week the "" Telstars"" demonstrated before a total of about 130,000 people. They were formed to replace the "" Red Sails"" team which was lost tragically at about this time last j'ear. I feel that the demonstration by the "" Telstars"" at Laverton was of a very high order, particularly in view of thc fact that they had been together for only a very short time and spent only part of their time doing acrobatics. I think ihat they are in world class in the sphere of acrobatic teams. Minister for Territories regarding a commission on tertiary education set up in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea to prepare natives for senior administrative positions within the Territory. Can he say what progress this commission has made and when we are likely to hear something more of it? the honourable member I think he has two different activities mixed up. There is a commission on higher education, under the chairmanship of Sir George Currie, which is inquiring into the needs and lhe best way of meeting the needs for tertiary education in the Territory. That commission has been proceeding with its work for several months and is expected to present a report before the end of this calendar year. 1 have no means yet of knowing what will he in the report, but when it is received the Government will give it the most careful consideration. With regard to thc preparation of native people for higher positions in the I address my question to Administration of Papua and New Guinea, two major activities are under way at the present time. One is the reconstruction of the Public Service so that it will be composed predominantly of indigenous public servants, with the assistance of the Australian public servants as auxiliaries. The other move is the establishment of the Administrative Staff College. It is possible that the Administrative Staff College will eventually fit into the established pattern of higher education recommended by the Currie commission, but, without waiting for the report of that commission, the Administrative Staff College has been brought into operation and is preparing people for higher appointments. In addition to that, in each of the functional departments, such as education, health and police, there are training colleges now in operation preparing people for higher appointments.",12,Immigration

Minister for Trade relating to the committees that were established earlier this year by the parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to formulate proposals for the future marketing of cereals and meat. I ask the Minister whether he has received any progress reports of the activities of those committees. If so, has he any information on those matters that he can give to the House? mation. The honourable member and the House will know that part of President Kennedy's proposals for freer world trading was that, concurrent with the reduction of tariffs, there should be improved access for the products of primary industries, and of agriculture in particular. To this end, the ministerial meeting of Gatt last May decided that a committee on cereals and a committee on meat should be appointed and that later a committee on dairy products should be established. The committees on cereals and on meat, which are separate committees, have met and have had preliminary discussions. Australia is represenPort Augusta is that applications for rail ted on each of those committees, as it will be, in due course, on the dairy products committee. It is not expected that there will be fast and conclusive decisions by these committees, but I can say that the progress which they have made up to the present time gives me some ground for optimism that useful results will flow from them. It is intended that the conclusions of these committees shall not stand alone but will ultimately become part and parcel of the total proposals of Presimodation for drivers, and the complaints dent Kennedy.

Shipping and Transport whether he is aware of reports of dissatisfaction among interstate road hauliers with the pick-a-back service being provided on the Trans-Australian Railway from Port Augusta. If there is any substance in these reports, can the Minister assure the House that the transport of goods to or from Western Australia will be expedited on this line? criticism that has been directed against the pick-a-back service. It appeared in a newspaper report which, with all due respect to the Fourth Estate, was rather embellished. The position of the pick-a-back service at truck space have to be made in advance. If this is done and if the vehicles arrive on time, there is no delay. The Commonwealth Railways inaugurated the pick-a-back service and are especially proud of it. The service is under constant review so that a high standard of efficiency will be maintained and goods will be cleared. My inquiries reveal that at present the service is at its highest state of efficiency. However, there have been complaints about the accomare justified.

On this point, I can say that in the last year, as the invited I am not as well informed on what appears guest of a large gathering of automobile manufacturers, I have said that the Government did not set out to protect and nurture a car manufacturing industry in Australia only to discover that many of the parts that could be made here were being imported.

I preface my question by inviting the Minister's attention to the fact that this is the only repatriation benefit that is not paid in advance.

But I want to tell him that I will be most surprised if what he has just said is a fair representation of anything that was said by Sir Alan Westerman. addressed to the Minister for Repatriation. By way of preface, I point out that the Repatriation Commission's annual report for 1962-63 has set out some information about the scheme for the education of children of deceased and seriously handicapped ex-servicemen sponsored by the Repatriation Department. I ask: Can the Minister inform the House whether details of this scheme are available to those who are directly interested and to appropriate organizations and, if so, where can such further information be obtained?

The flow of water through the dam is controlled in two ways -first , by the sluice gates or sluice valves beneath the wall, which were formally closed last Friday; and secondly, by the hinged gates on top of the wall, which are designed to help control flood waters. The work on the hinged gates has not been completed, as it has not been possible to test them under working conditions. First, the clearing of the lake bed must be finished and the filling of the lake must be timed so that the gates can be tested in due course. Because of the rains, work on the lake bed could not be completed before last Friday's ceremony, and it has been necessary to release some water through the valves that I closed then. This was always in contemplation, because it is not intended completely to cut off .the must flow below the dam and from time to time water will flow through those valves.

JOHNSON -My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that many young family men are experiencing difficulty in raising deposits large enough to enable them to attract housing loans from lending authorities? Is the Prime Minister aware that this problem has been overcome to a considerable extent in New Zealand by the provisions of the Family Benefits Home Ownership Act 1958? Has any consideration been given to instituting a similar plan in Australia so that young couples may capitalize child endowment for expenditure on any matter associated wilh the purchase of a home? fess to speak with knowledge of this matter, but I shall be very happy to refer the suggestion made by the honourable member to my appropriate colleague or colleagues. Minister for Immigration been directed to a statement made in this House yesterday by thc honourable member for Mitchell? The honourable member referred to a tabic in the ""Australian Demographic Review No. 167 "", which he interpreted to mean that nearly 50 per cent, of the migrants who have come to this country have returned to their homelands. In view of the fact that such ill-informed statements can do a tremendous amount of harm to our immigration programme, will the Minister inform the House of the correct percentage of migrants who have returned to their homelands? night when the honourable member for Mitchell was speaking. I have a high regard for his capacity and intelligence, and I was rather surprised that he should make so loose a statement. Of course, what he said is not true. My honourable friend from Henty, very properly, has directed the attention of the House to the statement. In fact, the whole experience of the Departbeen that between 93 and 94 per cent, of the migrants-the real migrant settlerswho have come to Australia and stayed here for a period of five years have remained. The departure rate for British migrants in recent years has been between 9 and 10 per cent., and the departure rate for migrants from the continent of Europe has been approximately 3 per cent. Although those ngures are good from our point of view, they could be improved upon, because in the sphere of the administration of these great national schemes there is probably no such thing as absolute perfection. None the less, I think honourable members will be glad to know that, according to my own researches, no other country in the world has as low a migrant return rate as Australia has. That should give honourable members cause for great satisfaction. It certainly does ill-service to our highly successful migration programme if I would like to think it is through misinformation or inadvertencea member of this House misrepresents the position. aware that a Japanese organization known as Japex is about to drill for oil in Australia?

In all these arrangements, and in any to be made, the usual rule will apply that the employment of Australian forces remains under the control of the Australian Government. We have acted and will continue to act consistently with the Charter of the United Nations. But Malaysia, the new nation, is here. The processes of its creation have been democratic. The United Nations Secretary General, having appointed suitable persons as examiners, reported that the people of North Borneo and Sarawak desired incorporation into Malaysia. The Prime Minister of Singapore, one of the great sponsors of Malaysia, has just received an overwhelming endorsement at the polls. We have publicly and unambiguously said that we support Malaysia which is, never let it be forgotten, a Commonwealth country, just as our own is. Should there be any attempts to destroy or weaken Malaysia by subversion or invasion, what should Australia do about it? We know that the United Kingdom accepts, in substance, the position of a military guarantor. Honourable members now know the terms of our own recent exchange of notes. The Government of Malaysia has said clearly that this exchange is completely satisfactory to it. But it has not been the normal practice of Commonwealth countries to spell out in detail their sense of mutual obligation, nor to confine themselves to legal formulae. For example, our vital engagements with the United Kingdom are not written or in any way formalized. Yet we know and she knows that in this part of the world we look to her, and she looks to us. Wc each apply in a spirit of mutual confidence a golden rule of mutual obligation. But for the benefit of all concerned, honourable members would not wish me to create or permit any ambiguity about Australia's position in relation to Malaysia. 1 therefore, after close deliberation by the Cabinet, and on its behalf, inform the House that we are resolved, and have so informed the Government of Malaysia, and the Governments of the United Kingdom and New Zealand and others concerned, that if, in the circumstances that now exist, and which may continue for a long time, there occurs, in relation to Malaysia or any of its constituent States, armed invasion or subversive activity-supporte d or directed or inspired from outside Malaysia-w e shall to the best of our powers and by such means as shall be agreed upon with the Government of Malaysia, add our military assistance to the efforts of Malaysia and the United Kingdom in the defence of Malaysia's territorial integrity and political independence.

The measure flows directly from an act of this Parliament, passed in 1945, assenting to the War Service Land Settlement Agreement. Under the terms of that agreement there was -set up all the machinery then considered essential to enable the respective State Governments to settle on the land numbers of men who had returned or would return from war service, under conditions that would enable them to earn comfortable livings during their lifetimes.

54,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [3.26],"This isbetween itself and the six State Governments, did not seek the authorization of this Parliament for the agreement until a vast amount of preliminary investigation and inquiry had been made. A most competent and experienced body of men was appointed by the Government as a committee to investigate and make recommendations. The committee members had the great advantage of having available to them all the experience which the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments of the period following the 1914-1918 war had gained under the scheme which operated after the close of hostilities in 1918. I need hardly remind honourable members that the experience of the various State Governments and the Commonwealth Government in relation to land settlement of returned soldiers after World WarI was, to put it mildly, that the scheme had been rather disastrous. Perhaps disaster was inevitable. It is not my intention to apportion blame for all the failures that occurred. Land settlement for returned soldiers was then an entirely new matter. Some of the State Governments were more incompetent than others. The main causes of the failure of the scheme at that time were excessively high land valuations, areas inadequate to enable men to make satisfactory livings and meet their commitments, excessively high rates of interest and, equally important if not more important, the disastrous fall in the 1930's of the prices of primary products. types of land or men were selected. mentioned other factors. In the main, however, the factors that resulted in failure were favorable conditions have operated in Ausnot of a personal character, within the control of the men involved. The experience gained from the period after World WarI . fortunately was available to governments after World War II . and enabled them to make plans to protect more adequately the prospective soldier settlers of that time. The assumed that the repatriation of ex-servicemen, as far as land settlement was concerned, came legally within the defence powers of the Commonwealth. However, it recognized that State governments had sovereign powers over the land, had officers experienced in land apportionment and control and, more important still, had in their agricultural departments officers trained in the skills of agriculture, which they could impart to settlers. It was decided that the three States which were most prosperous and best equipped to carry on land settlement would be known as the principal States. They were Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. It-was realized that Western Australia, Tasmania and South Australia were relatively weak in the economic sense. It was determined that these three relatively weak States should act as the agents of the Commonwealth Government, which would assume liability for capital expenditure and other essential financial requirements. This bill is nearly as historic as the first agreement, inasmuch as the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann) has informed the Parliament that we will not be likely to receive any more bills of this nature or of the nature of many that have preceded it. In this bill the Commonwealth Parliament is asked to authorize the raising of moneys totalling £4,225,000 from loan accounts. I understand from the Minister's speech that that sum, plus the amounts flowing in this year as repayments by settlers, will be sufficient to enable the three agent States practically to complete their jobs as war service land settlement authorities. Any funds required in future, due to the accountancy procedures to be adopted following the enactment of this measure, will be hypothecated from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth. I do not think that the Opposition will quarrel with that. We wish to point out that although tralia for the settlement of returned servicemen since the end of the last war, only a fraction of the men who desire to go on the land have been accommodated. You look around and try to apportion the blame. You ask why something better has not been done. At the inception of the scheme, Commonwealth Government there was a pegging of land values. The agreement provided that land must be purchased at prices not in excess of 1943 land values. There was then a chain of economic circumstances. On the recommendation of members of the present Government parties when in opposition, the people refused to vote for control over prices and land values.",20,Settlement Bill 1963
55,Mr Adermann,Not always the right,21,Settlement Bill 1963
56,Mr Pollard,"The Minister hasThey would not support alterations of the Constitution to enable control of costs in Australia. In addition, supporters of the present Government-bot h when out of office and since being returned to officerefused to support any amendment of the Commonwealth Constitution to deal adequately, for instance, with restrictive trade practices. The end result of this was an enormous boom in land values and those States which had to find their own financial able to pay off the total cost of their farms accommodation-the three principal States -were confronted by an ever-increasing cost of land. The Commonwealth was similarly placed in regard to the agent States which it was financing. Whereas in 1942 you could purchase a farm at a fair value of, say, £7,000 or £8,000, over the whole range of soldier settlement the average cost of farms has mounted to an exceedingly high figure. Taking the figures for the three agent States, we find that the total cost of the settlement of ex-servicemen on 1,260 farms in £23,204,000. On a rough calculation that gives an approximate figure of £18,000 per farm. The Minister referred also to South Australia where, since the inception of the scheme, 1024 soldier settlers have been provided for at a total cost of £15,977,000, or £17,000 per farm. In Tasmania 523 soldier settlers have been provided forthere are a few still to be settled-a t a cost of £17,841,000, or about £34,000 per farm. It does not take much imagination to realize the position of the Commonwealth in relation to the three agent States, or of things were inevitable, but it is not a glowthe three principal States, which find their ing tribute to a government which has been own finance. There is now a good deal of hesitation in acquiring Iand for soldier settlement. The Minister may be able to blame the principal States, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, for not putting enough men on the land, but he can blame only the Commonwealth in regard to the agent States timbered country had to be cleared. very heavily timbered country had to be cleared, but when we take into consideration the number of men approved for land settlement, the number actually settled is pathetically small. The basic reason for that is the excessive cost of settling men on the land. It is true that the scheme has been so well based, generally, that it is only recently that some nasty hazards have been experienced, particularly in relation to men settled in later years. In the earlier years of settlement, soon after 1945, the prices of wool and other produce were relatively good and costs were kept down. In those years some ex-servicemen were within a few years, but that is no longer possible. During the course of his speech the Minister said that some of the money involved under this measure will be used to cover expenditure yet to be made in Tasmania and some of it will be used to consolidate the position of some soldier settlers and enable them more efficiently to obtain a living from their land. 1 pay a tribute to the Minister for visiting the farms of some soldier settlers in Tasmania and Western Australia and, when he was conWestern Australia amounts to vinced »that under present-day conditions they had no hope of succeeding, deciding that they should be rendered some assistance. It is a long while since 1945 and it is wrong that some soldier settlers should still not be sure of what the ultimate valuations of their properties will be. It is tragic that some of them are still waiting to have their properties re-appraised and their final obligations determined, when they are now middle-aged. I suppose some of these in office since 1949 that a lot of these men still do not know what their position is and are not yet out of the woods. This applies particularly to men on dairying and woolgrowing properties. While we all hope that this will be the last measure brought before us seeking loan money for this purpose, if the drift continues we may be faced with further bills of this kind, not only utilizing the repayments that are flowing in, but also providing additional funds from Consolidated Revenue. Admittedly this scheme has worked out, overall, a lot better than did the World War I. scheme, but it is not good enough and I think the Minister will admit",21,Settlement Bill 1963

It could have embraced a vastly greater number of men. economy despite the advent of mechanization and the application of science to rural production. Land settlement is still a "" must"" in Australia. If we examine the not quite up to-date figures that are available we find that whereas in 1940 there were 443,800 people employed on rural holdings, in 1957 the number was 397,800. Those figures include both farmers and employees. The number of our rural holdings and to finish my sentence. When they were the number of farmers is decreasing confronted with a proposition that would annually, at a rapid rate. The Minister cost £30,000 a holding, even though that will probably say that the smaller number figure was to be subject to re-valuation and of people on farms to-day can produce write-off a greater volume and a greater value of primary products than was the case in 1940, but that does not dispose of the fact that with more people employed on rural holdthe Minister means when he refers to heavy ings tbe value of production both for exwrite-offs. Was the write-off to be 50 per port and local consumption would be cent, or 20 per cent.? infinitely greater than it is to-day. 1 do not want to rehash what I have said during previous debates concerning loans for soldier settlement purposes.

67,Mr Fairhall (Paterson,Minister for,26,Settlement Bill 1963
68,Mr Forbes (Barker) [3.56],"I thoughtseparate instances of the scheme having broken down and to refer to individual farms or groups of farms that have not been as successful as others and have required remedial action. Indeed, the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr action flowed from that visit. Adermann) in his second-reading speech said that quite considerable remedial action had been taken in some places. But the point I want to make is that, although this action may sometimes be necessary and although the scheme must be constantly watched, there is no doubt whatever that this land settlement scheme has not only been the most successful war service land settlement scheme in Australia's history, but it has also, been by far the most successhad reached the standard laid down in the ful closer settlement scheme of any description. This should be borne in mind in making an overall assessment of the scheme. This has been the most successful closer settlement scheme in Australia's history because, almost for the first time, economic rather than political considerations have predominated in deciding on the elements of the scheme-the size of farms, how they will be developed, the financial resources that will be provided to settlers and so on. Always in the past, political considerations } Some one has said in some parliament somewhere that a couple of hundred acres is good enough for any man. This sort of suggestion does not take account of the type of land, the best use of the land, the circumstances of the settler, whether he has any capital and so on. However, on this occasion, a really genuine attempt was made to leave political considerations out of the scheme and to test the scheme by the criterion of economic validity. The honourable member for Lalor referred to the slowness of getting people on to their farms. He said that people were still going on to war service land settlement properties many years after the scheme had been inaugurated. I agree with him. From my experience, I know that this has happened in South Australia. But frequently this has happened because of the point I made earlier, that an economic criterion was adopted. The honourable member for Lalor mentioned Kangaroo Island. He said that the Commonwealth and State Governments had had to take remedial action and give concessions to some settlers on Kangaroo Island. Indeed, I am grateful to the Minister who, at my request, some months ago visited the island. Remedial The need for remedial action on Kangaroo Island shows why it was vitally necessary in the interests of the settlers to hasten slowly with the scheme. This action was necessary in relation to thc first 50 settlers, who went on to their blocks before they should have done so. They went on to their blocks before thc blocks, in the circumstances of Kangaroo Island, scheme. If settlement had been hastened, as the critics suggested it should have been, remedial action would have been necessary with many more settlers. After the initial experience on Kangaroo Island, the authorities decided that, despite pressure from the settlers themselves and from the Returned Servicemen's League to settle people as quickly as possible, the settlers would not go on to their farms until the farms had reached the desired standard. Some people were in occupancy but did not have a farm allotted on Kangaroo Island for three, four or sometimes five have tended to dominate the situation. years. This is one reason for the slowness of the scheme. But, looking back, few people would regret that it has been slow. It will not be necessary to take remedial action in relation to the later settlers on Kangaroo Island. My purpose in rising is to repeat a protest that I have already made in the long and sometimes acrimonious correspondence with the Minister about the final rentals that have been issued for the later zones in South Australia. This afternoon, I wish to refer particularly to zone 5 in the southeast of South Australia, because this is an example which best illustrates the point I want to make. However, my general comments on principle apply equally to Kangaroo Island, the zone that covers the settlers at Camden Park and one or two other of the later areas. I believe, as I have said to the Minister in correspondence, that the final rentals in zone 5 and in other areas offend the tenets of common sense and justice when they are compared with the final rentals in some other areas of South Australia, especially areas in the the earlier zones. If the blocks in zone 5 south-east in zones that are only a few miles were better, obviously, it would be reasonfrom the boundary of zone 5. I wish to explain to the House how this But this is not so. If anything, the average came about. The areas in South Australia block in zone 5 is not as good as the to be used for soldier settlement are widely average block in the earlier zones. Yet, as dispersed. The quality of the land is unI have pointed out, the average rental in even and the requirements for development zone 5 is more than twice as much as the are uneven. Some areas were quickly and average in the earlier zones. easily developed. Others involved the removal of heavy timber and painstaking anomalies, of which I shall give the House pasture preparation. The agreement with one example. The Padthaway estate was the State of South Australia provided that acquired for soldier settlement and subthe rental of these properties would be divided into fourteen blocks. Ten of these based on 2 i per cent, of the cost of developare in one of the earlier zones. The rentals ment or on a productivity valuation, whichfor these blocks varies from £179 a year ever was the lower. For administrative purto £220 a year. The other four blocks, poses, it was decided to divide South because they happened to be located in Australia into zones based roughly on the zone 5, on the other side of a line on the time of completion of development. When map, are subject to rentals which have just development in each zone was finished, a been fixed, varying between £533 and £543 costing operation was undertaken, and final a year. rentals were fixed and notified to the settlers on the basis of that costing operation and the productivity valuations. Theoretically, Sir, this was a neat and tidy settlement. They all were developed at the system'. It introduced some rationality into same time and the settlers went on to all the method by which rentals were fixed, and of them at the same time. Yet, over tha to some extent protected the interests of fourteen blocks, the rentals vary from £179 the taxpayers. It also meant that the early to £543 a year. Furthermore, most people settlers did not have to wait until the whole would agree that the four blocks with the scheme was washed up before knowing their highest rentals are not quite' up to the final position. It is understandable that a standard of the ten blocks with rentals settler who went on his block in 1947 would ranging down to only about one-third as not like to wait until 1965 to learn what much. his permanent commitment was to be. However, this system ignored one thing, at the same time? and this seems to me to be the vital point. This point was made by the honourable member for Lalor in a different context. This system that I have described ignored were allocated at the same time. However, the fact that costs of acquisition and because a line on the map divides the estate development had increased enormously for into two zones, the rentals paid by one the later zones compared with the earlier group of settlers ranges as high as £543 a ones. In the south-east of South Australia, year, compared with only £179 a year for the average rental in the earlier zones was some of the blocks in the other zone. I under £200 a year. In zone 5, the average mention this as one of the extraordinary of the rentals just issued is more than £450 anomalies that arise under this zonal system a year. On top of this, many settlers in against which I am protesting this afternoon. zone 5 have considerable commitments to the South Australian Government for drainargued, in correspondence with me, that the age betterment. This is something which increase in costs that has led to this very few of the settlers in the earlier zones situation has occurred also in other spheres had to face. It would not matter if the -that it is not unique to war service land blocks in zone 5 were better than those in settlement. He argues that the increased able to expect them to bear higher rentals.

72,Mr Forbes,"The one estate was purcosts have to be borne in other spheres and that it is expected that they will have to be borne. He asks: Why should this not apply equally to war service land settlement? The Minister gave as an example in the same general field the war service homes scheme. He stated that some who had acquired a war service home early paid a much lower price than was paid by others who entered the scheme more recently. I believe that this argument ignores two tilings, Sir. I do not think that the examples are parallel in the first place. All soldier settlers are part of the same scheme -the Second World War soldier settlement scheme. They were not at liberty to choose when they would go on their blocks. Given a choice, of course, they all would have been ciples which produce the inequities to which on the earlier blocks, because, having been demobilized after the war, they were anxious to get on with their post-war occupations as quickly as possible. They wanted to get cracking and not waste years of their lives. Regardless of any consideration of rental, all would have wanted that. But what has happened has been that settlers who, as I have pointed out, were ready and anxious to get on the land as soon as possible were forced to waste five, six or seven years of their lives that they could have put into developing and working their blocks. They are the very people who have ultimately been penalized by having to pay rentals higher than those paid by settlers who had the advantage of getting on blocks much earlier. That seems to me to be the main point that is ignored when war service land settlement is compared with the war service homes scheme. The second point that is ignored is the fact that a person who, because of general inflation in the economy and increases in costs, has to pay more for his war service home, in most instances would have had his income raised and therefore would be in a better position to cope with the rising costs. Wages, salaries and other incomes rose in conformity with increases in prices during the period when not only the cost of housing but also the cost of everything else rose. Therefore, a person who had to pay more for a war service home than was paid by those who obtained their homes earlier in the scheme would have been in a position to meet the additional cost. As every one in this chamber knows, that consideration certainly does not apply to farming. Not one honourable member in this House would claim that people who began farming in the mid-1950s were as well able to meet higher costs and higher commitments as were people who began farming earlier. In fact, in many cases the very opposite is true. The early settlers under the land settlement scheme obtained the inestimable advantage of the wool boom. Many of them were able to meet their commitments in a few years because of the high returns that they received for their wool in that period. Against the point I am making the Minister has argued that he has complied with the principles of the legislation. I do not deny that. My point is that prinI have referred should not be allowed to determine the final results. Also, I doubt whether the zonal system which, in my opinion, has been responsible for the results that have flowed, is contained in any legislation. It is an administrative procedure agreed to between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of South Australia and designed to facilitate the administration of the scheme. I cannot believe that when the system was agreed to by the Commonwealth and South Australia it was anticipated by those making the agreement in this respect that it would produce the grossly inequitable result that it has produced in the form of rentals. Surely an administrative procedure can be varied if, due to circumstances that could not have been foreseen or anticipated at the time it was devised, it is shown to be producing an injustice. We have come to a pretty pass if we are to take our stand willy nilly on an administrative procedure (hat is admitted to be out of date and which does not produce the result that it was intended to produce. The Minister has told mc also that any variation of this procedure would cost the Commonwealth and South Australia money. That is because any write-off under the scheme is shared as to three-fifths by the Commonwealth and as to two-fifths by South Australia. Of course, anything done to rectify this inequitable situation would cost money. But I do not agree that that validates the argument that nothing should be done. If you present that as a valid argument for not rectifying the situation you say in effect that if an administrative procedure produces an unexpected and unjust result, the settler and not thc governments that devised the procedure must bear the brunt. If you use that argument you are saying that despite the fact that this system has operated in a way that is unfair and inequitable and which could not be foreseen at the time it was devised, because it will cost us money we will ask the settler for whom thc scheme is supposed to operate to bear the brunt and not the governments that devised the procedure. 1 cannot accept that argument. I appreciate, as the Minister has often pointed out, that South Australia is involved in this matter because of the agreement and that the CommonweaUh could not possibly take unilateral action in respect occupations in order to serve their country of the matter because to do so would, as it were, automatically involve South Australia in expense for which it has no legal liability. I have never suggested, and I do not suggest now, that thc Commonweallh should take unilateral action. The Minister is well aware that the South Australian Government has appointed a committee to inquire into the position of zone 5 settlers in the south-eastern portion of South Australia. I ask the Minister: If, as a result of thc inquiry, the Government of South Australia makes recommendations to the Commonwealth indicating that it is prepared to meet its share of the cost of rectithe 60.000 who had applied to be settled fying these inequities in the south-eastern portion of South Australia, will the Commonwealth give those recommendations careful consideration and, in fact, agree to them? That is the only point T wish to make at this stage arising out of the case that 1 put before the House. I support thc bill. settlement and the promotion of rural industries in this country have been, during this Government's term of office, disastrously inadequate to meet the increasing needs of tbe people of Australia. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) and the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Australia and Tasmania. In Western AusPollard) have pointed out that the soldier settlement scheme as it operated after the last war was a vast improvement on the system of soldier settlement that operated after the First World War. They pointed out that every ex-scrviceman settled on the land after the last war bas had an opportunity to succeed, which is a distinct improvement on what happened to soldier settlers after the First World War. But there are not enough people on thc land. Not enough ex-servicemen have been settled on the land. The history of the land settlement scheme shows that while this country was at war the Curtin and Chifley Governments were planning for peace. They realized that when thc war ended many ex-servicemen would want to become farmers; so they instituted an inquiry to ascertain how many ex-servicemen would want to go on the land and what types of farms would bc required. The Curtin and Chifley Governments discovered that 80,000 men had left rural in theatres of war. They decided that at least 50,000 of those men would want to return to rural occupations after hostilities ceased. When the war ended the State governments invited applications from ex-servicemen who desired to become farmers. They received applications from more than 60,000 ex-servicemen. Those applications were examined and thc applicants screened. It was discovered that of the 60.000 applicants, about 48,000 were eligible and suitable for settlement on the land. But what happened? Only 17,000 ex-servicemen were settled on thc land. Of on the land more than 30,000 did not receive farms. As the honourable member for Lalor has pointed out, one of the main reasons why that happened was that in 1948 when the Labour Government held a referendum seeking power to control the ceiling price of land, members of the parties which now sit in government were able to destroy that ceiling with the result that in Victoria alone, where farms were being obtained for soldier settlers at f 10,000, the price immediately soared to more than £20,000. In his second-reading speech thc Minister gave certain figures relating to the average cost of farms in Western Australia, South tralia the cost was £18,000, in South Australia £16,000 and in Tasmania over £30,000. These costs could not be met to thc extent required to put on the land all those who desired to go on the land. However, thesefiguresdo not reveal exactly the",28,Settlement Bill 1963
73,Mr Peters (Scullin [4.22],"Landextent of the disaster which has occurred. Quite a considerable portion of the land which was purchased was purchased prior to 1948, when the price of land was about one-half the present price. Farms which were purchased after 1948 cost very much in excess of the amounts cited by the Minister. In Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland-the States which were operating under their own schemes-the position was equally as bad as, if not worse than, the position in the other three States. The price per farm in those States ranged from £20,000 to £22,000. A vast proportion of the additional expense resulted from the defeat of the referendum which would have enabled a ceiling price to be put on land. What has happened has been a personal tragedy for those people who returned from the war in their early twenties and went on to farms to learn farming practices. They were told that if they obtained employment on farms the Government would pay a portion of their wages and ultimately would provide a farm for each of them. But many of these ex-servicemen did not get farms of their own. Is not that a personal tragedy? Can any one claim that a scheme which left 30,000 eligible and suitable applicants without land was satisfactory? servicemen were from the Second World War. Korean War. How many of our young men who served in the Korean War have been placed upon farms? We have men now serving the interests of their country in Malaysia. How many of those servicemen who return and desire to become farmer settlers will receive farms? There will be very few, if any. Greater than the personal tragedy is the Trade recently was appointed a member national disaster which has arisen from the non-settlement of people on the land.

Taking the matter further, in 1939 there were 253,000 farms in Australia, but now there are only 251,000. As the honourable member for Lalor pointed out, to-day there are tens of thousands fewer workers in rural occupations than there were in 1939. So we have the position that there are 2,000 fewer farms than there were, tens of thousands fewer farmers and a reduction in the value of our rural production by £50 per head of population. increase in population. needs to eat.

Those were the stories that were told in days gone by. As I have pointed out, since 1939 we have had not an increase but a decrease in our rural population; not an increase but a vast decrease in the number ,of farms; not an increase but an immense decrease in the value of rural production per head of population. Are those things for which the Minister for Primary Industry, who has spent quite a considerable time increasing his staff and extending his activities, takes credit? Why has he not accomplished something? After all, we are not asking the Minister to do anything that Labour would not have done, could not have done and has not done. What was the position when Labour was in office? In 1946, the year after the end of the Second World War, the value of rural production was £35 per head of population. In 1950 the relevant figure was £82. But there had been a variation in the value of the £1 during that period. The true figures were £85 per head in 1946 and £146 per head in 1950-a n increase of £61 per head under Labour. During those five years Labour increased the output of rural production. It also put into operation plans for the rural rehabilitapolist of land in Queensland. He is one of tion of thousands and thousands of Australian settlers. The Labour Party brought vast areas in the north of Victoria under soldier settlement. Those are the accomplishments of the Labour Government. In its five years in office after the end of the Second World War it was faced with the task of rehabilitating more than 1,000,000 ex-service men and women and putting them back into peace-time occupations. It had to convert factories that had been utilized in the manufacture of the munitions and equipment of war to the manufacture of plough shares, furniture and all the other requisites of peace. Labour did those things and at the same time increased the value of rural production per head of population by £61. As I have pointed out, this Government, during ten years in which, generally, it had the most favorable climatic conditions in the history of this country and the highest overseas prices ever payable for rural products, decreased the value of rural production per head of population by £50. The comparison, of course, is all in favour of Labour's administration. I join with Sir John CrawfordI do not know whether Sir John will be very pleased about that-in suggesting that one of the means, perhaps the most essential means, of bridging the gap that now exists between our exports and our imports is by increasing the volume of rural production, which necessarily involves increasing the number of farms and the number of people who undertake rural activities. The sooner this is done the better. It is a fact, of course, that the cost of land-no t its value, but its cost-ha s been allowed to mount to an excessive extent in the rural districts of Australia, and unless something is done to fix a ceiling price for land, the ordinary citizens, the ordinary sons of farmers, the members of the Australian Workers Union, a great rural organization, will have no opportunity of going on the land. The man who comes here from overseas and tries to save his money to obtain a farm will not be able to get one. How long would the ordinary worker in industry have to save to get a farm costing £20,000 or £30,000 or more?

That survey, conducted by independent experts, revealed that more than 600,000 acres of superb farming land could have been taken from the holders of the land in the western districts without reducing by one iota the income of the people who owned the land and without reducing by one iota the volume of production in the western districts. In reality, of course, if that land had been taken there would have been a vast increase in the production of the western districts. While people are using land to its productive capacity they are entitled to hold it, no matter how big an area they have. But the position is that there are people owning thousands of acres in New South Wales and Victoria simply because their fathers or grandfathers happened to be favorites of particular Governors of those States. They are not using the land, and the time has arrived when, in the interests of the production and defence of this country a survey should be made of the potential use of the whole of our agricultural land. In this way we will discover how we can feed our own population and play our part in helping to provide the necessary food for a hungry world. deal later with a number of the points made by the honourable member for Scullin( Mr this is not all new money going into the Peters). First, however, I want to refer to one matter which has no real connection with soldier settlement. I suggest that the honourable member for Scullin should expand his mind beyond the parochial, pocket-handkerchief confines of tbe electorate of Scullin. He suggests that there is no opportunity for men to go on the land. Let me tell him that at the present time in Western Australia we are developing millions and millions of acres of land, and there is plenty of opportunity for men to go on the land. Land is available at [25 SEPTEMBER, 1963.] Land Settlement) Bill. 1353 from 2s. 6d. to about 15s. an acre, and all that is required is the courage and energy to develop it. Men are going to these areas with less than £100 in tbeir pockets. All they need is enough to pay their fare to get to these districts and obtain, perhaps, a tent to start with. These are the types of people that we need in this country, people who will develop, and are developing, the land. The honourable member speaks about a declining farm population and production. I agree that there has been a decline in some parts of the Commonwealth, but for goodness' sake get outside Melbourne, and remember that there are vast areas of land where new farmers are going in, and that there has been a vast increase in lhe volume of production as a result of this development. In my own State we have increased wheat production in a year or two from 50,000,000 bushels to 72,000.000 bushels. Western Australia is now the second State in volume of wheat production, although we were at the bottom of the list a few years ago. Let the honourable member get out and observe what goes on, and so broaden his mind. Let him see the splendid opportunities that are available. Thc kind of statement that he makes is what deters people from coming to Australia and, in the case of those who do come here, causes them to acquire a feeling of regret. They hear statements like those made by the honourable member and, unfortunately, they believe them to be true. It is very difficult to counter the effects of such statements, and the honourable member does this country a disservice by making them. We have before us a bill to make available £4,255,000 in connection with the war service land settlement scheme. Actually scheme. What is involved is an adjustment in connection with nioney that has already been allotted to the States involved in this scheme. I do not know the actual proportion of new money that is involved. Western Australia will get nothing like the amount mentioned in the bill. It will probably get a very small amount. I want to deal with the matter of land settlement generally. It is true that this war service settlement scheme is a vast improvement on the scheme which operated after the First World War It is a most",33,Settlement Bill 1963

88,Mr Leslie (Moore) [4.52],"I shallsuccessful scheme. There still remain some difficulties and problems, some of which I will mention, but the major criticism that I would make in connection with this scheme-and I would offer severe criticism on this aspect of the matter-is that sion, but it indicated in its report that the it has attempted to do too little too late. I was a member of the State Parliament and a member of the Post-War Reconstruction Committee in Western Australia. A suggestion was made early in 1946 that we should have a celebration of the Japanese surrender on V.J. Day. The war service land settlement scheme was introduced in 1944. My reply to the suggestion was that I believed the time to have such a celebration was when the first soldier settler was put on a farm. There had been a lot of planning and talk, but that was as far as thc scheme had gone. It was not until a couple of years later that the first soldier settler was placed on a farm in Western Australia. The war service land settlement scheme is based on one of the ten reports prepared by the Rural Reconstruction Commission and submitted to the Chifley Government. The commission's reports are very valuable, but unfortunately, they are not all readily available at the present time. The report to which I shall refer made a valuable contribution to a solution of the problems associated with war service land settlement, many of which are still with us. The report deals with the employment and settlement of returned servicemen on the land, and it contains a draft of a bill which the Returned Servicemen's League submitted to the commission as the basis for a new war service land settlement scheme. I had a hand in preparing the bill, together with other State members from various parts of Australia. The commission did not accept the bill, although its main recommendations were based upon our submissions. There were two vital departures from our submissions. The Returned Servicemen's League had recommended that, by agreement with the States, the Commonwealth should accept financial responsibility for war service land settlement, as it was a defence matter, and that a Commonwealth land settlement commission should be set upa body similar to the Repatriation' Commission. Ther|e was.,a. .further .recommendation that in each State a land settlement board should be appointed to operate the scheme. Unfortunately, the Rural Reconstruction Commission did not adopt the suggestion for fhe appointment of a land settlement commisfinancial responsibility for land settlement belonged to the Commonwealth. When we made our recommendations we had in mind the failure of the war service land settlement scheme instituted after World WarI . Mr Justice Pike, in a report submitted in 1927 after he had made an investigation of the first land settlement scheme, referred to the split in financial responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States and said that it was a factor contributing to the failure of the scheme. The loss on that scheme in 1927, according to Mr Justice Pike, totalled £23,500,000. The Rural Reconstruction Commission, after taking evidence from the States in 1943, estimated that the accumulated loss on the first war service land settlement scheme then was £43,000,000. That is a substantial sum of money, judged even by to-day's values. In 1927, at the time of Mr Justice Pike's inquiry, only 71 per cent, of the settlers under the first scheme remained on the land. The Rural Reconstruction Commission did not try to discover the number still remaining in 1943, but I believe that it was very substantially less than that in 1927. Our committee's recommendations were based on knowledge and experience gained during the period after the First World War. The bill we recommended and our suggestions for the operation of a scheme were largely adopted. The criticism which I offer is that unfortunately too little was done too late. In Western Australia after the last war there were 4,000 applicants for land settlement, but only 1,002 were settled on farms. In Western Australia alone, 3,000 applicants did not get farms. Many of those people had trained themselves for farming, in accordance with a recommendation made by the Rural Reconstruction Commission. Why did the scheme fail to satisfy the needs of so many people? Why is there a shortage of land for war service land settlement? The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) and the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters) suggest that the shortage has occurred because of the action of the Liberal Party and the Country Party in opposing the granting of power to the Commonwealth in relation to prices control suggested in the 1948 referendum. Those honourable members suggest that the inability of governments to acquire land is due to the lifting of prices control. I do not know what happened in other States, but I know that in the post-war period we had legislation in Western Australia which gave the State Government complete control of land transactions. Land prices were fixed at the 1942 values, plus aUowances for any expenditure on improvements since that time. All transactions for the sale of farms were controlled. A person wanting to sell a farm negotiated with a potential buyer, reached an agreement and signed a contract. The transaction then went before the State Land Settlement Board, which had the right to acquire the farm at the price which the vendor was willing to accept. The board acquired quite a lot of farms. Honourable members opposite should not say there is a shortage of land only because of the defeat of the 1948 referendum. 1948. Western Australia were waiting to be placed on farms. A Labour Government was in office in this Parliament until 1949. Men were waiting for land and the Government had the power to acquire land, but nothing was done about it. Why was there a lack of development farms in that period? I have one criticism of the report of the Rural Reconstruction Commission. The members of that commission were experts and knew what they were doing, but they created an impression in the minds of the State Governments and the Commonwealth Government of that time that there was a shortage of Iand suitable for war service land settlement in this country. I cannot give exact references to the report. I have in my notes extracts from the report, one of which statesThe commission feels compelled to emphasise strongly that suitable Crown lands in various States are limited in extent. In another part of its report the commission saidThere are no vast areas of Crown land to be opened up by the States in the development of which both governments and citizens might again share ill-founded optimism. I p atested when that appeared in the report and said that it would create a defeatist attitude in this country. I was speaking with a knowledge of my own State. Since that report appeared and since the war service land settlement scheme approached its closing-down stage, Western Australia has profitably developed milUons of acres of land. Once we had a change of government in Western Australia-the Labour Government had accepted this 'no opportunity in this vast land of ours "" attitudethere was a change of outlook. The government which followed took a portion of land on the coastline, which I had recommended to it, and requested that the Commonwealth regard the development of this virgin land as a project area, lt was a light land venture and the Commonwealth Government said, ""Yes, we will agree to your taking half a mUlion acres "". To-day there are 50 very successful settlers on that land at Eneabba. One of the men who assisted me in my representations to the Commonwealth in connection with this project was the present Minister for Trade who had a look at the area. Following the Commonwealth Government's action in backing the State Government's view that the land could be developed and was worthy of development, the State started releasing land further south and to-day there are townships which have grown up and developed in the last ten years. That has happened as the result of the courage and wisdom of the Government of Western Australia which, backed by the Commonwealth Government, ignored defeatist reports. It believed that there was land capable of being developed and decided at least to try it out. There are to-day, in the area I have mentioned, 300 successful settlers who were not there ten years ago. It is true that some of them have financial trouble, some major and some minor; they have no roads, railways or electricity; they are away out in the bush, as were so many settlers in the early days; but they are men of courage, energy and ability-the people who will make this country.

I can mention other I am not sure that this principle has been parts of Western Australia also where there and is still being correctly applied in have been tremendous advances, yet in Western Australia. Land prices quoted dur1943 the attitude of the then Commonwealth ing this debate bear out my contention that Labour Government, guided by the report these settlers are being charged too much of the Rural Reconstruction Commission, and that the initial capital cost which they was that there was no more worthwhile land will be required to meet could-and in some capable of development in Australia.

92,Mr Leslie,"As I have said, 4,000 menit is taken into consideration and given full effect we will find ourselves in trouble similar to that experienced after World WarI . We then had to ask for a royal commission and Mr Justice Pike investigated the position and suggested remedies for the future of soldier land settlement. I want finally to refer to the requests and of unbecoming conduct, his appeal is disrecommendations which we made, for the appointment of an appeal board, for a long time before the present Minister came to office. Ultimately we got an appeal board and I am informed that the conditions of appeal and the operations of the board were arrived at after consultation with the Minister then in charge of the scheme. I say to the Minister at the table that lhe operation of the appeal board is a farce. I happen to have sat on the board and I know how it operates. It is a farce; it is of no use to the settler whatsoever. The honourable member for Indi( Mr Holten) suggests that the board was a farce because I sat on it. I can assure him that that was not the reason. I endeavoured to make it less of a farce if I possibly could. I say it was a farce, first, because the settler had only a limited right of appeal. He could appeal only after he had been ordered off his property. Perhaps he had been ordered off because he had committed an offence, but the only time he could appeal was after he had been ordered off his property. The appeal board consists of a magistrate, a representative of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia and a member of the department. Evidence is given before it on oath. When I was on the board, I was in somewhat the same position as a justice of the peace when sitting alongside a magistrate in a court; I could not ask questions in my own right. IfI wanted to ask a question I had to ask it through the chairman. At the termination of the hearing, I found a case to support a claim that the that only one of two things could be done. board should alter its attitude, he should be Either the appeal could be dismissed, or able to appeal to this tribunal. it could be allowed. The position really is that before the hearing of the appeal is commenced, a decision has been reached appeal board because of our experiences with relation to the way in which the after the First World War. In those days, settler has worked the property. He may there was no separate war service land have made a mistake. In fact, to illustrate settlement scheme in Western Australia. At the type of lease under which the soldier that time, land settlement was carried out settler is required to work his property, under the administration of the Agricultural F.8408/63 -it -[50 ] I point out that one condition is that the lease can be cancelled if the settler is guilty of unbecoming conduct. That is the sort of thing that one finds in Australian Military Regulations and Orders-the military rules. The settler could be guilty of unbecoming conduct, but there may be mitigating circumstances. If he is found guilty missed. The board cannot do anything else with him. It cannot say, ""Yes, this man has committed an offence, but, in the circumstances, we consider that this, or this, should be done"". Perhaps the settler should suffer some kind of penalty, but he should not be entirely dispossessed of his property and thereby lose whatever equity he has in it. There is no half way. I point out further that under the provisions by which the appeal board is appointed, even the Minister is given no discretion. He cannot come in and say, "" I think that there are certain circumstances in this case which would justify giving special consideration to this settler "". We have appealed from time to time for a change to be made in the conditions under which the appeal board operates. There are still 300 or 400 men concerned, and there probably will be more. It could be that these men could do certain things for which they would be criticized and condemned by the department. We do not want the appeals limited only to cases in which a man is to be dispossessed of his property. We are asking that the appeal board be given authority to hear cases in which there is a difference of opinion between the inspectors appointed by the Land Settlement Board and the settler as to the way in which the settler is carrying out his operations. Under the present arrangement, the board is a law unto itself. The settler just must obey the orders of the board or find himself in trouble. We feel that if a settler thinks he has We recommended the appointment of this Bank. Ultimately, the. Lands Department, agreed to the setting up of a committee on which was one officer seconded from the Agricultural Bank, one officer seconded from the Lands Department, and one representative from the Returned Servicemen's League. Ultimately, we reached a stage at which any soldier settler could appeal to this body if he found himself in difficulty with the Agricultural Bank or the department. That body would then give a ruling, publish a decision or make a recommendation which went to the Minister who could either accept it or reject it. At least in that way we got a band of contented people, and we all know there is nothing worse than a band of people who are not contented. WhatI have suggested requires only a very minor alteration. Attempts have been made in the State Parliament to have it adopted, but I understand that there is some difficulty at this end in connection with it I do not know to what stage the discussions or negotiations went because they were conducted at ministerial level, and I did not follow the matter up. I support the bill. I hope that at the winding up of this land settlement scheme all who have been privileged to take part in it will have benefited from it. House has before it the Loan (War Service Land Settlement) Bill 1963. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann) explained that the purpose of the measure is to raise loan moneys amounting to £4,225,000 for war service land settlement in the agent States of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania during the current financial year. Of this amount, £1,546,000 is to be made available to Western Australia, £1,229,000 to South Australia and £1,450,000 to Tasmania. The Minister also outlined a proposed change in accounting procedure which is to take effect as from lst July of this year, but I understand that this proposal is purely a Treasury requirement which stems from a recommendation made to the Government by the Public Accounts Committee which is comprised of members from both sides of the House. The Government applicants will be unable to be allocated has accepted the recommendation of the farms because of the difficulty of obtaining committee, and this Treasury requirement sufficient areas of suitable land. I believe does not affect in any way at all the amounts of money to be made available under the bill for war service land settlement. I should like to point out that the total amount advanced by the Commonwealth to the five States under the war service land settlement scheme which was commenced by a Labour government in 1946, after the bill had been assented to on 14th October, 1945, is approximately £100,000,000. The Governments of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland have contributed a similar amount. Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia have acted as agents for the Commonwealth, and in those States the Commonwealth has supplied the whole of the money expended on war service land settlement. As we know, the scheme was originated after the war for eligible ex-servicemen who were keen to be settled on farms. For obvious reasons, ex-serviccmen who were eligible to participate in the scheme were not debarred because of lack of private capital. This fact was stated by the Minister in his second-reading speech when dealing with the amount of money advanced to equip and operate the farms. I should like to deal with that point later. It must be heartening to the authorities, both Commonwealth and State, tofindthemselves in the position where they can now claim that all interested and classified applicants in Western Australia have been allotted farms. I believe that in all some 1,260 farms have been provided in that State. I was somewhat alarmed by the statement by the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie) that there were in fact 4,000 applicants for farms but only 1,000 were successful in having farms allotted to them. If that is the position, I should like to know more about it from tbe Minister when he replies. I simply record the fact that in his second-reading speech the Minister said that all those interested and classified were allotted farms, and I pay tribute to the authorities, both Commonwealth and State, for what has been done in Western Australia. It appears that in South Australia some",37,Settlement Bill 1963
93,Mr Davies (Braddon) [5.22],"Th ethat the settlers on Kangaroo Island in particular are experiencing much the same type of difficulties as those being experienced on King Island in Tasmania and that a technical committee comprised of both State and Commonwealth officers has been appointed to inquire into their problems. I have not been to Kangaroo Island, but I have promised certain people there that I shall visit them in the very near future. From reliable information given to me, I understand that the scheme on Kangaroo Island has cost something in the vicinity of £4,500,000 and that only 160-odd blocks have been allotted. The holdings are of approximately 800 acres each, and 1,200 acres have yet to be allotted. Of the number settled, 130, or 90 per cent., have gone bankrupt. On an average they owe between £5,000 and £8,000 in arrears of rental and advances for working capital, stock and plant and forfixedimprovements. I further believe that the main trouble arose from stumps and sticks left on the ground and through various types of soil deficiencies. I sincerely hope that the people on Kangaroo Island, like those on King Island and others who have experienced great difficulty, will soon receive recognition of the work they have done and some compensation and possibly even better concessions than they have already received. As I said, I have not been to Kangaroo Island, but I hope to visit the island, which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes), very soon. In Tasmania, which is the remaining spray that will eliminate the pest. State referred to in the bill, we have been informed that to date 523 farms have been allotted. Of these, 197 are was the depletion of pastures and, as everyin my electorate and they are to be one can easily understand, this led to a found in four areas-King Island, Togari, consequent reduction in farm incomes. which is the new name for Montague Added to this was the high cost of excesswamp, Mawbanna and Preolenna.

The total cost to date has been £197,878. At Meunna, eight dairy farms have been established at a cost of £131,173. The cost of the scheme in Tasmania up to 30th June of this year has been approximately £18,000,000. Of this amount, 40 per cent, has been spent in my electorate on some 197 farms. In his second-reading speech, the Minister for Primary Industry commented on the fact that development is still proceeding on the projects at King Island and Togari. He saidThese projects have taken longer to complete than originally estimated, due to a number of factors such as excessively wet seasons, problems in the control of re-growth and rushes, or pasture failures requiring some research to find the answers. This unfortunately is all too true. The land on King Island was originally covered with very dense ti-tree scrub. No great difficulty was experienced in removing the scrub wifh 1 modern machinery, but, as so frequently happens, after the land was ploughed, cultivated and sown to pasture, the ti-tree seeds germinated in the ground with the result that ti-tree re-growth is occurring constantly. However, the biggest problem is that after the ti-tree scrub has been removed, rushes appear and spread rapidly over the new pastures. There is no easy way, and certainly no cheap way, of controlling the pest. I have previously appealed in this House to the Government to enlist the services of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in an attempt to find some hormone or The result of the re-growth, of course, political parties, to inquire into all aspects development work, like the reports, was of war service land settlement on King Island. The Government refused to appoint such a committee, but the Minister did set up a committee of inquiry which commenced work in July, 1959. It is to his credit that he did set up this committee. It is more in the nature of a technical committee. It consists of the Deputy Director of War Service Land Settlement, an accountant of the Agricultural Bank in Tasmania and an officer of the State Department of Agriculture. These men visit each farm and conduct an inquiry into the affairs of individual settlers. Following the wanted the job done thoroughly. I am findings of the committee, the settlers receive such concessions as free agistment for stock, superphosphate credits, the writing off of interest on advances for stock, plant and working expenses, extension of the repayment period for stock, plant and implements, and the provision of a mowable area. The Government has accepted liability for some of the earlier mistakes it made. Re-development work will be done on most of the blocks on this island. Further, a credit is made in the plant account for undue depreciation of plant used under rough conditions and for re-growth control in excess of a reasonable level of maintenance control. As I pointed out, this committee has been in existence now for four years. I believe that some settlers are still waiting for the results of the investigation. I point I think the committee of inquiry whose out to the Minister again, as I did a few years ago, that the committee is taking far too long. The members of the committee should have been taken away from their ordinary work and should have been put to work as a committee straight away. It is easy to understand the dissatisfaction of some settlers who are still waiting for an investigation whilst others have had their concessions for as long as two years. The committee recommended some redevelopment work on the blocks. To date on King Island approximately 12,000 acres have been recommended for re-development and £232,000 has been credited to the settlers' accounts as a result of the committee's inquiry. Two years ago I drew the attention of the Minister to the feeling aroused amongst the settlers because the reanother committee to inquire into the taking too long. Any one who has lived on a farm will understand that while some paddocks are being torn up and redeveloped, the carrying capacity of the farm must be reduced. When the carrying capacity is reduced, the farm income diminishes. Despite the reduction of carrying capacity, the authorities have refused to reduce the annual commitments of farmers. The position to-day, four years after the committee was set up, has naturally worsened a great deal. The Minister in replying to me two years ago regretted the delay in the re-development, but he said he pleased to tell him that the job is being done properly; but it is being done much too slowly. I will not go into the cost now, because we all realize that there will have to be a big write-down on the whole scheme. But surely some adjustment can be made to the annual commitments now in view of the reduced farm incomes resulting from the re-development. The Minister admitted in his seconddifficulty in meeting their commitments. He reading speech that settlers have had some saidSome arrears have accumulated due to causes accepted as being outside the control of the settlers and ""ad hoc"" measures to assist settlers are being introduced as required; for example, by the extension of time in which to make principal repayments on advances made for the purchase of stock. work I have outlined and whose job it was to recommend the amount of re-development and credits for each settler could be classed as one of the ad hoc measures to which the Minister referred. Valuable as were these concessions that the Minister gave us, they still did not prove to be the final solution to the settlers' problems. When the settlers realized that they were no better off but were becoming worse off, even after the majority of them had received concessions, they were forced to send representatives, who were accompanied by the Tasmanian Minister for Agriculture and some members of this Parliament, to meet the Minister for Primary Industry again towards the end of last year. The Minister, to his credit, listened sympathetically once more and then appointed economics of war service land settlement on King Island. The chairman of tbe committee is Mr so high. Has the Minister any comparison R. M . Sargent, of Hobart, who is a chartered accountant. The settlers' representative-it is good to see them represented on the committee-is Mr Ken Payne, a bright young settler. Other members are Mr M. J. Firth, an economist, of the State Treasury, and Mr reply. A. G. Bennett, of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. The secretary of the committee is Mr D. Edwards, an accountant of the Agricultural Bank of Tasmania. This committee, which was appointed at the end of last year, was given terms of reference which required it to examine direct farm operating costs on an annual basis, excluding capital items, to look at total farm income on an annual basis, to conduct a comprehensive survey of finance for personal expenditure on an annual basis, to obtain information on the rate of depreciation of capital items, and after consideration of the facts revealed by the inquiry, to make suggestions about the basis of charges that a settler could be expected to meet under the conditions pertaining during the period covered by the inquiry. Naturally, at the end of the terms of reference, there was a blanket reference to "" any other matters pertinent to the inquiry "". So, after extensive inquiries, this second committee is to make suggestions about the basis of charges that the settlers can be expected to meet. Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish the committee well in its task. I only hope, as I said a few moments ago, that thc members of this second committee will give their full time to the inquiry. They should be seconded from their ordinary work so that they may devote all' their time to the pursuit of these inquiries and arrive at some worth-while recommendations, for time is running out for the settlers. 1 should like to know whether the Minister has any idea when the committee's report can be expected. Will the inquiry extend over four years, like that made by the first committee? Is this to be the end of all inquiries into war service land settlement? Will the Minister accept a substantial writing-down of the cost of this project? He informed me once that 50 per cent, of the total cost of the project at Rocky Gully in Western Australia had been written-off because the cost of development in that area had been between the cost of the scheme in Tasmania, especially at Togari and on King Island, and the cost of the scheme at Rocky Gully in Western Australia? He may be able to let us have some information about that when he closes the debate in I impress on the Minister the fact that the settlers want to know one thing. It is now almost twenty years since the end of the Second World War. Some of these settlers have been on their blocks for twelve or thirteen years and are anxious to see the green light on the hill and to know where they are going and what their commitments will be. After many years of frustration, all that they want to know is: What will be the final valuation of theic blocks and what will be the settlers' annual commitments? We have been pressing for this information for some time. The sooner the committee of inquiry makes its recommendations and the writing-down occurs and a realistic approach to valuations and rentals is adopted, the better it will be for the settlers and for the country as a whole. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, mentioned one of the objectives of the scheme-the building up of equity by the settlers. I have previously spoken in this House on the subjects of equity and of rental and valuations. I again press the Minister for a more realistic approach to rentals. This matter was raised earlier this afternoon. The settlers in Tasmania maintain that rentals should be based on the fair market value of a property as a complete unit. The practice of valuing buildings, houses and land separately is all wrong. The settlers say also that the option to purchase should be based on the value of the property as a complete unit. The Minister said that this would require an amendment of the principal act. That is just the very sort of thing for which the Parliament assembles here. If the people wish the act to be amended, and an amendment is found to be a valid and reasonable proposition, that amendment should be made. I know that any amendment necessary in this instance would receive the blessing of honourable members on both sides of the chamber. Mr Deputy Speaker, 1 believe that at this stage it is only right that I place on record here the views of the King Island Settlers Association. The views that I have been expressing for a long time have been stated not just as my views. They have been expressed on behalf of the settlers on King Island. Mr R. W. Cooper, president of the association, whom the Minister knows personally from his own visit to the island, wrote a letter giving his comments on the matter after the Minister's second-reading speech on this bill had been published in full by the ""King Island News"", a very fine little newspaper, as many of these provincial weeklies are. Mr Cooper, in his letter, states the views of the settlers on the points raised by the Minister in his second-reading speech. Referring to the impending writing-down of war service land settlement farms that had been forecast, Mr Cooper wrote. . . public that the cost to settlement authorities of developing a War Service Land Settlement farm almost invariably greatly exceeds the actual market value of the farm when leased to the settler. A proportion of this excess cost has been written off, but in spite of this the cost valuation figure for rental purposes appearing on a settler's lease always greatly exceeds the market value of the farm. For example, on a King Island War Service Land Settlement farm of 400 acres this cost valuation figure may exceed municipal valuation (or approximate market value) by as much as £10,000. Whether or not Mr Adermann's speech on the Second Reading of the Loan, War Service Land Settlement Bill presages a complete write-off of this excess cost is not clear. It is obvious until this is done it will continue to be impossible for a settler to build up equity on a War Service Land Settlement farm on King Island. Actually there could easily be a tendency to interpret the effect of what is here called by the Minister a "" write-down"" incorrectly. To our mind it relates to write-down of capital costs incurred by the settlement authorities, and except »hit it may have some tendency to reduce rental -wRSsmcnt it will not greatly reduce the settler's annual costs. He will still be responsible for meeting principal and interest re-payment on loans for stock, plant, structures, improvements, &c. It is payment of these annual commitments together with high rentals which have placed an impossible burden on tlie settler who started without capital. It is therefore very necessary that any attempts at writing-down be done in such a way that it will make War Service Land Settlement farms an economic proposition and tliat the settler will be assured of a reasonable standard of living, even though he begins with no capitaL I want to emphasize two points in this letter, Mr Deputy Speaker. The first relates to the wri'.'ing-down. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, said that there will be a fairly heavy writing-down, and he addedThe total amount of write-off involved cannot be defined precisely at the present time . . . We say that a farm ought to be valued at present market value and that all excess, costs of development should be written off. Anything over and above the present market value of a farm as a unit should be written off. That is the point of view of the settlers. For the sake of their peace of mind, happiness and satisfaction and of the stability of the settlement scheme and the economic well-being of King Island, it is to be hoped that the Minister will accept this point of view. The Minister stated that the total amount of write-off cannot be defined precisely at the present time. We say that once the farm is valued as a unit, that is it should be pointed out to the general the amount that must be written off. The letter which I have just read-it is a very good letter-refer s to the impossible burden on the settler. This is the great problem to-day not only on King Island but also on Kangaroo Island and in other soldier settlements. In the interests of the economic stability of the islands as well as the future of the scheme I urge the Minister to base rentals on the market value of the farm as a unit. As the president of the King Island Settlers Association states, the responsibility for meeting principal and interest repayments on loans for stock, plant, structures and improvements will still fall on the settler. In addition he must pay a high rental for his land. This is not done in ordinary private farming procedures to-day. Let us cut the red tape and let us get down to a normal farm accounting procedure where you value the farm and take into account improvements, such as fencing, water holes, barns and the dairy. Having arrived at a figure you fix a reasonable rental. The various accounts that must be kept by soldier settlers are worrying to them and are not necessary. Possibly a separate account should be kept for stock and plant because stock costs vary, particularly at places like King Island. It may be difficult, because of variations in stock costs, to arrive at a fair rental, but having taken into account all the things that I have mentioned, and having regard to the fact that on some farms plant may be older than plant on other farms, you should be able to reach a fair valuation. In his second-reading speech the Minister referred also to the other objective of the scheme, which is to enable settlers to earn a reasonable labour income. I know that settlers on dairy farms will be able to show the committee that they are not receiving a reasonable labour income. As for those on sheep blocks, their position as far as farm income and return to capital and management is concerned is fully covered in the ""Tasmanian Sheep Industry Survey"", a document published late last year by the Division of Agricultural Economics. That survey was far-reaching. It covered all types of sheep properties in Tasmania-the long-established properties and a percentage of war service land settlement properties. The survey shows that the return to capital and management on a merino wool-growing property has fallen from 5.91 per cent, to 3.36 per cent, over the last three years. The return on a property engaged in growing cross bred wool has fallen from 3.02 per cent, to .55 per cent. In the case of cross bred fat lamb propertiesI remind the House that these are the types of properties to be found on King Island and they were included in the survey-the return to capital and management has fallen from 2.1 per cent, to 1.29 per cent. One would have thought that the Minister for Primary Industry, who is in charge of war service land settlement, would have immediately ordered a review of the commitments he expects soldier settlers to meet in respect of sheep blocks on which they have been settled. Under the present arrangement the settler must find annually an amount which would represent at least 6 per cent, of the total capital investment in his holding. Yet the survey shows that the settler on a cross bred fat Iamb property receives only 1.29 per cent. It is utterly impossible for those settlers to find 6 per cent, while maintaining a reasonable standard of living and effecting farm improvements. I have dealt fairly fully with war service land settlement on King Island because there are 151 farms there with problems far more pressing than perhaps in any other area of Australia. In the interests of the economy of the island as well as Australia as a whole those problems must be solved. I would have liked to deal with the general picture at Mawbanna, Togari and Meunna, where the position is much brighter, and the problems are not as great as they are on King Island. honourable member's time has expired. [5.52] -In his opening remarks the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) traced the history of soldier settlement from the First World War to the present time. He gave reasons why land settlement of ex-servicemen after the First World War was a comparative failure. To a certain extent I agree with what the honourable member said. In those days we did not know too much about land settlement. The scheme was an experiment. Unfortunately, quite a few ex-servicemen who went on to the land after the First World War failed. Also, the honourable member saidI cannot agree with this statement-that the removal by this Government of prices control had resulted in some soldier settlers failing after the Second World War. I think the honourable member is well aware that in 1942 land prices were fixed throughout the Commonwealth. Restrictions on the ceiling price of land were not lifted until 1948. But in Queensland things went a little further. Even in 1951, when I came into this Parliament, a good deal of land in Queensland was frozen. Hundreds of thousands of acres of soldier settlement land in Queensland was frozen at 1942 values. Little or nothing was being done to get ex-servicemen on the land. As its excuse for not settling more people quickly on the land the Queensland government claimed that it could not get surveyors and contractors to do certain work. The honourable member for Lalor said that the Chifley Government offered to take over all soldier settlement as it believed it was the Commonwealth's responsibilty to settle ex-servicemen on the land. That is true, but Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria stated that they would accept the responsibility of looking after their returned servicemen. Queensland has the worse record of any State in respect of soldier settlement. Under Labour governments in Queensland only 470 ex-servicemen were",39,Settlement Bill 1963
94,Mr Deputy Speaker,Order! The,44,Settlement Bill 1963
95,Mr Brimblecombe (Maranoa),"settled on blocks. The Queensland Government abandoned its scheme in 1954. In closing down the scheme it threw certain blocks of land open to selection and certain areas were reserved for soldier settlement, but that is as far as the Queensland Government went. The terms and conditions under which soldier settlers financed their blocks were similar to those which applied to non-soldier settlers who drew blocks beside them. The Queensland Government abandoned its soldier settlement scheme in 1954 after it had obtained from the Australian Loan Council its quota for soldier settlement. A few weeks after the Australian Loan Council met the Queensland Government closed down its soldier settlement scheme, but the money obtained from the Commonwealth for the purpose of soldier settlement was not returned to the Commonwealth and was not used for soldier settlement. It was used for other purposes. So in effect Queensland obtained £1,000,000 under false pretences. At that time the Commonwealth Government made an offer to the Queensland Government. It offered to take over the operation of the scheme and contribute £2 for every £1 that the Slate Government contributed towards the cost of maintaining it, but the Queensland Government turned down that most generous offer. I have mentioned this because the honourable member for Scullin said that we were responsible for the failure not only of the war service Iand settlement scheme but of all land settlement schemes. The Commonwealth's offer was designed to speed up the settlement of the remaining appplicants for land, but, as I have said, that offer was refused. The Queensland Government made a counter-offer. It said that it would continue the scheme if the Commonwealth contributed all the money and allowed Queensland to retain possession of the land. The only security available to the Commonwealth was the land, so naturally it would not agree to the proposal. Those are the circumstances behind the Commonwealth's attitude to war service land settlement in Queensland. Only 407 persons were settled on the land. It is generally accepted that there is a failure rate of about 30 per cent, in all land settlement. That has been proved through the years by practically all States. Failures occur because some settlers are no-hopers, some just cannot make a go of it, some are forced out because of seasonal conditions and so on. As to failures by soldier settlers, let me point out that in those cases in which the Commonwealth wrote off the settlement the farmers concerned were far better off then than they would have been if they were receiving Government assistance to enable them to carry on. The money that was put into the land was not lost. Some one else carried on and received the benefit of it. The country did not lose anything. I do not agree that a write-off should be made on the present value of land. I believe that it should be based on the productive capacity of the land. There are arguments for both points of view, but if you wrote off a farm on the basis of its productive capacity you would be working on a more solid foundation than if you had regard to the capital value of the land at the time you proposed to write it off. I have some knowledge of what happened in a soldier settlement area after the First World War. I live rather close to an area which was settled by ex-servicemen of that war. You would not get better country anywhere in the Commonwealth, but many of the settlers failed because of the bad advice that they received from the authorities. They were keen enough to go on the land but they could not get the finance to buy the equipment that they needed. I ask for leave to continue my remarks at a later hour.

The proper forum for disputes that may arise in the future about Malaysia, is in our opinion, the United Nations.

Minister then saidI think I ought to take this opportunity, since the honourable member raises this matter, to say that there is a British-Malayan defence agreement, which was made in 1957. That agreement makes provision for the maintenance of Australian forces in thc Malayan Federation within the Commonwealth Far East Strategic Reserve, which is the particular structure. The Prime Minister then went on to sayI am pleased to say that there has been mutual acceptance of a proposal, and ready agreement among these nations (that is Britain, Malaya, Australia and New Zealand) following discussions in recent weeks, that the arrangement should carry forward into the future. Specifically, that means that the Australian and Malayan Governments consider that the proposed course of action which is to cover the situation now that Malaysia has come into existence, is the most satisfactory. In other words, our arrangement, instead of directing itself to Malaya, will now direct itself to Malaysia -the enlarged unit. This can only mean that we have no direct Lumpur, letters which, to my knowledge, commitment to Malaysia. The arrangewere never made public until March of ment which applied to Malaya is, in the this year.

On August 1, 1960, an for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) Internal Security Act came into force which said on 27th March this yearThere is no formal military alliance between Australia and Malaya. But if the same arrangement which we had with Malaya is now to carry over with regard to Malaysia, it is worthwhile looking at what the arrangement with Malaya actually was so that, on what the Prime Thus, if the Prime Minister's past Minister has said, we can discover what pronouncements can be taken to mean what our new arrangement with Malaysia now is. they say, our commitment to the new State In the House on 19th September, 1957, the of Malaysia is simply an extension of that Prime Minister gave the following towards Malaya-and that commitment he explanation:The Government of the Federation continues to sole ground of the need to combat armed be faced by a campaign of armed Communist terrorist activity.

As I have indicated, they went there and are there as part of a strategic reserve with the United Kingdom and New Zealand and as a contribution to the defence of the South-East Asian area. Only this Government can reconcile the irreconcilable. To further illustrate this point on 16th August, 1960, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition askedNow tliat the Government of Malaya has declared the emergency there at an end, and since Malaya is not a party to or covered by Seato, will the Prime Minister say what formal arrangements exist between Malaya and Australia concerning thc Australian land and air forces based in Malaya?

Even when thc Prime Minister of Malaya said in 1961 that he did not care when Australian troops were repatriated, the Government did nothing to regularise their presence there, or to explain the need for them to continue to be there so long after the emergency had ended. We were not the only ones who thought the conditions were too vague. vagueness helped to place the Tunku himself in a most embarrassing position. A t a political rally in Malacca on 9th March this year, he was reported to have said that Australia was pledged to fight with Malaya in the event of war with Indonesia. After a hurried diplomatic exchange-accom panied, be it noted, by complete official silence from the Australian Governmentthe Tunku was placed in the humiliating situation of having to explain himself before the Malayan House of Representatives, and to give a new interpretation of our commitment, as he believed it to be. He saidIfI have caused embarrassment to Australia by an article giving a series of questions which mentioning her in my speech yesterday, I am terribly sorry.

In his statement to-day, the Prime Minister gave no indication that he realizes the complexity of the situation. The plank of our platform demanding the recall of our troops from Malaya was superseded because the impending formation of Malaysia demanded a new approach lo Australia's possible commitments in this area, and because of the need for open, honest diplomacy expressed in public treaties based on mutual obligations for the protection of mutual interests.

Above The Deputy Prime Minister said in the",46,Malaysia Defence
100,Service ( Mr Mcmahon) Suggest That The Is,"the n I reject it on behalf of the Opposiwe support Britain. Of course we do; but the real question is whether or not we support Malaysia. Indeed, the chief obstacle which the Tunku has met with in recent months has been the conviction on the part of Indonesia and the Philippines that Malaysia represents a form of neo-colonialism. Our job is to help dispel that belief. The chief object of British policy has been to demonstrate that Malaysia is a genuine attempt at orderly de-colonisation. Our job is to assist Britain to achieve that object. This then is another reason why our future obligations must be clearly, publicly, and independently stated. I hope the Government has not forgotten the lesson it should have learnt from the late John Curtin. Mr Curtin stood for the principle that no matter how closely our larger interests coincided with those of the United Kingdom, no matter how essential co-operation between the United Kingdom Government and the Australian Government might be, Australia must insist at all times on making her own decisions with regard to diplomatic policy, and the deployment of troops in the Asian hemisphere, or anywhere else outside Australia. If John Curtin stood for anything, he stood for that principle; and the victory of our armed forces and the maintenance of the inviolability of our soil during the war against Japan was the triumphant vindication of that principle. Further, let me re-emphazise that we owe it to our neighbours to be clear and precise in our commitments and intentions. We have the firmest desire to maintain the friendliest relations with Indonesia and the Philippines. I hope they share that desire. The basis of friendship is mutual trust. The existence of trust depends upon the avoidance of suspicion, and the things which might give rise to suspicion. Unless all our treaty arrangements are made clear and public, it is inevitable that suspicion will arise. Friendship and honor alike require that our intentions should be made clear beyond doubt, and beyond room for misrepresentation and misunderstanding. It is, unfortunately, the case that Malaysia was born in an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion. It is our clear interest and duty to do all in our power to dispel that hostility are doing, to annex the agreement in its full and and suspicion. Vague military arrangements, unratified by Parliament, misunderstood by other governments, will have the reverse effect. Surely the Government has learnt its lesson in West New Guinea. Surely we do not contemplate a repetition of that shameful episode. In that case, we misled the Netherlands and confused Indonesia. Both had cause to be doubtful of our attitude, and in the end both grew contemptuous of our ambiguity. I have said that we owe it to our neighbours to clarify our intentions by means of open treaty. Let it not be forgotten that we owe it also to our allies-the allies with which we have mutual commitments by virtue of the very type of treaty which we on this side of the House advocate. It may be noted in passing that one of our treaty allies-unde r Seato-is the Philippines, undoubtedly an interested party in the present dispute with Malaysia. Another ally under Seato is Thailand, Malaya's immediate neighbour. The keystones of Australia's foreign policy are two open, clear and public treaties-ANZUS and Seato. If it is possible to formulate treaties with our fellow members of the Commonwealth, Britain and New Zealand, and with our most powerful friend, the United States, why is it not possible to formulate such a treaty with another member of the Commonwealth, Malaysia. But, if it is argued that such a treaty is not needed with a fellow member of the Commonwealth, then why are treaties necessary with our closest, oldest Commonwealth fellow-members and our greatest allies, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the United States? Indeed, when it suits his purpose, the Prime Minister has shown no reluctance to conclude formal treaties, ratified by Parliament. It is only six months since he introduced into this House a treaty relating to the North-West Cape base, although at the same time he pointed out that there was no constitutional necessity to do so. On March 26 he enunciated this principleWhen the details have been worked out and this matter, which is most important from the point of view of the Umted States of America, the Allied point of view and our own point of view, can be put in hand we propose, JO that there may be no doubt outside about the validity of what we final terms to a bill and to invite the Parliament to ratify it. Let me repeat those words"" so that there may be no doubt outside about the validity of what we are doing""-and by "" outside "" he clearly meant our allies and our neighbours. The course that the Prime Minister took with regard to the naval communication centre was perfectly correct. It would be equally correct, but far more necessary, in the case of any commitment in Malaysia. If this argument is not accepted, then the Government is committed to the curious proposition that we must trust Malaysia more, and they must take us on trust more, than the United States trusts us, or we them. The Prime Minister made the remarkable statement to-day that "" it has not been the usual practice of Commonwealth countries to spell out in detail their sense of mutual obligations "", yet have we not done so with Britain in the case of Woomera? Have we not done so with New Zealand in the case of ANZUS, and with New Zealand, Britain and Pakistan in the case of Seato? Most strikingly of all, in the very statement in which the Prime Minister made this assertion, he pointed to a detailed agreement between two Commonwealth countries, namely Britain and Malaysia itself. And yet, presumably to forestall our demand for a formal treaty, the Prime Minister condemned the practice of making treaties between members of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister said to-day that the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve was "" relevant to the functions of Seato "". This is special pleading, for the reserve could not be used for Seato purposes under the 1957 United Kingdom-Malaya Agreement and can now only be used for Seato purposes under the 1963 United Kingdom-Malaysia Agreement in Singapore. Australia's Army base at Malacca and RAAF. base at Butterworth can still not be used for Seato purposes. In fact neither agreement gives Australia the right to maintain bases anywhere in Malaysia, and, indeed, the 1963 agreement gives Australia no rights. It sets out the rights of Britain. It sets out the obligations of Britain. It sets out the rights of Malaysia. It sets out the obligations of Malaysia. But where does Australia come in? We have rights under ANZUS and Seato but not under the United Kingdom-Malaysia Agreement. We undertake obligations under ANZUS and Seato, but not under this agreement. Above all, we owe it to our own people, and in particular, our fighting men to declare our intentions specifically and openly. In the final analysis, we, here, are dealing with men's lives. It is true that our troops now in Malaya are volunteers. But they have volunteered for the service of their country and their country owes it to them to say unmistakably what it expects of them. The conditions under which they might be called upon to fight cannot be left to the discretion of the Malaysian Government, or the decision of the British command. They are our men, and those who constitute the membership of the National Parliament alone have the right, the responsibility and the duty to determine when, where and how they shall be used. The Australian Labour Party will never call on any Australian to shed his blood without telling him, without the least equivocation, why we ask him to make the sacrifice. Labour governments have mobilized Australia's armies in two world wars. The people trusted us because we trusted the people. It was on the basis of frankness and trust that we were able to lead the people. We do not intend to depart from that principle now, or ever.

Secretary-General of the United Nations had, after investigation, satisfied himself that the majority of the people of Sarawak and North Borneo wanted to join Malaysia. He said that all this weighed heavily with the Labour Party and that we should stand by the verdict of those who made the investigation on behalf of the United Nations. Clearly, in the critical points of his declaration of Labour's attitude he was, I am happy to say, taking exactly the same line as the Government takes. This is very good for Australia and good for the new state of Malaysia.

Have the Leader of the Opposition and the Labour Party forgotten the great Seato alliance that was formed in 1954 and that those who were parties to that alliance assumed some military obligations? Have they forgotten that the Commonwealth countries proceeded immediately to equip themselves to discharge their obligations by arranging the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve, as was done in 1955, the year after the establishment of Seato? That strategic reserve was posted in Malaya. Every one knows that was our contribution towards the security of South-East Asia. That is the reason why our troops were put there, and all of them were proud to be able to make an invaluBut to deal with the Communist terand others interested, knew that perfectly clear knowledge, it does not do credit to what the Prime Minister has said. He quoted the Prime Minister as saying, when The Government of the Federation continues to terrorism within its borders. It has accordingly against the terrorists. Australia has been glad to join with the United Kingdom and It is interesting to note that in attempting to confuse the issue by departing down a very questionable side alley, the Leader of the Opposition lead himself into the unhappy situation of having to remind the House and the country that it was in these circumstances that the Labour Party evolved a policy of withdrawing our troops and bringing them home. At that moment, that was the Labour Party's contribution to withstanding the southern penetration of Communists in this area which is so vital to the security of our own country. To clear the record, I point out that he reminds us again that that unhappy decision of policy on the part of the Labour Party to call our troops home has since been repealed. AllI say is that if there is confusion in any one's thinking, or in any one's policy-if there is confusion in the capacity of onlookers to comprehend what goes on-that confusion is all on the opposite side of the House. Again to put the record straight, I point Government. The Leader of the Opposition out that the Leader of the Opposition makes saidit quite clear to-night that the Labour Party is not now advocating the withdrawal of whether Australian troops from Malaysia. We are we do. happy to accept Labour's present decision He saidand to forget Labour's earlier unhappy attitude on this critical matter. On this great support issue, and at this very difncult period, Australia needs a truly bi-partison policy as she has never needed one before, and I hope that, notwithstanding its unhappy ingredients hoped that it was clear on his side of the here and there, the speech of the Leader House. But, if these two things are separof the Opposition to-night is basically the able, then we make it clear that we unrevelation of a bi-partisan policy in Ausdoubtedly support Britain as she undoubtralia with respect to this matter.

The Leader of the Opposition agrees with Of course, the Leader of the Opposition is the Government that the independence and here recounting the explicit reason why our integrity of Malaysia must be preserved; he troops were posted in Malaya in the first agrees with the Government that Australia place and why they have been retained there is vitally interested in this area; he agrees as part of the Commonwealth Strategic that there should be an Australian alliance Reserve. That is why we have entered with Malaysia; he agrees that there should into commitments under the Seato pact. It be an Australian alliance with the United is why we have a vital association with the United States of America in this area. That was the reason why the troops were posted there and it is a reason why they are there to-day. A new reason that emerges is our willingness to protect the territorial and political integrity and independence of the new State of Malaysia. The Leader of the Opposition said that his party recognizes that this is a reason, and he approves now of our troops remaining there as a protection against that threat from the Communists. To clear up the point that he has raised in a confusing manner, it has been, as all the world knows, a cardinal point of the policy of Australian governments, from whichever side of the House they have been drawn-and it is certainly a cardinal point of the policy of this Government-that the control of Australian forces when overseas shall never pass out of the authority of the Australian We are not really faced with the question of or not we support Britain. Of course, But the real question is whether or not we Malaysia. I did not think it was the real question; I thought it was clear on our part, and I had tedly supports Australia.

Up to this point all that he has said has comprehension that we will stand by each confirmed the policies and acts of the other. We do not need signed documents Government; but if we take his words to make clear that we intend to adhere to literally, then all these declarations of policy our word. and attitude are negated by his complaint that we have not a treaty with Malaysia. be in criticism of the Australian Labour He would like, to use his most curious Party on this issue. I would have much words, a treaty with Malaysia, mutual for preferred the Leader of the Opposition to preference. But Malaysia is only ten days conclude his speech, which he opened very old. He would withdraw the substance of correctly, by making clear to all Australians all he says he believes in because we have and to all our friends and those who are not a treaty with a country ten days old, not our friends overseas that, as far as a country that has been tormented with Australia's internal security and relations trouble since it was established. Does the with other Commonwealth countries are Leader of the Opposition seriously suggest concerned, there is one Australian policy. that we should have negotiated, concluded and published a treaty with a country ten days old? All the world knows that it has been a characteristic of the British Commonwealth and is a characteristic of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell). new Commonwealth of Nations that we do However, we do not need the encomiums not require of each other documents of of the Deputy Prime Minister, for the mutual obligation. When the Leader of the Opposition providing for the defence of this country sought to show that this attitude is negated speaks for itself and is in striking contrast by the existence of a whole series of treaties with the record of those who sit opposite. between Commonwealth countries, what did I am sure I speak for all Opposition memhe recount?

In many aspects of trade and mutual aid there can be reciprocal advantage. The new federation accomplishes another vital objective in securing to its people the right of self-determination. Any small that are ever seeking to expand their influence and power. Efforts at expansion often are paraded as attempts to liberate people from neo-colonialism, but they really are adventures in appropriation. The United Kingdom Government has wisely forestalled the use of any such justification if ever it could be regarded as justifiNowI come to the deterioration of to such a degree as to cause violent action I personally view the present attitude and actions of Indonesia with considerable concern, for I was one of those who exercised good offices with the State Department of the United States of America and at the United Nations to bring about Indonesian independence. At ihe time when Indonesia was seeking independence, many believed that the opportunity to exercise self-government would bring the Indonesians to apply themselves earnestly to the task of building their nation and establishing their nationhood with the best of intentions to preserve peace and maintain goodwill. increasing incentive for the Indonesians to stabilize their own domestic economy and to raise the standard of living of their people. The contributions made under the Colombo Plan have shown the desire of Australia and other countries to assist in promoting the well-ordered development and peaceful pursuits of Indonesia. I say, also, that 1 deplore the hostile demonstrations that have occurred in the Malaysian capital. Such incidents can only inflame the minds of other peoples. No good purpose is served by such ill-considered and irrational conduct. I should like to make a few observations about the efforts by the Malysian Prime Minister to achieve some accord with both Indonesia and the Philippines. His willingness to attend two summit conferences in Tokyo and Manila, and his agreement to submit certain matters to examination by the United Nations and to defer the date of proclaiming the new federation constitute an impressive gesture of good faith and are evidence of a wish to be on friendly terms with neighbouring nations. Malaysia has no military strength of its own to make it a threat to any one. This brings me to Australia's commitment to Malaysia. I believe most strongly that if we are to have any part in defending this area of the world, our role should be laid down clearly in a public treaty, as has already been stated by the Leader of the Opposition in the excellent speech that he made to-night. That is what is demanded by other nations that have responsibilities of this kind. We in this country, along with the United States and New Zealand, have clearly stated in a publicly-known treaty our mutual commitments to one another's defence. That treaty has been approved by the parliaments here and in New Zealand and by the Congress of the United States. In that treaty, we have committed ourselves to firm and definite action if acts of aggression arc ever threatened or attempted against any of the signatories. Is Australia, as a fellow member of the Commonwealth of Nations, to have in relation to Malaysia a code of committal different from that which we have in relation to New Zealand? Our commitment Many envisaged also an to New Zealand is firmly declared in a treaty made public and endorsed by this Parliament. Let us have matters of this kind in relation to Malaysia put into some regular form. A letter may carry all the implications of committal, but is it really fair to the Australian community to allow one man or even several men to commit this nation to a course so grave and perhaps so full of sacrifice without the knowledge and consent of the Parliament? The people will demand to know the exact terms of our commitment, and any undertaking should be implemented in some regular form by the Parliament. The United States requires this to be done if it is to be committed. I see no reason why the requirement set torth in the declared policy of the Australian Labour Party should not stand also in the name of the Australian people. This is the way in which we have committed ourselves in the wider sphere of the South-East Asia Treaty Organization. Let us recognize that any commitment to Malaysia may have far-reaching obligations and consequences. The Australian nation has a right to know the exact nature of those obligations and likely consequences. This may be a time also when the good offices of mediation would be appropriate. Australia is in a unique position to exercise a restraining influence, and we must not miss the opportunity to seek to restrain and curb any belligerency, no matter from whom it comes, and any action that would disturb the peace of this area of the world. It would be interesting to know whether the Government has considered having the situation reviewed at the United Nations General Assembly now meeting in New York. The United Nations, as an international authority, cannot be indifferent to these happenings that we are discussing, ing from the present into the past and into since a party delegated by that body has the dimness and confusions of the past than verified the wishes of the people concerned. in facing up to the realities of the present.

What are the conditions which the Opposition has not yet revealed but which it regards as so important that without that price being paid for its support, it will not give it?

I wonder whether there has been some argument in the Labour Party about what should go into the treaty. answer. ber for Fremantle tells me that there has been no argument in the Labour Party about what should go into this treaty. His statement reveals the Opposition's suggestion that there should be a treaty as even more fatuous than I described it earlier. The Opposition insists on having a treaty without even knowing or arguing about what should go into it. Tlie Labour Party says, "" We will not oppose, but there must be a treaty "". The Labour Party has not disclosed to the people of Australia or to the world at large what it thinks should go into the treaty. The two speakers from the Opposition made some remarks about the necessity for control over our troops. Control exists at present without the necessity for any treaty to be concluded with Malaysia or any other power. But I am sure that the people of Australia will be asking what the Labour Party means when it speaks of qualified support contingent upon the conclusion of a treaty. Is this an escape clause? Is it a sop to those members of the Labour Party who otherwise would not have gone as far as the Leader of the Opposition wished them to go? These are the questions which anybody analysing the speech of the Leader of the Opposition must be prepared to ask. I turn from that to what seems to me to be the real core of the matter, and that is the existing situation of Malaysia. What is happening in Malaysia to-day-the anxieties in Malaysia and the dangers that confront Malaysia-ar e facts. They are facts with which we must grapple. They are facts in which we in Australia are vitally interested. In the first remarks that I make on my own account I should like to try to set out clearly what seem to me to be the reasons not only why the Government of Australia but also, I believe, the majority of the people of Australia see the fate of Malaysia as being very much their concern. The first point is that Malaysia was created by a democratic and constitutional process. That democratic and constitutional process has been made freshly evident in the last few days first by the report of the United Nations Secretary General after the examination of the situation in North Borneo and Sarawak and more recently by the results of the free elections in Singapore, which clearly show that the majority of the people of Singapore endorse the action of their Prime Minister in joining with the federation. So Malaysia was created by democratic and constitutional process. Because it was so created and not brought into existence by force of arms, intimidation or threat, we in Australia will want to see it survive. We will wish it luck and will be ready to support it. The second reason is that Malaysia has come into existence as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and we in Australia value our association with other member nations. We value in particular the ancient alliances we have had in many times of trouble, and we value also our common store of ideals and traditions. Those ideas about what is proper conduct between nations and what are the proper responsibilities of nations towards each other are to-day perhaps the strongest bonds that bind us. So because Malaysia is a member of the Commonwealth we feel more than the passing interest we would feel if it were not. Coming closer to our national interest, Malaysia is worth something to Australia. The stability and the prosperity of Malaysia are important to us. We live, we trade and we prosper in this region of the world, and the stability and the prosperity of every one",57,Malaysia Defence

111,Mr Hasluck,"The honourable memof our near neighbours vitally affect our own stability and prosperity. So we want to see a stable and a prosperous Malaysia just as we wish to see stability and prosperity in other countries around us. The security of Malaysia undoubtedly must add to the security of the whole of the region in which we live, just as the insecurity of Malaysia must add to the insecurity of the whole of the region in which we live. Any threat from anywhere to the peace of this region is a threat to ourselves. Although these things may not interest or concern the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns), who is interjecting, I believe that, though rather axiomatic, they are not dealing with a question for a potenare the things in which the people of Australia are mainly interested and the things on which the declaration by the Government of Australia is based. I believe they support the Government. The fina] set of circumstances to which I what he regarded as the misuse of the word wish to refer is that this issue of Malaysia is important to us because in giving support to the survival of Malaysia we are maintainmeant by mutual obligations. He said that ing respect for the choice of a free people and respect for a democratic and constitutional process. In addition, we are resisting within Seato, could find that Malaysian termethods of intimidation, negotiation by threat, and diplomacy by abuse; we are resisting methods of infiltration and subversion, and we are maintaining the political and territorial integrity of nations against whom aggression may rise in any form. Those are things which I believe the people of Australia value and which they would wish to support. In giving our support to Malaysia in the clear terms of the declaration made by the Prime Minister this afternoon, we hope that we will hearten the people of Malaysia, we hope that we will hearten those others who support them and we hope that we will strengthen the resolution of all those who try to ensure that the principles which we value are applied day by day, month by month and year by year in the conduct of international relations. It is because the situation seems so clear to all of us on this three months. There is clarity in the policy side of the House and, I believe, to the people of Australia, that, whilst we welcome the indication from the Opposition that it does not differ fundamentally from what the Government has said by way of support of Malaysia, we wish that the declaration by the Opposition had been given in more forthright and less equivocal terms than those in which it has been given. We wish, and I am sure the people of Australia wish, that the Opposition would not talk in the rather wordy way in which the Leader of the Opposition traversed the ground and avoided most of the corners, but that it would talk in a forthright, plain and simple way. There is not a great deal to be said in this situation. All that is required are what side we are on and, being on that side, simple words that mean: "" Yes. We know we will use all our efforts to support it."" tial election. We are dealing with a question for a potential war, and the discussion in this Parliament to-night should proceed on that basis. For the life of me, I cannot understand why a responsible Minister of the Crown should want to quibble about "" mutual "". The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) made perfectly clear what he Malaysia had assumed no obligations towards Seato and that Australia, functioning ritory was denied to Australian forces. That is utterly wrong. can refute me. That is the meaning of the statement of the Leader of the Opposition. You do not answer that statement by bellowing. Our relations with Indonesia have been the graveyard of the reputations of Ministers for External Affairs-Spender, who gave guarantees about West Irian and whose words were flung to scorn, Casey, and now the Minister whom the Government has run out of the country. The Government sounds uncertain trumpet calls and asks us to follow it. But which line shall we follow-the Barwick line or the Menzies line? With the utmost goodwill in the world, we say that the trumpet has given out very uncertain sounds over the last which was enunciated to-day, but not in those enunciated before to-day. If men are to be committed to fight, they need a Parliament behind them which is not wrangling. I am not interested in attacking the Government on this. The argument",58,Malaysia Defence

114,Mr Beazley,"If I am wrong youtliat obligations should be clear and precise needs to be answered by analysis. It should not be shouted down. Secondly, we must face the fact that if Indonesia intends to mount a full-scale offensive against Malaysia, the whole of the armed forces of Australia, let alone the few men in Malaysia, will seem very small indeed. If there is any restraining influence in the new declaration of Australian foreign policy on this matter, it is because the armed forces of the United Kingdom will be able to use Australian territory, not because the armed forces of Australia, especially the segment in Malaysia, could be called a powerful army. Thirdly, Indonesia's purpose appears lo be to eliminate Western influence in South East Asia. Indonesia's illusion is that if Western influence is eliminated it will be replaced by Indonesian influence. It will not. influence. We must face the fact also that many Asian powers do not think as we do. They did not adopt the same attitude as we did to West Irian. For instance, India said, ""This is a case of Asians returning to Asia "", whereas the Africans said, "" This is a case of black men like ourselves being handed over to Asian imperialism "". Then we have the curious attitude of the Philippines in this present crisis. We ask the Government one or two questions. First, is Indonesia's confrontation of MalaysiaI use the Indonesian word ""confrontation "", which is a new word for "" threats towards ""-to be submitted to the United Nations as a threat to world peace? I believe that it should be submitted to the United Nations as a threat io world peace, and that it should be submitted to the United Nations by the Australian Government. The mission of the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) to New York will have significance if that is his intention. If that is not his intention, he is merely going to the ordinary proceedings of the United Nations and he is moving from a position of relevance here to one of irrelevance in New York. in the United Nations. have not much faith in it? irrelevance. is made relevant if it is called upon to make decisions on this situation; but if these are ordinary procedural affairs of the United Nations and no one is going to bell the cat of Indonesian threats of aggression, then the proceedings at the United Nations are irrelevant to what to this country has become the most important issue, namely the activities of a neighbour with whom we share a common frontier in New Guinea. The United Nations, in its procedures on this matter so far, has seen to it that the vital principle of self-determination has been carried out. The decision has been verified. What has happened has been a violation by Indonesia of the diplomatic decencies. I invite the Government to consider this: Since the Government says that its position It will be replaced by Chinese has been very clear and we members of the Opposition ought to have been following it, I say that if its attitude towards Malaysia had been clear the Australian Embassy in Djakarta would now be gutted. Every country which has stood against an Indonesian interest has had its embassy or its consulate attacked. It is precisely because the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) has left his position unclear that the Australian Embassy in Djakarta is intact. The Malayan consulate was attacked. Honourable members will remember that this technique was used earlier when the United States appeared not to be supporting Indonesia's position on West Irian. This is not a new technique in Indonesia policy at all. There are a good many silences in the statement made by the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies); but he was not silent on 14th July of this year when he said that he understood the United States view that the defence of the new federation should be a Commonwealth of Nations responsibility. If the Australian Government has had any discussions with the United States on this matter, I think it would be very good if they were revealed in this House. This back-handed way of saying things appears to me to mean that the United States takes no responsibility for the defence of Malaysia; it says that that is a Commonwealth of Nations matter. One can put the position positively by saying that it",59,Malaysia Defence

This engaging little flash of information as to what is the United States opinion of this situation came in July and has not been repeated; but it is very relevant to this country in making Subandrio, in promising Malaysia a terrible decisions about what we should do. We confrontation, to use his word, saidhark back to March when the Minister for External Affairs gave his blessing to the supports it, will still be a question mark. three-power talks, the intention of which He accused Tunku Abdul Rahman, as as far as Philippine and Indonesian policy Soekarno did, of having broken a promise was concerned was clearly to delay and to conduct a plebiscite. frustrate the establishment of Malaysia. I do not believe that the clarity that the Government feels it has in its policy to-day was apparent then. However, there are a number of things Government says to the Opposition, "" What about which I believe we can be confident. would you do?"", when the Opposition as We can be confident about the fact that an opposition can do nothing. I do not if we have to defend Malaysia we will be stand and ridicule what are quite apparently defending a free decision to federate.

In fact, we have had a great negative verification of that in the decision of Brunei not to fact and challenges are hurled it would. There is no doubt that Indonesia's pressure, even if it stops short of war, is going to be a continuing fact in regard to Malaysia. I think an issue of pride has become involved in this matter.

The towards Indonesia in any part of this House. In fact, I believe that there is a very general to Malaysia. This is a most relevant point. belief in this Parliament that Indonesia and Australia have the same fundamental interests and that both countries could have their independence destroyed by aggression from the north. We had the same fundamental strategic interests in the Second World War, although Indonesian affairs were then conducted by the Dutch. I do not think that on this matter there is any need for any hostility or bitterness in this House. We are still hopeful that restraining influences will operate on Indonesia. I hope that the restraining influences will be not merely those of the United Kingdom but also those of the United States. It may be that the violent attacks on the embassies have helped to consolidate United States opinion in a way that did not exist before. It certainly appears so when one studies the United States press. We do have a vested interest in getting this matter settled, in mobilizing every restraining influence on Indonesia that can be mobilized. I think the tactics of Idonesia have not been much good from that country's own point of view. There are limits to the tolerance of people who may be persuaded to believe that a kind of diplomatic larrikinism can pay off. We should recognize the fact that these methods of diplomatic larrikinism did pay off in the case of West Irian, and that this is why they are being used again at the present time. But I think it would not be very hard for the Government, if it desires complete parliamentary unity on this question, tp proceed to get clarification of the obligations of Australia to Malaysia and vice versa. I quite concede that Malaysia is only ten days old. If you read carefully the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition you will find that he has not said that we want a treaty this minute; he has asked for clarification and precise definition of obligations, and a firm treaty as a matter of future policy. The position of the Australian forces in Malaya, he said, warrants this. But if the Government is serious in believing that this country is committed to the defence of Malaysia, what it should be telling the Australian people-and if it wants to have a restraining influence it should make the statement publicly so that Indonesia will be aware of it-is what forces it has to implement these promises We have spoken about being practical, and every member of this House knows ihat if the forces available are those that are now in Malaysia, then they are very small in comparison with the forces in Indonesia. [9.42] I am sure that all Australians who have had the opportunity of listening to this debate to-night, or who will read reports of it in the newspapers to-morrow will regret deeply that although the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) commenced by expressing the Opposition's support of the establishment of the Malaysian Federation, he then proceeded to give reason after reason why the Opposition does not support it. I believe that most people in Australia agree that on an important subject such as this we shouid avoid petty party politics and devise a decent bi-partisan policy to give expression to the will of all the people of Australia. Too much of this discussion has been based on the treaty-orno-treaty proposition. The people of Australia are far more Impressed by notions of friendship and fellowship than they are by this extraordinary suggestion that we should be tied up with legalistic restrictions which would, no doubt, give the lawyers plenty of opportunity to find escape holes should they be required. I am sure the people of Australia are far more concerned with the honesty of purpose and association which underlies the general conception of the Commonwealth of Nations than they are with a lot of legalistic treaties. During this discussion to-night perhaps too little attention has been given to tbe overall philosophy behind the present situation. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck), I think, touched on this subject to a certain extent, and I propose to give it some attention. We all wish for peace and we believe that peace and progress are the best things for our neighbours to the north. We believe that the security of the Australian mainland and of Papua and New Guinea is dependent to a great extent on the peace and security of our northern neighbours. The progress and evolution of those countries will be based on their ability to produce the kind cf economy which will raise living standards and remove the kind of ground which communism finds",60,Malaysia Defence
119,Mr Mackinnon (Corangamite),"so fertile and in which it can grow. We must accept the fact that any step taken to halt such progress in the areas with which we are concerned in this discussion must inevitably hinder the development of a large-scale economic effort in those areas. Furthermore-and this was also mentioned by the Minister for Territories-if these countries are now to be asked for a military effort at a time when they are trying to further their own economic development, this must represent a great hindrance to future progress. This can be illustrated-and I say this with deep regret by the obsession of Indonesia with military armaments, which undoubtedly has been the main cause of that country's deplorable economic situation. If similar conditions are to be forced on the smaller countries, particularly this new Federation of Malaysia, the possibility of their steady social and economic development must be seriously threatened. Australia more than any other country is directly interested in this problem. We want peace and we want our neighbours to have peaceful conditions in which they can carry out their tasks of development and of raising their living standards. In this atmosphere we must also remember the constant pressures of Chinese Communist expansion in this area, which make so much more necessary a common development policy which, by raising living standards, will remove the ground in which communism grows.

Now, with the almost complete withdrawal of those stabilizing influences and the estabthat the deep-down cause of friction lishment of newly emerged governments in between Dr. Soekarno and Tunku Abdul the former colonial territories, we are faced Rahman is the realization that the policies with a completely new set of circumstances, of the Government in Malaya have been wilh changed values and with unpredictable successful, whereas the economic deteriorapossibilities. The final withdrawal of the tion of Indonesia is almost unbelievable, United Kingdom from the Borneo dependencies has virtually completed the disengagement of which I have been speaking. The Australian Government, with due consideration for the stability of the new countries that is so essential to Australia""s security, has wisely decided to support the new federation, and it is the extent of this support that we are now considering. The nature of this support must also be considered in the context of our future relations with our neighbours, and this immediately brings us to the problem of the future of Australia's relations with Indonesia, where the events of the last few months, as has been mentioned by the honourable member for Bonython( Mr Makin), have clearly tended to confirm the doubts and misgivings which we had at the height of the West New Guinea dispute, and which have been renewed by the establishment of Indonesian occupation troops in West New Guinea. The geographical fact of becoming a nextdoor neighbour to Indonesia has further emphasized the problem. The reason for Australia's support of the new federation are many. They have been well set out in previous statements and by earlier speakers in this debate. I do not propose to go into them at any length, but there is one feature of the situation which was brought home to me very clearly during a recent brief visit to the area concerned. Malaya has evolved, despite the trials and tribulations of protracted activities against militant Communists, a most dynamic economy supported by an efficient and proI further believe that it is almost palpable especially in view of the richness of the area and the sound position of the national finances some years ago. Indonesian preoccupation with the recovery of the white elephant-West New Guinea-and the expenditure involved in defeating the rebellion of 1956 cannot be real reasons for financial collapse. Similar problems were facing Malaya in its early struggle against communism. Following complete economic irresponsibility, we are now confronted by continuing manifestations of political irresponsibility, of which the events of the last few weeks are unfortunately only too symptomatic. I believe that the Tunku, with the understandable desire to see Malaysia launched on a calm sea-for which I praise him-ha s done everything humanly possible, even to the extent of leaning over backwards, to placate Indonesia and the Philippines. The indications are that the Philippines will accept the fait accompli, even if with little enthusiasm. But Indonesia appears to remain obsessed with the imaginary feeling of being contained, with hostility directed at the United Kingdom as the alleged instigator of neocolonialism in what it considers to be an Indonesian sphere of influence. This was mentioned by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley). With the examples we have already seen of irrational and irresponsible behaviour at the highest level, I believe it is impossible to make an intelligent forecast of what is likely to be Indonesia's next step, but one thing seems abundantly clear. I want to make my position on this quite obvious. What is abundantly clear-it has been explained and accentuated in the statement by the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) concerning Australia's attitude towards and its understanding with the United Kingdom and Malaysia-is that we must leave no doubt in Indonesian minds about what national action we will take should Indonesia's present policies lead it into an attack on the new federation, even at the obvious and probable risk of incurring the full blast of hostility which all along has worth mentioning that we undertook an descended on the heads of any nation that expresses opposition to Indonesian demands. I regret having to state these facts, but I believe they must be faced. At the time of the dispute over the observers who were to accompany the recent United Nations mission to Borneo, Dr. Subandrio was reported as saying, "" We always get what we want"". I believe that all people who are interested in international affairs realize that the time has arrived when, with some imagination and with a full knowledge of the implications, we must stand firm with Britain and Malaysia, even at the risk of an outbreak of hostilities. We must be prepared also to increase substantially the availability of our military forces in any eventuality that may arise. It has often been said in the press and in speeches in this chamber that we in Australia, through the Colombo Plan, have taken an active part in promoting the economic welfare of South-East Asia. We must be prepared now, both mentally and physically, to accept a greater share of military responsibility. Criticism has been levelled at the Government-mainl y from Australian sources, and not so much from outside Australia-to thc effect that we have for too long relied on the forces of the United States of America and of the United Kingdom for the provision of the military backbone in the area where we are so vitally concerned. The Government's present decision makes our position and intentions unequivocally clear. I believe that it expresses the opinion of the great bulk of the Australian people, who have for some months been more than uneasy about the shape of developments to our north. I remind honourable members that Australia has been directly interested in the defence of Malaya since 1955. The Prime Minister in that year pointed out that in some aspects the defence of Malaya was more important than the defence of some point on the Australian coastline. Since then, the Government has regarded the defence of the countries of South-East Asia as a collective responsibility and a joint effort. Hence our part in Seato, our contribution to the strategic reserve and our ANZUS commitment. Incidentally, ii is immediate responsibility in Korea. It has already been mentioned that we accepted an involvement in the Commonwealth effort in Malaya, subsequently embodied in our acceptance of the implications of the British-Malayan agreement in 1957. Under this agreement we accepted in general terms a Commonwealth responsibility. I point out that Australia's entry into the British-Malayan agreement was accompanied by distinct reservations about the specific British role in the external defence of Malaya. In other words, we were restricted in our obligation to an internal defensive requirement in line with our other international understandings. that this situation fits in with the general approach to a Commonwealth obligation related to our association with other Commonwealth countries, such as our immediate reaction to the Indo-Sino conflict last year. These obligations are perhaps difficult to define and the eventualities which may occur can never be anticipated, but I believe that I express the thoughts of most Australians when I say that the legalistic drawing up of treaties is not only practically impossible in this world of rapidly changing situations, but also that the attitude of hiding behind some ill-defined or inappropriate treaty clause is foreign to our national character and wishes. In view of the report of the United Nations visiting mission, accepted by the Secretary-General, U Thant, as a reasonable appreciation of the wishes of the people concerned, we must expect to have the weight of world opinion with us when we declare for the maintenance and security of the new Malaysia Federation. Debate (on motion by Mr Coutts) adjourned. LOAN (WAR SERVICE LAND Second Reading. Debate resumed (vide page 1364). [9.59] -Before the suspension of the sitting I was relating to the House some of the reasons why, in my view, the settlement of war veterans in certain areas was a failure. Although the land provided for settlement in certain areas was the best obtainable for that purpose, some of the settlers were wrongly advised on the methods to be adopted in preparing the land and on suitable crops. On some occasions dry conditions caused the failure of crops and at that time bad market conditions were operating. That is all I want to say in regard to that matter, but I wish to return to the subject of my opening remarks. I agree that they are not relevant to the bill before the House, but I made them in reply to certain statements made by the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters) on land settlement. I I believe thought it was quite proper that the true position regarding soldier settlement in Queensland, and why it was discontinued so early, should be made known to this House, and the minds of certain honourable members refreshed in regard to the deplorable attitude adopted at that time by the then Laboui Government in Queensland. The approach was dishonest and it was not a genuine approach to soldier settlement after World War II . I support the bill and I hope it will be the last measure of this kind that will have to be brought before this House. bill was introduced by the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann) on 14th August. It sets out to fulfil the obligations and commitments to soldier settlers entered into by the Commonwealth and State Governments under the war service land settlement scheme. I want to speak particularly about the land settlement scheme on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. It was amusing this afternoon fo listen to the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) praising himself for thc great fight he had been waging on behalf of these settlers. It is all the more amusing when we recall that about fifteen months ago many of the soldier settlers on Kangaroo Island sent an SOS. to the Australian Labour Party for help because of the inaction of both the Federal and State governments (Maranoa) and their failure to recognize the plight of these men. The settlers had received promises; they had received sympathy; but they had received no help. Hence their appeal to the Labour Party a week after the then Minister of Lands in South Australia had said that he was completely satisfied with the way the soldier settlement scheme had gone. This statement by the South Australian Minister followed complaints from some of the settlers on Kangaroo Island.",62,Malaysia Defence
120,Mr Brimblecombe,,65,Settlement Bill 1963
121,Mr Sexton (Adelaide) [10.3],"ThisAt that stage the honourable member for Barker made no public statement, but after our visit to Kangaroo Island he was the first honourable member in this House to be on his feet at question time to ask about soldier settlement problems. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) and I visited Kangaroo Island and addressed a meeting of soldier settlers there. At that meeting we were told of the hardships under which they work. I shall list some of the complaints that were made at that meeting. It was claimed that the development charges, particularly for the first 50 settlers, were too high for economic returns, and that some settlers were heading for financial disaster. This was admitted on all sides. The ex-servicemen alleged that tbe high cost of development and the restricted allocation of superphosphate for fertilizing their land was crippling them and preventing them from obtaining the best production that could be obtained from their holdings. To their chagrin they noted that later settlers were given a greater allocation of superphosphate, which would give them some semblance ol an economic return. It was also claimed that the capital costs of development were too high, that interest rates were too high, and that repayment rentals were too high. We were told also that the living allowances for working and family expenses were far too low and in many cases worked out at less than the basic wage when all of the items were taken into consideration. Of course, this caused a feeling of frustration and led to a lack of development in this area. Again, these men believed that they were not being fairly treated in that the valuations settler is allowed by this Government and of their properties were based on the actual cost of development rather than on the economic values of the blocks. The act expressly states that thc lesser value shall prevail and of course that would naturally be the economic value of the block and not the cost of developing it. I will give illustrations of some of the costs involved and how they mount up. The average settler on Kangaroo Island buys about 60 tons of superphosphate a year. This costs I am speaking of last year and I presume the cost is still the same-£1 2 13s. a ton at the factory. Another £3 17s. a ton is paid to the Adelaide Steamship Company Limited and other firms to transport the superphosphate from the factory to the farm. Superphosphate alone costs each of these people £900 a year. So, if the Australian Labour Party had been elected at the last federal election its policy of paying a subsidy of £3 a ton on superphosphate would have benefited each of these soldier settlers to the extent of £180 a year. When we look at the freight charges which are being made by the Adelaide Steamship Company Limited and others we cannot help wondering whether the Liberal Party and the shipping companies and their subsidiaries are not hand in glove in allowing this robbery to continue. Freight on superphosphate costs these people 77s. a ton and transport of a sheep from Kangaroo Island to the abattoirs costs 9s. 9d. Let me quote from a statement rendered by Elder, Smith and Company Limited. A settler sold a total of 90 lambs, for which he received £154 16s., but he had to pay the Adelaide Steamship Company Limited, in freight, charges and cartage, no less than £50 lis. 4d. A statement from Goldsbrough Mort and Company Limited shows that another settler sold 540 sheep, for which he received a total of £606, but £284 of this was taken in commission, charges and freight. The charge made for transporting a bale of wool from Kangaroo Island to the wool store is no less than £1 8s. 6d. The average settler pays to the Adelaide Steamship Company Limited, for transporting his products from Kangaroo Island to the mainland and for bringing goods from the mainland to Kangaroo Island, no less than £750 a year. In other words, the Adelaide Steamship Company Limited is receiving more each year from each settler than a its allies in the South Australian Parliament. But with the money he receives, the settler must house and clothe his wife and family, educate his children and try to attain a reasonable standard of living. Those were the complaints that we heard at the public meeting that we addressed on Kangaroo Island. After a general discussion of the complaints had taken place, a branch of the Australian Labour Party was formed and almost every person present at the meeting waited back to join the ALP. Within three days, the Premier of South Australia announced that he had sent the Director of Lands and another highly placed official of the department to Canberra to consult with the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr bring party politics into it. The returned Adermann) in an endeavour to do something for the soldier settlers on Kangaroo Island. As I have said, the formation of that branch of the ALP. stirred the State Government into action. It also stirred the honourable member for Barker into action because, on the first day of sitting after our visit to Kangaroo Island, and after the formation of a branch of the Australian Labour Party there, he jumped to his feet and received first call at questionprophecy which came true. I saidtime. Upon receiving the call, he asked the Minister for Primary Industry a leading question about these soldier settlers. The Minister then went out of his way to praise the honourable member for Barker for the representations he had made on behalf of the soldier settlers of Kangaroo Island. If all this was fair dinkum, to use a colloquialism, if the honourable member for Barker had genuinely made representations, why did the soldier-settler members of the ALP. branch on Kangaroo Island send out an SOS. to the Labour Party seeking help to rectify their grievances and their injustices? Not only did the Minister go out of his way to praise the honourable member for Barker but, in order to make things look better still, he also said he would make a personal visit to Kangaroo Island and talk to the soldier settlers on their properties. Many months later, he visited Kangaroo Island, but it is interesting to record that his visit was arranged by the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, and this precluded any political intervention whatsoever at that particular meeting. Of course, we do not mind the league getting credit for anything that it does, but on this occasion things were done in a very furtive way that created suspicion in the minds of many people. Indeed, it created so much suspicion that the people on the island who had joined the Australian Labour Party on the occasion when the honourable member for Hindmarsh and I visited there have retained their membership of the Labour Party. It is said that the proof of the pudding is in the eating thereof; and we are satisfied with the situation. party politics into it. , soldiers on Kangaroo Island did that. They had had a taste of one side of politics. They had been left high and dry by the members on your side of thc House, who took no action on their behalf, so they brought the other side of politics into the question to see if they could get some redress. And they did get some redress. Here, let me refer to a prophecy I made when addressing that meeting that night, a Gentlemen, even if you do not believe in the Australian Labour Party's policy, the very formation of a branch to-night will bring you action quicker than twelve months of negotiation will bring action from the Government side, whether the people who represent you be members of the Liberal Party or the Country Party. That statement was proved to be true because, as I said, three days after the formation of the branch of the ALP. on Kangaroo Island, the South Australian Premier went into action and sent his Director of Lands and another highly placed official to Canberra to confer with the Minister for Primary Industry to try to do something practical and get some action for these people instead of the promises and expressions of sympathy that they had been receiving over the years. branch of the Country Party they would have got some action. Look at those who come into this Parliament purporting to represent the country people. The real interests of the Country Party are so closely allied to the interests of the Australian Labour Party that they are almost indistinguishable, but whenever it comes to casting a vote, we find the members of the Country Party voting with the very men who kick them and rob them from day to day and from 3'ear to year. "" socialist"" is. The honourable member for Mallee reminds me of the supporter of the Australian Democratic Labour Party who published an article in a newspaper the other day about socialism.

126,Mr Turnbull,We are not socialists.,67,Settlement Bill 1963
127,Mr Sexton,"What a hackneyed wordsaid we ought to say so in different language. In that article he quoted the very language that we use in setting out our objectives and, with his double talk, he tried to convince the non-thinking readers of that newspaper that his idea of socialism was something different from the true objectives of the Australian Labour Party. Thc honourable member for Mallee would make a very good companion for the member of the D.L.P. who made that statement. If the Liberal Party members of this Government really want to do something for the settlers, they ought to be attacking the costs that are plaguing the returned soldiers, for costs are the essence of the whole matter, The returned soldier settler is not looking to make a fortune in twelve months or three years. All he wants is a reasonable living in return for the labour he puts into working his property; but he constantly comes up against rising costs which are plaguing primary producers throughout Australia. It almost makes me sick to hear the Country Party members getting up to support the Government when they know full well in their own hearts that the Government is allowing costs to rise continually to the detriment of the very Liberal Party bestir themselves. We have people whom they are supposed to represent. A moment ago, I cited the freight rates charged by the Adelaide Steamship Company Limited. Have we had any real complaints from the members of either the Country Party or the Liberal Party about excessive freight charges? I cannot recall having heard any. Nor can I recall hearing any of them advocate that one of the Australian National Line's ships should be put on the run in competition with the ships of the private shipping companies so that we might get a true indication of what would be a just freight charge. But they still come in here, waving their arms in ecstasy and using auto-suggestion to convince themthose who will need to re-pasture their land. selves that they are doing the right thing and that the primary producers are getting along very well. I do not believe that the primary producers, particularly the settlers on Kangaroo Island, are getting along very well. Mr Clyde Cameron -What about the' happen to be one of the first settlers there. cockchafer beetle? mentions the cockchafer beetle. To Government supporters, who are laughing, I say this is not funny. We visited a farm where the beetle had eaten all the herbage. On another farm, tlie farmer was loading the wethers he should bave been keeping for shearing into a semi-trailer and sending them to market because the beede had eaten the fodder that would have sustained the wethers until shearing time. But the beetle is only one of the many problems that beset the primary producers. I have a very even temper, but it almost annoys me when I hear members of the Australian Country Party trying to create the impression that they are championing the cause of the primary producers. There is only one shipping line to Kangaroo Island and that is controlled by the Adelaide Steamship Company Limited, which has the monopoly. The company will not allow any competition on this run. The directors of the company are also leading members of the Liberal Party in South Australia. Perhaps that is why these settlers were complaining for so long without getting any results. Nothing was done for them until the Australian Labour Party went into the arena. Only then did members of the not won in this area, but we have done some good work. I believe that the action taken by the Australian Labour Party led to the settlers receiving consideration much earlier than they otherwise would have. The Minister has been gracious enough to allow £300 to be credited to every soldier settler on Kangaroo Island as a contribution to the higher costs of development. He is allowing £2 an acre for re-ploughing the blocks that were developed early in the scheme. There were 50 of them. The settlers on these blocks were almost a lost legion, because they were all heading for financial disaster. The Minister is allowing £2 an acre as a re-ploughing charge for He has increased the superphosphate allowance to l i cwt. so that the land that has been neglected for so long may be revitalized. Not many years ago, a man came into my office and said: "" I am being told to get off my property on Kangaroo Island. I My superphosphate allocation is insufficient",67,Settlement Bill 1963
128,Mr Sexton,"The honourable memberto allow me to get the best results from tlie block. I cannot keep enough sheep to the acre to make a reasonable living and as a consequence I am behind with my payments. Despite the fact that I have a wife and seven children to keep, the authorities have told me that I must leave the block."" If this pioneer of Kangaroo Island had been given a little more sympathetic consideration during his earlier years there and had received a better superphosphate allocation, he could have brought his block up to a suitable productivity level. He would have had the fodder to enable him to carry sufficient sheep to make this an economic proposition. He would then have been able to remain as a settler on Kangaroo Island and in turn have been able to raise seven of the best migrants for Australia. Mr Clyde Cameron -Hav e you seen this island yourself? House that I have been there to inspect the farms and to form a branch of the South Australian Labour Party there. I have visited the properties and seen the damage done by the beetles. the island? funny things in my time and I have seen lots of funny things on the other side of the House, but I have not time to analyse them all at this juncture. I believe that the local members of Parliament are now paying a little attention to Kangaroo Island. The local branch of the Australian Labour Party meets regularly and it is necessary, therefore, for the local members, both State and Federal, to pay some attention to Kangaroo Island and to visit it periodically. WhatI have said to-night may be useful to some other area that may be suffering similar disabilities to those we found on Kangaroo Island. I do not have any area in mind, but there may be an area, politically conservative, that is receiving the same will recall that about 1958I speak subject treatment as Kangaroo Island received until the Australian Labour Party took an interest in it. If there is such an area, I hope that it will, as a result of my speech to-night, receive the quick justice that it is more settlers on the land. All the money entitled to receive and that settlers there will obtain recognition of the hardships that soldier settlers endure in their pioneering efforts to develop the land from its virgin state to a state of productivity that will ensure economic prosperity. Primary Industry) [10.28] -in reply-We are very pleased that the bill has been well received. It introduces a change in accounting procedures and it is necessary to providefinanceby way of loans to meet expenses in this year rather than to use the repayments of advances. There was really nothing contentious in the speech of the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard). However, I assure him that the net cost of the scheme to the Commonwealth will not be affected by the procedural alteration. He will find confirmation of this assurance in my second-reading speech. I inform the honourable member for Braddon( Mr Davies) that all applications for settlement in Tasmania and Western Australia have been met. Indeed, there were surplus farms in Western Australia. We advised the Returned Servicemen's League throughout the States that any eligible settlers wishing to do so could lodge claims for the surplus farms in Western Australia. As a result, some settlers were transferred to that State. In South Australia, there was a deficiency of suitable land and this prevented us from obtaining sufficient farms to satisfy all the applicants in that State. Victoria claimed that all applicants were satisfied and then changed from war service land setdement to closer settlement. I think that the few unsatisfied applicants.remaining under the war service land settlement scheme were satisfied under the closer settlement scheme. In New South Wales, a considerable number of applicants are not satisfied. That is a principal State. The New South Wales Goverament decided not to continue war service land setdement and to change to closer settlement, with some preference to ex-servicemen. I think honourable members to correction on the year-the Commonwealth Government made available an additional £2,000,000 to New South Wales and Victoria to assist those States to put was not used in the specified time and tha",68,Settlement Bill 1963

132,Mr Adermann (Fisher,"Minister fortime was extended to enable all the funds to be spent. As I have said, both Victoria and New South Wales decided to change to closer settlement. Queensland, unfortunately, did not proceed with war service land settlement after 1954. I turn now to the remarks made by the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes). The Director of War Service Land Settlement, who administes the war service land settlement scheme, has two objectives in zonal costing-first , to achieve equality of rents within a district as nearly as possible, and, secondly, to advise settlers of their commitments as early as possible on completion of development in an area. We have been told that rentals vary because blocks are in different zones. That is so. The cost of land and development was not nearly so high years ago as it is to-day. If the actual cost of development is particularly Adelaide and the honourable member for high, the productivity of the land is determined and the rental is based on whichever is the less. We cannot add anything to the costs incurred in earlier years. In a sense one has to submit to the luck of the draw. This can be illustrated by reference to Canberra. Rents of the houses built here years ago are lower than those of dwellings built in more recent years. What happens in war service land settlement is in line with I went to Kangaroo Island. He may recall what happens with respect to house rentals in Canberra. you mean. the honourable member would say. Farms because drainage was inadequate. SoI developed in more recent years are subject provided funds to enable the whole settleto higher rentals than are blocks developed ment to be drained. earlier. I do not agree, however, that earlier-developed farms have better potential than those developed later. All that is needed is time for proper development. Only after pastures have been fertilized for and I accepted it. some years can potential be properly assessed, and then it is sometimes found to be better in respect of some of the laterto drain the land to make it suitable. developed farms than in respect of those developed earlier. In zone 5, which was mentioned by the been lacking in action in these matters when honourable member for Barker, settlers are action is known to be necessary. The subject to payment not only of the rental honourable member for Barker was on my determined by the Commonwealth but also doorstep, as is proved by correspondence. of what is known as a drainage betterment He pressed me to go to Kangaroo Island charge, which is imposed by the South and eventually I went. The honourable F.8408/63 -R -[51 1 Australian Government to meet the cost of drainage work that was necessary. This work has been confined in the main to the area of zone 5. The State insisted that the Commonwealth fix its rentals before the drainage betterment charges were fixed by the State. Every settler has the right to appeal if the rent is too high. I believe that that is a fair thing. charge is too high, you mean. right of appeal in that event. The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Sexton) levelled at the honourable member for Barker a charge that I must refute. Correspondence in the files of the Department of Primary Industry shows that, long before the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) went to Kangaroo Island, the honourable member for Barker had been pressing me to go there. A Minister cannot always visit any place as soon as he is asked to do so. I remind the honourable member for Adelaide that I visited South Australia on at least two occasions to assist war service land settlement before the occasion on which the generous gesture by the Commonwealth, which I was instrumental in having the Government agree to, in providing all the settlement.

140,Mr Adermann,"I remind honorable member for Adelaide was generous enough to tell the House of some of the measures that we agreed to undertake to assist the settlers there. However, I think it must be agreed that the honourable member for Adelaide and the honourable member for Hindmarsh went to the island primarily for the purpose of forming a branch of the Australian Labour Party. I do not blame them, as members of the Opposition party, for attempting to form a Labour Party branch. I merely state that the formation of such a branch was their primary purpose in going to the island. whip up votes. matter. Even if they formed not one branch but two branches, they still would not unseat the honourable member for Barker, who is appreciated for the excellent service that he gives to the settlers on the island. The honourable member for Moore( Mr the proper standard, and I have sought to Leslie), who made some comments about war service land settlement in Western Australia, will know of the visits that I have made to that State in an endeavour to assist the scheme there. I assure him that Western Australia will get its full share of the funds being allocated, as provided for in the bill, provided, of course, that the money is required to finance the agreed programme for the year. We do not intend to minimize our commitment if the money is needed. The honourable member made some comments about the appeal board. Settlers have a right to appeal, and I do not agree with him that a board is necessarily farcical. The Commonwealth imposes only one stipula-. tion-that the board shall have no power to alter rents. Those are determined by the Commonwealth alone. I have been able, in certain instances, to assist settlers in relasettlement is a success. Some settlers who tion to rent problems. But rents are a Commonwealth responsibility and the Commonwealth makes the ultimate decision. The appeal board may deal with appeals lodged by settlers in relation to all other matters. For example, if a settler is charged with a breach of a covenant in a lease-in effect, if he is charged with a breach of contracthe has a right to appeal to the board, which will determine the appeal. The honourable member for Braddon( Mr Davies) knows of my visit to the scheme at King Island and to other war service land settlement schemes in Tasmania. He was good enough to mention the concessions that I have extended to settlers in that State. To date, the Commonwealth has provided £232,000 to meet special needs of development. All the settlers whose farms need additional development have not yet been assisted in this way; so thc allocation made for this purpose will be increased. That will not be a load on the settlers. The expenditure will be borne under the agreement by the State as to two-fifths and by the Commonwealth as to three-fifths. I have not sought in any way to impose an extra burden on settlers. I recognize that some of the fault was their own in going on the land before development was complete. That was a mistake made in several settlements. Because it was a mistake we do not want to continue to penalize settlers. I have rather taken the view that it is necessary to bring their development up to do that in every settlement where I have found this to be the position. The honourable member for Braddon referred to two committees. He referred to one on which the Commonwealth is represented. So far as the Commonwealth is concerned there has been no delay. I think the particulars may be obtained from the State committee's office in Tasmania. The delay has been occasioned by the illness of a member of the committee. The honourable member may refer to the Government of Tasmania to see if he can expedite the matter. We will be happy if that is done. The only other point that I wish to raise concerns the second committee, which is a State committee. There are two sides to the question whether war service land have had their accounts squared following credits being given to them as recommended by the committee, on investigation have been found not to have paid one penny in the last two years. That is their attitude after having been given credit and assistance in the way the committee has done. It is to be hoped that the honourable member for Braddon does not suggest that the income of the farmer will meet only operational",70,Settlement Bill 1963

142,Mr Adermann,"That does notcosts and the settlers' living costs because the full cost of living of the settler is taken into account before a rental is fixed. There are always two sides to a matter. I cannot accept the honourable member's statement of the economic position of the settlers to whom he referred. I thank both sides of the House for the support that they have expressed for the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. In committee: The bill. no desire to delay the passage of this measure. During the course of the debate honourable members roamed over Australia. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr settlers organizations in Queensland regardBrimblecombe) referred to Queensland's treatment of soldier settlers.' I may be getting a little wide of the bill but I think 1 should say something in defence of Queensland. In 1952 when the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) was the Minister administering war service land settlement the allegation that Queensland had not played the game and had not done as much as it should have done was raised. At that time the honourable member for Chisholm saidQueensland expenditure, as far as is known to know what plans the Government has to the Australian Government does not include the cost of acquisition of Iand. The honourable member compared an expenditure of £19,000,000 in Victoria, which included the cost of acquisition of land, and the expenditure of £21,000,000 in New South Wales, which also included the cost of acquisition of land, with an expenditure of £1,600,000 in Queensland. Obviously the cost of acquisition of land represents the major portion of expenditure. The comparison was unfair. I direct the attention of the honourable member for Maranoa to that fact. In the course of his speech in 1952 the honourable member for Chisholm had incorporated in "" Hansard"" a table which showed that up to that time Queensland had provided for soldier settlement 614 holdings, totalling in area' 410,000 acres. Western Australia, with a population similar to that of Queensland, had provided 716 holdings. Tasmania had provided 217 holdings and Victoria had provided 2,256. Of course, comparisons of the number of holdings provided by the various States are odious. Populations of the States varied and area of land available varied. It is completely unfair to attempt to brand Queensland as the bad boy of soldier settlement. Even the honourable member for Maranoa will admit that when Queensland abandoned soldier settlement in favour of another settlement scheme, it gave preferential and exceedingly generous treatment to soldier settlers. heard of any complaints from soldier ing harsh, unfair or inadequate treatment by the Queensland Government. I will leave the matter there. bill provides £1,450,000 for expenditure in Tasmania. I do not want to delay the passage of the bill but the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann) may be able to supply some information regarding the expenditure of part of that money because, as I said earlier to-day, we are anxious to bring this scheme to a successful conclusion. Some settlers have been on their land for twelve years, and they are anxious to know what the final valuation of their properties will be. They want to know how much rent they will be up for. On this matter I refer the Minister to an answer which he gave to a question which I asked on lst July this year. He said that the area which had been recommended for re-development on King Island was 11,935 acres. I am well aware that in the first year of re-development 500 acres were developed. Last year an area of 5,000 acres was re-developed and sown. This year an area of 3,000 acres has been disked and is ready to be sown. So we have a total of 8,500 acres re-developed out of a total area of almost 12,000 acres, leaving 3,500 acres still to be attended to. n",71,Settlement Bill 1963

146,Mr Davies (Braddon) [10.47],"Th eI point out to the Minister that on King Island there are twenty wheeled tractors belonging to war service land settlers and 23 crawler tractors. When you add the thirteen crawler tractors belonging to private and beef from King Island to Melbourne. contractors on the island it brings the total to 36. l f only 3,500 acres remain to be re-developed, why is it proposed to expend £100,000 on new equipment? I understand on good authority that five wheeled tractors are to be disposed of and that five new ones are to be purchased, and three crawler tractors are to be replaced at a cost of about £8,000 each. I should like the Minister to tell us whether the proposed purchase of these additional machines is an indication that his department intends to carry out further re-development work. There are so many machines already on the island that there are machines to burn. 1 welcome thc proposed expenditure on new machines if an all-out effort is to be made this year to proceed with the re-development work. As I stated this afternoon, two years ago we were concerned at the slow rate at which the job was progressing. This caused a great deal of dissatisfaction among thc settlers on the island. While the re-dcvelopment was going on, the amount of land available to the settlers for carrying want him to increase his freight rates to their stock was reduced. Despite this, and despite the reduction in income which followed, the settlers were expected to continue to meet their usual annual rent commitments. If the Minister is not prepared to carry out an investigation into this matter and to reduce the rents while the re-development is going on, at least he can tell us whether this additional £100,000 for the purchase of new machinery is justified. If the new machines are to be used to carry out the re-development as quickly as possible, let us get on with the job. However, the authorization of this expenditure does not seem to fit in with thefigures.hegave previously. While the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Opperman) is in the chamber, let me refer briefly to a matter similar Primary Industry) [10.48] I am not sure to that raised by the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Sexton), who said that it cost 9s. 9d. to convey a Iamb from Kangaroo Island to the market. We pay £1 ls. 9d. for the carriage of a Iamb from King Island to Melbourne. We acknowledge the work done by Captain Bob Houfe in building the roll-on, roll-off vessel "" King Islander "", a vessel of about 180 tons. He constructed this vessel to modernize the means of transporting lamb We have no desire to see the freight rate increased. I make a plea to the Minister for Primary Industry, who administers the war service land settlement scheme, and to the Minister for Shipping and Transport, to heed the efforts being made by the people of King Island to obtain for Captain Bob Houfe a subsidy for his ship. Unfortunately, because the vessel is under 500 tons, it does not attract a subsidy. If the Government will not pay a subsidy, will it heed the request of members of the King Tsland Municipal Council, who asked the Minister for Shipping and Transport for a straight-out grant? If the man who runs the fleet of ships serving King Island does not receive assistance, he will not be able to carry on. He borrowed £130,000 from the Development Bank at 6 per cent, interest to build the new vessel. His other two ships, "" Loatta"" and ""Darega"" lost £4,000 last year. He cannot sell them at present because they are the security for the advance he received to build the "" King Islander "". We do not meet the interest bill on the advance he received to build the new ship. If the Government cannot give a subsidy to Captain Houfe, it could make a straight-out grant to him. A similar grant has been made to the Burns Philp organization, which trades between Australia and Papua and New Guinea. In conclusion, let me repeat my request to the Minister for Primary Industry for information on the Government's plans for the re-development on King Island. What acreage is to receive attention? Will the Government consider reducing the rents now being charged while the re-development work is progressing? whether the honourable member for Braddon( Mr Davies) objects to the purchase of the new machinery, but I can assure him that there will be no surplus of machinery. We propose to use the machinery to develop an area which is not under investigation at present or within the terms of reference of",72,Settlement Bill 1963
147,Mr Adermann (Fisher,"Minister for the committee, as well as the area that the honourable member mentioned. I shall look at his comments on the other matters that he raised and, if necessary, will reply to him later. Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Bill-by leave-rea d a third time. Television-Politica l Parties. Motion (by Mr Adermann) proposedThat the House do now adjourn. Speaker, I wish to return to an old subject of mine which has been debated in this House with sympathy on both sides. I refer to television in Australia and the content of Australian drama in the television programmes diffused from day to day. Tonight we have had a debate about our overseas obligations and our responsibilities to the rest of the world; but in Australian telelians are anxious for us to get our own vision we have completely abdicated to a culture which is foreign to us, although it may be sympathetic to us. There is no substitute for the Australian way of life and we cannot get the Australian way of life out of a can from the United States, England, Japan or any other country. As a writer, I say to my colleagues in this House that there is a great cause to be fought for. I agree completely with the setting up of the Senate Select Committee on the Encouragement of Australian Productions for Television. I have read evidence submitted to that committee and I am impressed with the way in which Senator Vincent, as the chairman, and the Liberal, Labour and Country Party members of the committee have attempted to probe a problem which is a serious one in our lives. Surely, after nearly 200 years of existence this country should be able to say to the world through television, which is the modern way of expressing ourselves: ""This is the true Australian sentiment"". I am astonished to find that we are challenged by commercial vehicles which say that we should not have this in television. Can anybody tell me that the country that produced Henry Lawson, Banjo Patterson and hundreds of other writers is incapable of producing Australian scripts for television shows? How absolutely and stupidly absurd that is! I submit to you, Sir, that the reason why such scripts are not being produced is a commercial one. The reason why we do not have more Australian television programmes is that it is cheaper to buy canned Yankee, British, or other overseas programmes. If this country is not prepared to put a stop to this by imposing a tax on the footage of film or in some other wayI leave it to the good sense of the Senate select committee to come to a decision on that-w e are in a very bad state. It is not sufficient to make windy asserand what we are proud of, unless we are prepared to do something. I completely refuse to believe that we cannot produce an Australian film. I refuse to believe that a good Australian drama would not be acceptable to Australians. From my own experience and that of most Australians to whom I have spoken, I know that Austrapeculiar national aspects on television. We do not want any favours; we do not want any concessions. We want only the right to depict our own country, in our own country. Anybody who says that we have not that right is not a true Australian. We see the Sydney"" Daily Telegraph "", with its addiction to syndication and its penchant for ploughing through the morgues of Hollywood to find films for its television stations. No Australian who sits in front of his television set will say that he is getting too much of a good thing. We have been tolerant with the twenty-year-old films, the westerns and all the other rubbish. Some people might like those programmes. I am not going to say that they should not like them. I do not intend to make any comment about a man's taste. But we, as Australians, through the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, have given the television stations entree to our lounge rooms or wherever we have our television sets, and we expect them to give us some Australian drama in their programmes. If they do not do that, why should thc Government have anything to do with them? At present, sloppy entertainment is purveyed to anybody who PUes to turn the dial on his television set. The responsibility resides in",73,Settlement Bill 1963

It is useless to tell me that something cannot be done, when we have the best sportsmen in the world, we have singers equal to the best in the world and in every other sphere we have measured up whenever we have been asked to measure up, despite the fact that we are only 10,000,000 people in a young country.

If you are ashamed of your own drama, the story of your own that the fight in this Parliament should be country, you have no significance.

After a paltry be if we did not want to tell our own three years the television stations started story? People say that Australian proto make considerable profits, and lately ductions are amateurish. Of course they they have made enormous profits. They are amateurish-becaus e money has not have treated the Australian public as a lot been spent on showing people how to proof goons. They have said, "" You have to duce programmes. But is there anything take it and like it.

If you cannot get steamed up, I we will have some sympathy for the underestimate the anger that resides in all decisions of the Senate Select Committee.

This is the Australian outlook: mittee which would challenge the unbridled We will accept the good talent from the right of any company, such as the company rest of the world.

But that does profits out of television, the editorial readsIt was left to a very expert, and somewhat unin expected witness to give Senator Vincent some of payers pay. We must have an opportunity thc facts of life this week. . . . He told Senator Vincent, loud and clear, chat viewers preferred top quality imported programmes to Australian programmes. How, in the name of God, could he do that when we have never had Australian programmes on television? It is up to the Government, the Broadcasting Control Board and the Senate Select Committee to say that this is the time to do something to assist the production of Australian programmes. We do not want to be fed for ever on Yankee dope. I am tired of galloping cowboys, difficult psychological problems that cannot be sorted out, cross section examinations of operations and all the other horrors of overseas television which are alien to us and which are not balanced with the Australian point of view. My time is limited. I rose merely to say ( Mr every night? We are having our legs pulled. What we get from overseas is the not mean that we should not have a voice our own television, for which we as taxto present the Australian way of life. I know that the hour is late, but I have thought it necessary to point these things out to the House, as they have been pointed out many times previously. The Australian Labour Party, of which I am proud to be a member, has always had the basic culture of the Australian people as one of its ideals. disagreeing with the Liberals on a great -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. to support the remarks of the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) about the desirability of greater Australian content in television programmes. While this is not the matter on which I rose to speak, I may say that in the field of television at least the Americans have managed to present the American outlook. In Australia there is much to be said for the point of view expressed by the honourable member for Parkes. We should give our Australian viewers a greater proportion of Australian programmes. I hope the honourable member's words will be heeded by those people who bring syndicated programmes from foreign countries to our television screens night after night. again and again. things again and again. I hope they can learn that this is Australia and that we are entitled to programmes giving the Australian point of view. They must be made to realize that they should give to viewers, particularly to our young people, some sessions which will show them the real Australian way of life. My primary purpose in rising was to let the people of this country know the facts of life in connection with the Liberal and Country Parties in this Parliament, which the members of those parties endeavour to hide to-day, but which should be known to all the people because they are so apparent to us in this chamber. For some time the Liberal and Country Parties in this Parliament have masqueraded as one united party, and you would think as you see them sitting here-that is, if you were not very observant-that they all believe in the same things and in the same policies'. But only to-night we heard the Deputy Prime Miniswith what the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) put forward on behalf of the Labour Party. The gloomiest sight in this Parliament to-night was that of the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies), as he sat in his place and heard the Leader of the Country Party and Deputy Prime Minister international issue. We have seen the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate), who is interjecting, speaking on the matter of redistribution, and we have heard the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) tearing at his throat because he had attacked the Country Party's proposals for a gerrymander of Commonwealth electorates. The Prime Minister may put on a bold front, but he cannot disguise the bitterness of the feelings of one section of the coalition government for the other. Members of the two parties disagree, first, over the proposed redistribution. There is no doubt about that. They can make no headway in their attempts to settle their disputes. The Leader of the Country Party and Deputy Prime Minister has refused to deal with the Minister for ihe Interior( Mr Freeth), who is in charge of electoral matters. The Deputy Prime Minister is not speaking to the Minister for the Interior, because the latter gentleman said what he thought of the Country Party and its leader and had his views published in a Western Australian newspaper. To-day we find the Leader of the Country Party and Deputy Prime Minister negotiating with the Prime Minister for a gerrymander because he refused to deal with the Minister responsible for electoral matters. That has never been denied in this Parliament. The honourable member for Higinbotham ( Mr Chipp) is doing a lot of interjecting, but I suggest that he get up and answer me when 1 have finished. Do not sit there mumbling; stand up and defend your Country Party colleagues. Every day of the week we see Country Party members getting up to speak and all the Liberals walking out. I cannot say I blame them because the Country Party members are not worth listening to. But the point is that the members of one party just do not like the membsrs of the other. When a Liberal member gets up to speak he finds there are no Country Party members in the House. If the Labour Party did not ensure that there was a quorum present, there would not be a member about the place.",74,Adjournment

They disagree at the State level about the inroads of one party into the supposed territory of another. The Country Party has demanded that the Liberal Party stay out of the election for the federal seat of Cowper-as though either party could beat the honourable member who represents that electorate today. Why, in the very stronghold of the Country Party we find that the seat of Lismore in the New South Wales Parliament is held by a Labour Minister. The honourable member for Cowper will take you all on, give you a lead and wind up the winner. Members of the two Government parties individually and collectively the Liberal disagree on many other matters. They party members of the Cabinet. The Liberal disagree on overseas investment.

Year by year their supporters are and it seems that the Minister for Trade diminishing in number. The only way they had him kicked out for disloyalty to can save themselves is by gerrymandering Cabinet decisions while now the Minister the electorate at the expense of the Labour for Trade opposes Cabinet decisions every Party.

Thc members of the Wentworth ever did, although we know that the former Minister for Air was kicked out of the Ministry for his disagreement. What a disunited rabble sits here on the Government benches. Fancy them telling us what to do about Malaysia and other international matters; they are hanging together by a thread. They are a minority Government, in power only because of the votes of supporters of the Communist Party. Yet they try to lead the people and to tell us on the Opposition side what to do. The disputes go further than public attacks in the newspapers and in party conferences. They are taken into the Cabinet room itself. The Minisler for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister, I understand, attacked brazen about the position. He now appears The people on the opposite side of the Country Party are endeavouring to force the Government to issue such an instruction. I congratulate the Minister for the Interior who evidently believes in the integrity of the Labour Party did to those men. The DemoElectoral Commissioners and will not be a party to this vile plot of the Country Party. Because of his refusal, you now have a tired, worn-out, discredited Prime Minister, forced to do the things that the responsible Minister will not do. Here we see the members of the Government who talk about the Labour Parly being disunited. 1 have pointed out these few salient facts to show the disunity that exists in Government ranks. How long is it since we have seen a member of the Country Party get up and defend a member of the Liberal Parly. They are members of one organization, but they hate each other. They will not stand united as an organization, I hear a lot of interjections from the other side. The members who are making them will have plenty of opportunity to reply to me. Let us see you members of the Country Party who are interjecting get up and defend your Country Party colleagues. Let one of you deny that you want a gerrymander to save yourselves, at the expense of members of thc Labour Party. The only reason you arc not game to pull on an election is thaf you know you cannot arrange a gerrymander in time to suit the Countiy Party. You know that your sins have found you out. I put on record my brief resum6 of the disunited rabble-if I may use that term-wh o sit opposite. I ask thc public to look at them and see how they joyously embrace each other in debate and in the policies presented. ] hope that ultimately the Australian people will see them as we do and reject them as they ought to be rejected-as a disunited rabble, inept and incompetent, who should not be trusted with the government of this country. -We have listened to the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) talking about a so-called split in the Government parties. Some of the honourable members now on the other side of the House were not here when seven Victorian Labour Party members lost their pre-selections because they told us why the Labour Party could not become the government. Some of us remember those seven men standing up in their places here and putting a curse on the Labour Party. We all know what the cratic Labour Party, to which they now belong, advises its supporters to give their second preferences to our candidates, because the Labour Party is not fit to govern. It ill behoves a right-winger who has only recently taken his place on the Opposition front bench to talk about a split in the Government parties. The greatest split of all time occurred in his party because Mr Keon, Mr Cremean, Mr Bill Bourke and others squared their shoulders and told the truth, holding nothing back. The honourable member for Grayndler was one of their mates, but he survived because the New South Wales executive of the Labour Party is a right-wing executive. Otherwise he would have gone the same way as Mr Keon and the others. They were flung out because there was a left-wing executive in Victoria which could not bear to have men of courage telling the truth. Those men told us about the Victorian Labour man who was approached by a certain organization which offered him £11,000, and who said, "" That is chicken feed; we want more than that"". Many of us remember Bill Bourke telling that story. The Labour Party tries to cover up its weaknesses by indulging in the sort of tripe we heard from the honourable member for Grayndler. The honourable gentleman might like to know that left-wing members of his party from New South Wales have told me the truth about him. 1 have got the story. The so-called split in the Government parties can be brought out into the open. Members of the Australian Country Party say that they represent people in the country districts. I also represent a country district. I say to the .honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull), who is not here now, that his party does not have a monopoly of country representation. There is healthy rivalry in the Government parties, but the split in the Labour Party is not healthy. On one side of the Labour Party are the left-wing people who play about with Moscow and with Mao Tse-tung. They are the enemies of Australia, the un-Australian group. What the honourable",76,Adjournment
154,Mr Jeff Bate (Macarthur) [11.20].,"member for Grayndler has said about us is a joke, a bit of good fun. The so-called split in our parties means nothing, but the split in the Labour Party really means something. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell), speaking to-night with his tongue in his cheek, said there was a lack of precision in some treaty with Malaya. But while he was speaking, the left-wingers of his party were banished from the chamber. They were in the corridors, talking about what they would do to sabotage their leader. The right-wing has control of the Labour Party for a little while, but that is only because the left-wingers said, "" All right boys, you do the talking and pretend to the people of Australia that we are decent right-wingers. However, when Labour becomes the government, the left-wing will take control."" That is the real story. The split in the Labour Party is basic, but the so-called split in our parties is a matter for amusement. It is only healthy rivalry. The split in the Labour Party is dangerous because it has in it treason to this country. speak on the issue of Malaysia because The people who once mattered in the Labour Party left it because of that. Where there is treason, the stench of treason people that you represent, the Victorian left it. The others have blown out what executive. cannot take it. I am not surprised that a Victorian member tries to object to what I am saying. He has a left-wing executive around his neck. The decent people who used to support the Labour Party-the right-wingers, the brains of the party-go t out. They said, ""We cannot win while circulated:there are Moscow troopers in the Victorian executive and the Queensland executive"". who have had their trips to Moscow, Shipping and Transport, upon noticesplit the Labour Party; they kept the leaders of the party skulking in the any1. regular bushes outside the Hotel Kingston, waiting to that area? for their orders; and they decided at Hobart that we should not send Australian troops being established in the near future? to Malaya. The Labour Party has been trying to square off ever since. This is a a ship similar to the "" Bass Trader"" or the deep-seated split, and a tragedy for Aus"" Princess of Tasmania"" constructed for the tralia. The Leader of the Opposition is National listening to me now. He knows how dreadful this situation is. He knows how dreadful it was that he and his Deputy Leader had to go to the Hotel Kingston to get their orders about the naval communication station in Western Australia. The Labour Party has been trying to square off with the Australian public ever since the red Hobart decisions were made. I think the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) and seventeen others walked out of the Hobart conference, and the nineteen men remaining made the infamous decisions which would have let Australia down. To-night, however, we see a different picture. The right-wingers have said, "" There may be an election soon and we must try to win it. We must pretend that we are true to Australia, that we are dinkum Aussies. We must keep the leftwingers outside"". The honourable members for Parks( Mr Haylen), Reid( Mr Uren) and Yarra( Mr Cairns) were kept outside. They could not be allowed to they would have let the cat out of the bag and the people of Australia would have known where the Labour Party really stood. Thati . the classic dilemma of the Labour Party. It is split right down the brains they had. Question resolved in the affirmative.

In addition the following overseas vessels with passenger accommodation call regularly at Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and north Queensland ports and in the absence of Australian licensed passenger vessels are permitted to carry passengers interstate:"" Changsha"", "" Taiyuan "", "" Francis Drake"" and "" George Anson "". 2. I am not aware of any proposals by private shipowners to establish such a service, and based on the Australian National Line's assessment of the opportunities for economic operation of an interstate passenger service to north Queensland ports, I think its establishment in the near future is unlikely. 3. The economic opportunities for further developing existing trades and also establishing new ones are constantly under review and in line with this policy shipping services to north Queensland have been examined by the Australian National Line from time to time. However, based on the experience gained by the line in the searoad passenger service between Melbourne and Devonport and other relevant data such as the high capital cost of a special purpose vessel, the provision of appropriate berthing and terminal facilibasis of actual cost of labour and materials plus ties and the existence of other forms of surface transport competitive with shipping, the Australian National Line considers that the introduction of a roll-on roll-olf passenger-cargo service to north Queensland ports could not be economically justified at the present time.

Garlic is grown commercially in Australia and as small quantities are exported from time to time, I feel that if imports are taking place, the quantities involved would be very small. the Cockatoo Dockyards. member's questions are as (Question No. 259.)

The lessee company is required to pay an annual rental calculated on a formula related to turnover. The annual rental so assessed in recent years has been of the order of £130,000. In addition to the lease agreement the Commonwealth has a trading agreement with the company. This agreement provides for the company to undertake Commonwealth work on the overhead costs. The company receives a management fee based on a percentage of turnover and shares in the residual profit or loss arising from all of its trading operations. The balance from all trading operations is vested in thc Commonwealth. The annual surplus paid to the Commonwealth under the trading agreement in recent years has been of the order of £40,000.
