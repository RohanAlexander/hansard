MrM c DONALD the Prime Minister that in the outlying districts of Northern Queensland the distribution of the rolls is a tremendous task, because some places are served only by a fortnightly and others by a monthly mail. If the rolls do not catch the mails, they have to be sent out by special messengers, which costs an enormous sum. I urge that the printing of rolls for outlying districts should be done before the printing of rolls for districts in which they can be easily delivered, so that there may bo time for proper distribution ?

Perth, I think, yesterday or the day before, but I have not yet had an opportunit y to go into this question, whicli is a very complicated one. The use of Donnybrook stone in the construction of the Perth General Post Office was first brought under my notice by the honourable member for Perth, who raised the question just after we took ofiice.

MrP . P . ABBOTT -Referring to the representations made some time ago to the Minister of Trade and Customs by the honourable member for Maranoa and myself, regarding ithe tobacco-growing industry in New South Wales, the low prices paid for the leaf, and the quality -of the leaf grown, I desire to ask the Minister whether he has been able to -obtain, for the benefit of growers, any information on the subject? ber mentioned this question to me last night, and I am in a position now to furnish the House with a reply to our -communication on the subject, which we have received from the Government of New South Wales. The honourable member, together with the honourable member for Maranoa, made representations to me some time ago, and during the recess I forwarded to the honourable member for New England copies of the replies which we had received to our communications from the Governments of Queensland and Victoria. I propose now to read the following letter, dated 4th instant, which we have received from the Premier of New South Wales:Sir,-With reference to your letter of the 12th December, 1913, with regard to the attisinking was ordered about two months tude of tobacco companies towards Australian tobacco-growers, I have the honour to inform you that from inquiries made it would appear that the trouble has been caused by the production locally of large quantities of inferior tobacco leaf. The manufacturers have stated that they are prepared to take almost unlimited quantities of first quality leaf, but that the consumption of low quality is very small, and they are now overstocked with it. Having regard to the above facts, this Government is now inviting applications for the position of tobacco expert, whose duties will include the instruction of growers in up-to-dato methods of growing, harvesting, and curing leaf. This, it is hoped, will result in the production of a muuh higher quality leaf. If this can be successfully accomplished, the industry will be placed on a much more satisfactory footing. Two petitions with reference to the question of Excise Were presented by the honourable member, and these have been referred to the Inter-State Commission, who have advised me that the matters referred to are now set down for hearing, and that the producers w ill be advised of the date on which the Commission w ill be able to take evidence on the subject. OIL INDUSTRY : SUPPLY OF MACHINER Yternal Affairs inform the House what progress has been made in the erection of machinery in Papua for the development of the local oil industry, and when any definite result will be known ? is on the field at the present time. The reports coming from him are rather technical in character, but they indicate that, as the sinking goes on, the good prospects evident on the surface are being maintained. I am told that it is very difficult to be absolutely sure of the oil prospects of a field unti l a great depth has been reached. I cannot say exactly to what depth the shaft has been sunk. On the advice of the expert, a new shaft is being sunk on a new part of the field, and about a month ago a depth of 254 feet had been reached. I was then informed that the prospects of the field were then even more favorable than they were at the outset. As to the question of machinery, I may say that, speaking generally, a boring plant is the only machinery on the field at present. A new plant for heavier ago, but I cannot say whether it has yet reached the field.

The honourable [11.13] -First of all, I should like to offer my sympathy to the Victorian members on the Government side. My reason I am pointing for doing so is that a certain decision has been come to which, to my mind, belittles those honourable members. I say in all sincerity that those who are their friends, and are particularly friendly to Mr Watt, have gone out of their way to make it appear that, as the present honourable member for Balaclava is leaving the House, there must be Victorian brains brought into it , because there will be none when the honourable gentleman leaves. We heard of the Conservative leagues imploring MrW a t t to leave the State House and enter this Chamber, and we are told that if he is returned here he will take up a portfolio at once. If that is the intention, it is a b it rough on the Victorian members on the Government The answers to the honside, whom I have known for some years to be capable men when they have the opportunity. I do not think it is fair for their friends to make it appear that it is necessary to introduce brains into the House because there are none amongst the Victorian members already here. I believe that there is just as good brains in this House to-day as there will be when MrW a t t enters the chamber. To make the position more contradictory, it appears now that the reason why he left the State Legislature was",18,Opposition Members Hear Hear

Mr MATHEWS (Melbourne Ports)that there was need for brains there, because I see in the Argus this morning that the Liberals are looking for a brainy man to lead the Victorian Legislative Assembly. However that may be, I do not think the articles that have appeared in the press lately treat Victorian members fairly,, and they have my sympathy. The present situation in Federal politics is most peculiar. Like all other individuals I have my own opinions, and however strong they may be I will express them. I have expressed the opinion that the contemplated dual dissolution is not fair to the people of Australia. I have publicly disagreed to the steps taken to bring this situation about, because I felt that it was not in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution. I believe that the Attorney General created the present position, and that it did not arise constitutionally. May I remind honourable members that the Chief Justice of the High Co.urt told the representatives of the Labour unions, and the legal gentleman who was appearing for them, that they had no right to create a position which would enable them to come to the Court. If the position had not arisen naturally, they had no right to make a position for the simple purpose of getting their case'before the Court. If they did create such a position, they would have to be put out of Court. Court disagreed with the Chief Justicewrongly, I admit. the Court have done many wrong thiugs. If it is wrong to create au artificial position in order to get a case before the High Co"".urt, how much more wrong is it for gentlemen occupying the Treasury bench to prepare a case and create a position upon which the Governor General is asked to give a decision ? Either they presented a case to him that was not a fair statement of the condition of things in this chamber, either it was wrong and misleading, or His Excellency did not go into the case with due regard to the spirit of the Constitution. If the Ministry created a position for the purpose of misleading the Governor General they are unworthy of holding their present positions, and ought to leave them. The only opportunity we will get of proving whether they have done so is to ascertain exactly the contents of the memorandum sent to tlie' Governor General, and I will not be satisfied until I know the purport of that document. I feel that the Government are afraid to place before us the reasons which they submitted to the Governor General in support of their request for a. double dissolution, either because they do not desire to show us that they misled His Excellency, or because tliey wish toconceal the fact that, in acceding to their request, His Excellency acted weakly, inasmuch as the reasons upon which he based his action were weak. It has been demonstrated again and again in this Chamber that the Government Preference Prohibition Bill could accomplish nothing, inasmuch as preference to unionists had already been abolished by administrative act. But tlie Government recognised that whilst that measure would accomplish nothing, members of the Labonr party were bound to fight it because it was intended as an attack upon a great principle. of a great principle. tion of a principle which could operate in no direction at all. The Attorney General created an artificial crisis because he knew that members of the Labour party would be bound to oppose majority of the that measure on principle. I come now to the second so-called test question-the proposed restoration of the postal vote. To me it is amazing that that section in politics which, for centuries, has opposed the enfranchisement of women should be consumed with anxiety to restore the postal vote. As a matter of fact, the birthrate amongst the labouring classes of the community is much higher than it is amongst other sections. The honourable member for Yarra has convincingly demonstrated that the highest birth-rate in Victoria obtains in districts which are represented by Labour men. Are we not desirous of securing as large a poll as are my honourable friends opposite? party object to postal voting? abuse which has attended the operation of that system.

To my mind, if we had a Court of appeal to which the question of the double dissolution could be referred, that tribunal would declare that the decision of the Governor General was wrong; first, because he was wrongly directed by the -Government; and, secondly, because it was against the weight of evidence. and in fact? member has cast a reflection upon the Governor General, which he must withdraw. definite on the subject, and the expression that His Excellency's decision was "" against the weight of evidence "" is not in order. lowed to give expression to my views in that way, of course I shall have to withdraw the remark. But I am forced into taking up my present position by the action of the Government in refusing to disclose the reasons upon which they based their request for a double dissolution. However, sir, I bow to your decision and withdraw the observation. We have been told that this Parliament was unworkable, and that a double dissolution of Melbourne Ports and was necessary, because the Senate would defeat any legislation which the Ministry attempted to place upon the statute-book. I admit that there have been two sessions of wasted effort. But the Labour party are not responsible for that, although, doubtless, the Conservative press and the Conservative leagues will endeavour, during the coming fight, to show the electors that we wasted the time of Parliament. As a matter of fact, the time was wasted by the Government themselves.

A t any rate, we should have had the opportunity to place on the statute-book a Such measure which would have been beneficial to the people.

I have often said that the only anomaly in the Tariff is that the duties are not high enough; but, of course, I could not get my way. Why could not the GoThere are many items, however, in respect of which the duties should be wiped out. For instance, there are duties The experience we have had of on raw materials, whereas there are very small duties on the finished articles, or duties not as high as those on the raw materials.

It is only right, under the circumstances, that the public should be made acquainted with the manner in which the Government are dealing with the Constitution. Prime Minister refers to the spirit of the various sections of the Constitution, but it has been made clear by the honourable member for West Sydney and the honourable member for Bendigo that, by the action of the Government, tlie power of the Senate will be destroyed for ever, unless the people take the matter into their own hands at the election. We have heard a great deal of talk about electoral corruption, and so forth, and the Government are very keen on impressing on the public their desire to have a "" clean roll.""

If that charge be true, surely it is something for which we may be commended rather than condemned. ment have expressed their desire that every person possible shall be allowed to exercise the franchise, and to that we say ""Hear, hear."" We have never yet tried to prevent any section of tke community from having the fullest opportunity to vote, consistent with fair dealing. The correspondent to whom I have referred goes on to sayThe Ministerial party has absolutely set its face against any such proceedings, the probability would seem to be that thc issue of writs would follow very closely on the date of the dissolution. Once the writs are issued thu rolls arc closed, so far as additions to them are concerned. The newspaper seems to gloat over the fact that the Government can prevent The names going on the rolls, and that, in doing so, they have something to be proud of. Which is the party that desires to give the greatest voting facilities to the electors of Australia-the party which would defer a dissolution to enable those who are not on the rolls to get there, or tlie party that would issue the writs immediately Parliament is dissolved, so as to prevent enrolment? Any blame that may be attached to this Parliament for practices leading to the disfranchisement of electors must be borne, not by the Opposition, but by the Government. The correspondent from whose letter I have quoted is, I take it, in touch with our business, attending here day by day, and, perhaps, has been inspired to write as he has written. Yesterday we had an inspired question about an electioneering pamphlet, to bring it before the public, and now we have this statement in the press, for the benefit of those who are likely to swallow it instead of looking more deeply into matters. It has been hinted that absent voting will have to be more strictly regulated. I hope that the Government will do nothing to limit the electors' light to vote. The last Government tried to give the greatest opportunity for voting by the Melbourne correspondent enabling electors to vote out of their subdivisions. That facility was largely used, yet not so largely as our honourable friends opposite would make out. The correspondent from whose letter I have quoted says furtherMinisterialists feel that it would be almost criminal if , in the face of experience, they were to permit the absent vote to be used without additional safeguards.

He continuesOn 31st May last there were, in some instances, more absent voters than resident electors in polling booths through the day, and it is understood that one of the effects of the new regulation, which will be prepared, will be to reduce an aggregation of this kind by making as many voters as possible exercise their franchise in their residential subdivisions. That might be commendable if there were facts to justify it , and I think that the Electoral Commission should summon this correspondent, and let h i m say in what booth there were more absent voters than residential voters. think it w ill be found that this individual writes without knowledge of the facts, merely for a living. Let me take the returns of the voting for the Senate-som e of the candidates for election to the House of Representatives were unopposed. The highest number of absent votes recorded in any New South Wales division was 4,852, in No r t h Sydney, out of a total of 44,S42. votes were recorded, out of a total of 28,079, and in Parkes 3,159 absent votes were recorded. corded chiefly in divisions which returned Fusion candidates, although the suggestion of the correspondent whose letter I have read is that the Labour party wishes to continue absent voting because that system is advantageous to it . figures prove anything prove anything. ment that I have read, which, I think, was merely a scare paragraph. Were all the absent voters to record their votes w it h in an hour or two, I doubt whether they would congest tlie booths so much that the residential electors could not vote. tricts the absent voters caused congestion in the polling booths. when acting as secretary to my party, I was informed that the Presiding Officer at Saddleworth was insisting that illiterate voters who required his help should vote at the table, and persons were objecting to being required to thus vote openly. I thereupon saw the Divisional Returning Officeri n Adelaide, and he wired to the Presiding Officer that illiterate voters must be taken into the cubicles, so that they might vote secretly. An y congestion that may have occurred in that booth was due to the fact that the Presiding Officer was not carrying out his duties properly. The fact that there may have been congestion in one or two places would not j u s t i fy the further restriction of absent voting by regulation. Let me quote other figures to show that the absent vote d i d not operate as has been suggested. Let me now quote some figures for Victoria. In Kooyong, which is uot a Labour electorate, 3,136 absent votes were cast, out of a total vote of 27,000. In Henty, If that be done, I whose representative does not adorn this side of the chamber, 3,177 absent votes were cast. The next electorate which, polled 3,000 absent votes was Corangamite, whose representative does not adorn this side. It will be seen that the: figures prove, as far as figures can prove, that it is not this side which is benefited, by the absent vote, but the other side. A t Ballarat, 2,923 absent votes were cast,, and in this case the memher is on tliis. In Parramatta 3,446 absent side of the House. I have not the Adelaide return, but I know that the late member for the constituency received Absent votes were reless absent votes than did the losing candidate. In Boothby, the sitting member once lost when it came to the counting of the absent votes, but recently he had a sufficient majority of the legitimate votes to secureSof a r as his return. In Queensland, five constituencies cast over 3,000 absent votes. The highest return is credited to Brisbane, namely, 3,539 votes, and the sitting member belongs to this side of the chamber. The next highest return is 3,444 absent votes forWide Bay, which is represented by the Leader of the Opposition. It will be found that in the major i ty of instances the absent voting figuresare in favour of the other side. In Boothby, in South Australia, 2,434 abI n many country dissent votes were cast out of a total poll of 30,000. I know, from personal experience of the election, that there was very In South Australia, little congestion, except in densely-populated areas.

He was very cross when the Leader of the Opposition twitted h i m with slandering the general public. The point I wish to make before my time expires is that the conduct of the Electoral Branch certainly needs looking into ; and unless the Prime Minister gives us an assurance that people will have an opportunity to get their names on the roll prior to the elections, we shall not have that clean roll which he desires, and which would be of much benefit to this side. We have urged that canvassers are going round, and that the Department, in some instances, are acting on their recommendations, and people are constantly being put off the roll instead of being put on. I hold in my hand, not a letter from a correspondent, but a letter which came to me through the avenue of the Australian Workers Union, and that much-abused man in Adelaide, Mr Frank Lundie, and which reads as follows: Commonwealth pf Australia. State of South Australia. Memorandum. The Commonwealth Electoral Registrar, for Subdivision of Port Lincoln. To John Biscoby, Wirrila Siding. I enclose card. You are already on roll. Your name was given in by Liberal union organizer as having left division. You will not be struck off. As you still live in division no need to make a fresh claim. W. G. BRENNAN. Dated 4/6/14. If Mr Biscoby had not taken the precaution of writing to Mr Brennan when he got the notice that he had been struck off the roll for not living in the division, he would have been amongst tJie lost voters. When we have knowledge of this kind from official documents, it is sufficient In the warrant for our saying that some opportunity should be given to electors at the mercy of the Liberal union's organizers, who, I maintain, go round day by day, week by week, and year by year, to ascertain that they are on the roll. When they talk about I wish to funds being subscribed by trade unionists for political purposes, I ask who provides the money for these organizers if it is not the commercial bandits of the Commonwealth ? They are described by a write) on the greatest trust in the world ar "" commercial brigands and bandits."" It is these persons who are putting some of their ill-gotten gains to an ill purpose, and that is in sending organizers round the country to object to the enrolment of men who are working on, say, a siding. Why, sir, the description of tlie man explains itself. A navvy, or a platelayer, must necessarily shift his place of residence: in fact, he shifts from day to day, as hi? work progresses. He reaches a mile or more from the place where he was housed, and the Liberal organizer, behind his back, goes to the Electoral Office and lays an information, so to speak, that he is not now living in the place where he is supposed to live, and so he is robbed of the franchise which he holds so valuable. member's time has expired. MrM c GRATH (Ballarat) [12.18] 1 propose to refer to the application of the Government for a double dissolution, and the request of the Opposition for the publication of the papers on the subject. The Attorney-General has said that we are asking for something quite unusual, but I am of. opinion that we have plenty of precedent for making the request. I find, on referring to old records, that in 1868 a memorandum by the Premier <of Victoria on the question of a dissolution and the Governor's reply were laid before the State Parliament. In 1880 Mr. James Service, the Premier, asked for a dissolution of the Legislative Assembly on the question of the reform of the Legislative Council, and the f u l l reasons for the request to the Marquis of Normanby, and His Excellency's reply, are to be seen in a parliamentary paper.

In 1912 it brought out 14,000 peoplo, of whom only 150 went on the land. In 1913 the total was 11,000, and only 131 of them went on the land. It was true some of these others came out as farm labourers, but the great bulk of them had either remained in thc large centres of population or else had drifted back thereto in the last ten years. The population of Victoria had increased by 115,000, but the city secured 95,000 of this increase. I believe that is a correct statement of what is going on. He n who are brought out, instead of going on the land, are remaining in the cities. I hope, at a later stage, to make further reference to this subject. [12.30] I do not propose to detain the Committee at any length, but I desire to offer one or two observations in connection with the attitude of the Government towards what I conceive to be the most essential matter now engaging public attention. I refer to the amendments of the Constitution necessary, by common consent, to enable this National Parliament to deal with those great and urgent problems that confront this country in common with every other. going to traverse this question at length. 1 do not propose to indulge in any lengthy criticism of the action, or, more properly, the inaction, of the Government; but what I do propose to do, in order that the position be made clear, is to set for th very shortly the steps that have led up to the present position, so f a r as the proposed laws for the amendment of the Constitution now before this House are concerned. This Parliament has had ample opportunity for reviewing this question since 1910, when the first proposals for the amendment of the Constitution were introduced in this Chamber, u n t i l to-day. It may be f a i r l y said that no suggestions for legislation have secured a wider circle of converts in a shorter time than have these proposals for the amendment of the Constitution. I need hardly point out that on the first occasion when these proposals were submitted to the electors they were rejected by a very large majority. In. less than two years they were again submitted, and defeated only by the narrowest of margins. I do not intend to deal with the proposed amendments in detail,, or to set for t h the extent to which they are individually necessary, or the manner in which they respectively deal w it h the questions of the day. I am, however,. I think, entitled to call the attention of the Government to the fact that for thethird time in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament these proposals-for , in substance, they are the same as those which were submitted in September, 1910 -are now before us for consideration. The Government, instead of facilitating discussion upon them, resolutely refuse to permit of any debate upon them at all. In regard to measures for proposed legislation generally, that attitude, in view of our moribund condition, would be not only permissible, but proper. But it is very different with regard to proposals of (West Sydney) this kind, because no time could be more fitting for the discussion of measures for the amendment of the Constitution than is the present, when this House and the other Chamber of the Legislature are both on the eve of an appeal to the country. mit that inasmuch as the Bills proposing constitutional amendments have been in troduced in this House, and now appear on the business-paper as Orders of the Day, the honourable gentleman w ill be out I am not of order in discussing them in Committee of Supply. I wish to submit that I am not out of order. The honourable member for Richmond is very impatient. If he had waited a little while I should have made perfectly clear the object for which I rose. I am proceeding in a proper way, and I hope I am not transgressing any of the rules of debate. I certainly do not intend to do so. I submit that I am perfectly in order upon a proposal to grant Supply to the Government to bring before the Committee some of the shortcomings of the Government in connection with their refusal to make such an appropriation of funds as would permit of these measures being submitted to the people at the time of the forthcoming elections. I submit that that is perfectly in order.

Here we propose to go to the country. It is admitted by both parties that amendments of the Constitution are absolutely necessary. I lay special emphasis on the fact that, so f a r as any expression of opinion can be, or has been made by any recognised mouthpiece of either party, there is by common consent a necessity for the amendment of the Constitution. I wish to make it perfectly clear that the present position is that we are going to the country, that the electors are to be asked to choose between this party and that party, and that unless there is an amendment of the Constitution neither party can usefully serve the people in the new Parliament. must be, on the admission of the learned Attorney-General, an amendment of the Constitution before the great problems with which we are admittedly confronted can be dealt with. for Flinders? orable member for Flinders has said that over and over again.

What for? In order that be some constitutional virility injected we may come back and again make this ad misericordiam appeal, and say, "" We cannot do anything, because we have no power."" Why should we not now, when the opportunity is in our hands, when we are going to the very fountain of all power, get that authority which is admittedly necessary in order to do that which has to be done? Whetheri t be done by us or by the present Government I was saying that in is immaterial, but it must be done by somebody. If we hesitate now to submit an amendment of the Constitution for approval by the people, we shall be recreant to the best interests of this country, and to the traditions of this Parliament. The Prime Minister point blank refuses to permit this, and refuses to recommend, as he is authorized to do by section 128, H is Excellency to submit these measures to the people. He may say he is opposed to them, but what of that if the people are not opposed to them?

IBVINE The position put forward by the honourable member is entitled to respect as coming from an exSpeaker, that anything, no matter what its nature may be, which an honourable member desires to test can always be brought forward by moving a reduction to the amount of Supply. But the matter must be relevant to the particular service covered by the item which is sought to be reduced. Otherwise an amendment might be moved to reduce an item in the Department of the Attorney-General w i th a view to showing that the Navigation Act should be brought into force, or there might be a reduction moved to the salary of the head of the Department of Trade and Customs with a view to showing that some policy in regard to the Department of External Affairs should be brought into existence.

I merely rose to ask the Chairman to state what would be the effect of the amendment. consider the matter from a broader aspect. If I moved an amendment to reduce the amount of Supply asked for by £3,000,000 because the Government had not dealt w i th certain proposals which I thought should be dealt with, surely it would not be ruled out of order. Once we a set of get into Committee in regard to the details of the amount asked for, it would be very difficult to bring forward an amendment such as this perfectly relevant to the question immediately before the Chair; but, as pointed out by the honourable member for Kennedy, it is quite a common practice in Committee to move an amendment to reduce an item by f 1, and if that can be done it should be permissible to move a similar amendment on the general motion covering the whole Supply. Last year an amendment was moved to reduce a vote by £ 1 as an in timation to the Government that they should reduce the expenditure on defence by something like £500,000. the Defence Estimates.

It is admitted that it is in order to move that an item be reduced by £ 1 , and surely any honorable member can rise and say that he votes forthat reduction for some particular reason..",33,Forrest

We transferred pairs before the division took place. The Government Whip asked me for three pairs for members who were absent, the honourable member for Balaclava being one of the names mentioned. I went to the gallery where the honourable member for Darwin was sitting, and asked him. if he would give a pair.

I do not accuse the Government Whip of any sharp practice. What occurred was the result of an accident which might happen at any time. Mr JosEni COOK I suggest that we might have the division over again, or vote on a proposed smaller reduction. in favour of the proposal of the honourable member for West Sydney, and would like to move the reduction of the amount by 10s. which was taken was quite regular, and it is contrary to our procedure to allow the moving in Committee of Supply of a number of amendments in succession, all of them raising practically the same issue.

There was a distance of something like 11 or 12 miles between the point to which the line had been completed by day labour and the point at which Mr Teesdale Smith's contract was to commence. For that distance nothing had been done, not even clearing, except the putting in of survey pegs. Since then, deviations have been made round small cuttings, for the purpose, it has been aaid, of expediting the work. But, as Mr Teesdale Smith has not completed his contract, and is not likely to complete it for some time, why were the deviations made? ister may have some explanation to give, but unfortunately he is absent. I should like to know why these deviations were made at such a distance from the line as first surveyed as to necessitate the relaying of the rails, or, in other words, the undertaking of two jobs in stead of one ? Notwithstanding that we were told that Mr Teesdale Smith had ample plant to carry on the work, I am assured that he has been compelled on more than one occasion to borrow plant from the Commonwealth Railway Department. We should like an explanation of all these matters, but there is no one present to supply it . Even. if the Honorary Minister, who is in charge of the work, were here, he knows so little about it that I fear he could not give us much information. The whole question of the contract requires to be f u l l y in vestigated. pointed by another place is unable, unfortunately, to proceed with its inquiry.

I understand that the Government are going to call for tenders for the construction of a furthe r section of 132 The HonoraryM in miles of railway, and, if they do, the tenders of certain persons may not be regarded so favourably as they were before. The honourable member for Henty, who, I regret, is not present, in the course of a speech at a public meeting a few days ago, made certain statements regarding the Labour party to which I take exception. If we are to be constantly subjected to such misrepresentations as those in which he indulged, the coming election will be characterized by a great deal of bitterness. The honourable member for Werriwai n this House recently said that the Government had held out the olive branch to the Opposition. In the name of Heaven, when did they do so ? When they introduced the A u d it Bill last session, did they meet with any drastic opposition to it? By no means. We were quite willing to pass the A u d it B ill , provided that one clause referring to a matThe Select Committee apter which in our opinion should not be dealt w it h in such a measure was eliminated. But these political Shylocks demanded their last ounce of legislative flesh, and would be satisfied with nothing short of it .

It was dropped, not because of our opposition, but because of the action of the Honorary Ministeri n introducing such a provision. The honourable member for Henty has misrepresented our party to such an extent in these matters that his exaggeration must defeat the very purpose that he had in view.

I prefaced my statement by saying that I desired to show how the policy of "" spoils to the victors "" was followed by the Fusion party. The Government wanted a medical officer at Launceston to examine cadets, and the remuneration ofiered was £ 2 5 per year. medical man in Launceston to undertake the work Subsequently, on representations being made to Dr. Clarke Webster, he, from patriotic motives, undertook the work at £ 2 5 per annum. The boy to whom I referred was sent to him for examination, and he declared that the lad, although not f u l l y grown, was constitutionally fit. sive and inscrutable countenance is a The father of the boy was not satisfied, and sent him to another medical officer to be examined. By a singular coincidence the second medical officer is the partner of the brother of the father of the boy. The boy's father has a brother, who is a medical man, practising in partnership with Dr. Irvine. The boy was sent to Dr. Irvine, who declared him to be physically unfit, but the Defence Department would not accept that declaration as an excuse, because Dr. Irvine was not a duly qualified medical officer appointed by the Department. A t any rate, the boy did no drill, but here is where the "" spoils to the victors "" policy comes in . Recognising that the amount paid for these medical services was not sufficient, the Defence Department raised the amount to £ 6 0 per annum. Then Dr. Clarke Webster was "" passed o u t . "" were no longer required as medical officer in that particular defence area, and when he was passed out D r . Irvine received the appointment. In this way do the spoils go to the viccors. gest that when it became worthwhile having this particular office, and paying additional remuneration, the Government gave the position to a gentleman who had acted in a certain way. He was a friend of the Government, a friend of the victors to whom the spoils went. that statement? the table of the Senate. When the I am pleased, sir, Labour party were in power, we made two I think, howappointments of friends of our party, appointments in the Northern Territory, neither of which carried a very high emolument for a place of that sort.

I would describe the honourable member for Flinders as the "" white hope"" of Conservatism in Australia. If I may be permitted to recite a little history, I wouia remind honourable members that none of the leading men in the States of Australia was entirely in favour of Federation unti l after 1892. A f t e r that year, when Labour was told not to fight with the bludgeon, but to take its place on the floors of the Parliaments of the different States, and fight its battles there-whe n we accepted that challenge, and put men into the State Parliaments, our opponents realized that the time had come when Federation might be useful. Mr (now Sir George) Reid, who had been opposed to Federation, became a convert, and in 1894, in the New South Wales His services Parliament, he revived the agitation in favour of Federation. In due course, Federation was established. Sir George Turner, who was a delegate at the last Convention, held in. Melbourne in 1898, said, when somebody interjected about Democracy, "" We will have no. Democrats in the Senate; the electorates will be too I deliberately suglarge, and no Labour man w ill be able to afford to contest them."" That hope was not realized, and the Senate, instead of being, as they expected it to be, a citadel against which the forces of Democracy might hurl themselves in vain, became so radical that to-day there are twenty-nine Labour representatives there and only seven Conservatives.

291,Mr Conroy (Werriwa) [3.48],"Iclaimed that there are certain honorahle members on the Ministerial side who agree w i th portion of the proposals for the amendment of the Constitution put -forward by the Labour party, but it is extraordinary to hear of honourable members in any part of the House arguing that powers that now belong to the States, and which could be exercised in every State, would be transformed if collected into one unified power under the Commonwealth. If honourable members understood what they are driving at, they would understand that they are passing the greatest vote of censure possible on the Labour parties in New South Wales and Western Australia, because in each of those States the Labour parties, if they wished to do so, could bring forward legislation dealing with combines and trusts. by the Legislative Councils. They have never tried to bring in this legislation. Honourable members know that nothing of the sort would take place, and that the States are well able to deal with these matters. But if it is true, as our Tariff we remove the burden from honourable members say, that the Legislative Councils of these States would reject this legislation, what a whip it would be for Labour members to use before the electors, in appealing against these Legislative Councils. Yet they have not done so, because they know that any .' trusts that are in existence in the States have been created by the action of the Labour party themselves. out in 1901 that certain votes of the Labour party would result in creating trusts and combines, and that they were protecting certain manufacturers from competition by imposing duties 500 per cent, greater than any difference in the rate of wages paid to the employees of those manufacturers. In plenty of cases the difference was ten to twelve times the amount of the increased wage. Honourable members gave £1 to the workmanthough, as a matter of fact, they did not, -because the increase had to be taken in relation to the ordinary rate of wage in the country-bu t at the same time they gave ten times that amount to manufacturers, and enabled them to for m combines. new Protection ? point out in 1902-it took the Labour party four years to bring out the term itself-that , if the Labour party were really working in the interests of the workers of the community, they would see that the whole of 'the duties went to the workers, that there would then be no more log-rolling, and that there would be an end to any body of men striving to get for themselves something they had not earned-strivin g to get something at the expense of their neighbours. The honourable member for Maribyrnong the other night said that he wished to stop competition from other countries, and he claimed he was speaking on behalf of the workers, but I point out to the honourable member that a high T a r i ff does not stop that competition. It still goes on. We merely transfer the burden from the manufacturer or grower to the general taxpayers. In the case of sugar, I have already shown that competition is not blocked, that it still goes on, and that we have merely transferred the burden to the shoulders of the general taxpayers. B y the manufacturer, and at the same time reduce trade and the profits arising from trade. All this arises from one in it i a l error. Honourable members claim that all labour creates wealth. It does nothing of the sort. If it were so, where there are large numbers of men employed they would all be engaged in creating wealth, but I can show many cases in whicli I pointed labour and wealth are entirely distinct. Labour frequently works hard and creates no wealth, such as might happen in the case of employing men to dig holes on the seashore. long bow now. ber will recognise that in such a case there is destruction of the whole 100 per cent, of effort; yet the honourable member w ill not recognise that if there are two factories turning out a particular article, each sustaining a loss of 50 per cent, of effort-that is if a protective duty of 50 per cent, is necessary to enable the article to be turned out-the loss thus sustained is exactly that which would result",41,Pairs

When they are in the ridiculous position that they I assert, that places into which nogoods can go are absolutely the best places for white men, and offer the best advantages for workers, they are involving themselves in the unfortunate position of having to assert that every improvement that has taken place in the matter of lower freights, and so on, is a distinct in j u r y to the workers.

I am afrai d that one of the Government's methods of economizing may be to do what was done by the party opposite on a previous occasion, to prevent the extension of old-age pensions. In March, 1908, Mr Fisher, the honourable member for Wide Bay, moved an amendment on the question that Mr Speaker do now leave the chair, w it h a view to affirming that the electors having decided by a large m a j o r it y that the Commonwealth should pay old-age pensions, provision should be This is a made for their payment. Honourable members opposite were too cunning to vote against that amendment, but how did they speak? Let me read some extracts from the debates, which are recorded in the Hansard reports for the session. The present Treasurer, Sir John Forrest-His remarks will be found on page 9204; I do not, as the PrimeM in ister did the other night, make a number of quotations which cannot be verified-saidWhile the Braddon provision has force, financial considerations prevent the establishment of an old-age pensions system.

I am absolutely opposed to the alienation of any of our public funds for such a purpose unless tliose funds are provided from the primary source of the Commonwealth revenue, namely, the duties derived from Customs and Excise. I do not at all favour a land tax, which would interfere with State rights. The present Treasurer said, page 9337The Government bave plainly set forth, times out of number, that financial reasons prevent thc question being dealt with until after 1910, when what is known as the Braddon section ceases to operate. . . . I am in favour of the granting of old-age pensions, but I have never thought the establishment of a Commonwealth scheme possible until after the expiration of the Braddon provision. All the Liberals, Anti-Labourites, or Fusionists in Parliament at that time professed to favour a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions, but they made difficulties about providing the money. At that time the Braddon section was still in operation. It required the Commonwealth to return to the States 15s. for every £1 collected from Customs and Excise duties, and, in addition, the Commonwealth had returned in seven years some £6,500,000, being the unspent surplus of the remaining 5s., which it was at liberty to retain. The proposal of Mr Fisher, the present Leader of the Opposition, was that the Commonwealth should in future keep the whole of its portion of the Customs and Excise revenue, putting what it did not spend into a fund from which pensions could be paid before the expiration of the Braddon section. The Surplus Eevenue Bill was brought forward by the late Sir William Lyne on the 31st March, 1908, a fortnight after Mr Fisher's resolution had been carried, having been bitterly opposed by members of the present Liberal party. The present Treasurer spoke against it on several occasions, and Mr W. H .

His proposal meant an indefinite postponement of the Bill. Fortyfour members of the Fusion party were then in Parliament, and twenty-nine of them voted or paired in favour of the Prime Minister's proposal. I shall give only the names of those who are still in Parliament, or are likely to be candidates at the next election. Those who voted for the postponement of tlie Bill were Mr L.

349,"Orable Member For Wimmera, Mr Samp","Liberal Ministry, and five others of the party who voted for that duty. Speaking from memory, the Government of the day abandoned the proposed duty on kerosene of 3d. per gallon, whilst the proposed duty on tea was defeated. These were two easy means of raising revenue from the people, and they may be resorted to by the present Government should they be returned to power. We can only judge them by their actions. We must look at their performances in order to determine what they may do in the future. In Queensland the Liberal party, prior to Federation, had a duty, I think, of 6d per lb. on tea, and 6d. per gallon on kerosene. The only other point that I wish to emphasize is that, owing to the action taken by the right honourable member for Wide Bay on behalf of the Labour party, Federal old-age pensions were introduced eighteen months earlier than they would otherwise Bave been. The honourable member practically told the Prime Minister of the day, Mr Deakin, that an Old-age Pensions Bill must be passed in 1908, and it was passed. It is a matter of history that the Bill was passed readily, and that there would have been no means of finding the money necessary to pay the pensions if those to whom I have referred as voting against the Surplus Revenue Bill had been in power. I place tliese facts on record so that those who are in receipt of invalid and old-age pensions will know that, owing to the action of the Labour party, they secured their pensions eighteen months earlier than they would have done if the question had rested with the Fusion party, which has always been opposed to any extension of the invalid and old-age pension system. Honourable members of the Opposition are continually charging the Liberal Government with having failed to pass any useful legislation during their term of office.

Since then the Labour party have adopted every known and unknown means of preventing the Government doing anything of a useful character. They have raised points of order from time to time.

Re-: cognising the utter futility of expecting the Opposition to assist them to pass any legislation of a useful character the Government rightly determined to end thia political farce whicli has been costing the people so dearly. In support of my contention that honourable members opposite have wasted time, I have a few facta which I sliould like them to digest. I am afraid that they will sadly interfere with their digestion. I have before me a statement showing how the time of this House was occupied from 9th July, 1913, to 31st October. In that period there were forty-eight sitting days, less one day on which the sitting lapsed. The House sat for 287 hours 53 minutes, and of that time questions and personal explanations occupied 20 hours 12 minutes, and private members' business 32 hours, leaving a balance of 235 hours 41 minutes available for consideration of Government business. During Government time Ministerialists spoke 202 times, occupying, in all, 66 hours 52 minutes, whilst members of the pied 161 hours 32 minutes. they say they were "" gagged."" tleman will remember that the Opposition resorted to means of obstruction for whicli we have very few precedents; they even opposed strenuously a motion for leave to introduce various Bills.

Then, as will be seen by reference to Hansard, volume L XX . , page 91, they will see that Senator Russell moved the suspension of the Standing Orders, despite an appeal made to him by Senator Millen, who pointed out that he would have ample opportunity to bring forward the matter to which he desired to refer if he allowed the ordinary business of the Senate to proceed. On this question the Senate divided, and the motion was carried against the Government. sell then moved the adjournment of the House to discuss a speech made by Senator McColl at Fitzroy, on 21st July, with regard to alleged electoral irregularities. I would further remind honourable members of the action taken by Senator de Largie, who moved the suspension of the Standing Orders and the appointment of a> Select Committee to inquire into the case of Mr Chinn. moved the suspension of the Standing Orders to allow a SupplyB ill to be passed through all its stages without delay; but Senator de Largie immediately moved that Government business be postponed u n t i l his motion in regard to th© Chinn inquiry had been dealt with .

In the Fowler. Coming to the Chinn inquiry, we find that an application for expenses to enable the Select Committee to visit K a l goorlie was refused by the Government, and that Senator de Largie moved that the Committee have leave to adjourn to Kalgoorlie. On that question the Senate divided with the usual result. Another matter brought up by the Labour party in the Senate was the discussion and the appointment of a Committee of Inquiryi n regard to Cockatoo Island. On 28th November, Senator McGregor opposed a motion by Senator Senator RusMillen, that for the remainder of the session-which, by the way, closed on the 18th December-Governmen t business should take precedence of other business. The House divided on the question, and Senator Millen's motion was lost. In view of the fact that the time of both Houses has been wasted in this way, it is distinctly humorous to hear the Opposition accusing the Government of failing Senator Clemons to carry anything of a useful character. I propose to make a comparison of some of the expressions of opinion in which members of the Labour party have in dulged on the question of the double dissolution. Now that the die has been cast -no w that the Governor General has Senator granted a dissolution-the warriors opposite, who previously were throwing down the gauntlet and invitin g an appeal to the country, are squealing so loudly that they can be heard from Darwin to Fremantle.

If those honourable members who were in the Labour Government were earnest in their recent endeavour to bring about a single dissolution, it was because they all have safe seats, and they are quite satisfied to risk spending a few pounds on electioneering, because, if through a re-shuffle of the political cards they came back into office, the -cost would be infinitesimal compared with what they would gain. They have been in the tart-shop, and they have had thei r fingers in the jam, and during the last twelve months they have been meditatively sucking those fingers, longing for the time when once again they will be back in office. That iswhy they wish to have a single dissolution. But the poor rank and file, those who have been, figuratively speaking, sitting on three-legged chairs, who may fall by the wayside, they do not want a single dissolution, and have been cursing, not only the Government, but also the bold buccaneers of .the Senate for forcing this double dissolution upon them. Those honourable members opposite who have Honourable members know been lavish in their condemnation of In this the Government, and very frequent in their challenges to go to the country, know in their hearts that if the Labour party had been in power under similar circumstances, nothing short of an earthquake or a charge of dynamite would have shifted them from the Treasury bench until the f u l l term of Parliament expired. But, in order to terminate the present situation, that no self-respecting Ministry could tolerate, the Government very rightly applied for a double dissolution, and got it ; and, since then, honourable members opposite have been reviling the Governor General for having granted it. One honourable member, the honourable member for Barrier, who should Members of the Opposition know better, considering that he has been a Minister of the Crown, has been accusing the Governor General of partisanship.

I have not time to deal with the honourable member and his remarkable utterances. I dare say that it is quite possible some members of the Opposition did not like the idea of a general election. I do not. I am utterly opposed to going to the country. It is only twelve months since I was before my constituents, and my majority was 6,863, whereas in 1910 it was only 2,800. I have no reason to fear that the electors of Capricornia have withdrawn their support from me. On the contrary, I have every reason to believe that if we have a general election I shall be returned. I object to being sent to the country every year, because my electorate is 1,500 miles away from Melbourne, and a lot of travelling has to be done. The division is equal in area to the State of Victoria. I shall not attempt to follow the honourable member for Ne-pean in all his accusations against the Labour party as to our fighting like K i l kenny cats and attacking tooth and nail measures introduced by Ministers, and tearing them to pieces, and preventing the Government carrying on the business of the country. I simply refer the honourable member to the list of measures which have been passed. They appear in the Government Gazette. Some of the honourable member's constituents may ask him tlie question. We passed Supply Bills, the Norfolk IslandB ill , the Pine Creek to Katherine River RailwayB ill , and also a LoanB ill for £2,000,000. Had we cared to hold up the business of the country we could have done it on those measures; but no, we were prepared on all occasions to assist the Government in passing measures for the benefit of the whole of tlie community, though at the same time we deemed it our sacred duty to prevent them from attacking our social legislation, which we believed was in the interests, not only of those who work for wages, but also of civilization itself. postal vote? stitution.

It has not been in vogue long enough for ua to decide whether it is in the interests of the manhood of Australia that we should take boys at a tender age, and subject them to the discipline which our military officers think is necessary.

I read in an encyclopaedia some time ago that the class in the community most subject to hypnotism were soldiers, because they were accustomed to obeying the word of command, and when the hypnotist told them to go to sleep, they went to sleep more quickly than any one else. That is a scientific fact. ""We should train our people to defend the country, and I do not say a word against the compulsory system as a system; but I do say that there are certain great defects which require remedying right away. Some time ago there was a disturbance at the Liverpool camp, and a report we have before us condemns the officers who had charge of that camp. Since that time there has been an encampment at Lilydale, but, so far as I know, there has been no in vestigation regarding what happened there. The boys in the case to which I have referred were mostly from the city and suburbs, and they were placed under the command of big, strong, 16-stone officers, marched them 20 miles on one of the hottest and most trying days in summer. Many of the omcers, though, of course, I do not say all, who have control of the cadets do not understand boys; and I was very grieved on reading Sir Ian Hamilton's report to find that he did not touch on the question whether our system of training and encampments is not too severe for them. So far as I know the General .has not referred to this matter at a l l ; and, therefore, I am forced to quote some words which he spoke in acknowledging a toast at a dinner given in his honour at Brisbane. The newspaper report of that function is as follows:General Hamilton, in acknowledging the to such questions as these are not given toast, touched on defence matters. He said straight out; but, however that may be, thoy might compare Australia, metaphorically, the Agei n an article on the 2nd A p r i l to an eighteen-year-old trainee of 6 f t . 2 in. last said: in his stockings, giving magnificent promise for the future, but liable just yet to be knocked out by quite an inferior sort of chap who was ing made any official examination of the men. more mature, and, consequently, better-knit It was never suggested that they had. together. What was wanted was more time for casual examination was made on behalf of a the development of the youth into matured high officer, the men being picked out indissoldiers. This gives only a glimpse of Sir Ian Hamilton's opinion concerning the treatment of the youths. I dare say that, surrounded as he was by the military officers of 'Australia, with whom he was well acquainted, and by whom he was being treated magnificently, he could not find it in his heart to express in his report an opinion as to the rough treatment meted out by certain of them to the boys. Aa to what happened at Lilydale we read in the Age of 17th FebruaryTurning to more recent events still, evidence is not wanting that the troops which were training last week at Lilydale were overworked. Since their return to town, many cases have been reported, though none officially, of youths who were unable to return at once to their civil occupation owing to fatigue and foot weariness. Several men, on their arrival from Lilydale on Saturday, fainted from exhaustion. Surely it is too great a price to pay for efficiency if only one man be overtrained. Sir Ian Hamilton, riding among the troops immediately after the morning engagement on Friday, was quick to note traces of exhaustion in the troops. The 2,000 men on the preceding day had covered 20 miles, not marching along even a dusty road, but manoeuvring across country-no w halting, now scrambling up hills, now slipping down the hard and grassy slopes. . . . A medical examination made indiscriminately down the firing line by an army medical officer revealed the startling fact that ten trainees were suffering from acute dilation of the heart. When men on horseback, who the troops returned to camp-the last unit filed in at 7 p.m., having been in the field since 8 a.m -the y were practically ready to drop from exhaustion. The lads lay about in their tents, too tired even to talk, too exhausted almost to sleep, and their feet were swollen and blistered. The General had foreseen what the Brigadier had not-that the morning exercise was sufficient for the troops. As Sir Ian Hamilton remarked, in effect, they cannot learn much, even if they do carry out the exercise, when they are tired. Some little investigation was made, and the military ofiicers replied that there was no examination, and they denied the correctness of the report. I noticed yesterday, I think it was, that when Dr. Maloney asked a question about an officer having been fined the reply given was, ""There is nothing on record.""

385,Mr Higgs,"The y were not the boysI t is quite true that physical training is good for boys, but I have given some attention to the subject, and my opmion is that, in the case of growing youths, it can be over-done. Certainly a boy cannotl be properly physically trained hjy being kept standing on the side street by the half hour, or being compelled to walk to and f r o forming fours. No good can be done to boys by taking them at the age of 18 to 20, and marching them 20 miles a day carrying a heavy burden. I saw some of the boys who had marched from Heidelberg one afternoona distance of about 12 miles-and each was carrying about 43-Ibs. weight. any medical man of knowledge and experience say that boys are benefited by that sort of thing ? it benefits anybody. Colonel Monash personally, but I understand that he is a man of 15 or 16 stone weight, and I dare say that, being on horseback, he did not realize what the -boys at Lilydale were suffering. While the vitality of the average boy of 18 to 20 years of age is, I believe, as great as ever it was, wooden stretcher, the mattress and blanketshe may not be so well able to rough it as were the boys of 30 or 40 years ago, ma-ny of whom lived in the country, and on the Saturday .afternoons were accustomed to walk 10 or 15 miles in the bush. It is quite possible that the boys of .to-day, whatever tlieir vitality may be, have not the capacity to suddenly endure a march of 20 miles, especially on an extremely hot day; and to say this is to say nothing against the physical or mental fitness of the cadets of to-day. In my opinion military officers ought to be subject to some kind of examination before they are placed in charge of the boys. Evidently the Minister of Defence does not see his way to interfere; and thus we have a brigadier compelling long marches such as those to which I have referred. I understand that in no part of bhe world are soldiers called upon to drill in the hot parts of the day, and it is reserved for Australia to take, not adult men, but boys of tender age-and 18 years, afber all, means only a boy-and subject them to work only fit for welltrained and mature men. It is certainly time some alteration was made in this respect. of the treatment of defaulting cadets, some of whom, on religious grounds, areacting under t i e orders of tlieir parents. Only to-day I received the following letter:125 New-street, Middle Brighton, 10th June, 1914. Bear Sir, FindingI am unable to obtain justicefrom the Defence Department, I write earnestly appealing to you to kindly use your influencein connection with the unjust treatment of our lad, who, through loyalty to his parents' views of Christian teaching, is undergoing solitary confinement in the cells at Queenscliff fortress. Tom is a lad of 10, and was sent to Queenscliff on Wednesday last for 21 days, for reWould fusing to train under the Defence Act. My wife and I are members of the Society of"" Friends, ancl hold strong convictions on this matter of militarism, which is a vital one in the religious views of the Quakers, and however you may differ from mc on this point, I am quite sure, as a man, you will agree that, this is not the treatment for a boy of sixteen, I do not suppose that even if he had committed a crime. I do not know For continuing in his refusal, the boy wasplaced in the cell next the guard-room on Thursday night, where he was confined until 11 a.m. Saturday morning, and then court martialled. The Military Court then ordered him to be placed in a cell for seven days. He is locked in a cell 10 foot by 10 foot, built, of wood, with an iron roof. It has no window, thc light coming through a grating. He has a are taken away in the morning, and not brought back until dark. He has half-anhour's exercise in the morning, and again in the afternoon; he is on half diet, has not been allowed to read, nor to write to his parents. We were quite unaware of this treatment of Iriui until we visited Queenscliff on Monday,, when we found him looking worse than whem seen five days previously. Tliis we attributed to the mental strain of the solitary confinement, a recent illness of a month in bed, and to the reduced diet-afte r lunch time on Saturday he received only bread and water uiiti'F breakfast time Sunday. The boy endeavoured to cheer his mother by saying that he had only four days' more solitary confinement to go tlirough. However, thismorning we waited on the Defence Department authorities, and were officially informed tliat if the boy continued in his refusal to forego hisconvictions he would be ordered a further period of -solitary confinement. The Civil Court ordered the boy into military custody, but surely it is going beyond the intentions of the Citizen Army for a court martial to be allowed to step in after a case has been dealt -with by the civil CmiTt. Furthermore, solitary confinements should never lie ordered. The question may well be asked: Is this a Citizen Army controlled 'by Parliament, or a military Army controlled by the Military_ Board? A Melbourne lawyer states -that solitary confinement is -considered inI now come to the question human, and only used in the case of refractory criminals of the worse type.",55,Chaieman Th E Honourable That The Government W I L L Not Borrow F O R

387,Mr Higgs,"My wife and I earnestly appeal for your influence in tins distressing matter, and hope you will at least write a letter to tlie Minister of Defence. Yours very sincerely, F. J. ROBERTS, per I.C. That letter reached me only to-day. I understand that the boy has now been taken out of solitary confinement. All authorities are opposed to solitary confinement as a punishment, even for prisoners who have committed crimes like theft. Imagine a boy being placed in a room by himself, and kept there day and night without being allowed to read or write for a period of a week. not think that any member of either House would say that a cadet refusing to drill should be punished with solitary confinement. It would have been better to compel this lad to read than to prevent him from reading. Authorities in various parts of the world are challenging the wisdom of imprisoning as a means of reforming the adult criminal, and surely it is, to say the least, an abnormality to put intosolitary confinement boys, who, under the direction of their parents, refuse to drill. This is what Dr. James Devon, a medical officer of the Glasgow prison, says on the subjectAll sorts of systems have had their trial in dealing with the offender. It has always been recognised that it was necessary to remove him from the place where he had offended. He has been, transported to other lands, there to begin a new life; but the conditions under which the operation was carried out were appalling. He has been placed in association with other offenders, and left, with very little supervision, to become worse, or make others worse. He has been placed in solitary confinement, cut off from company of any sort; with the result of wrecking his mind as well as his body. If solitary confinement is likely to wreck tlie mind as well as the body of an adult, what is it not likely to do to a boy of sixteen ? Let me read a passage from The Secrets of the Prison House, by Arthur GriffithThis failure of imprisonment, both as a reformatory and deterring agent, has led to two very opposite results. One is a growing disinclination to use it ; the other an earnest wish to prolong its infliction. The first is shown curred in connection with elections, even in recent legislation with regard to first offenders, which, empowers Courts to withhold senwhen electors' rights have had to be protence, or excuse from punishment in cases duced 1 where an accused person isguilty of no very heinous offence, and has never lapsed before.. A magistrate or Judge will hesitate before sending a man to prison for a first offence,, and I doubt whether any Judge has of late ordered solitary confinement for persons convicted of. theft. I . do not think that there is any law providing for the solitary confinement of cadets. I do not think that such a law would be passed by Parliament, but if such a law exists, it is a bad one, and like other bad laws should be repealed or ignored. member's time has expired. When my speech was interrupted by the operation of the Standing Orders, I was referring to the opportunities for wrongdoing given by the electoral law. No doubt both parties are of the opinion that a contest at the polls should be fought under the fairest conditions, neither side having any special advantage. But the Electoral Act does not provide for that. There are political enthusiasts who are prepared to take risks for the advantage of their side, and the absentee voting provisions give them many opportunities. A. man named John William Jones,, residing at Broken Hill, might, after getting enrolled for the Barrier, visit Adelaide for a holiday, and stay there for some time. While at Adelaide he might get himself enrolled again as John WalterJones. Then, on election day 'he could vote in his subdivision at the Barrier as John William Jones, and at another polling booth, as an absent voter, as John Walter Jones, and he would run only the very slightest risk of detection. thing happen? world, we know that it happens.

Mr J. favorable to that being done now? member for Cook prevented the increase being secured. MrJ . H . CATTS -No. The honourable member will find that the Treasurer is not in favour of an increase. to say what the Treasurer is in favour of; but I do not hesitate to express my own opinion on the subject. tion of increasing the old-age pension payments, owing to the obstruction methods of the Opposition, has been side-tracked. the old people at present receive is wholly inadequate. cient to buy them food, let alone to provide them with clothes, and to enable them to pay rent. Seeing that the Parliament before the last had no hesitation in raising the salaries of members, I think that Parliament has been oblivious of the interests of tliese old people. The cost of living has gone up, with the result that the purchasing power of the 10s. per week which pensioners are receiving has depreciated so that it is hardly sufficient to enable them to keep body and soul together. The proposal introduced by the Treasurer, in respect of inmates of institutions, that 8s. per week should be paid to the institution, and the remaining 2s. per week given to the pensioner concerned, was certainly a step in the right direction. There are three of these in stitutions in my electorate, and during the last election campaign several of these old people mentioned to me how much they felt the lack of a little pocket money which they could call their own. When the Treasurer brought forward his B ill it had my warmest support, as I recognised at once that it would meet the wishes of these pensioners, and that it was a step in the right direction, inasmuch as it would place the inmates of such institutions in the position of paying guests instead of being almost considered recipients of charity. The officials as a rule treat them kindly and well, but I am afraid that among a large number there may be one official who is not as tactful as he might be in dealing with the old people, and that might make them feel their position. Under the new arrangement they would have a sense of independence. They know that their H. CATTS I s the Treasurer maintenance is being paid for, and they have the privilege of having a couple of shillings per week with which to purchase little extras that they require. I regret that the condition of this Parliament did not permit us to go further, so that we could enable these old people to be provided with a few more of the things they require, because I feel that we ought to I am not prepared do all that we can to make their remaining days happy and contented, and I hope that when the new Parliament asThe quessembles provision w ill be made on the Estimates to this end. There is only one other matter to which I desire to refer. If we come back from the next The Is. 5d. per day which general election with the condition of parties unaltered from the stand-point of It is hardly suffinumerical strength, I consider that this Parliament will have seriously to take into consideration a different system of government. Such an idea is in the minds of the people outside. We cannot t u r n a deaf ear to expressions of public opinion. The people themselves are beginning to grow weary of the continual fighting that goes on under the party system. They will not be satisfied to see the country's money wasted by party warfare, and if the next Parliament is in no better position than is the present, we shall have seriously to consider the introduction of some other system of government whereby the public interests w ill be better served.

424,Mr Joseph Cook.,"It is the function ofElectoral Acts were carried in 1902, 1905, 1906, 1909, and 1911. In every Act passed by the Commonwealth Parliament provision has been made for appointing a Chief Electoral Officer, whose duties have always been the same as they are to-day. There is no difference in respect of the duties of Chief Electoral Oflicer between the Act of 1911 passed by the Labour Government and the preceding Acts passed by Liberal Administrations. Therefore we see that the position is not as the Prime Minister has stated it to be. In order to prove that the Prime Minister was misrepresenting the matter when he said that the Government had no power to see that the law was carried out, and that he was not telling the truth , I shall quote what the Attorney-General said last year. On page 31 of last session's Hansard there appears the followingtho Attorney-General more than can be avoided, but I should like to asK him whether he or the Government issued the regulation spoken of, and which we have not yet seen ? Was it issued on his own initiation as Attorney-General, or was it issued on the initiation of the Minister of Home Affairs, or any other authority ? Mr W. H. IRVINE -Tli e regulation was issued on thc autliority of the Cabinet after full consideration of the whole matter. This was in regard to an inquiry into cases of duplicate voting. We see from these words of the Attorney-General that the Cabinet, and not this outside officer, is responsible for the administration of the law. Wheni t was a matter of inquiring into cases of duplicate voting, the Cabinet was the party responsible, but after inquiries have been made, and a certain number of persons have been shown, according to the other side, to have voted twice, we are told that the responsibility is on the Chief Electoral Officer, and not on the Cabinet. Later on, we come to another statement by the Attorney-General, reported on page 913 of the Hansard of last session. Speaking on the 5th September, 1913, the Attorney-General saidTJnder the electoral law, there are certain offences, and that law is administered by the Minister of Home Affairs, just as Customs prosecutions are initiated or carried on by the Minister of Trade and Customs. The responsibility for initiating or carrying on a prosecution under the electoral law is a matter for the Department of Home Affairs, and rests with thc Minister of Home Affairs. Thus we have the Prime Minister on one side, and the Attorney-General on the other contradicting each other. To-day, they sit on the Treasury bench, in f r o n t of me, silent as statues while I quote their words, tliose of the Attorney-General proving that the Prime Minister has misled the Housei n stating that the responsibility for administering the electoral law is not on the Government. I do not believe that these are cases of duplicate voting. When a man named Smith goes into a polling booth among a crowd of electors the officer at the table may tick off the wrong Smith from the number of Smiths on the roll. The right Smith, whose name has been ticked off, goes to vote as an absent voter in another booth. He makes a declaration and records his vote. Thus there is an apparent duplicate vote. That out of the 30,000 votes recorded in my electorate there were only forty-six cases of what appeared like duplicate voting is a record which is very creditable to the officers who carried out the election. I do not think, as I have said, that these were duplicate votes, b u t when the Government said that there was wholesale wrong-doing under the Electoral Acb we were entitled to look to them to carry the matter to a conclusion, and to show the country fairl y and squarely whether, in the end, this was found to be the state of affairs. Ministers have taken the matter to a certain point, but there they have dropped it , and not in a straightforward and manly way. The Prime Minister does not stand up boldly and say, "" We charged a number of persons with wrong-doing. The evidence does not confirm it , and we therefore withdraw it . "" He shelters himself behind the Elec-. toral Office, and says the administration of the Act is in the hands of the Chief Electoral Officer, and, therefore, Ministers have nothing to do with it . Ministers have r u n away from the charge they made, and do not propose to do justice even to their own supporters, whom I have quoted to show that they do not believe that these people were guilty of any wrong-doing under the electoral law. There are some matters that look like manipulation of the electoral machinery by the Government, b u t I have not time to deal with them, and I shall have to wait a further opportunity to p u t them",62,Newtown
425,Mr Fisher,"I do not wish to interrogateSupply. before the Committee. However, before I sit down I wish to make a remark in connection with a portion of the speech of the honourable member for Nepean. The honourable member found fault with the present system of enrolment, aud the cure that he suggested was electors' rights. To justify his complaint against the present system of enrolment, he took a hypothetical case, one of the most impossible one could conceive. He dealt with the case of a man becoming enrolled in two States. He took the case of a man living in Broken Hill, and being enrolled there as William Jones, and then going to Adelaide, and being enrolled in South Australia as William Henry Jones, and thus having a vote in two States. If that is all the wrong thafc can be shown under the present Act, I hope we shall always have a measure that will work so well. apply in any one State. Mr J. H . CATTS -No; not with the card system of enrolment. Every elector must sign a card, and every card signed by an elector goes to the Central Office, where a staff compares the signatures. The honourable member for Nepean no doubt, as a business man, employs the card system, and understands thoroughly. He will therefore know thafc the only way in which that system can be wrong is when the officers in the Electoral Department refuse to do their duty. In every case where two signatures are alike it is only necessary for tlie two cards upon which those signatures appear to be taken oufc for careful scrutiny, and if it is shown on inquiry fchat they are signed by the same person the name will be struck off the roll. He says he wants ""electors' rights"" restored. save us from the manipulation carried on under that rotten system. Sitting suspended from 6.25 to 8 p.m.. Mr P. P. ABBOTT (New England) [8.0] I should like to reply to one or two of the remarks that fell from the honourable member for Cook regarding the alleged maladministration of the Electoral Act by the Government. The charge made is that the Government are proposing to amend the regulations under the Act in order to assist electors who are favorable to them and their policy; and in support of that charge the honourable member told ns that, in his own electorate [REPRESENTATIVES.] Supply. at the last election, there were certain: duplications which were all of the namesof Liberals. Under the Electoral Act and regulations, however, which were administered by the Labour party for -three years and more, there is nothing whatever to prevent a person voting at every booth in a subdivision in the name of a known Liberal supporter. It will be seen, therefore, that it does not follow that there has been duplicate voting on the part of Liberals. sons who do this have never been caught? Mr P. P. ABBOTT -The honourable member knows that it is the most difficult thing in the world to sheet such a charge home. no ground for the charge! Mr P. P. ABBOTT -The honourable member for Cook insinuated by his remarks that Liberals had voted more than once. honourable member for Cook said he did not think there had been duplicate voting, but that, if there had been, it appeared to have been by Liberals. Mr P. P. ABBOTT -Any person it reading the Hansard report of the honourable member's remarks would infer that this practice had been indulged in by Liberals, though we know that Laboursupporters, if they wished, could vote in the name of Liberals, and throw discredit on the latter. sides. Mr P. P. ABBOTT -The honorable member was not in the House when the honourable member for Cook spoke, and Heaven therefore may not know the position.. orable member is talking a lot of rubbish. Mr P. P. ABBOTT -If my remarks may be described as "" rubbish,"" I can certainly apply the same term to the remarksof the honourable member for Cook. I should like honourable members opposite to be consistent in their attitude on the question of a double dissolution.

The granting of Supply is urgent and important in view of the fact that the public servants have to be paid, and the works of the country carried on. the Supply Bill? Mr P. P. ABBOTT I intend to detain the Committee only a few moments, whereas most of the speakers opposite have occupied the full time allowed. It has been shown during the past fortnight that the earnest wish of the Opposition is to put off thc evil day as long as possible -to be saved from their friends, the electors, and to draw their emoluments to the very last day.

P. ABBOTT -The honourable member for Darwin has been so long out of office that, probably, he has forgotten the procedure, and also the fact that after the 30th June there is no money provided. The electors, who are masters of the situation, ought to be afforded the earliest opportunity to show whether they are satisfied with the administration, not only of the Electoral Act, but of all the Departments, by the present Government. It is rather late in the day to trouble oursignificant passage from the Argusselves with matters of policy so far as this Parliament is concerned, seeing that we have to go to the country. T. am very much concerned, however, to note that the >romise given by the Prime Minister a } square stand-up fight in every respect, is, apparently, not to be carried out. If there is anything in a paragraph which appeared in the Argus of 13th June last, it seems to me that there is a determined effort make a charge of that kind against the Government, but I do say that they are following a practice which will prevent a square stand-up fight between parties. The honourable member for Henty is very much disturbed because we have adverted and readverted to the question of the Electoral Act. able members opposite only desire time to stuff the rolls. and the condition of the rolls are of the very highest importance at the present juncture. ber's point of view, no doubt. member says that it is not so from his point of view, he makes a useful admission. not on the rolls ought to be fined £2. O'MALLEY -The Governfrom the Prime Minister, with tiresome reiteration, that he is doing all he can to purge the rolls. What does that mean? It means getting names off the rolls. I do not suggest that the Prime Minister deliberately sets out to disfranchise people, but I more than suggest that he comes here with an utterly erroneous idea that a number of persons, whose names are on the rolls, improperly exercised the franchise at the last election. Notwithstanding all the investigations that have been made, not a scintilla of proof has been obtained in support of the charge. talking before the report of the Royal Commission is tabled. In any circumstances it is certain that the issue of the writs will follow very closely on the dissolution proclamation. The reason for this being that final purification of the rollsSave the markl ittle time back, that this was to ba a may be immediately proceeded with. As no new names can be added after the writs have been issued, the supplementary rolls should be very small in every ease.

If this does represent the intentions of the Government Supply. sible consequence, but if that represents the intentions of the Government, it simply means that, after the rolls have been printed, there will be no opportunity to have placed on them names which have been wrongly omitted. If I could only get the Government to realize that it is infinitely more important that every person qualified to vote should be enrolled than that, in a few instances, names which are twice enrolled should be removed, some good service would be done. The repeated allegation of the Government that persons whose names have accidentally been enrolled twice will vote twice is absurd, and more than absurd, it is wickeda scandalous slander on the electors of the country. Prime Minister to tell us continually that all his efforts, and those of his officers, are being directed to the purging of the rolls, the removal of names, is for him to show a poor conception of his duties as head of the Electoral Department. That honourable gentleman got the honourable member for Gippsland to question him about a certain circular, so that he might stigmatize the statements therein as a pack of lies. I therefore tender him this warning-that , if ample opportunity is not afforded to place on the rolls the names that have been improperly removed, and those which should have been enrolled that have been left off, I shall charge the Government with having deliberately obstructed enrolment to prevent a fair poll being taken. I make the statement now so that it may not be said that it was uttered outside by some one who had not the courage to make it here. The Act provides for a certain procedure in the removal of names from the rolls. It contemplates the making of a deposit of 5s. by every person who objects to any name. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs said the other day that that provision has gone by the board. law, and should be observed. But in practice any person may now object to a name without backing his objection with a deposit of 5s. or of 5d. He need simply hint to a policeman or registrar that a name should be challenged, and to the person whose name is mentioned will immediately be sent a notice, informing him that unless within twenty days he shows cause why his name should be retained it will be removed from the roll. Such notices are sometimes not received by the persons to whom they are sent, and are sometimes not understood when received. In some cases they cannot be read, and thus names come to be removed that should not be removed. Many instances have been given, and I have here a notice which was directed to a person who had lived continuously for twenty years in one house. Had not her friends explained the notice to her, her name would have been removed from the roll. We wish to prevent occurrences of that kind. We are more concerned with getting names on the rolls than with anything else, because we desire a square, straight out appeal to the people. HonEor the orable members opposite have been very persistent in stating that the Labour party is opposed to postal voting, and that we have prevented the passing of a measure which would give facilities for the exercise of the franchise by persons who, without some provision for voting by post, cannot exercise it. But I shall not forget to impress on the electors this fact: that of the two Bills which were to be sent to the Senate .in order to secure their rejection, and thus obtain ground for advising the Governor General to dissolve both Houses of the Parliament, only one was pressed, the Voting by Post Bill being dropped. It is the Liberal party that is responsible for the fact that some system of postal voting has not been provided this session. We submitted one amendment, and could have submitted others, believing that an understanding might be arrived at which would result in the adoption of a system of postal voting which would be acceptable to all parties. It is true that postal voting was abolished by the Labour party, but that was necessary to wipe out the vicious practices that the law, as it stood, permitted. We wiped the slate clean, and were prepared, pursuant to our policy of Nevertheless, it remains the enfranchising every one who should be enfranchised, to support any reasonable system of postal voting, or other reasonable system of voting, which would assist the sick, and would prevent the abuses",65,Newtown

We are not, and never shall be, prepared to accept the postalvoting system -which the Fisher Government abolished, because we know too well the abuses to which it gave rise. I wish to draw the attention of Liberals to a company established in Melbourne -just before the last referendum and election.

The primary, and, so far as I can ascertain, the only, object of the company was to establish, print, and publish a newspaper in Victoria or elsewhere; "" to carry on the business of newspaper proprietors, printers, publishers, and advertising agents."" All that company did was to print and publish a paper called Public Opinion, which was hawked round to election meetings, and elsewhere, and thrust under our noses as a vehicle of healthy, public opinion, particularly of Liberal opinion. A copy that I have here depicts Labour with a bludgeon about to knock down the "" free worker,"" the "" producer,"" the "" manufacturer,"" the "" consumer,"" and "" private enterprise."" The truth is that the company deliberately entered into a voluntary sequestration and failed to pay the men who printed its paper. It left them in the lurch. The Treasurer says that he does not think that Mr Fairbairn would be a party to such a thing. Mr P. P. ABBOTT -Does not the honourable member know that the workers can recover their wages? should know more than the secretary of the company. I ask the honourable member to listen to this letter, which was addressed to the shareholdersDear Sir or Madam, I have to inform you that an extraordinary meeting of shareholders of the above company was convened for the purpose of passing a resolution to place the company into voluntary liquidation. At such meeting, however, a quorum sufficient to carry the resolution was not present, and the meeting was consequently adjourned for a period of seven days. Although every effort was made to obtain a quorum at the adjourned meeting, the necessary number of shareholders were not present at such meetthe honourable ing. It was decided by the shareholders, however, that the creditors be advised of the financial position of the company. I have therefore to inform you that the liabilities of the company amount to £718 15s., as per list The honourable herewith, and that the only asset is the sum of £80 which is to be received for the sale of thc copyright of Public Opinion, book debts, contracts and goodwill of the company, and which offer the shareholders present at the meeting instructed the directors to accept. Unfortunately, this amount is insufficient to meet the liabilities to the preferential creditors, consequently there is no provision for the ordinary creditors. It was also resolved by a majority of the shareholders that unless the creditors desired to take action, the directors distribute thc moneys in the hands of the company amongst the preferential creditors in proportion to the amounts of their debts, such distribution to be made at the expiration of fourteen days from this date. I am, yours faithfully, F. L. SMYTH, Secy. The honourable member will see that there was not much money with which to pay even preferential creditors, and let me remind him as a lawyer, since he appears to appeal to me as a fellow practitioner, thafc the men who printed this paper were not, and are not, preferential creditors.

I know nothing of the merits of the case, but I believe that before the debate is over it will be put before us i u its proper aspect. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports said last night that there was no necessity for a double dissolution, and that the Opposition would have assisted the Government had it endeavoured to bring forward legislation for the well-being of the Gornmonwealth. One of the first actions of the present Administration was to bring forward an amending Electoral B ill , and I defy any one who has had experience of our present Electoral Act to say that it does not need to be amended almost from beginning to end. I reiterate what I said last year, that from the first section to the last it opens the door to fraud and impersonation. does the honourable member make that statement ? own experience, and the evidence which has been given before the Commission of which the honourable member is a member. see t h a t the honourable member is called upon to appear before the Commission to prove what he says. tell my honourable friend as a member of the Commission what I am telling him now in the House.

I hope tliat the Electoral Department will insist in respect of the JOHN FOEEEST -Was it a limited claim cards that are now being received that every elector who desires to be enrolled shall give his f u l l name, address, and occupation. on now, and rightly so. I have only to say centlyI am -dealing with the State law -som e 100 applications for enrolment were received. The only address given was that of "" Geraldton,"" and I understand that the Crown Solicitor held that to be a sufficient address. The same thing might be done in connection with the Commonwealth rolls.. I desire that the Department shall insist upon the f u l l address and occupation of the applicant and tlie witness being given so that when applications are investigated it will be possible to take .proceedings against, not only the applicant, but the witness in any case of wrong doing. Mr. ELnibbs told us that the rolls used at the last election contained 180,000 names, more than there were adults in tlie Commonwealth. That surely was .sufficient to make us consider whetlier an amendment of the Act was not necessary.

471,Mr Gregory,"In Geraldton remember was a Protectionist. I am prepared to explain my policy on this question. ern Australia desire to be given an opportunity to state their case to the Inter-State Commission before it reports to Parliament. In regard to the finances, I was surprised that the honorahle member for Kennedy, when speaking the other evening, seemed to be very sore indeed because the Treasurer had stated that it was estimated that the surplus at the end of the year would be £800,000. The honourable member was insistent on the fact being plained to the public that the difference between the receipts and expenditure represented a deficit of £1,800,000. When the Estimates were submitted last year it was realized that the expenditure would be very much greater than the revenue, and it was undoubtedly proved here that the draft Estimates approved by exMinisters showed an expenditure of some millions more than the Treasurer estimated to the Committee. proof? ments given to the House and the draft Estimates signed and approved by some ex-Ministers. I am pleased that the expenditure this year has not been so great as had been anticipated. When we realize the enormous additions to the revenue received by the Government during the past three years, one can hardly wonder at the extravagant financial orgy which was indulged in. In regard to the Estimates submitted last year, I fail to see that the present Treasurer made any great departure from the method of estimating adopted by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer. For the year 1911-12 the then Treasurer estimated to receive a revenue of £19,550,000; he estimated £21,227,000, and he was going to expend the whole of the surplus of £1,712,000 which had accumulated prior to that date. The honourable member did not expend all that he estimated, and his revenue was greater than he had anticipated, with the result that the year closed with a surplus of £2,261,000. 1912-13, the honourable member for Wide Bay estimated a revenue of £20,442,000, and the Committee was asked to agree to an estimated expenditure of £22,683,000. So that the honourable gentleman intended The producers of Westto expend, not only the whole of the estimated revenue of £20,442,000, as well as the surplus of £2,261,000, ' but he also borrowed £2,100,000, which meant that he obtained approval to spend in 1912-13 £4,360,000 more than the estimated revenue for the year. I do not know what the expenditure would have been had the same Government continued in power, but I do fail to understand the policy of the Leader of the Opposition after hearing him state the other night that he obexjected to loan moneys being expended on the naval bases and similar works. In the face of that statement, I cannot understand how he induced Parliament to agree to the borrowing of money for the building of the Commonwealth offices in London. asset^ so are the Naval Bases. in the Naval Bases? expenditure of £2,100,000 from loan moneys on the Commonwealth offices and other works, there was £870,000 for the purchase of the Cockatoo Island Dock, and they treated it as a transferred property. it is, after the reports that I have read lately. dom of the honourable member opposite, but I prefer to accept the reports which have come from experts who have some knowledge of the subject. purchase money to-day if they were to sell the property. the reports which have been published, I think it would be a good thing for the Government to get rid of the dock. you constructed at Fremantle out of loan money ? structed; it was abandoned.

487,"I N The Following Year, Mr Gregory","It was never conthe Labour Administration were willing to spend £4,360,000 more than their revenue, and to that must be added the £870,000 for the purchase of the Cockatoo Island Dock, or a total of over £5,000,000 of expenditure in excess of the revenue. We must realize that there are many recurring items on the Estimates which must increase from year to year. There are the old-age pensions, which I hope we will be able to increase, but which, in consequence of the natural increase of population and of our people becoming older, must increase in number, with the inevitable result that next year, and in each succeeding year, a greater amount must be placed on the Estimates. The same argument applies to the maternity allowance and the defence scheme. As the cadets are drafted into the Forces and our warships are manned, there must be in the next few years a far greater expenditure than there has been in the past. that the Attorney-General referred to the maternity allowance as a waste of public money? I understand that the Government are going to do away with that. stand what the honourable member understands. Kennedy was very insistent that the Treasurer should state how he was going to make good all this expenditure, and whether he was going to propose increased taxation. If the money required for big permanent works, such as the Federal Capital, which should be a charge on posterity, and the Naval Bases and other big defence expenditure is to be found from revenue there must be increased taxation to enable us to meet our expenses, to pay your debts? orable member and I might get out. of our debts, but the Commonwealth will be compelled to pay its debts. Honourable members opposite practically admitted the truth of my argument, seeing that in the 1912-13 Estimates they proposed to spend £5,000,000 more than their revenue. If only the year before last it was a proper thing to spend £5,000,000 more than the revenue, how will honourable members foot the bill in future, having regard to the increasing cost of administration, unless we are going to have rigid economy, and construct such permanent works as I have described from loan money? If , on the other hand, we are going to adopt the policy of honourable members opposite, there must be increased taxation to enable the Treasurer to pay his way. If honourable members opposite are emphatic on that point, and want it to be clearly understood that we are to have increased taxation so as to pay for all these things, the sooner the public know their policy the better. gard to loan moneys? borrowed money for all permanent works, and especially for the Federal Capital. If we are going to build a great city that Avill be a credit to posterity, and should ultimately bring in a good revenue, why on earth cannot we build it from loan moneys with a reasonable sinking you not know fund attached, so that within fifty or sixty years the whole of the loan will be paid off ? Why should we be taxed for all these works? city, are you not ? The honourable member for know, but I feel confident that honourable members opposite, if they return to power, and find that they have not sufficient funds available from revenue, will introduce a Loan Bill to cover the expenditure on the Commonwealth offices in London, the Federal Capital, the Perth Post Office and works of that description. They must have their tongues in their cheek, and must be trying to deceive the people, when they say they will not agree to the use of loan moneys in tlie construction of such works. I have just a few words to say in regard to the postal administration. I know that the Postmaster-General has endeavoured to liberalize the conditions governing the granting of telephone services to outback districts, so far as the regulations will allow; but I do contend that when a Srate Government spends hundreds of thousands of pounds in constructing a railway, building roads and establishing water supplies for the purpose of permanently opening up the country, the Commonwealth is justified in constructing telephone lines along those railways, and doing something t.o help the development of the country,",70,Smith I Shall Certainly Is A Country Of Magnificent Distances Pro

495,Mr Gregory,"Well, I do notwithout insisting upon a ll the conditions and restrictions that are enforced at the present time. I believe that such a policy can be adopted. As I remarked before, Western Australia is a State of enormous distances, ancl in many districts wliere railways have been constructed the population is very small and scattered. we are building to Western Australia w ill ever pay? depends on the development of the whole of the country. Judgingf r o m the reports I have received, that railway should be a paying proposition in about ten years from the date of its completion. Butf r o m the progress that has been made to date, it is very difficult to say when the line will be completed. In connection with tlie building of spur lines in Western Australia, through districts where there was very little population, I notice that, although those lines do not actually pay at once, the net result to the whole system is such that the railways as a whole pay handsomely. Therefore, I commend to the consideration of the Government a similar system of railway construction for the development of the Northern Terri tory. Cheap lines could be constructed on a narrow gauge, and they could be standardized when the development, population, and traffic warranted. The Western Australian experience is that cheap rail-, way lines are a wonderful aid in developing the country. Reverting to the Postal Department, I think that most of the country members on both sides of the House would heartily concur in some amendment of the regulations which would enable the Postmaster General, in dealing with tlie granting of telephone facilities, to give to the people along those spur lines some of the conveniences which are given to the people in the cities. tainly deserve consideration, and we know that the people in the cities cannot claim that they have been neglected, whilst, on the other hand, it can be claimed that in many instances the people in the country arc neglected. that the export trade of Australia is something like £79,000,000, and that, with the exception of a few thousand pounds, the whole of that trade is the outcome of the development of land, and thb production of wool, wheat, metals, and other primary products, greater considerationshould be 1 given to those who are trying to develop and pioneer the primary industries of the Commonwealth. I hope that the PostD o you think the railway master-General w ill give f u l l consideration to the request I have made^ and that that request w ill be endorsed by honourable I do not know. That members on both sides of the House-. I was interested in the references of the honourable member for Dampier to the possibilities of f r a u d under the present Electoral Act.. If I remember correctly, the honourable member spoke of the door being open to fraud, and the inference certainly was that fraud was practised during the last election. I maintain that if any honourable member knows of an instance of fraud being perpetrated under the Electoral Act ifc is his bounden duty to go before the Electoral Commission that is now taking evidence, and give proof of it. When we find honourable members talking about f r a u d or the possibility of fraud during the recent elections, I would remind them that the amending Electoral B ill of last session provided for something infinitely worse by which the secrecy of the ballot was likely to be destroyed. The proposal of the Government was that the elector should sign the butt of the ballot-paper, and tliat fche butfc and ballot-paper were to bear corresponding numbers by which, as w ill be readily understood, it would be easy to trace the elector's vote, and it ill becomes any honourable member supporting the Ministry to make such references fco fche Electoral Act as the honourable member for Dampier has made when he is supporting a Government thafc introduced legislation that would destroy the He a r , hear! secrecy of the ballot. I support the honourable member for Dampier in his request that the Inter-State Commission should visit Western 'Australia. I frankly acknowledge that we have not in that State as.many industries firmly established as in the Eastern portion of Australia. Prior to Federation there were a number of industries in Western Australia, but the introduction of the Federal system and the abolition of Inter-State duties caused a great slump in those industries.",71,Smith I Shall Certainly Is A Country Of Magnificent Distances Pro

502,Mr Burchell (Fremantle) [9.0],"Now, however, I am glad to say the temporary depression is being overcome, and there are many manufactures in the State, and it would be a good move on the part of the Inter-State Commission to visit Western Australia prior to presenting their report. definite promise of an interim report from that Commission. The Minister of Trade and Customs made some reference the other day to amendments of the Tariff. Apparently his promise was on all-fours with the usual policy of the present Government. They have no intention of attempting to amend the Tariff"" n o w , "" or prior to the double dissolution, which has been Governor General; but at some time in the far distant future they will do it . I believe in what is known as the new Protection, but if under the existing Constitution it is not possible for us to legislate along those lines, I believe that for a new country such as Australia a protective Tariff is desirable. Therefore, it is in the best interests of the country that steps should be taken as early as possible to revise and amend the Tariffi n order that it may be more protective. I have just touched on one or two matters mentioned by the honourable member for Dampieri n order to connect my remarks with liis speech. I wish now to say a word or two about the present situation, To refuse to produce the correspondence that passed between the Government and the Governor General is a peculiar attitude for Ministers to adopt. I cannot understand why the correspondence should be regarded as confidential. The stand I take is that as the community in general will be called upon to pay for the election, there is no reason why they should not be acquainted with the f u l l position, and if the Government have nothing to hide, which is the inference to be drawn from the answers given by the Prime Minister to the Leader of the Opposition, why do not Ministers come forward and lay that correspondence on the table of the House, in order that the country may be enabled to come to a decision? dead-lock, or so-called dead-lock, between the two Houses has been carefully engineered and manufactured by tlie Government.

They were supposed to have been terribly corrupt, and it was said that every evil possible had been indulged in . The Electoral Commission has now been sitting for some considerable time, and, so far as I have been able to read in the daily press, nothing of a particularly startling nature has been disclosed. In fact, those who have been most insistent in regard to electoral fraud have been most backward in going before that Commission and proving their charges. This fact will serve to show the people of Australia that, after all, tliere was not much in the bogy raised after the last election. was a campaign of slander. Prime Minister down.

Truly this is a wonderful record of administrative ability, one which it would be hard to equal. An attack has been made by the Treasurer on the maternity allowance. I was pleased to notice that the honourable member for Dampier included this allowance in his general benediction on social improvement. This is quite refreshing, in view of the bitter attacks that were made on the maternity allowance during the last election campaign, when we were told thafc it was a huge waste of public money, and that it ought not to be permitted. I admire the Treasurer, who is, at any rate, consistent, and now tells the same story he told twelve months or more ago. Wheni n troducing this very SupplyB ill , in relowing he said that, in any case, the paysponse to an interjection by the honourable member for Yarra, the Treasurer said, "" Y o u are very generous with other people's money."" is the idea on the part of the Treasurer and others thafc ifc is criminal, in a sense, to expend money on a maternity allowance. Knowing your humanitarian views, Mr Fowler, I feel confident you w i ll not agree with expressions of the kind uped by the Treasurer, but would rather desire the maternity allowance to be granted throughout the land, without any class di. tinctions. I shall nofc deal with the financial position at any great length. I have again read the Treasurer's speech, and I find that the estimated £21,462,000, while the estimated expenditure was £23,281,000, showing an excess of expenditure of £1,819,000. ciate the point taken by the honourable member for Dampier fchat, in framing the estimate of expenditure, the revenue must necessarily be borne in m in d; but had it not been for the fact that there was a surplus of over £2,600,000 left by of the Government to-day would have been considerably worse. We are told that there will be a surplus of £824,305. This is interesting, in view of the fact thafc fche pre-election statements of our honourable friends opposite were very different indeed from those they are making to-day. We were then told that the Fisher Government had entered upon a 1 ' wild orgy ' ' in finance-that money was being squandered right and left-and one honourable member is reported to have said that sums of money had been frittered away nobody knew where, and that "" contingencies "" accounted for the whole. The statement of the Treasurer to-day clearly shows that the Government Bave not been able to do all they promised the people. They came into power to reduce expenditure, and they met their first Parliament with a Budget thafc provided for an increase of from £4,000,000 to £5,000.000. Yet we are told that the present Government know all thafc there is to know about sound finance! On the 16th A p r i l , 1913, the Minister of Defence, in another Chamber, said, in reply to a question, that approval, had been given to the paymenfc of the money appropriated for increases to Area Officers; and on the 13th May folment to these Area Officers would be made to apply fco fche present financial year. I have in my hand a copy of Statutory Underlying all this Rule 55 of this year, which reached me only to-day, and from that I find that Area Officers who received £ 1 5 0 , excluding all allowances, are now to receive from £150 to £ 1 8 0 . There is, however, a certain clause in the regulation which providesSubject to provision being made by Parliament, the Minister may approve of an increment being granted at the rate of £30 per annum, after three years satisfactory service as an Area Officer, on a certificate from the District Commandant that the duties have been performed in an efficient manner. revenue for 1913-14 was This looks well; but how many area officers were there three years ago, or prior to November, 1913, from which the regulaI appretion dates? Is this simply a means of saving a paltry sum, or is it something with which to gull a certain section of the community into the belief that they are going to get something which they actually will not get? I have to-day received a wire from Western Australia informing me that'ten men were on Tuesday discharged from the works at the Henderson Naval Base, Cockburn Sound. It will be interesting, perhaps, to the Treasurer, and other Western Australian members, to know that the people of that State realize the treatment they can expect from the Cook Government. the 16th April, the Minister of Defence, in the Senate, when questioned regarding Cockburn Sound, said there was work which could be proceeded wifch, and which would be necessary. The honourable gentleman, later, stated fchafc a considerable amount of work would be necessary before the major portion of fche work could be undertaken. there was a ""considerable amount"" of work to be done in April of this year, what is the Minister's idea of a "" considerable amount "" ? Has the work been completed, seeing that the Government are'reducing the number of men engaged? We were told at one time that men were being put on these works for electioneering purposes. Have we now a case of men being put off the works for electioneering purposes? There are only a few men concerned; and I am glad to say, judging from the result of the last election, that, even if they were compelled fco leave the Fremantle district, I should not be affected personally. the Fisher Government went out of olB.ce there were between 180 and 190 men employed at Cockburn Sound, but, according to the return presented by the Honorary Minister the other day, there were, when the return was prepared, only fiftythree, and if ten have since been dismissed, we seefchafcthere are now only forty-three men engaged. Although the Minister has refused to acknowledge that fche Government are going to wait for Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice's report, that would appear to be their intention, or they are trying to save money this year, and endeavouring to avoid the necessity of making financial provision for the work afc the Naval Base next year. The supporters of the Government, by the vote they cast on the Constitution Alteration Amendment Bills, have placed themselves in a very peculiar position; and it is to be hoped that, when they go before the electors, as they will within a very limited time, they will be able to explain what action they propose to take to reduce the high cost of living that is pressing on all Mr Burchell. of us, and will be able to show what they are prepared to do to make the Constitution more workable than ifc is at present. The Attorney-General has acknowledged repeatedly that there should be some alterations; but now, when an opportunity is given to again test the feeling of the people on the question, the On supporters of the Government are found voting in such a way as to show they do not approve of any such appeal. [9.30] -The honourable member for Batman has mentioned my name in connection with a newspaper called Public Opinion. He stated fchafc I and other members formed a company which was If , as the Minister says, promoted to publish this paper for political purposes. I do not propose to speak in defence of any other person connected with the company, but I wish to explain my position in regard to it. One or two months after this Parliament was elected, a representative of the newspaper asked me to take shares in the company, informing me that certain persons were already shareholders, and I took 100 shares, for which I paid £ 1 each. The next information I received was that there was to be a meeting of the shareholders to wind up the company. As I was not a shareholder during the election campaign, and doubt whether there was one issue When of the newspaper after my £100 had been paid, I did not consider that I had any liabilities in regard to tlie debts thafc might have been incurred prior to my becoming a shareholder. I considered fchat I was exempted from any personal liability. trying to prove that he is not a business man ? I was pretty soft in this case. I was informed by the representative of the newspaper that it had a large circulation, but I ascertained afterwards that it had been circulated free. My £100. would not have gone into it had I known thafc before. If I join a rotten concern, and find oufc immediately afterwards that all I am to get from the investment of my money is the right to sign a proxy form in connection with the winding up of the company, I do not consider that I have any personal liability concerning it .

The honourable member for Yarra this afternoon said that I voted for a duty on tea when a member of the first Federal Parliament. were five members of this Parliament who voted for a tax on tea, I being one of them. I admit that I was one of them. The duty was not imposed, because of a combination of the then Labour party with a few Free Traders. must admit that a duty on tea is a revenue duty, and the combination that I speak of thought, I presume, that the finances of the Commonwealth would be -crippled, to the disadvantage of the Government, by the removal of that duty.

532,Mr Manifold,"W h e n it came tober going to refer to the vote on threelegged glue-pots? fer to the vote on the banana duty. Members who had been Free Traders until that duty was proposed then became Protectionists. There are one or two other matters to which I wish to refer. It has been stated by the Labour party that the Liberal party wishes to starve the Defence Department; that in touring the country we have spoken against the defence expenditure, and have proposed that it be cut down. My position in regard to defence is absolutely clear. I stated it when I contested the last election, and I shall state it again on the public platform. We have put the duty of defending the country on the lads and young men of Australia. We have made our boys commence at the age of fourteen years to prepare themselves to defend the country. They have to bear the whole responsibility up to the age of twenty-five years. That being so, the older citizens ought to pay, and pay well. ought to pay? says that the whole expense should be put on the land. owners alone. contention, though I do not know whether they will get enough from the large land-owners. others in their mind. As we ask the boys and young men to train to defend the country, we should provide proper places for them to train in, proper areas for them to train on, and proper equipment. it? going to do it, we had better stop our defence preparations. We older people of the Commonwealth have no right to ask the boys and young men to give up a great part of their holiday time in preparing for the defence of the country, if we cannot find the necessary money. Whether the present expenditure is too great is another matter. In all probability we shall have to cut it down to a certain extent, but not to a very great extent. In my opinion, drill halls, naval bases, and other defence works should be paid for with loan money, provision being made for a considerable sinking fund. But ordinary annual expenditure should be met out of revenue. The Defence Department should not be starved. I hope that the report that the Light Horse is to suffer is not true. At the present time £4 a year is paid for horse allowance, and it is rumoured that the allowance is to be reduced to £3. I hope that that is not so. ful about crediting rumours these days. rumour is not true. At Warrnambool there is a battery of artillery that has been in existence for a considerable time, the men being highly trained. Young men leaving the cadet forces have good opportunities to learn artillery work in that battery; but I understand that provision is not to be made for its continuance. I have written to the Minister of Defence on the subject, and have received the usual reply that "" the matter will receive consideration."" We know perfectly think well what that means. Another matter to which I draw attention is the administration of the old-age pension system. When I first stood for this Parliament, I said I would approve of a Commonwealth old age pension system; but I think that the system which has been adopted could be liberalized. If an old man is allowed the use of a cottage, or given a few shillings a week for doing odd jobs about a place, I think that they have he is not allowed to draw an old-age pension, the Commissioner construing the Act as he thinks best. I have had many cases of that kind before me. Some time ago the Commissioner refused a pension to a man of sixty-eight years of age because he was allowed to occupy a room for sleeping in, and was given 4s. 6d. a week. The result was that the man who had been making this allowance to him had to turn him out on the road. He had to say to him, "" You must clear out in order to be entitled to draw a pension of 10s. a week."" That does not seem to be just or equitable. Then there is the case of old married people who are living apart, but who have not obtained a judicial separation. I know of many such cases where husband and wife have been separated for many years. In one",77,Smith I Shall Certainly Is A Country Of Magnificent Distances Pro

542,Mr Manifold,"I hope that thatcase the couple have heen living apart for t h i r ty years. The woman w ill not return to her husband, who has money, and as there has been no judicial separation, she has not been able to obtain an old-age pension. It may be said that she can sue for maintenance, but if she did so, the husband would at once set up the defence that he was prepared to take her back and to provide a home for her, and tliat since she would not live with him, he would not allow her a penny. I think that the old-age pension system should be liberalized in its application to such cases, or that the Commissioner, at all events, should use a little more discretion in dealing with them. [9.47] I wish to begin my speech by quoting section 83 of the Constitution, which provides thatNo money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealtb except under impropriation made by law. But, until the expiration of one month after the first meeting of tbe Parliament, the Governor General in Council may draw from the Treasury and expend such moneys as may be necessary for the maintenance of any Department transferred to the Commonwealth and for the holding of the first elections for the Parliament. I read this provision of the Constitution because I am constantly being told that if another place fails to grant Supply-, His Excellency can issue warrants, and enable a general election to be held. My answer to such a statement is that it is rubbish. The Governor General has no such power, and if he does issue warrants and permits the money to be spent, he will have to pay it himself. Let me say straight out that if I were in charge of another place, Supply would be granted only from month to month, unless there was an absolute guarantee that there was to be no tampering with the electoral rolls. I have just returned from Tasmania, wliere I found a perfect avalanche of names being swept off the roll. Sir honourable member mean by ' ' tamperi n g "" with the rolls? properly removing the names from them. If we are to have a fight, let it be an honest one. Thousands of names should not be removed from the rolls without justification. In Tasmania, notices of objection are being sent out to men who do nofc know what they mean. I have had them [88] brought to me by men who say that they have been living in the same houses for twenty years, and cannot understand, therefore, why objection should be taken to their enrolment. If the Cook Government wish to do the honest thing-if they do not wanfc to bring down upon themselves tlie maledictions of generations yet to come,fcheywill nofc allowfchissort of thing to be continued. God cursed Egypt, and the very angels flying in heaven are saying, "" W o e be unto the Cook Government!"" I wish now to deal with the Treasurer's Budget story. When fche Fisher Government took office on 30th A p r i l , 1910, they were faced with a deficit of £500,000. We paid it , and we also reduced the debts of, the Northern Territory. We took the currency out of the hands of private corporations, and placed it on the solid rock of the nation's credit. We created the national bank system. True, ifc was a small beginning, bufc we made a start with it . We prepared plans for the building of the transAustralian railway, and we started the work. We also laid the foundations of fche Federal Capital. In our three years of office we gave employment to thousands of men and kept money in circulation. Business men were prosperous, and the rents went up and interest went down. ment came in and ""washed up the dishes."" not even wash them. They threw them out unwashed. Wlien Ave retired on the 25th June, 1913, Ave left the marvellous surplus of £2,643,305. We gave our successors a start such as no Government ever had before. But Avhat is the position today? The Treasurer says he has done the best that he could do in the circumstances, and. that is bad. There is a vast difference between the financial statement Avhich he delivered on the l l t h inst. JOHN FORREST -What does the and his Budget statement of October last. I shall try, in a simple Avay, to analyze the two statements without any prejudice or feeling, because Australia is my coun1 mean im try, and I Avish to see it prosper.

546,Mr Kingo ' Malley,"The y didis when money is in circulation-whe n the nation is prosperous-as it was during the Pisher regime. On the l l t h inst. the Treasurer asked for £3,060,026 for the ordinary services of the Commonwealth, and £800,000 for new works and buildings. gentleman said that the Government had not issued any order that works should be cut down until after the 30th June. I do not like to contradict a Minister, but I think I know something. Let me compare the right honourable gentleman's statement with what was done by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer of the Commonwealth. that capacity he sent for me, as the boss of tlie Commonwealth works show, some time before the end of the financial year, and said, "" Get your undertakings well under weigh; the money has been appropriated, and see that it is expended before the 30th June."" ference between the two parties. Why have not the Cook Government come forward and said candidly, ""We have done the best we could do, and the best we could do was bad""? Instead of saying that they have a surplus of £824,000 on the year's transactions, why do they not honestly admit that they have "" burst"" up the Fisher surplus, and will show a deficit of £3,195,000 at the end of the financial year. After all, it is not a crime. The Prime Minister is a great talker and a mighty promiser; but what has he done? While I was in TasmaniaI had plenty of time to compare the last Budget with the Treasurer's recent financial statement. I was able to do so at night after I had finished my talking, and had completed my work of getting people on the roll. "" repeaters "" ? not believe that 100 people in Australia "" repeated "" at the last election. I think that the people would be too scared to do anything of the kind. In my own electorate at the last election there were several men from Ballarat. I said to them, "" If you have not heen long -enough'in my electorate to entitle you to vote for me, you had better vote for McGrath."" But they replied, "" No ; we are not too sure about our position, and,, by Jove, we do not want to go into the' cooler.'"" The Treasurer in his Budget statement of October last, estimated the current financial year's revenue at The right honourable £21,462,000, and the expenditure at £27,246,747. He estimated a deficit of £5,784,747, which was to be liquidated partly out of the Fisher surplus and partly out of loan funds. While the expenditure of revenue is £834,000 less than the Budget estimate, in consequence of the starvation of public works, it is charged against certain lands required In for defence purposes, while in the Budget it is charged against loan funds. But how can an honest Government say that Mr Fisher's surplus, which was the result of the accumulation of the revenues of 1910-11-12, is an ordinary item of revenue for 1913-14 ? If Mr Grice, or Mr That is the difSargood, or any of those big business men of Australia, were to take capital and utilize it for the payment of dividends, he would be prosecuted under the Companies Act. Mr Fisher's surplus was accumulated national wealth. It was a reserve, to all intents and purposes like the reserves set apart by the banks. and loss. national capital. much about banking as the honourable member does, and I say it is capital. A sum of £200,000 of this surplus is only postponed or deferred expenditure out of tlie fleet item of £1,002,000. How is that a surplus? It is not even a contingency surplus, and if that amount is deducted from the £824,000, there is left only £624,000. I will go on until I get every feather off that alleged surplus. We find that only a paltry £160,000 has been saved out of this orgy of militarism, instead of the half-million which the Prime Minister promised would be saved on the occasion when we refrained from reducing the military vote. The honourable member for Werriwa and several other honourable members would have voted with us, but we did not force a division because the Prime Minister made that promise. That is all the saving that has been made on military defence. On 25th",79,Smith I Shall Certainly Is A Country Of Magnificent Distances Pro

554,Mr King O'malley,"I know asJune, 1913, the date on which the Fisher Government received the royal order of the boot, Mr Fisher's accumulated surplus, which is national capital, was £2,643,305. I did not spend six years in a banking institution in the City of New York without learning something about the game, and I think one would learn as much in NewY o rk as in Melbourne or Warrnambool. cording to the Treasurer's estimate, was £21,462,000. What does one usuallydo when he brings down an item of profit -and loss? He enters it as ""brought forward from last balance-sheet."" The Treasurer did not do so, but commandeered Mr Fisher's surplus as an item of revenue for the year 1913-14. accumulated surplus from the revenue of the three preceding years be considered revenue for tliis year? member w ill have to go to a financial kindergarten. ing mullock. orable member for Henty must not make those remarks. orable member desires to shift mullock he may do so. The present Government commandeered that surplus and called it a revenue item for 1913-14. I say this is a travesty of a balance-sheet. I do not blame the Treasurer; he has got into bad society. The inclusion of Mr Fisher's surplus increased the current financial year's revenue from £21,462,000 to £24,105,305. Supposing that were done by a business man, would honourable members call the result a surplus? I w ill not say what would happen, but this seems to me to be one of those desperate plunges at Hindoo figure juggling, which the ordinary Australian or American does not understand. The"" Cooked"" Government started w it h Mr Fisher's surplus of £2,643,305, and after thirteen months in office, these business managers of Australia-w c were told that all the business men of Australia, all the brains and genius, and multiplicit y of exaltation, were on the Treasury bench-w e find they have arrived at an absolute deficit of £2,019,000. hausting the Fisher surplus, and after the works all over Australia, except those that could not be stopped, have been hung up, and hundreds of men have been made idle, and business allowed to become the worse in the history of Australia. I have never known the business of Australia to be worse than it is to-day. The banks are f u l l of money, but no one wants it . The total revenue, achave stopped. I am going to take another point. If the honourable member for Henty w ill be willing to give a tenner to a hospital, I w ill do the same, if any recognised financial writer in Australia does not call Mr Fisher's surplus capital. Is that a go? bet I made w it h you the other night. H o w can an make a bet, but he can make a present. The honourable £200,000 for the fleet item were deducted, there would be a deficit of £2,019,000. I find that immediately after the 30th June the Government w ill have to cut loose and meet their obligations. And Order ! The honthe deficit is right here. I w ill not say that the Government know it , because I do not know that they are competent If the honenough to know it . L et me take another point. When we get, after the next election, not a shandygaff or nondescript Protection, but a real effective Protection that wil l give employment to our young men and young women in Australian factories, so that the £27,000,000 worth of wool that leaves this country annually wil l be turned into a finished product here, and sent to the other parts of the world to be sold as an Australian product; when we have a diversification of the industries, and Protection helps to develop intelligencea protectionist country is an intelligent country-the revenue of the Commonwealth must f a l l . But assuming that the revenue does not f a l l at the end of the next financial year there will be a deficit of £1,194,695. These figures treat of only expenditure out of revenue.

Whatever surplus remains is carried forward to the next year. goes into a Trust Fund. Just by Parliament, and is unexpended at the end of the financial year, is carried forward to probably continue the works that were authorized in the preceding year, and in that case it cannot in any sense be called capital. It is simply revenue which has been collected in the previous year, and held over to pay accounts on works that are not yet finished. come capital ? comes capital. Commonwealth forbids that. I have carefully totted difference in the Federal Constitution, but mere words in the Constitution do not make any difference in tlie collection and Looking at expenditure of money; you may call it by whatever name you like. The honourable member for Darwin tried to explain that because certain works had been approved by Parliament, and had not been completed, therefore the money voted to carry out the works should be counted as an expenditure. He adds that amount to the ordinary expenditure of the year, and says the deficit is in creased by so much. The thing is so much moonshine. If the expenditure has not been incurred, how can it possibly be added to a deficit to increase that deficit ? Surely as public works are carried into I foleffect and payments made the payments should be debited only to the years in which the work is done. We have heard a considerable number of charges of extravagance on the one hand and the want of means of raising revenue on the other. It is very easy for a Government with an overflowing Treasury to carry out a huge amount of public works and save a considerable sum at the end of the year if anything like judicious economy is practised. The Labour party during their three years of office received £15,000,000 In every more revenue than their predecessors did in the same time. It is no credit to them, therefore, that they l e f t a surplus of only £2,650,000. Parliament did not pass sufficient works to enable them to spend If we all their revenue.

I know of no other banking institution where one man has the responsibility of controlling the funds supplied by the taxpayers. The Governor of this bank has the sole control of its capital. Questions have been asked in this House as to what the manager of the bank is doing, and the Treasurer invariably replies in a way that reminds me of the honourable member for Darwin's famous rubber phrase. If the Minister who is responsible to the House and the country for the conduct of the funds of Australia has no control over the manager of the bank, it is time we realized the necessity of creating a board of control or advice to assist him in running an institution which is now handling several million pounds, and will probably handle even huger sums in the future. These should not be under the control of one man, not because he is not absolutely honest and anxious to do his best, but because the responsibility is too great for any man to undertake single-handed. No , my instrucject to a public audit to which no otlier bank is subject. only to the honesty of the staff. The audit is to keep straight the people employed in the institution, and no one in this House impeaches in any shape or form the honesty of any of the staff of the bank.

The honourable member for Darwin mentioned that the Prime Minister, at the beginning of the financial year, expressed a hope that he would save half-a-million pounds on defence.

The Victorian training ship, which was anxious to get a set of flags, had heard that the Naval authorities had a set for sale, and, having made inquiries, was told that it could have them practically at a sacrifice, because the set was one flag short, and a new set had been ordered. Instead of getting a new flag in place of the one that was missing, the whole lot were thrown out by the Naval authorities, and the training ship got them for a song. Apparently, under the Naval Defence regulations, it is not possible to buy a single flag. I am sure it is about time investigations were made into the details of our naval system, because a large saving could be effected. I feel timi d in approaching my next item. I do not think there will be any cheers. There is a great rush at the present time to get voters on the rolls, and I suggest that the Treasurer, who is short of funds, and has a great deal of expenditure to face, for which he has not fhe revenue, should see that these people whose names are being put on the rolls, but who should have had their names there a considerable time ago, are fined the maximum of £ 2 for not enrolling.

There will never be a satisfactory roll until we issue electors' rights. honourable member suggests that electors' rights can be bought, but I remind him that a man can only vote when he produces his elector's right, which is immediately cancelled, so that there can be no voting a second time upon the facts. I think we it. Every honourable member desires to prevent duplicate voting. It is necessary to have ampletime in order to see that people entitled to be on the rolls have their names registered, and that names whicli should not be on the rolls are struck off, but, unless there is sufficient time to systematically check these I understand that villas costing matters, we have no safeguard against duplicating votes.

The honourable member for Ballarat may know of the Port Fairy election, when Sir Bryan O'Loghlen, the Premier, was very hotly pressed. There was a desire to get as many votes as Sir Bryan's supporters could possibly get, and one man was caught going into the polling booth to vote in the name of Brannigan when the man on the roll in the name of Brannigan happened to be dead. This person was told that Brannigan was dead, but he said, "" Oh no, you are making a mistake. It would be a damn poor Brannigan from Clare that would not get out of his grave and vote for SirB r y a n . "" In regard to the catastrophe that has overtaken us, Parliament, as at present constituted, has met with its just deserts There was no other solution of the diffi culty facing us than a double dissolution, except, perhaps, there might have been a single dissolution, that would have placed our friends opposite in power. With them a single dissolution would be a case of "" HeadsI win, tails you lose."" I ask honourable members opposite candidly what they would think of the Government if I am Ministers had agreed to a single dissolution ? Ministers have done the only thing they could do in the circumstances without abrogating the rights the people gave One them, and allowing honourable members opposite to come over and take the loaves and fishes.

There are technicalities arising in connection with it sufficient to wreck almost any organization. If they were insisted upon, as they are being insisted upon to-day in one case, I am certain that no organization registered in this country could withstand the attack. We need to amend the Act on that account. I do not think there is time in this Parliament to make such an amendment as would be necessary to remedy that defect, but there is time to remedy the defect which has given rise to the crying injustice to which I have referred. The great body of miners throughout Australia are now bitterly disappointed men. They have been disappointed in the promise which the Act held out to them, and in the bitterness of their disappointment what may they not do? They do not understand technical difficulties. They do not realize the difficulties arising from the interpretation of legislation as we realize them-som e of us more than others. In such circumstances, they say, ""The law is against us."" How can we blame them? We can excuse them if they say, "" The law is against us, and, therefore, we shall be against the law."" We could not blame them for taking up that attitude when we knew that the rank and file do not really understand the legal situation. They say, "" We came under an Act which gave us a promise of the betterment of our conditions by law, and now we are thrown ont by that law."" What they may do we do not know; but we hope they will realize the situation. Wo hope that they will start again after all these years, and this promise of peaceful regulation. We hope they will go through the painful process al] over again, will spend their money and their time, and bring their plaint and their evidence. Then, suppose they do, they may say, "" First of all, our employers, wHb say that they believe in industrial peace, will say, ' Y o u are wrongly registered.' We fight them on that, and beat them. Then we enter the Arbitration Court. We fight there for weeks and months, and get our award. Then they take us to the High Court, and we fight there weeks and months again, and may eventually be thrown out again on the merest tech[89] nicality."" This is not right. If the Liberal Government do believe in industrial peace-and I think that in their hearts most of them do-the y will be prepared to amend the Act. I except the Attorney-General because that honourable gentleman believes in Syndicalism. He believes in the mastiff with the blood dropping from its jaws"" our ugly brother,"" as the honourable gentleman calls it . The honourable gentleman believes that preference to unionists ig a blot on the statute-book, and as without it there can be no encouragement of organizations, and without organizations there must be direct action, it is clear that the Attorney-General believes in "" the mastiff."" In my opinion, these things must be remedied. The Government have it in their power to provide the remedy. They say that they believe in industrial peace; let them prove it by doing what we ask them to do. Progress reported.
