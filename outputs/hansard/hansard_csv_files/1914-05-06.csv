3,Mr Groom (Darling Downs,"Minamendment upon the motion for the adoption of an Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General, and by it he accuses this A d ministration of having "" failed to safeguard the interests of the people of the Commonwealth;"" but he and his supporters in their attempts to justify the charge have proved, not that we have failed to safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth, but that we have been alive to our responsibilities, and have done all we can to advance those interests. was levelled against the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs failed. Yesterday afternoon, the honourable member for Yarra, in supporting the amendment, declared that the Department of Trade and Customs, over which I preside, had unduly delayed certain matters of administration. member who should not bring that charge, it is he. Ever since he entered this House he has posed as the archpriest of Protection, and has hardly made a speech without touching on the important fiscal question. I admit the importance of the question, but what did he do when in office to improve the Tariff? which he was a Minister, was in office for three years. During that time it had a majority in both Houses, and could have given effect to any policy that it had the backbone to put forward. In their first session, thc Labour Ministers dealt with certain so-called Tariff anomalies, and they dealt with a few more in the next session, but they did not introduce a large policy of Protection, their plea being that they could not do so until tbey could make sure that the worker would get his fair share of the benefits accruing from higher duties. Yesterday, the honourable member for Yarra boasted that, in dealing with Tariff anomalies, he made dredges dutiable, and increased the duties on pianos, and on several other things. As he could give the Protection necessary in connection with two or three items, why did he not carry out the f u l l policy of Protection that he has always advocated? He neglected entirely to propose any complete revision of the Tariff, and failed to propose whole-heartedly the policy that he has always strongly advocated. When he l e f t office, there remained undealt with in the Department 117 confidential Tariff schedules; there were from 470 to 500 applications from persons who desired relief in connection with Tariff matters, and, speaking from memory, there were the reports of some sixty or seventy deputations. I do not say that all the applicants were entitled to higher duties, but their representations merited consideration. The honourable gentleman did not even go so far as to appoint the InterState Commission. Hadi t been appointed seven or eight months earlier, it could have commenced its investigations sooner, and Tariff matters would then Especially has the charge which have been more advanced than they are to-day. What is the position of this Government in regard to the Tariff? I m mediately we assumed office, we took steps to f u l f i l one of our platform pledges by appointing the Inter-State Commission. It had been announced that the Liberal party would stand by tlie fiscal policy which had been affirmed by the people If there is any honourable of Australia and embodied in our Tariff laws. We lost no time in appointing the Inter-State Commission. On the 8th September, 1913, I sent the following letter to the Chief CommissionerDEAR SIR, In the discharge of its duties to investigate and report generally upon the effect and operation of the Tariff Acts at present in force, I The Pisher Government, of would invite the Inter-State Commission more particularly to investigate and report as soon as practicable upon the following matters :(1) Any industries now in urgent need ol Tariff assistance. (2) ' Anomalies in the existing Tariff which are either technical in character or are due to or arise from the incidence of the taxation. (3) The lessening, where consistent with the general policy of the Tariff Acts, of the cost of the ordinary necessities of life without, injury to the workers engaged in any useful industry. We organized the staff of the Commission, provided it with adequate accommodation, and it got to work as soon as possible. Ever since it has been giving consistent and persistent attention to the matters brought before it , and has now examined no fewer than 320 witnesses in respect of 149 different applications. It has received 463 individual applications, of which 200 are for in creased Tariff assistance, and 219 for reductions of duty, abolitions of duty, or in opposition to increases. In some cases, decreases upon certain articles are asked for in order that the industry concerned may be better encouraged. The applications deal with 213 subjects and with 154 Tariff items, one item often including more than one subject. So far, no application has been based upon grounds of urgency. received a progress report from the Commission ? been, or could yet be, received, because the Inter-State Commission has not been appointed to report upon the industries of only one State.

21,Mr Groom,"This distinguishedHouse was committed. Then, too, the honourable member says that we committed a mistake in remedying a defect; which, he must admit, was in the Labour Government's own Bill. The right honourable member for Wide Bay admitted in this House that it would have been better had the late Government inserted in that Bill clause providing for the collection of the revenue. We collected every penny of the £150,000 of revenue for which they had not provided. But this, after all, is but a minor point compared with the substance of the question at issue. The substance of the matter is that the honourable member for Yarra, without consulting the growers' interests, as Minister of Trade and Customs, increased the wages of the workers engaged in the sugar industry in Queensland. the House-neithe r the honourable member for Richmond, the honourable member for Cowper, nor I-questione d the propriety of the increase. posite did. I mentioned yesterday the names of some of those who did. complain that, whilst the honourable member, as Minister of Trade and Customs, was ready to assist the workers, he gave no consideration whatever to the sugar growers-the primary producers-upo n whom the whole industry rested. Justice was alleged to be done to the workers in the industry, but an additional burden was imposed on the sugar farmers, and the honourable member for Yarra gave them no relief. The Queensland Government pleaded with him for help for the sugar farmers, and we on this side of the House also did so; but since only farmers were concerned, the matter was of no importance to the Labour party. party. be looked after, and they said, in effect, "" Let the other bloke look after himself."" That is their policy. The Queensland Government asked that action should be taken to relieve the farmers; our party also pleaded for assistance for them, and finally the Labour Government agreed that as soon as certain measures were passed by the Queensland Parliament the proclamation should issue and relief should be given to the sugar farmers. The present Government came into power, and as soon as the conditions were fulfilled we took action, and gave to the primary producers the relief which the late Government had neglected to give, as they should have done. The honourable mema ber for Capricornia represents a number of sugar producers, and the trouble, so far as he is concerned, is that he has not been able to show that, since he entered this Parliament, he has doiie anything of value for the farming community of Australia. The honourable member for Barrier has an unequalled record in the Postal Department. There were fewer milestones during his administration than in the case of any other Minister, and he got out of the Department as soon as he found that difficulties were arising, sheltering himself behind the excuse that he was taking control of a better Department-that of External Affairs. His record in that Department is well known. The real trouble with the honourable member for Capricornia is this: Last season showed the finest record for the sugar industry that Queensland has ever seen. Roughly speaking, 2,085,000 tons of cane were produced, and the relief we gave resulted in every grower being benefited to the extent of about 2s. 2d. per ton. In other words, we took action at the earliest possible date, in order that the growers might get the benefit of the legislation passed, and that benefit took the form of something like £225,000 more than they had received in any previous season. During the first few weeks, while the conditions were being fulfilled by the State, we could not give the additional bounty, but, as soon as the conditions had been met we were able to legislate, and, before the 1st January of . this year, to give those growers who had not benefited by the repeal an extra £35,000 in cash, making in all, as I say, relief They are a class to tbe amount of £225,000. If in this Their class party had to Parliament I can, by committing such a mistake, help the growers and primary producers to that extent, I am prepared to accept the responsibility. The trouble is that honourable members opposite have never done anything for the farming population.

25,Mr Groom,"What they did was toagainst the middleman-bu t they offer no practical legislation for their relief; on the contrary, the farmers' and producers' burdens are increased, and they are allowed to stew until they' get relief in the best way they can. I should now like to make some reference to the honourable member for Brisbane. when addressing the House, he prefaced his remarks by expressing the hope that we would regard what he said as purely political-that he had no desire to introduce personalities of any kind-and , therefore, I hope he will take what I am going to say now in the same spirit. If the honourable member wishes to worthily represent, politically, that great constituency of Brisbane-on e of the finest cities in Australia-it would be wiser for him to ascertain, in the first place, whether there is even a shadow of foundation for statements he makes in public. It is very unsatisfactory that an honourable member should go on the public platform, as the honourable member did at Ballarat, and make allegationsI do not wish to mention names-about threats made by the Government, and that, when challenged, he should retort by saying that he did not make the statements as representing facts within liis personal knowledge, b u t that he was asking whether rumours he had heard were true. What sort of personal relations would we have in lif e if , when we heard any scandalous rumours about our neighbours, we circulated those rumours without making any inquiry as to their truth ; and if . when we were brought to book, we pleaded that we'did uot utter the statements as true, b ut were merely asking whether they were true or not? The honourable member for Brisbane, when he was challenged, said that he had intervieweda pressman, from whom he learned that there might have been other causes for the resignation of the Governor General. quoting correctly. the honourable member did sayWhen lie returned to Melbourne and was thing whatever to do with the lighting of interviewed by a pressman, be learned that Cape Moreton; and, therefore, the honthere might have been other causes for the resignation of tbe Governor General One of those causes he learnt might bave been grouud. the differences over the New Year's honour list. rumour with just about as little foundation in fact as had the other one circuthat is so. lated by the honourable member. I remind the honourable member that he takes a very dangerous course when he applauds, as he did, a statement of the Prime Minister that something like fiftyseven persons had obtained enrolment before being eligible. "" Hear, hear! The other day, Good luck to them ! "" was his remark. in order in quoting from Hansard of this session ? merely giving the figures. As a matter of fact, the words were uttered in the debate now in progress, and, therefore, I may quote them, but, as the honourable member objects, I shall not trouble further. slightest objection to the quotation. has no objection; but it is to be regretted that he should publicly applaud the conduct of those who are acting directly against the desire of honourable members on both sides to have clean rolls. Of course it must be understood that I am now speaking purely in a political sense. Then the other day the honourable member referred to the Government as being morally responsible for the lives of those unfortunate men who perished in the disaster off Cape Moreton. The charge, he said, had been made in Brisbane; and no doubt it had, with, perhaps, some little ""colouring. The honourable member said : The loss of tliat ship was entirely due to the absence of a light on Smith's rock or of a sufficiently poworful light at Cape Moreton. As a matter of fact, before the honourable member mentioned the subject. I had drawn the attention of the Lighthouse Branch to the matter, and Captain Hood, who has been in the district and knows it well, reported, after giving reasons: For these reasons there is, in my opinion, ton or its vicinity. land that the loss of the vessel had noorable member's charge falls to the Queensland Government have erected a",14,Kendell

The honourable member for Yarra is quite correct when he says that the State Government should not do this kind of work, whicli now is purely a matter for the Commonwealth. If a light has been erected there, it is against the recommendations contained in the reports of Captain Brewis and Captain Hood. The captain of one of the largest vessels which go to Brisbane discussed the matter with me, and he, too, said tliat there is no necessity for such a l i g h t ; and inquiries show that the loss of the vessel was due to an uncharted rock. The honourable member, before he charged others with being responsible for the loss of human lives-befor e he tried to attach a stigma to the Government-migh t have had the courtesy to inquire at the Department, when he could have ascertained the facts. orable member for Brisbane want with facts? strong for the Prime Ministeri n this case! ber's facts are so exceedingly strong that tlie aroma ought to be sufficient to prevent his touching them again. the honourable member represents a great city like Brisbane, he ought to have realized his moral responsibility to inquire as to the truth of charges before launching them; that is a duty he owes to his constituency, the country and Parliament. pretty safe at Brisbane; he defeated a Liberal Minister. way does not concern me so much as his political honour. The honourable member for Eremantle, speaking very temperately with respect to the Director of Lighthouses, said that while he did not question the capabilities of Mr Ramsbotham as an engineer, he thought a man of nautical or navigation experience should be appointed. I would point out to the Gohonorable member that, though in EnglandT r in it y House is controlled by the T r in it y House Brethren, Sir Thomas Matthews, the Engineer-in-Chief, is responsible for the construction and maintenance of the lighthouses and for the maintenance of the lighthouse service, and acts generally as adviser to the Brethren. It is the same in Scotland, where the engineer, MrD . A . Stevenson, attends all meetings of the board and advises as to the sites of lighthouses, but is entirely responsible for the construction and maintenance of them. In the same way Mr C. W . Scott, the Engineer, is responsible for the Irish lights. In Canada, MrW . P. Anderson, the Chief Engineer, is responsible for the maintenance of the lights, and in France, which has one of the finest lighthouse systems in the world, the administration is controlled by the Engineer-in-Chief, M . Ribiere. In Australia, three of the State officers are not men of the class the honourable member mentioned. I wish now to pass to the charge which the honourable member for Yarra, and other honourable members, echoing h i m very faintly, have levelled at me in regard to the transfer of lighthouses. members echo the honourable member for Yarra when that honourable inember was facts are too the last who spoke from this side of the chamber ? mentioned the matter several times in public.

However, it was again introduced in 1911 by the honourable member for Yarra, at that time the Minister of Trade and Customs.

After the Act was passed the honourable member appointed Commander Brewis to make reports on the location of lighthouses, but if he had been, as he said he was, eager to transfer the lighthouses to the Commonwealth, why could he not have appointed a Director of Lighthouses in 1912, while still allowing this officer to continue making his report ? It could have been done, but the honourable member did not do it. He did not appoint a Director of Lighthouses when he had the opportunity to do so early iu 1912; he let the matter drift on, with the result that when the present Government came into office in July last I found that there was an advertisement appearing calling for applications for the position of Director of Lighthouses. is honest for once he will state the reason for that. He knows that the applications were closed before he came into office, and that the advertisement had to be put in afresh. is quite right in saying that the position was again advertised, but he will admit that, though he had the whole of 1912 in which to make the appointment, the advertisement was not inserted-that is, the particular advertisement on which the Director was appointed about May, 1913. not, completed his report. son why a Director should have not been appointed, and all the preliminai-y work taken in hand. previous Minister eighteen months to advertise ? knows the reason for it. He can state it fully so far as I am concerned. It was to shelter, not myself, but a man who cannot answer for himself. against my predecessor over that matter. I simply say that he could have appointed a Director in 1912 had he desired to do so. We appointed a Director, and he took up his duties on the 8th September, 1913. Pirst of all, he had to prepare for the transfer of the whole of the State Departments, he had to inquire into the organization of those Departments, and into the question of light dues, and to lay down the whole basis of the carrying out of the works that were needed during the current year. The most important feature of the Federal control of lighthouses was not merely to take over the officers and continue the existing lights-the States had been doing that all along-bu t it was the addition of lights-the providing of better lighting on the Australian coast. With my sanction, and with full approval, the Director has given as much attention as possible to pressing forward the construction of all those lights that are necessary for the protection of navigation on our coasts, and the absence of the issue of the proclamation has not delayed in the slightest degree the progress of the lighthouse business. The Director has organized the staff. We have appointed district officers for two of the districts, and they have been to the different reefs and places where lights are to be inspected, and made reports and trial surveys on sites for lighthouses to be built. * All the optical apparatus and the material required for construction have been arranged for. The ketches necessary to assist in the construction have been purchased, and the men who are to carry out the work have been engaged. In every way the progress of the erection of these lights has been advanced by the Director. The light at Wilsou's Promontory has been properly equipped. This work was arranged for by my predecessor, who also dealt with the improvements made to Gabo Island. New lights have been installed at Cape Liptrap and Citadel Island. We are making provision to press forward with the new optical apparati for Emery Point and Fort Point, in the Northern Territory. Surveys have been made, and the material provided. Very soon the staffs will be engaged in the construction of the lights on the Inner Barrier Reef, along the coast of Queensland, at Coquette Island, Dhu Reef, Heath Reef, Tih Tih Reef, Chapman Island, Piper Island, and Gierke Island. Also, investigations have been made in connection with a light at West Point, in Tasmania. We have pressed forward the work of construction in every",16,Kendell

55,Mr Groom,"I am making no chargeway possible, and we have endeavoured to take over the administration of the lighthouses, which is not the easy matter that honourable members might think. First of all, we had to make provision for light dues, and since taking office we have investigated this matter. We wrote to the State Premiers in December of last year, pointing out that, as the Commonwealth were taking over the coastal lignts, it was not right that the States should continue charging the whole of their light dues, which, in the form of tonnage dues, had been imposed on the shipping of Australia and that from overseas, and we suggested to them that they should make a reduction of light dues corresponding to the relief of expenditure which we were giving to the States, so that the shipping of Australia should not be taxed twice for the same service. Of course, if this tax is imposed, it is going to be passed on to the people whose goods are carried, the farmers and consumers, and we do not want that to happen. We do not want an amount in the neighbourhood of £100,000 of unnecessary taxation imposed, and in order to prevent the imposition of those double dues we have asked the States to remit taxation to the extent that we shallbe relieving their exwas passed, that months of careful inpenditure. the Commonweath will have to go ahead and impose taxation to provide for the cost of the service it is rendering. in the long run. do it in the long run, that is no reason why we, as a Government, should not try to see that the right thing is done. That is the stand we take. Incidentally, I want to refer to the Navigation Act. The honourable member for Yarra found fault with the present Government because we had not brought the Act into operation. I say, deliberately, that there is no man in this House who knows more about the. practical difficulties in the way of bring the recent conference for the regulation of ing that Act into operation than does the ex-Minister, who passed the measure through this House. He knows as well as any other honourable member that there are 100 clauses providing for regulations; he knows that every one of those clauses involves more or less expert investigation; he knows there are six different systems operating in Australia at the present time; and he knows that those different State systems have to be brought into harmony, that we have to devise regulations in harmony with the spirit of the law we have passed, and that those regulations will require to be considered by the expert Committee which is provided for in the Act itself. My honourable friend further knows that the Commonwealth will have to appoint its own staff, and it will have to establish relations with the different State officers, in order to find out how much is to be done. should get a move on, instead of doing nothing. ber's statement is not correct. He did not say that we should get a move on, but that we had not proclaimed the Act. said we had not proclaimed the Act. An Honorable MEMBER -I s the Act law to-day? the Act is law, but it is not in force. It was known to everybody, when the Act vestigation would be necessary before the measure could come into operation. It is .easy in this House to pass clauses in a Bill declaring that something should be done, but it is'more difficult, when dealing with the ramifications of the trade of Australia and the Departments of the States, to frame regulations that will bring the whole scheme into harmony and make proper and just working conditions for our snipping. So far as -the Government are concerned, that end is being striven for as fast as possible. Many regulations have been framed already, a mass of material has been collected as the basis for framing the regulations in their entirety, and we are in communication with the Imperial authorities in order to obtain information which will enable us to give effect to the recommendations of the safety of ships at sea.

I tell him now that no one has been appointed. a result of inquiry, that no offer has been made to anybody, and that the whole of the applications are at the present time with the Public Service Commissioner in the usual way.

The application of Captain Davis will be considered conjointly with all other applications which have been made for this position. I desire to make reference now to a matter which, as the speeches of honourable members have iudicated, is of great im portance to members on both sides of the House. I refer to the operations of trusts in Australia. make some general remarks in regard to trusts. On both sides of the House strong expressions of opinion have been made that members do not desire to see trusts, which carry on their operations injuriously to the consuming public or to the industries of the community, carrying on those operations in the Commonwealth; and, as far as the policy' of the Government is concerned, we have never hesitated to declare our hostility to trusts of that description. I think that generally expresses the public opinion of Australia on this matter. But when you come to deal with the problem of trusts, and to decide as to the methods by which your legislation is to be carried out, you are confronted with a problem of a very, very serious character indeed, and one which, in the words of a very eminent American, "" taxes the capacity of the ablest statesmen that provide."" Roughly speaking, the remedies of the trust evil have fallen into three classes. Firstly, there are those who contend that the proper remedy is to restore competitive conditions, so that trusts shall not monopolize any trade or industry, or carry on operations in undue restraint of trade. The second method is to regard the existence of a monopoly I read the paragraph. as the natural outcome of economic conditions, and to assume that the monopoly must grow unti l it gets complete control of particular branches of industry, when I tell him, as the ' State shall step in and provide laws regulating the industry by fixing prices. Thet h i r d remedy which has been suggested is that which has been proposed in .Australia alone, by any responsible body, and that is the nationalization of monopolies. Those are the three remedies which have been suggested. As regards trusts generally, what you have to examine into is the nature of the evil and the trouble that exists in the country. You have to find out what is the cause of the trouble. Then when you have discovered the evil, it was definite and ascertained what the wrong is, you must introduce a law to provide a proper and adequate remedy for the disease. That is the proper method of investigating a problem of this kind. It is not to be solved by mere academic considerations. It involves something more than that ; it means a very close investigation of the conditions obtaining. The TJnited States Government have appointed Mr. JosephE . Davis Commissioner of Corporations in the United States, and have Pirst of all I desire-to instructed him to investigate trust conditions in that country. In the course of a very able and interesting address which Mr Davis ""delivered recently on this subject, he pointed out and enumerated the. various remedies which have been suggested. pointed him ? ministration. Mr Davis says thisThe economic aspects of the problem, to wit: what is the fair, just, attitude of government to the capital invested in and the men interested in and directing these great enterprises, as well as to the public at large, what shall be done to preserve freedom of opportunity for business, is the problem Congress will address itself to in tbe immediate future. Then he saysThere are wide variances of belief as to the treatment of this problem. Some maintain the United States can that the Sherman law, in its present condition, with a few amendments, is sufficient. Others there are who maintain that the Sherman law, even though amended, is negative in its effect, and not constructive in attacking the problem; that what is needed is not only",18,Kendell

Some offer in solution an Inter-State trade commission, to proceed upon the theory that monopoly should be frankly recognised and regulated, even to the extent of regulation and control of prices. Others advocate a similar commission, whose object and purpose, however, sliall not be to regulate monopoly, but to regulate and control Inter-State business in supplementing the Sherman law by aiding the Courts in the restoration of competitive conditions, and in giving force to the decrees of the Court; charged witb the additional power of defining what shall constitute fair and unfair competition, what shall constitute reasonable restraints of trade, and what agreements, now apparently in violation of the Sherman law are not, in fact, in restraint of trade, and should be permitted, together with other similar powers. Still another plan has been suggested which looks to keeping the control of this question more within the province of tbe individual States, by making it illegal for any corporation to do an inter-state business unless the requirements of its charter, granted by the States respectively, should contain certain inhibitions upon the activity of sucb corporation, looking to tbe prevention of the issue of watered stock, to the prevention of interlocking ownership and common directorates, and other similar conditions which are alleged to be the operating causes for the evils of the present condition. I u the U n it e d States the m a g n it u d e of the p r o b l e m is realized, and v a r i o u s remedies have been suggested; b u t the most i m p o r t a n t t h in g is to determine the quest i o n of f a c t t h a t lies in the background. Speaking on t h a t subject, he saysIn the last analysis society is concerned w it h the question of which of the two types of industrial system is the more advantageous to the general welfare. The question resolves itself into whether the monopolistic system of lurge units or the competitive system confers the greatest advantage upon society. The advantages and disadvantages of each are questions of fact, and one of the paramount considerations therein is the question of cost of production. The efficiency of an industrial system w ill bo finally gauged by the people, in a large measure, by the difference in the cost of what they buy; and that system which produces most cheaply, and does not induce other and greater evils than those sought to be remedied, would be regarded as the final economic fact, in a large degree, by the consumer. One of the fundamentalfacts, then, to bo determined is the question of the efficiency of the trust-the question of whether increase of the size of capital and organization necessarily means a lowering in the cost of production and distribution, to the ultimate advantage of the people who buy. He sets out clearly the questions of fact which have to be investigated before a remedy can be devised. The remedy of our friends opposite is the nationalization of monopolies. They consider that the State should nationalize these huge business institutions, running them as Government concerns. The honourable member for West Sydney, who was Attorney General in the late Government, has saidExperience has proved that nothing short of nationalization will serve as a check to these great combines. T h a t is the v i ew of houorable members opposite. The y have also expressed the o p in i o n t h a t it is better to a l l ow the trusts to g r o w as a necessary stage in t h e n a t i o n a l i z a t i o n of industries, w h i c h is t h e i r u l t i m a t e p o l i c y . L e t m e quote the honourable member for West Sydney againWho to-day is able to sell the cheapest-the small man in a humble way, or the great combine or trust that controls, not only the inlets and outlets of industry, but the products and the markets in which they are to be distributed, tlie sources from which are drawn the raw material, and the most up-to-date machinery for dealing with all these that thc civilized world can supply? Obviously not the isolated trader. The individual who has nothing but his brains and a few pounds of capital cannot hope to compete in such circumstances. He addsI t is sufficient here to point out that the Labour party views with equanimity the development of the trust, regarding it as a necessary stage in industrial and social evolution, and preparing the way for a more complete systematization of production and distribution by society for the benefit of the whole people.

In the address of Mr Davis, to which I have referred, the arguments brought against the value of huge industrial concerns are set out very f u l l y ; but the time w ill not permit me to quote them. It is contended that many of these great organizations are successf u l only so long as the original organizing brains remain at the head of them, or so long as the trust carries on its operations w it h in a restricted area, because otherwise there is, as with Government control, too much centralization, with consequent weakness in administration; so that a system which at first created cheapness by its economy in organization, in the end increases the cost of production. It is argued tliat, for various reasons stated, it is inadvisable to allow huge aggregations of wealth to be controlled by a monopoly. ever, the Commissioner saysAt tlie centre of this great system of trusts there is thc question of fact to be determined, if possible. There is now no governmental or other agency engaged in attempting to get scientific information with reference to this fact. It is cliaracteristio of the quality of mind of the President of the TJnited States that he should desire facts upon which to base a judgment. It is the intent and purpose of Theni t adds this very important findthe Bureau of Corporations, aeting under the direction of the President of the United States, ingto make a survey of the industrial field, and an extensive investigation of this subject. come for so radical a departure from the long We shall enter into this investigation with the established policy of the country, and it hopes sole intent of working out, in a scientific and that the time may never come when it will be fair-minded spirit, the facts absolutely as they necessary for the Government to assume the are. So vital and so fundamental is this pro' task of establishing prices for general commoblem that to attack it in any other spirit dities. It believes that the progress of the would be criminal. What is needed is lightnot heat. The problem bristles with difficulfair, ties; it seems a tremendous undertaking. It hitherto will demand an increased appropriation from cannot Congress to enable us to have the men and to compete with each other. There is a sense means at our command. The results of this in which this is true, but it is only technically investigation may not coincide with all that true. What is meant when we use the phrase we hope to procure. We can, however, obtain "" maintaining competition"" is maintaining comsome facts that will at least contribute to a petitive conditions. We can both create and correct interpretation of industrial conditions maintain competitive conditions, and, until as they exist. The President of the TJnited States lays it petition; down as a fundamental basis that, before tial competition tending to prevent undue prices there can be legislation on this subject, and unfair practices. Without going further there must be an economic inquiry to into the issue between regulated competition ascertain the facts. Honourable members iterates its finding that the anti-trust Statute opposite have continually attacked the should stand, and that every possible effort to Sherman law, and have stated repeatedly create and preserve competitive conditions that it is inoperative; that it is useless iWr. Groom, as a means of restraining trusts, affording no remedy against them. But in 1911 Congress appointed a Committee to report upon the operation of the existing laws affecting trusts, and the Committee reported, concerning the Sherman law, that it should stand as the fundamental law on the subject, andThat any supplemental legislation for more effectual control and regulation of Inter-State and foreign commerce should be in harmony witb the purpose of the existing statute. It reported furtherThe Committee will not at this time enter upon an extended argument respecting the policy of maintaining competition or competitive conditions in the business of the country. It is well understood that there are many distinguished students and highly-trained thinkers who believe that the age of competition is past, and that for the struggle which competition involves there should be substituted combination and co-operation, under such regulation and supervision as will protect the people from the oppression of monopolistic power. And added to the students and thinkers who have Summing up, howreached this conclusion through mere observation and investigation, there are many engaged in commerce, and who, therefore, speak from a practical stand-point, who have also concluded that some form of regulated monopoly or concentration should be adopted. All these men, whether theorists or otherwise, admit that if we abandon the effort to maintain competition the Government must undertake, directly or indirectly, to fix prices for the combinations or monopolies. The Committee feels that the time has not yet world depends in a large measure upon that reasonable rivalry among men which has characterized the advances of civilization. It is frequently declared that tbe law compel men employed in like business human nature is revolutionized, when competitive conditions exist, there will be actual combut if for some extraordinary reason that should fail there will be, at least, a potenand regulated monopoly, the Committee reshould be made. Coming back to the three points: the restoration of competitive conditions, the -control of monopolies, and the nationalization of monopolies, the ""United States Committee reported strongly in favour of the existing legislation, but urged that it should be amended in order to thoroughly restore competitive conditions in tlie country. advocated the continuance of the antitrust legislation of the United States of America. regulation of prices, as advocated by honourable members opposite, and the question of nationalization is not even mentioned. ""When the Labour party are faced with an investigation into the question of nationalization of any particular industry, they w ill meet with only a reiteration of the findings of the Royal Commission on the Sugar Industry. ber's party said that that Commission was a biased one. They made that charge before the Commission presented its report. findings. his party now have faith in the Commission; but they said before that it was a packed Commission. Commission, then the importance of its findings in this respect is accentuated. If a Commission was packed by Labour men, and yet could arrive at these findings, what is to be said by the Labour party in favour of nationalization ? mission was packed did not happen to be correct. quired into the suggested remedy of nationalization, and reported as followsAdvocates of the public ownership of industry rightly dwell upon the avoidance of the wastes of competition. But, in the case of the refining industry in Australia, such wastes are negligible. Further, taking into consideration the various difficulties with which public ownership has to contend, and the high efficiency of tlie present refining business in Australia, we do not think that the public ownership of tbe refineries woud prove as financially successful as the present private ownership. It proceeded to give its reasons for holding this view. First amongst these was the cost of nationalization. ""Dealing with the items which go to make up the cost, it reportedThe cost of nationalizing tbe refining industry would involve an initial capital outlay of some millions by the time allowance had been made for the costs of refineries, goodwill, floating capital, &c. To secure a fair interest on this capital outlay without penalizing consumers would, we believe, be difficult, if not impossible. The point is that nationalization, instead of cheapening the costof the articles to In other words, the Committee the consumer, would have penalized the consumer. The proposed remedy, therefore, would be worse than the disease. It would not consent to the Finally the Commission reported in regard to the Colonial Sugar Refining CompanySuch profits' as it does make on its refining are made under existing conditions-condition s which give to its plant a value in excess of earning capacity under the altered conditions which would be involved in nationalization. In the general result we cannot avoid the conclusion that the Commonwealth Treasury would be involved in a heavy financial loss, unless it were prepared to make higher demands on the consumers than is necessary under a system of' private owned industry subject to appropriate regulation. Colonial Sugar Refining Company fixed the price of sugar in Australia, and that there was practically no competition between the refinery companies in Australia. ber's interjection reminds me that the honourable member for Yarra claimed that he had done a splendid thing in raising the wages of the employees in the sugar industry, and that the increase had been approved by the Royal Commission, as well as by the Queensland Court. The facts are that the Royal Commission, however, approved of an increase in wages concurrently with relief being granted to the -grower, and that the Queensland Court only allowed the increased wages after the growers' capacity to pay them had been increased as the result of Commonwealth legislation. I desire, in conclusion, to refer to the Beef Trust. The Government have not been oblivious of the importance of this question, although the honourable member for Yarra, when speaking at Ballarat recently, blamed us for not dealing with the trust.

Early in August, 1912, he knew that the Beef Trust was going to commence operations in Australia. He was in office during the whole of that year, and had a complete majority in this House as well as in the Senate. He was familiar with the law, aud its limitations. He kuew that if the company submitted plans and specifications of its works to the Department, and acted as ordinary citizens, he had no power to refuse its request. He knew the law as it existed witti respect to monopolies, because the Attorney-General had been prosecuting a suit in connection with it. Indeed, on certain aspects of that law he had consulted the Crown Law Department. In view of all these facts, how was it that during all this time, if the law was defective, he did not bring in a Bill to amend it so as to enable liim to deal with this trust?

As I say, honourable members opposite regarded this merely as a piece of political platform work, and never treated it as a serious problem. After the present Government took office special instructions were given to the officers of the Department to be particularly careful in watching the operations of the alleged trusts, and to report on all concerning them. Every important movement that was noticed was examined and investigated, and, as far as possible, the Department has been closely watching events.

The Government fully realize the evil, not only of a meat trust, but of any other trusts which may grow and assume control of the export trade; and, accordingly, two Bills have been drafted, and will be submitted to the House. It has been decided, on the determination of the present motion, to appoint a Royal Commission to make a searching investigation into operations of the alleged trust in connection with the meat industry, with a view to ascertaining the facts and to assisting the Government in the administrative exercise of the powers which it is proposed to confer by the Bills referred to in the Governor General's Speech.

As to the rise in the price of meat, many of us remember the time when the primary products of Australia were practically valueless, and when there was no real encouragement for farmers, pastoralists, or any other producers. Great wealth has come to Australia through the extension of our operations, by means of better steam-ship accommodation other agencies, in the markets of the world, and through the increased price of wheat, wool, and meat. tories do not export, but merely supply local wants, and the millions of money which come into Australia, in return for our great primary products, have helped to increase the wages of the artisans in the cities. The hope of all Australians is that our products may continue to go abroad, and that the added wealth may result in liigher standards of living for the whole nation. Incidentally, of course, we have to face certain consequences. If we export our wheat, and reap the advantage of higher prices in the markets of the world, the farmers must get the advantage; but the wealth that comes to Australia affords employment for the whole of the people. and flour may rise here, and our clothing and meat may cost a little more.

However, these are matters of far-reaching importance, which we shall, no doubt, have an opportunity to discuss later on. I have had prepared for me by the Customs officials in Western Australia and Queensland a return showing last week's prices for beef and mutton in Perth and Brisbane. This return shows that, while the price of the sirloin was 5^d. in Brisbane, it was 7d. at the Government butchery in Perth, and 6d. at private butcheries.

ForA l l is not done yet. top-side, the prices were 4d. in Brisbane, against 7d. at the Government butchery and private butcheries, Perth._ Again, in regard to mutton, legs' sold at 5^d. in Brisbane, against 7d. in Perth at the Government butchery and private butcheries, and loins were selling at 5£d. in Brisbane, against 7d. at the Government butchery, Perth, and 8d. in private butcheries, Perth. I could give further details, but they are not necessary. There may be local causes and operating, but these are the latest figures I could get, and they indicate that, even in Perth, where there is no trust in exisOur factence, high prices can prevail as against Queensland, which is supposed to be r i d den by the trust. I only plead for fairness in the discussion of public questions, that honourable members will analyze things fairly, and get at the truth on the known facts. That is all I plead for. It is the way in which the Department is conducted, and I trust and believe that, from both sides of the House, the Department will receive co-operation in the endeavour to assist the producers and consumers of Australia in relation to her primary industries. explanation in connection with a matter raised by the honourable member concernThe cost of wheat ing the application made by the Australian Meat Company, known by every one to be a branch of the American Beef Trust.

160,Mr Jensen (Bass) [ 4 . 1 2 ],"I maythey would do. Paragraph 2 of the Speech of the Governor General saysMy Advisers consider that under existing circumstances a prolonged recess is not advisable, and that Parliament should be given an early opportunity of considering the best means of expediting the despatch of urgent public business. Are we to believe, from the statements of Ministers and their supporters, that the two. Bills which the Government propose to bring before this House, w it h a view to causing practically a deadlock, are urgent public business? I would like to know whether the m a j o r it y of the electors of Australia consider these measures urgent public business. I see nothing urgent in them; in fact, they both reek with tlie odour of plea of urgent business is nothing but fool those who supported Ministers in 1913. Paragraph 3 of the Speech of the Governor General saysDuring the first session of this Parliament, my Ministers, for reasons which they advise me were beyond their control, were unable to pass legislation on many subjects outlined in their policy statement presented to you on 12th August last. Those subjects comprised Bills dealing with the prohibition of preference or favouritism in Government employment, and the restoration of the electoral provisions for votright for the Government to follow oufc ing by post. It is quite clear to me that the only urgent public business before this Parliament to-day is the two Bills which the Government propose to introduce, and which were brought down to Parliament last session. But how can a B ill be Urgent that deals at the most Avith not more than 3,000 people in the Commonwealth ? W ill the bulk of the electors consider the Government Preference Prohibition B ill urgent business, especially in view of the fact that this Parliament years ago endorsed the very action which was put into effect by the Fisher Administration-that is, granting preference to unionists in the Commonwealth service? Andi t only applies to casual labour. Many thousands in the Commonwealth service are working under the Public Service Act, which is administered by a Commissioner, and this preference to unionists applies to the casual labourers only; but if the Government do go to the country on this question, they w ill again fool the people by telling them that the matter applies to every civil servant in the employ of the Commonwealth. . [ 2 6 ] -a Mr P. P. ABBOTT -We would not mislead the people. the Fusionists to do anything else b u t mislead the public on every question that is before them. I for one would be quite willing, and so would my party, to go to the country if the true question were put to the people, namely, that this preference to unionists is confined to the 2,000 or 3,000 casual employees in the Commonwealth. We w ill help the Government to pass their B ill quickly. I can speak on behalf of my party when I say that if the Government will put to the people the only question that is occupying the attention of the House to-day, we will pass their B ill quickly. But we can""bluff."" This not trust the Government. They will bring forward every possible outside issue a put-up job to delude and in order to mislead the public? That is their game, and ifc is our duty to tell the people whafc the intentions of the Government are. The Arbitratio n Act passed by this National Parliament gives the Court power to grant preference to unionists, and surely if this Parliament thought it right to give the Court power to make that concession fco employees outside fche Government;, thus placing an obligation on private employers, it is also tlie principle contained in fchafc enactment, and mete out the same justice fco their own employees. That being fche case, If a i l to see why the Fisher Administration should have been slandered as they have been by their opponents. Then, in regard to the other B ill which the Government propose to introduce in order fco bring about a dead-lock, namely, that for the restoration of fche postal vote, if the Labour party thought that nothing wrong would be done by our opponents in connection with fche collection of postal votes, we would be prepared to pass that B ill also. Last session we were prepared fco concede all thafc was necessary. The honourable member for Hunter moved to insert a clause which had for its object the giving of a vote fco fche sick and in firm, subject) fco fchafc provision having a responsible person to operate it , so that no wrong should be done. Isi t not a fact thafc, under fche old system of postal voting, half fche votes in the Commonwealth could have been so recorded ? I make bold to say that our opponents discovered what fchey had missed, and regretted that they had not made much",27,Kendell
161,Mr Jensen,"I have never knownmore use than they did of the system, although they used it pretty freely, I admit. the postal vote restored into the Electoral Act in the form in which it was operative four years ago, they would have a chance of continuing in office, because of 3Jhe money power they possess to manipulate that vote. But knowing what wrong tjould be done under that system, the Labour party introduced into the Electoral Act a new system whereby this canvassing method was abolished, and the wrongful obtaining of thousands of votes before the proper election day was blocked. How many people were actually disfranchised by the abolition of the postal vote? the elections of 1913 greater than that recorded at any previous election? face of that fact, can the Government come forward, and say that the electors have been deprived of anything? They cannot; tlie increased vote in 1913 shows that no wrong had been done to any elector in Australia. I am quite willing to g i v e the sick a vote, provided ifc is obmised fche electors. tained in the proper way, and that can only be done by some Commonwealth officer being present, and witnessing fche recording of that vote.

D i d they not promise the farmers, squatters, They know that if they could get and orchardists throughout the Commonwealth that they would amend the A r b i tration Act so that the rural workers would not come under its operation ? That was distinctly promised in my electorate. If the Government w ill bring in a B ill for that purpose it will be a direct challenge to the Arbitration Act as it exists on the statute-book to-day, and the Labour party will assist the Government to test public opinion on that matter. As a member of this Parliament, I do object, however, to being placed in a false position by the Government bringing down a proposal for prohibition of preWas not the poll at ference to unionists, which only applies to a handful of people, although they would In make it appear to the country that the principle applies to every person in the Commonwealth service.

He forgot to mention that there was also a back door. I often see the Prime Minister dodging in through that door myself. If there was one thing more than another that all the Government candidates throughout the length and breadth of Australia told the people during the last campaign it was that they stood for purity of administration. In what way have the Government brought it about? To denounce preference to unionists, which means that all who come in through the f r o n t door come in free, and come in equal, and to tell certain contractors that if they wanted anything on the quiet they must come round to the side, is a very peculiar way of bringing about purity of administration, yet that is the way the Government have adopted. If there is anything that calls for publicity it is the letting of contracts for public works, but that is not how the Government let the Teesdale Smith contract.

I claim to have some knowledge of this business, as I was travelling ganger for a railway contractor for five and a half years, and helped to make up quantities for earthworks, bridges, ballasting, and relaying for many lines in Queensland. During the same period, the honourable member for Herbert was, as it were, in the opposite camp, being what I might call Government inspector. Government in Queensland? ment is the honourable member talking about? you havo always denounced. denounced the same people up to the time that he came into the Federal Parliament. He did so u n t i l "" F a t "" got hold of h i m , and now he is the advocate of the crowd that he used to denounce. member for Herbert get that billet by the side or the back door? competition so f ar as I know, and I can assure the House that he knows something about this subject. If the Prime Minister did not know anything about this contract, why did he not get expert advice? I am sure the right honourable member for Swan could not have been in Melbourne at the time. If he had been he would never have allowed such a contract to go through. As an old hand at the game himself he knew what contractors were to deal with. Let me tell the Prime Minister that he will not be done with Mr Teesdale Smith, even when he pays him up for his contract. There will be a few extras that will have to be paid for. No wonder the present Government like contractors. There are eight or nine H a d the Golawyers in the Cabinet, and they know very well that handing out contracts ad libitum now will mean plenty of grain to come into the granary by-and-by, when the contractors make their claims for extras. The honourable inember knows that, because I read in Hansard many years ago how he denounced contractors for these very practices. The honourable member, however, is bound to do something for the contractors. He promised them that he would do away with day labour if he got into power; but let me tell him that there is no day labour on any of our Australian railway systems. It is all direct labour with the Government. The difference between that and contract labour is that, witli direct labour, you get a better job, there is no scamping, and there are no deviations to be made, or, if any alterations have to be made in bridging, tunnelling, or laying the roads, it is done without any extra expense. In the contracting days, once we started deviating, even if it was only a yard of muck, we used to make the Government pay for it",32,Burnie Wednesday

210,Mr Page,"He got it fairly in openthrough fche nose. members, particularly the honourable member for New England, have defended the price which the Government are paying for this contract. The honourable member for New England said that there were no extras in the contract, and that 10 per cent, had been stopped from tlie total amount to be paid. He did not mention that when the contract was completed to the satisfaction of the engineer that 10 per cent, would haye to be paid. £1,000 that the contractor is putting up, and the penalty of £ 5 per day for delay in completing the works, are mere fleabites. One important point is the payment for the banks, about which there has been so much controversy. My experience is that if we were paid for the muck work out of the side cuttings we did very well. In the whole of my experience-and I put in prices for contractors for hundreds of thousands of yards of muck on different railways in QueenslandI have never once known the contractor to be paid for the bank in addition to the side cutting. The contract price for the side cutting was 2s. 6d. a yard to bank, never 4s. 6d. a yard for taking out of the cutting, and an additional 2s. 6d. a yard for putting the muck to bank. making a little fortune out of this contract. The Government have put forward the excuse that they let the work in this hurried manner because "" T i m e was the essence of the contract."" But what do we find? There is a gap of 12 miles between the head of the road and the portion completed hy the contractor. According to a man who has been there, they have only just started to clear that section of 12 miles. Where is the hurry? That throws that plea to the wind at once. Why was it done? Had they called for tenders nobody could have offered an objection. met, the Minister came down and said that the reason why they were in a hurry to get Mr Teesdale Smith to take on the job was that he had a plant right on hand, and that if a contract was not let within so many days he would take his plant away, and have nothing to do with the work. afterwards that Mr Teesdale Smith had not as much plant there Certain honourable as a wheelbarrow. Here is wher* the lack of administration came in. If the Minister of Home Affairs could not devote the whole of his time to this business, and therefore, had to hand it over to the Honorary Minister, why did he not get the advice of experts who had been at the game? There was formerly in this Parliament an expert who is second to no man in Australia. H a d the Prime Minister consulted this man I am satisfied The in my own mind that no contract would have been let to Mr Teesdale Smith. The way in which the contract was let was most peculiar. There were no plans, no specifications, no sections. Nothing was known about the work when the contract was let. Unless a man has been over the survey, bored some t r i a l holes, and put in some paddocks to know the nature of the cuttings and the banks, how can he know whether he is offered a f a i r price for the work? Let me describe the procedure which was observed by the contractor for whom I worked before he went in for a contract. In Queensland, the contract for a railway job was not settled in a day. On the contrary, it occupied weeks. When the schedules went in, the contractor with the lowest tender was sent for ; the whole of the contractors Why, Mr Teesdale Smith is and their engineering staffs met the engineer's staff and the Commissioner of BailHe will make about half profit. ways and discussed the schedules. In this case, however, there was no schedule to discuss. The contractor was told in effect, "" Go ahead; do as you can ; do as you w ill , and we will pay you 4s. 6d. a yard for the work done in the cutting, and for everything over a lead of a chain and a half we w i ll give you another 2s. 6d. a yard."" Mind you, sir, 7s. a yard is not too much when a man comes to have a long lead on, because he has to pay for the horses and the haulage, and the bank has to be made. A bank that has to be made by horses and drays is worse for the conThen just before Parliament tractor, and better for the Government, than a bank made up by* barrows from the side cutting. If you are going to measure up the bank after that is done, you w ill pay double for it , at any rate, a third more, because you cannot get a solid yard of muck into the space of a cubic yard. The Prime Minister knows that if a skip of coal is taken out it cannot be got back into the hole. When this matter comes to be analyzed by honourable members, they w ill see the terrible mistake",33,Burnie Wednesday

The point is that the relation of the men is direct with the Government. The saving under what we call the day-labour system is made not because the work is actually done more cheaplvbu t is due to the reduction in the cost of supervision. It is not necessary to have an army of inspectors and engineers to see that work under the day-labour system is carried out properly, but under the contract system there must be strict supervision of all work carried out by a contractor. If there is not strict supervision of contract work oh a railway, it will be found that the cost of maintenance will be considerable when the railway is taken over. I have not been over the ground, but I venture to say that it will cost more to maintain the section of the transcontinental railway carried out by contract than it w ill to maintain any section completed under the day-labour system. forgets that the Teesdale Smith contract is only for excavation. of the banks that trouble always arises after a line has been completed, and not in connection with the laying of the permanent way. to the satisfaction of the Engineer-inChief. in-Chief tell how much a bank is going to subside? will not have such trouble with the banks on this section as with those that have been carried out at Canberra. berra is of the nature suggested by the Honorary Minister his officers are to blame for allowing it to be scamped.

The Prime Minister said last week that the present Government treat their workmen much better than did the Labour Government.

The following letter appeared in the Age of the 27th A p r i l , 1914: Sir,-In reference to the transcontinental railway, it is about time that the public knew some of the facts. It is said that day labour is proving itself a failure, but the position is tliat the day labour system is being deliberately strangled by the Government.

Repeated promises' have been made that departmental stores would be improved, but conditions are, if anything, worse now than at any time since tbe line started.

Some of these men have been sleeping on the ground and without tents for over three weeks, waiting for the Department to unwind its red tape. Just before the holidays the riding ganger at the head of the road sent for 60 men.

For the convenience of tbe men and the protection of tradesmen and boardinghouse-keepers procuration orders were allowed right from the start of the job. Now, however, some four-guinea clerk has put his foot on the system, and large numbers of men without funds and without credit have been compelled to leave the works. I know the conditions on these railway works, and I can sympathize with these men. When I was working on railways in western Queensland, I know that many men, and particularly immigrants, were sent out to the works without a tent to cover them, or a shilling in their pockets. They were just dumped down at the rail head to do the best they could. I thought that those days were past in Australia. Surely the Minister can do something to alleviate the sufferings of the poor devils who go out to this line to do a hard day's toil. made into those statements immediately. I can tell the honourable member that what I have done to improve the conditions, and the honourable member will probably approve of it, has been to raise the wages of labourers from 10s. to l is . 8d. per day.

Cash ""subs."" are issued on occasion, wben With the usual blundering shortsightedthe timekeeper "" has t i m e "" and sufficient civility, but the men to whom they are issued must cash them themselves, and in Port Augusta. Fancy giving a man a cash order at a place 60 miles from Port Augusta, when he has to pay to go there by train in order to cash the order, and then has to pay to get back again to his work. Why should he not be able to cash his order at a local storekeeper's or with the people in charge Some of the men were at the head of the road? I think that regulation is a piece of tyranny on the part of the officials of the Department. The writer of this letter continuesA man on formation work was without funds, and worked for three days without food, or with such scraps or sufferance meals as he could get. He then drew a "" sub."" to pay for his meals. As the "" sub."" was only cashable in Port Augusta, and by himself, he lost three days' work to get to the office and return, and was charged 5s. lOd. by the Department for the return journey by the construction train. That is really "" hot stuff""-to give a man an order, knowing that he cannot cash it where he gets it, but must go to Port Augusta; and when he comes back to start work again, to charge him 5s. lOd. for his train fare, in addition to his loss of time. The late Government gave the employees in Port Augusta free firewood, but now the order has gone forth that only "" t h e s t a f f "" are to receive it . This represents a reduction in wages, but it applies only to the underpaid men I shall have an inquiry at the bottom; the high-priced officials are still to get their wood free. These items, selected almost at random from a multitude of similar nature, are given as illustrations. A deliberate nttempt is being made to goad the employees into reprisals and to strangle the day-labour system. This, at any rate, is my conviction Yours, & c , C. I i . GRAY.

I From what I know of Mr Hedges, I am certain that he would have been only too pleased to give the Minister the benefit of his advice. Passing away from that, I I am as satisfied as that wish to refer to what the Government is doing for the producers. Honourable members opposite, especially the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, continually proclaim themselves to be the friends of the farmers, and declare that their mission is to make the lot of the farmers easier and better. I ask them what they have done for the small growers who are uot members of the Dried Fruit Defence Association. If a retailer of sultanas, raisins, or currants buys dried fruits, exJOHN FORBEST -The honourable cept from the association, he loses at the end of the season a rebate of | d . per lb. which would otherwise be paid to him. This prevents the small growers from selling their fruit.

One of the directors of the association told me that it is on good grounds. I said, "" It is a damnable arrangement that a man cannot sell the products of his labour without entering a combine.

305,Mr Page,"I do not wish to be unyears that the grower of beef and mutton has obtained anything like value for his products. I can speak only in regard to the position of the industry in Queensland, and I know that at one time the representatives of two or threecompanies used to go out west and take away stock at their own prices. But since new buyers have come in a change has come over the scene, and those who have fat sheep or cattle for sale are now obtaining fair prices for them. The cause of the increase in the price of beef and mutton throughout Australia is the scarcity of the supply. The trouble is not that too much is being exported, but that tliere are not enough cattle to be killed. of the meat whicli ought to be used locally is being exported. vented? When a man buys a beast he may do what he pleases with it. But having regard to the price of beef in Australia to-day, men are foolish to export so much as they do. The honourable member for New England quoted 4£d. per lb. as the price of a sirloin of beef in Brisbane. It cannot be obtained at that price even ou a Queensland station. I am at a loss to account for some of Mr Knibbs' statistics as to the prices of different comnot send over os. for a ticket merely with modities. I have tried, without success, to obtain different things at the price quoted by him in his statistics. He has, perhaps, been given the wholesale, and not the retail, prices. month before the honourable member tried to buy. some cases two or three months earlier. At the latter end of March last I saw Is. paid in Brisbane for a cabbage, whereas Knibbs at 4d. each. If he lived up there for a time, and had to buy these things for himself, he would be able to tell the people of Australia more accurately what are the ruling prices of various household commodities. The price of meat is still increasing. Mr Denham, the Premier of Queensland, and his Treasurer, Mr sation, seeing that, the people up there Barnes, say that when the operations of the trust compel the consumer to pay increased prices they will deal with it. They can deal with the trust in Australia, but they cannot control its operations beyond the 3-mile limit. Sir George Reid, when in Australia recently, told the public through the press what Swift and Company, Armour and Company, and others in the Meat Combine were doing in London. They are cornering the London market, and it is there that the danger lies. What use would it be to have our cool stores full of meat if the exporters could not sell it abroad? Outside the 3mile limit the trust cannot be dealt with by any of the States. There it has to compete in the world's markets, and if it has the control of the beef supply of the world, what can Australia do against it? Mr W. H . IRVINE -The real danger, as I said, is in London. asked the late Sir Malcolm McEacharn, who was a shrewd business man, for his definition of a trust, and received the reply, "" A trust is a jolly good thing to be in, and a jolly bad thing to be out of."" Tliat, I think, is about right. Those in the combine are having a good time, and those outside are jealous of them. for it. we like it to turn out trumps. No one even sends Ss. to Tattersall's without hoping to draw the first prize. A man does the desire to fill the other fellow's purse; he hopes rather to get something for nothing. As showing the view which the Queensland Fusion Government takes of the increase in the price of meat, and of the operations of the Beef Trust, I shall quote for the edification of honourable members and my many constituents who read Hansard the following telegram from Cairns, which was published in Monday's issue of the Argustion yesterday, Mr White, Minister for Agriculture, said that he had been Bpeaking at Atherton about the great future of the cattle industry. Many people had the idea that because a large company was erecting works on the Brisbane River, it was the cause of the rise in the price of meat. He hoped that the price would go still higher-(sensation) I should think that there would be a senare now paying 8d. a lb. for beefbecause every penny would help Queensland.

When election day comes round, the people will say, "" It is all very well to t r y to evade the issue, but the position is that the price of meat is going up. How do you account for it? We are told that the increase is due to the operations of the Beef Trust."" Mr White went on to sayIf they bad the abattoirs in Queensland they would send beef to all parts of the world, and get more money for the primary producers.

I have now to refer to another matter relating to honourable members opposite who describe themselves as the farmers' friends.

The production of sugar The Minister, however; said The conorable member for Wannon recently told us that the Agricultural Bureau was That is the it would make twu blades of grass grow where only one had growu before.

The only buyer available Anything that touches a constitucame along recently, however, an'd said tc them, "" If you grow more than a certain quantity this year, I shall not be able to take the whole of your crop."" I am pleased to say that there are some men in Australia, even yet. One came to me last week, and gave me the address of some persons who were prepared to take tobacco on sample; and, at my in stance, communications have been opened up between the parties. Honourable members opposite are always talking about looking after the interests of the farmers: but why have they not done something in this direction ? They could afford material benefit to the producers in halfan-hour if they would increase the i m port duty on foreign unmanufactured leaf, and decrease the Excise on colonial leaf. I do not see how the farmers can That is no consolation to be much advantaged immediately by the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau, an institution which, if we believe honC a n the bonororable members opposite, would make a hen lay two eggs where now she lays only one.

Once he.was a On the 1011 census it was shown that the population in Queensland had grown so much faster than that in Vietoria, that the Northern State became entitled to a tenth member, the Victorian representation being, at the same time, reduced from twenty-two to twenty-one. Based on the enrolment on the State rolls for Queensland, it was contended that the Commonwealth rolls for the State named were I heard it for the first inflated to the extent of 53,632. Statisticians agree that the adult electoral population forms about half of the total population. Therefore, if this contention that the Commonwealth rolls for Queensland were overloaded to the extent of 53,632 names were correct, it would mean that tlie population of Queensland was now over-stated to thc extent of 107,264 persons.

SurelyI am nn individual who can think for himself, even if the honourable member for New England cannot. I do say that a trust is operating here, and honourable members on the Government side know it very well. Yet they sit there indifferent to what is happening. They have promised to do something ever since they have been on the Treasury bench. But why are they not politically honest enough, as we are, to tell the people that, until they give the extra power we asked for in the referenda, Parliament is powerless to take steps to check any combine that may operate here? Australia is different from any other Federation in the world, in that this is the one Parliament, called a Federal Parliament, that can be defied by any few financiers who may have enough capital to corner our foodstuffs. It is a bad condition of affairs in this young country, that, though we bave gone in for nationalism, hauled up the flag of Federation, and pointed to the Australian Parliament as the all-powerful institution which is going to lay the foundation of the future nation of Australia, we yet find, after the experience of a few years, and some attempts to deal at law with trade and commerce, that any two or three individuals in the community can defy Parliament, snap their fingers at us, and say, in effect, "" With our money we will run any form of trade we please to the detriment of the people of this country, and Parliament is powerless to interfere with us."" knows there was an Act on the statute book during the three years the Labour party was in power, but was auy attempt made to put it into operation?

Every time a lawyer is beaten, he says, "" If the Judge had only listened to me instead of to the other person, I would have got a verdict.""

The Coal Vend became a different proposition in after years; but the honourable inember would try to make out that what obtained at that time obtains to-day. I say that a combine, whether it be in connection with beef or coal or timber, may run a legitimate business; but when it oversteps the mark, and clashes with the interests of the consumers, Parliament ought to be powerful enough to legislate for the nationalization of the monopoly. Let every one of these combines stand upon its own merits. I wish now to make a few remarks concerning the action of the Government in respect of the unfortunate outbreak in Sydney of that loathsome disease known as small-pox.

I say now that the small-pox outbreak in Sydney has not been eradicated. not wish to dilate further upon this subject, bufc I would like a competent Commission to be appointed to inquire into fche results which flowed from the use of the vaccine which was provided by the Commonwealth authorities for distribution throughout New South Wales. district from which I hail, as many as sixty employees in one business establishment were allowed time off to be vaccinated, and it is a fact that, in most cases, they had afterwards to be taken to hospitals for treatment. To-day there are numerous instances in which disfigurement has resulted, either from the vaccine used, or from the way in which the patients were treated. Their disfigurement is ten times as bad as that which would have been inflicted upon them by the dreaded small-pox itself. This matter is sufficiently important to warrant the appointment of a Commission of experts to inquire into it , with a view to seeing whether good or harm was done by the treatment to which patients were subjected. knowledge of the complaints which have been levelled against the Government for their action in this connection, and I know that the Prime Minister has been challenged by a man who was given up for dead, after he had been vaccinated a man who holds a good position in a Royal Commission to inquire whether he was not ten times worse after being subjected to the vaccine treatment than he would have been had he suffered from small-pox itself. I wish now fco say a word or two in regard to the Teesdale Smith contract. ulterior motives fco the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, nor do I object to him interviewing persons who wish to consult him on public business. We ought not to judge Ministers from that stand-point. We ought, rather, to judge them by their administrative acts. In allowing the exConsulting Engineer-in-Chief to advise him, not only of .the prices which should be paid, and of the conditions which should surround this particular contract, but also of the policy which should be pursued by the Government, the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs exhibited a lack of capacity fchafc I have nofc seen paralleled during the time. I have been in public life. The avowed policy of the Ministry was that this work should be I do done by contract, and fchafc tenders should be called for it . Yet, on the advice of Mr Deane, that policy was departed from, and a contract was let without any tenders being called. The reason advanced by the late Consulting Engineer-in-Chief for the adoption In the of this course was one of urgency. It was pleaded that Mr Teesdale Smith should be allowed to proceed with the construction of 14 miles of earthworks, as expedition was imperative. But the facts which have since come to light prove that there was no urgency whatever. Now thafc Mr Teesdale Smith has almost finished his contract, the rails have nofc been laid within 11 miles of ifc. sence of the contract. by the late Consulting Engineer-in-Chief that Mr Teesdale Smith had the requisite plant on fche spot. As a matter of fact, he had not. He had to get ifc from a place 300 miles distant. He has been paid a fabulous price because the work I am not speaking without was one of urgency, and because he was bound to complete it within three months. Some honourable members opposite are jubilant because he will have it completed within the stipulated period. But the fact that he w ill have done so clearly disproves the assertion which has been repeatedly made to palliate this blunder, dale Smith had to work was hard country. As a matter of fact, viewed as hilly country, it was of the very softest description. Nofc one of the cuttings required the use of a charge of explosives. Most of them could be ploughed out, and I do not impute any the earth scooped. It is true that explosives have been used upon it , but only for the purpose of bringing down larger quantities of material for removal.

Then we have to look at the ingenious way in which that price was increased by the conditions of the contract. We all know that, where a cutting is made, a hollow has to be filled up, and an embankment has to be built. If the contractor cannot get sufficient"" material out of the cuttings to form his embankment, he must get it somewhere. But the Department was so kind to Mr Teesdale Smith that, in effect, it said to him, "" You need not bother about that. We will give you 2s. 6d. per cubic yard to remove the material which you take out of the cuttings to form the embankment in addition to 4s. 6d. per cubic yard for excavating the cuttings."" born administrators. be a sample of the contract system, we shall require no better evidence to put before the people as a contrast to the system of day labour. are the Government paying under this contract? that he had to purchase a considerable quantity of extra plant to carry out his undertaking. I believe that he had. He had to buy a large number of camels, horses, ploughs, and scoops. too. we have to pay the whole cost of the plant that the contractor had to purchase to carry out this work. ThenI would ask if it is not a fact that, at the head of the railway clearing, the Government have a staff of surveyors who are wellequipped with camels, which are being kept in idleness ? These surveyors are waiting for the Government to let a tender to somebody else to carry out the surveying work which they themselves should undertake. They have the plant, the camels, and the men, and yet they are held up waiting orders until the Government are prepared to let a contract to private surveyors who will take their places. My friend the Treasurer used to be awfully anxious about the construction of the line. gentleman wishes to hasten the work, and yet he is a member of a Government which is causing delay after delay in getting this line constructed. Can he deny that the surveyors now at the head, of the line, who are well-equipped, and were getting on well with the workmenmen who are being paid handsomely by the Government-ar e now being kept idle in order that the Government may carry out this craze of theirs to have all the work from top to bottom let to some person or other by contract? in charge of the business. What is the use of asking me ? ister? The right honourable gentleman is the only Minister at the table at the present moment.

These are independent gentlemen, whose policy in regard to the building of railways in the future is to have no contracting, because they find that day labour righ t We had them all in stock, through the piece has meant the saving of thousands of pounds in their Departments. It stands to reason that if a day-labour job is not completed for the estimated cost, or less, the cause must be bad supervision. Given the same supervision and the same conditions, ib stands to reason and common-sense tliat jobs carried out directly by the Departments themselves by day labour are not only cheaper, but infinitely better done than under any other possible system.

372,Mr Watkins,"W h e r e is the Minhonorable members opposite would put on the statute-book a law that would not only prevent, a Minister from granting them preference, but would also prevent any Judge or other independent tribunal, Pederal or State, from giving them a meed of justice. To show what an empty shibboleth this measure is, Ministers know that they have abolished preference to unionists in Government employment by an administrative act, and therefore do not require a B ill to do it . An y succeeding Government can reverse that decision. trying to gull the people. if they are able, to induce the Governor General when he arrives to grant them a double dissolution on a flimsy pretext, such as this measure is. trade unionists not have preference in this regard ? hand to give up their right to strike, and to go to the Arbitration Courtsi n order to secure the settlement of their difficulties. While they give up the only weapon they have ever possessed with which to fight for their rights, surely the Government will not deny them the right to employment after the dispute has been legally settled? those who stand behind them, would, if they dared, and if they thought it was popular, do as their predecessors did before them in days gone by. They would go so far as to deny the men the right to form trade unions at all. They stand up to-day and say, "" We do not object to trade unionism so long as it keeps its place."" sense in which they are really used, mean that so long as trade unionists are helpless, so long as they are content with their conditions, and not aggressive in asking for their rights, the Ministerial party believe in unionism, but directly the unionists attempt to do something for themselves, they say, "" We are against you; you are too aggressive; you are usurping the rights of the employers."" They make all manner of charges, and then t ry to justify their attitude by some flimsy pretext such as I have described. I am positive that every benefit that has been secured by non-unionists everywhere in the industrial world by way of in creased wages, or increased accommodation, or better conditions generally, they have to thank trade unionists for, altliough they never did anything by cash contributions or by their own exertions to help to bring these improvements about. Why, then, should they receive at the hands of this, or any other Government, the same consideration as the men who have borne the brunt of the battle, and paid their share to gain these benefits ? It has always been the unionists who have made the sacrifices in the past, and they have a right to preference, especially if they are asked to give up their right to strike by going to a Court to have their differences adjusted. Just imagine the first act of the honourable The fact is that the Ministry are member for Parramatta, as Prime MinisThey intend, ter of Australia, being to strike a blow at the very men who put him into Parliament on the first occasion! His present attitude is a very striking commenW h y should tary upon his political career. Senti n to Parliament, as he was in the first instance, You ask them on the one by the miners' pennies and the miners' work, his very first act as PrimeM in ister is to say, "" I am against preference to unionists."" When he was the miners' paid secretary, he dared not settle any strikes without every man having absolute preference and going back again into the mine. When he sat as delegate to the Australian Miners Federation The Government, and under my presidency, and I went abroad adjusting and settling disputes, P* can imagine what he would have said to me if I had come back to the council and reported that I had adjusted even one dispute without getting absolute preference for every man who was out on strike at the time. That is the man who is now at the head and forefront of the antiThose words, interpreted in the preference movement. He wants to make us believe that he thinks differently today on the question from what he did fifteen or twenty years ago. He does not really think differently, but his position is different, and he has altered his views to suit his position. Whatever the outcome of the present situation in this House is, nobody will be more ready to welcome an appeal to the country than myself. I think that tlie appeal should have been made before this session began at all. I have always thought the House unworkable since the last election, and everybody knows that that is so. The Government are tryin g to hold on to office and to twist the situation in order to serve their own party ends. That is a degrading spectacle for any Government or party to offer. They are helpless so far as doing anything in this Parliament is concerned, and they know it . Knowingi t , they should agree to a dissolution of the House, so that the people, who are the final arbiters, may have another chance to adjust the position in Pederal politics. in the contention of the honourable member for Barrier that there is plenty of work to do? had shown at the beginning an earnest intention to do any work at all, the position might have been altogether different, but they did last session just what their programme shows that they are going to do this session. "" We are going to tear the Constitution to pieces. in such a way that the Governor General will give us a double dissolution on questions affecting only 2,000 men on the one hand, and a mere detail of the electoral system on the other."" ture to say that the framers of the Constitution when they agreed upon the sections governing deadlocks between the two Houses never dreamt that any Government would be so insane as to ask for a double dissolution on a flimsy pretext of thafcokind. They had in their minds a possible struggle between the two Houses on some measure embodying a vital principle. duced a measure governing the whole electoral machinery of the Commonwealth, it might have been called a test question in reality, b u t the postal vote is simply a detail of our electoral system, and ifc will be an extraordinary stretching of the Constitution for any Governor General to say that upon either of the measures which are to be pub before us by the Government/, fchere is such a disagreement between the two Houses as to warrant a recourse to the deadlock provisions of the Constitution in the sense in which their framers intended them to be used. before us, I shall offer no unnecessary obstruction to them, but they w ill get from me the criticism which they so richly deserve, and the people of this country w ill be made aware of the true position which the Government occupy.

If this practice is initiated during this brief session, it may form a precedent for similar action later on, and opportunity which has hitherto been provided for the discussion of private members' business may disappear altogether. Mr Bo YD -There is always a greater number of private members than of members of the Government, and they w i ll be in a position to protect their rights. the Government should objectfcogive two hours and a half a week to private members' business when, by doing so, they will maintain the privilege which private members have hitherto enjoyed, without encroaching upon the time tbe Government require for the transaction of Government business.

The honourable gentleman tried to under-estimate the value of the time hitherto devoted to private members' business. I can call to mind, since I have been in this Parliament, many motions, originally moved by private members, which have ultimately resulted in the passing of Acts of Parliament. A motion moved by a private member broueht about the greafc inquiry into the administration of the Postal Service.

If the Government are going to give way on this question, and set apart time for private members' business, I hope that they will decide that the House shall sit four days a week. But if they propose to go on with the business for which we were called togetlier, thus' early i u the year, to deal, I trust that .they will see that the whole of the time is devoted to Government business. Let me deal for a moment with the question of whether or not the carrying of the motion would be a precedent for the abolition of private members' business. ber of private members is largely in excess of the number of members of the Government, and no Administration could insist upon monopolizing, indefinitely, the time of Parliament for the consideration of its owu business, if a majority of honourable members favoured the setting apart of time for the consideration of private members' business. There always would be, under normal conditions, a majority anxious that private members should have an opportunity to bring forward the grievances which they desired to ventilate from time to time. But of this motion would not interfere with grievance day. sion which takes place on a private member's motion, if it leads to anything at all, results in the Government taking u p the proposal, and, later on,submitting a B ill to give effect to it .

I , for one, although a supporter of the Government, would not tolerate the monopolization of the whole of the days in an ordinary session to prevent private members being: allowed to discuss matters from time to time. But on this particular occasion the Government have a definite purpose in view, and I think that they ought to adhere to their determination. I hope there are honourable members who still believe that it is honourable to be connected with business outside. to a member who lives in No r t h Queensland? member is at a disadvantage compared with a member who lives in Victoria.

I trust that honourable members on both sides who believe that the business of Parliament can be done in three days of the week, and who believe that we ought to be afforded an opportunity to attend to our own business, w ill vote with the Government, irrespective of party. It is not necessary to debate the question at great length, seeing that the honourable member for Henty has used arguments sufficiently strong against the proposals of the Government. We are sent from all parts of Australia to do the business of the country; and in order to meet the convenience of a few honourable members, who live in four of the States, we are asked to make this change, regardless of the inconvenience that may be caused to those who come from the more distant places. bers ? who w ill be convenienced are a m a j o r it y ; but, being a majority, they ought not to use their strength to the disadvantage of others. tage is there? that in time; the honourable member thinks more quickly than I can. speak.

From the first mention of it , I have expressed my opposition to this proposal. Rightly or wrongly, I am sent here by the people of Brisbane to do the business of Parliament, and I think other measures could be adopted to get through that business in a shorter time. I do not, however, think that the plan now proposed w ill help us very much. From a personal point of view I shall be very glad [27] to have an extra day, because I have any amount of correspondThat ence and departmental work to attend to. I am prepared, however, to give the fullest possible time to the business of Parliament, so that we may gefc through ifc at the earliest possible date, and return to our homes and constituencies. I am utterly opposed to the proposal, particularly at this stage, because it means fche elimination of the private members' opportunity fco put their views before the House. There is a feeling creeping over the mind of not only the people of Australia, but of the people of most civilized countries, that the party system is on its trial, if it is not, indeed, already sentenced to death. Party government has practically outlived its usefulness. The only opportunity that members now have, apart from their association with any particular party, is that presented by the time devoted to private business. If the motion be carried, private members will have no other standing in the House than that of members of a party, or a part of the machine, A few honourable memjust as honourable members like to view it. We shall have no rights outside No doubt those our party, by which the whole of our movements will be directed.

I shall deal with of the House, submit the proposal that is down in my name. As to the importance or otherwise of private business, I am prepared to say fchafc, although the motion I hope to have the honour of moving to-morrow may be considered of no importance, it is only a matter of a few short years when it will be accepted and adopted by the Governments in Australia. One can understand the desire of the Government to push forward their The best days I own particular business, but they must not forget that, however unimportant private business may appear to tbem, ifc is of prime importance to individual members. Every honourable member who puts a motion on the paper thinks it worthy of, at any rate, some consideration ; and the fact that other honourable members do not remain in tbeir places to hear the speeches, is no argument against the quality of tbe business.

It is a wonder that administration is carried on even as well as it is, because of the lack of opportunity Ministers have of attending to their Departments. to Ministers will be more than counterbalanced if private members are to be deprived of their privileges, and thus degraded to the position of mere puppets in the political machine, while the system of party government that will grow out of such a condition of affairs will be to the great disadvantage of the parliamentary institution. MrJ . H . CATTS (Cook) [9.31] I am prepared to sit whatever days are necessary to do the work to be done by Parliament. The question of how many days the House should sit is primarily one to be settled by Ministers, who know the time that will be required to do the business to be brought forward, and it is not for honourable members of the Opposition to object; though I suppose the less business the present Government do-if it is the same as they brought down in the past-the better we should like it. However, I cannot see any advantage that the proposal will give to those for whom the When, howalteration is supposed to be brought forward. Honourable members now have Wednesday morning and Thursday mornI cannot undering on which to conduct their correspondence and transact business that can He says he is opposed only be done outside the Chamber. As parties now stand, the almost continuous attendance of members in the Chamber is necessitated, and those who take copies He also complains of of their correspondence cannot write their letters in the Chamber. The Labour party hold their weekly party meetings on Wednesday mornings, while I understand the Government party also hold weekly party meetings. As the Opposition must continue holding their party meetings on the Wednesday mornings, honourable members from New South Wales must still leave Sydney on the Monday evenings, as they do now, while those who live in Tasmania will be in the same position. As a matter of fact, I do not think they those who clamour the loudest for fewer sitting days are those who live almost No; because of continuously in Melbourne. MrJ . H .

If honourable members supporting the Government propose to give But the advantage up their party meetings and allow M i nisters to conduct the whole of the business of their party, and to have no say in the matter themselves, simply coming into the Chamber and recording their votes like machines, well and good; but Opposition members insist on taking part in party meetings, and on understanding what is to be the attitude and action of the party in the Chamber. The only difference the proposed change w ill make in regard to Sydney members is that, in order to attend the party meetings on Wednesday morning, they may cool their heels in Melbourne on Tuesday afternoon and evening.

The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is also interested in private members' day, and he, no doubt, will rise aud let honourable members know the faith that is in him. posed alteration, not so much because I ' am against any lessening of tlie days of sitting-that being, as I have said before, a matter for the Government to decide; and if they say that the necessary work of Parliament can he done in less time, that is their concern-bu t because in the way in which ifc is submitted it will not give members the relief it was said would be given. The only members to benefit will be the gentlemen who occupy the front seat on the Government bench. They will be relieved of one day's sitting in the House, when their actions and policy could be subjected to criticism. Then, of course, there is the encroachment upon private members' time. In view of all those circumstances, I propose to vote for the amendment moved by the honourable member for Kennedy, and if that is defeated I shall vote against the motion. Several references have been made during this discussion to various matters, and I , for one, am very anxious to see very drastic reforms made in the procedure of this Parliament. We should curtail, not only thc days of sittings, but also the length of speeches. I am of opinion thafc the standing order referring to the length of speeches requires some considerable amendment in the direction of shortening the time for which members are allowed to speak. Minister prevented that from being done when it was proposed. did is one thing, and what I think on the subject is another. For my part, I am anxious to see the Standing Orders further amended, so that speeches will be even shorter than they are at present. I enter my protest against the system of party government which is at present in force, and I have no hesitation in saying that it will not be long before that system will be completely abolished, and another substituted. The present system has outlived its usefulness, and some other form of government-wha t form I am not prepared to say-wil l be brought into existence. I am convinced that the people of Australia will nofc tolerate the present method of procedure, and the shameful waste of time that is taking place in this I object to the proChamber. In the course of a few years they will take control of this Parliament, if Parliament is not prepared to do the work which the people created it to do. I am prepared to support the Government in this matter, if their motion is accepted; hut if there is to be any curtailment of Government business, I shall favour a continuance of the practice of sitting four days a week. I am convinced that the people of this country are dissatisfied with the actions of Parliament to-day, as they have reason to be dissatisfied, and in future they will amend the governmental system, if Parliament itself does nofc amend it for them. I think it only right that I should place my point of view before the House. No one has ever accused'me of neglecting to look after my constituents. When I was approached and asked if I would waive my motion, I strongly objected. Then it was represented to me that I might be acting the part of the dog-in-themanger, and I said tliat if every other member was willing to waive his business I would not be a dog-in-the-manger, but would make a strong appeal to the Government to consider the question of an amendment of the divorce law. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition has made a suggestion that, instead of private members being allowed four hours for their business, as at present, they own Prime should have two and a half hours on, say, Thursday morning. I think the honourable member for Kennedy made a mistake",60,Chapman Wh Y Are You Colonel Rykie Ho W Do You Know How

483,,"Mr FALKINER (Riverina) [9.56]urged on our party the necessity of submitting such a motion last session, and 1 renewed my efforts on the first day of the present session. The idea, therefore, that the Government have been actuated by any ulterior motive goes by the board. I was in a hopeless minority in my own party until I learned from some members of it , who are supposed to be on specially friendly terms with members of the Opposition, that a great number of the latter were also in favour of it. It was only then that my own. party decided to endorse it . Personally, I do not think that the Prime Minister has gone far enough. My own idea is that we should sit three days a week, and that the Government should curtail questions without notice, and devote that time to the business of private members. If we cannot sit on three days a week only, we ought to sit the whole of the week. large number of honourable members were' elected to this Parliament who have private interests to attend to, and the electors have never expressed the opinion that they should sit here day after day and absolutely neglect those interests. As the majority which either party will probably have in the future is likely to be a very narrow one, we shall be required to attend here upon every sitting day. days a week honourable members w ill have no time in which to attend to their own business, and the result will be that we shall get a class of professional politicians whom the country does not want. Those of us who have interests outside of this Parliament require a certain amount of time to look after them, and the electors who sent us here are willing that we shall have it . If the proposal to sit three days a week is not acceptable to the House, I am prepared to meet upon four days a week. happen to have upon the business-paper two notices of motion which I regard as important. I should like to hear that tbe Prime Minister intends to set aside a few hours on Thursday morning, or on some other day, for private members' business; but if the Government decide that this shall not be done, I shall vote against the amendment even though I have two notices of motion on the business-paper. I promised that I would support the motion, and shall keep my word. [10.1] -It is a strange thing that time should be occupied in a great Parliament like this in discussing a question of this character. Many years ago we could have had our salaries fixed at £1,000 a year, but honourable members were scared of their shadows in those days. I remember when the thing was all right, and the very men who voted against the increase of salary all went out of public life. The great people of this country do not want men to work themselves to death. I believe in taking everything that comes, and if it comes too swiftly then I dodge it . When I look round it seems to me that it would be easier to sweep back the waves of the ocean than to silence the political martyrs who are too much afraid of their own shadows to do anything. What are A t the last elections, a^ they frightened of? No other Parliament in the world works more than three days a week. Most of us are now travelling toward our immortal home, and are we going to work ourselves to death for a few years? What, after all, is private members' business? I never got a motion through this House yet, and it w ill be thirteen years on the 9th of this month since I gave notice here of a motion dealThat being so, if we meet four ing with old-age pensions. It was thirteen years since I gave notice of a motion to allot, an area of 1,000 square miles for the Pederal Territory, but I never got the motion through. There are honourable members here who always do their best to throw out motions of that kind, and it is a farce to talk about this matter. We can adjourn the House and have a battle over the thing if it is not working right. In fact, it seems to me that patient listeners stimulate eloquence. No matter how this matter goes, I intend to vote for three days sittings a week. [ 1 0 . 5 ] I am rather surprised at the proposal coming from the Prime Minister, for I have a vivid recollection of h i m assailing the late Prime Ministerf o r having the temerity to move that private members' business be done away with towards the middle of the session. We have practically not more than started the session, but the Prime Minister now wants to wipe all private members' business out.
