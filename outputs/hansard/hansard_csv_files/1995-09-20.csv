I am very pleased to see, as has been the practice in recent times, this chamber being made available for the discussion of reports of this nature. As we all know, when there was only one chamber, the motion to take note of a paper was really almost farcical inasmuch as we may as well have added 'and be consigned to the garbage bin', because in fact papers never were aired. Of course, the papers represent substantial work. This one was done mainly by the department but many are done by committees which put in extremely large amounts of work on hearings and reports. They are designed as an essential part of our democratic process whereby people in the community are given the opportunity to express a view through parliamentary committees of various natures. Those reports are of considerable value and the more exposure they get in this place the better, whatever the subject matter. I would just like to put on the record my approval of this process that is now available and I hope that my support for that is evidenced by my presence here today. I also have an ongoing interest in industrial relations and remind the House that my maiden speech was on that very subject.

Nevertheless, one has to push one's own points from time to time. members that it is out of order to read newspapers in the chamber. industrial relations system that contained a bit of flexibility; in fact, you could read into it the argument for enterprise bargaining. I made those arguments from long experience-close to 25 years-of employing people in a large range of industries, including the transport sector. It is interesting to note that enterprise bargaining is as old as the process of employment. When we did not have unions and awards, enterprise bargaining was the only arrangement available. I have lived in a business environment of award structures, and I found that those people whom I wanted to employ usually wanted an enterprise bargain. I never found that the truck driver on line haul wanted to be paid the award. If they walked into your place looking for the vacancy that you had advertised and you said, 'I pay the award', they would say, 'Thanks very much' and tum round and walk out again. They did not want the award. They did not want the restrictions that it placed upon them; they wanted an enterprise bargain.",129,Oless Will Not Be A Direct Supplier Of Services But Also Open Up A Range Of Other Opportunities In

265,Mr Tuckey,"Anybody who goes back to that speech will find substantial pleas for anMC 1388 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 September 1995 Strangely enough-and I know it is anathema to many union bureaucrats-the simple fact was that in the transport sector on line haul the truck drivers mostly wanted trip money. They wanted trip money because it allowed them some flexibility in getting from A to B-some might argue more quickly than they were allowed. It allowed them to meet their commitments and to earn good money if they could fit in an extra trip. In most freight situations you find that there is a load in one direction but not necessarily in the other: it is known as back loading. The drivers were very happy if they got an incentive for back loading and-surprise, surprise-they usually found a back load. If they were under the award, the truck came back empty. The union in that industry is held up to the community as being both powerful and influential, but out there on the ground the fellow who drives a truck in those sorts of situations was always anxious to strike an enterprise bargain. That was even more notable in our more remote areas. The people who chose to go there were of a more enterprising nature. Naturally they were not looking for an enterprise bargain that reduced their opportunity to earn money; they wanted an enterprise bargain that allowed them to earn more money. More importantly, they were able to get it. As I said in relation to back loading, in every case the deal recognised that the guy who owned the truck needed to make a profit to stay in business and create jobs. These fellows all understood that; they were the salt of the earth. I never could work out why people so loved driving a truck. In later years I was able to say to two or three of them, 'Would you like to own this truck?' They said, 'How could I do that, I haven't got any money?' I said, 'I'm quite happy to advance you in business, I'll guarantee your loan.' I did so on a number of occasions-being one of those villainous bosses who extract everything from the worker. I put four or five fellows, who had given me good service for three or four years, into a truck and let them subcontract to the business with which I was associated. As it was a cooperative, I was a director and not an owner. To the best of my knowledge, a number of them are still doing extremely well. One fellow was a Maori, and he and his wife were two of the hardest working people I have ever met. She could drive the truck better than he could-and did. These were the sorts of people whom I saw through five or six years of their business until they could stand on their own two feet. Not one of them let me down. They were the people who were willing to go into enterprise agreements, and willing to grasp the first opportunity to be an owner of a truck-even though this generally reduced their disposable income. They had to meet the payments on the truck, fuel tax and sales tax, and everything else associated with running one of those businesses. Prior to the last election we worked out that those costs were about $2,000 a week. There has never been a time when enterprise agreements were not in fashion; they just were not formalised. We now have a report on enterprise agreements in their formalised sense and I wish to make a few remarks about that. I want to repeat something I say from time to time. I have referred to it a little alreadythat is, this business of villainous, grasping bosses, which is the only sort of rhetoric which our trade union bureaucracy uses to defend their existence, to defend their salary structures and to defend their right to a living. They say, 'We have to protect you from those villainous employers. ' Wednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1389 As we know, we have 800,000 or 900,000 small businesses in Australia. It is argued that, if they took on one extra employee each, they would wipe out the unemployment pool. We know that is easier said than done. I would say 95 per cent of that group could never be categorised as villainous or grasping. They are frequently, and on most occasions, one of the workers. You can go into many of these workplaces around Australia and have some difficulty identifying the boss, because he looks awfully like everybody else in the workshop. If he is in shorts and long white socks, he is not the boss; he is the visiting salesman. These people are employers of a huge percentage of the Australian work force. They are on equal terms with them and frequently, as I just mentioned with the owner-driver truckie, have less disposable income than many of the people they employ. They also have a huge appreciation of the value of good employees, the ones who tum up to work regularly, are innovative and are committed to the work ethic. For the only reason that they do not want to lose them, they tend to pay them over the award. In other words, they have an enterprise agreement and it reflects those people's good performance. Every time we hear about this unfair dismissal law, it presupposes the bosses get to work every morning, particularly this group of small employers, and say, 'Who can I sack today? Ha, ha, ha.' Scrooge! businesses which had to retrench staff in large numbers. I talked to one bloke who cried about that situation, not just because he was asking people who had worked with him for many years to leave, but because he saw them as his major asset which he was obliged to dissipate. He saw it as having to sell the land on which his factory stood. He was more concerned how, if he survived the recession we had to have, he would recover this wonderful asset. He knew as he let them go that they were not going to go on the dole. They were the people who would find another job because they were good at their job and he was paying them over the award. He had an enterprise agreement with them going back decades and he shed a tear for those people and for himself because he knew what he was losing. These are the points I make when I hear this mythology that every employer is there to rob you, exploit you, and you therefore need a trade union involvement and an enterprise agreement. That is a lot of rubbish. The truckies never said, 'I want to apply for a job with you, Mr Tuckey. I want trip money. I want an enterprise agreement and, by the way, can I call up Billy Smith to come and hold my hand while I deal with you?' They were all about six feet tall. Their feet were nearly as wide as their shoulders. They did not need any help. If they had been dissatisfied with the way I was running the business, they would have given me a bit of advice on that too. There are thousands of these workers around the place. They have always got a job. They change them from time to time and they do not need anybody's help. They know their value, they know the market and they know what they want. They do not need any of this help. Consequently, they get to the point where, in terms of enterprise agreements, they find it all a bit of a joke. It is worse than that because on 20 March 1995 Deakin University put out the results of some interesting surveys done by a masters student, Glennis Hanley, under the supervision of Associate Professor Alan Hope in the School of Economics. I do not think Deakin would be considered a right-wing university. They pointed out some very interesting things which I would have thought was a great message to the trade union movement.",131,Representatives Main Committee

267,Mr Tuckey,"During the recession we had to have I talked with people in certain smallMC 1390 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 September 1995 The research found that, while the union members tended to be satisfied with traditional union issues, an important factor affecting a unionist's satisfaction related to relationship or communication issues, such as never seeing the trade union representative anymore. These issues included listening to members' concerns, keeping members informed about union affairs and giving members a say in how the union is run. 'The importance placed by unionists on relationship issues suggests that, with the larger union structures following amalgamation, rank and file members feel distant, even remote, from union hierarchy,' commented Ms Hanley. Another important finding of the research was that 40 per cent of members claimed that they joined the union because of either a perception of compulsion or actual compulsion. Of the remainder, only a small group, around 13 per cent, could be described as union 'idealogues' committed to the values of trade unionism. The research also revealed that, given trade union membership has fallen from 51 per cent of the employed work force in 1976 to around 35 per cent today, a significant proportion of union members, 40 per cent in this study, may be described as reluctant conscripts. A more realistic estimate of committed union members may be, in effect, about 25 per cent of the employed work force. Everything involved with this report, and the government's legislation, in terms of the value of that operation, is guaranteeing that group-the union bureaucracy-a place in doing deals for a very cynical work force. And, as we can see, most of them thought they joined the union to buy a job. I think that is one of the more disgraceful aspects of Australia today-the fact that people are still obliged to buy a job. In fact, coming back to those truckies, I have seen them come back to the industry four and five years later and be obliged to get a union ticket in order to pick up a load. They are then told that they owe five years of union dues, because when they were last in the union they did not write a letter withdrawing from the union. I think that too is outrageous. They had to buy a job at a price of $1,500 to $2,000. I think that that is an issue that might be the subject of a parliamentary inquiry. Ms HENZELL (Capricornia) (10.18 a.m.)-As usual, you could drive a truck through the comments made by the member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey). The only example he could use of people who might be affected by workplace reform was that of the six-foot muscle bound truckie. The report we are talking about-Enterprise bargaining in Australia-summarises the issue up to December 1994 and it has some important findings for the new industrial relations measures that are being brought in by this government. I would like to refer to the report that we are debating today. I think some of the gains made are important. Overall, the findings of the report suggest that the period covered by the first report was characterised by a significant growth in enterprise and workplace agreements, particularly in the federal industrial relations system and in the service sector, with bargaining spreading across a large number of industries to cover a majority of employees in the federal system. Workplaces with new federal agreements were distinguished from other forms of agreement, because they were likely to deal with more issues, more likely to reward employees for putting in extra effort and hours, less likely to exclude groups of employees from their agreement, more likely to result in consistent wage increases for all employees, more likely to be seen by women and part-timers as giving them a fair chance to have a say in bargaining and more likely to be seen by women and part-timers as making them better off. This was in comparison, of course, with formal agreements in state industrial relations systems; the new federal agreements have advantages. To quote from the summary report, the federal agreements: Wednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITfEE MC 1391 · had greater coverage, and more effective representation of male and female employees · were perceived as showing generally better outcomes in terms of productivity, product quality and reliability, performance against external standards, operating costs and profitability · were less likely to record a deterioration in management/union cooperation as perceived by employees · were more likely to provide pay increases for employees, especially female and part-time employees · were less likely to be perceived by employees as having made them worse off. However, the report also notes some general dissatisfaction with workplace change. This was referred to in comments made by Mark Davis, in an article in the Financial Review, in response to the report. In spite of some of the very positive gains that the report mentions, to quote Mark Davis's report: The outcome of workplace change is often viewed negatively by employees, particularly in places where management fails to consult with its workforce. That is, obviously, a key issue of enterprise bargaining. There has to be effective consultation between management and workers. He goes on, in hIS review of the report, to say this: While collective agreements are estimated to cover 69 per cent of employees under the federal system, they cover only 21 per cent of the entire workforce because of the lower penetration of bargaining in workplaces regulated by State industrial systems. The report found that the most common workplace changes introduced last year were new technology, changes in work organisation, new training opportunities and employee performance appraisal. The report says negative perceptions amongst employees reflect an ""intensification"" of work and higher levels of pressure on workers, with most employees saying they were putting more effort into their jobs than in the past. I think that that is a key issue. Certainly, we recognise that the really quite radical changes made to the workplace-through enterprise bargaining and, in many workplaces, through structural changes-have resulted in a rise in concern, not only about future job satisfaction, but also about security of employment. That has also come out of the recession. To quote, again, from the summary report: A particular area of concern arose from evidence of employee dissatisfaction on several issues across all types of workplaces, whether or not they had agreements · there was a significant decline in satisfaction with management, perceptions of weakening job security, widespread increases in stress and growing dissatisfaction with employees' ability to balance work and family life · employees were almost as likely to think that workplace changes had made them worse off, as better offso it is about fifty-fifty on that· attitudes to workplace bargaining were more positive than attitudes to workplace change more generally, with employees in workplaces with new federal agreements substantially more likely to report they were better off than worse off because of workplace bargaining. While there is obviously this background of widespread concern about the changes that are happening in the culture of many workplaces-with many entrenched attitudes having to change and with concern about the future and job security-the evidence would indicate that, in fact, the enterprise bargaining arrangements that we have put in place have had a significant effect on the confidence of workers to feel that they can actually negotiate more effective arrangements with employers. But that involves the ability to handle the arrangements. Certainly, one of the key factors, as I have said in speeches before, is the ability of management to consult effectively, because MC 1392 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 20 September 1995 we now have much more on-line, face-to-face arrangements in workplaces. We should remind ourselves that our Industrial Relations Act now covers certified agreements-negotiated between employers and unions representing employees-and enterprise flexibility agreements, or EFAs, made directly between an employer and employees, provided that the majority of employees approve. It is very important and very significant for workers to remember that the major difference between ourselves and the opposition is that underpinning these quite radical changes is a commitment to an award safety net provision. It is important for us to remind ourselves of what those particular award safety net conditions are. They include minimum weekly wage rates; overtime and penalty rates; relevant leave loadings, for example casual leave loadings; four weeks annual leave; parental leave at test case standards; cumulative sick leave; two to three days bereavement leave; jury leave; the 38-hour week; termination, change and redundancy at test case standards; superannuation; public holidays; union right of entry; dispute settlement procedures; equal pay; and industry appropriate standards which vary from industry to industry. On the other side of the ledger, what are the opposition offering in comparison? We are not too sure now, because they keep changing their particular goal posts. We are not sure that the real agenda about Jobsback has ever really changed, and I believe that the ideological commitment of the current Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard) has not changed. From what we can understand from their public comments, what is left of Jobsback is rigid and will be seen not to have changed. But we can specify that the only part of the award that the opposition is prepared to support is a single unspecified minimum hourly wage rate for adults, and another for juniors; four weeks annual leave; 12 months unpaid leave for natural mothers; and 10 days non-cumulative sick leave. There is no recognition of industry standards. colleague from the opposition benches. There is a major difference between the government and the opposition. What we have delivered under the Accord is a commitment to the nodisadvantage test so that, when workers go into a bargaining situation, they know that they will have access to advice from their union delegates and they know that, while they are negotiating increased productivity trade-offs for increases in wages and conditions, there will be a bottom line that will not be affected. And the evidence indicates, from those that have been registered in the federal system, that they simply have not been add-ons to the award provisions, but have been genuinely striven-for improvements to the awards; and we have actually had increases in productivity. Looking at the general situation, workers have to be very clear that, if they are to be seduced by the generalised and insubstantial rhetoric from the opposition, they will be cutting away their award conditions and the safety net. That is very important. I gather that the opposition spokesperson, Mr Reith, has suggested that the coalition will introduce a no-disadvantage test. But we are not really sure what it will mean. It will not be a safeguard on award conditions but, as the minister said, a trapdoor to lower wages and employment conditions. I am afraid to say that I do not feel reassured by the shadow spokesperson on industrial relations.

We will include that, and I thank myWednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1393 Australian work force, at the end of the day, will be prepared to jettison what has been built up over a 12-year period: an Accord that has delivered wage security, low-inflation and sustained economic growth, and which has delivered two million jobs in the last 12 years and a substantial improvement to our whole economy. That is what is going to make the difference for workers and their families. It is important to indicate that our industrial relations policy has delivered the lowest level of industrial disputes in 50 years, even under collective bargaining with a sanction-free bargaining period. We have 60 per cent of federal award workers now covered by enterprise agreements with productivity offsets and four to five per cent annual wage increases. Under the Industrial Relations Reform Act and the Accord we have been able to decentralise the wage system while maintaining fairness in the process. Part of that is to make Australia a more productive, cooperative and competitive society. That is what is going to deliver advantages to families. All the rhetoric in the headland speeches will not change that. In talking with some of my coal mining constituents recently on a visit out west, the following point was made to me. I think it is pretty telling. A comrade said, 'Look, in the 1970s and the early part of the 1980s, I spent more time out on the grass than down the pit because we were forever battling with management. In the lifetime of the Labor government I've been able to get on with the job at my workplace. We've negotiated massive workplace reform without the necessity for prolonged disputes.' Honourable members may remember that the current Leader of the Opposition was the architect of the housing dispute that saw coal workers out on the grass for weeks on end. As I have often said, the coalminers of Blackwater have not forgotten the fact that John Howard precipitated a riot. They have not forgotten it; they have very long memories. The coal miner that I was talking to said, 'I don't want to spend the next five to 10 years out on the grass. I would like to complete my working life and then retire and have the benefits of the wages and conditions that my union, the CFMEU, the mining division, have been able to negotiate for me with management.' Coal workers have provided huge changes and made major differences to the productivity of that industry. We are still working on the AMH dispute. It is at least something to say that we have an industrial relations commission providing the backing for those workers and ultimately, I believe, the rights of the workers will prevail against a multinational. our South Australian colleagues the members for Bonython( Mr Martyn Evans) and Makin( Mr Duncan), particularly, in this instance, the member for Bonython who, prior to his life in the federal parliament, served in the South Australian government as the Minister for Health. Both members will be familiar with what is a popular view in South Australia right now, that is, that the current Minister for Health, Dr Armitage and, I suspect, his counterpart, the Minister for Education and Children's Services, Mr Lucas, go home at the end of the day rubbing their hands in glee because another hospital or school has been closed or spending on health and education has been constrained in some way. I think that is a lot of nonsense, that both of those ministers find themselves reluctantly participating in this sort of reform and wish that the sort of pressure that they are obliged to put on the taxpayers' dollar was not necessary. I open my remarks in this manner because the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) suggested that there was some sort of glee on this side every time workers are, in some way,",136,Representatives Main Committee

Just as I suspect my state colleagues do not go home gleeful when they find themselves obliged to exercise government restraint, so I want to reassure the Main Committee that the objectives that the government has for employee and employer relationships are largely reflected by the opposition. Sometimes I suspect the opposition is wrongly seen as simply reflecting the view of employers. In fact, it is made up of a group of people who want good employment relationships and good employment conditions for employees in Australia. At the great risk of boring you, since I suspect you heard this remark from me in the House of Representatives chamber earlier this week, I would point out to the Main Committee that what the government and the opposition have in common when it comes to enterprise bargaining and employer-employee relationships is one very significant factor: not that the government represents employees and the opposition represents employers-which is nonsense-but that we all happen to be parents of children who are seeking employment in Australia. I no more want my children caught up in an exploitative time frame and exploitative work conditions than anyone in the government wants theirs in that position. I have vested an interest in continuing good employee-employer relationships in Australia. The member for Capricornia has suggested, as government members sometimes do, that the government has some sort of monopoly on enterprise bargaining and employer-employee relationships. I pick up the comments by the member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey). I suspect that the whole concept of enterprise bargaining was in existence long before the present agreements were in place. The whole concept of enterprise bargaining is, frankly, something that suits the Australian workplace and the Australian work ethic. In my own experience in rural industries, shearers have always been a part of some form of enterprise hargaining. They choose to work on a contract rather than at an hourly rate because of the opportunities for remuneration that that offers them. I know that is particularly true in the transport area, as alluded to by the member for O'Connor. Transport drivers deliberately choose to enter into a trip rate rather than an hourly rate arrangement. They deliberately choose transport operators who will pay them above the award. And they deliberately choose to enter into some form of loose enterprise bargaining so they can negotiate such things as back loading in order to maximise their return. The operator is pleased to entertain them because he wants that truck loaded and because, frankly, enterprising employees are the very people he wants to employ. I am not one who suggests that out there in the workplace there are not some trucking operators who would be exploitative, given half a chance. Of course, there are. Sadly, that is part of human nature. But they are in the minority. Furthermore, I have witnessed-I could not say first-hand because I have never been a truck operator but I had produce on the truck that was affected-the retaliation of employees who have felt that a particular truck operator was in some way being exploitative. I well recall getting a phone message to the effect that the tomatoes that I had produced and that I thought were on a truck destined for the Melbourne market were bound for Hobart, across the ocean, and were about to be left in Hobart. The truck driver had chosen in his own retaliatory way, having got to Melbourne and feeling that he was being exploited by the truck operator, to put that truck on the Empress a/Tasmania and leave it there. That did not please me and it did not please the transport operator, and I guess it is a very poor illustration of enterprise bargaining, but I applauded the determination shown by that particular employee to hold an exploitative employer to ransom. Wednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITfEE MC 1395 There is not, on this side of the House-as is popularly imagined-some sort of desperate anti-union feeling. I suspect that most of the members of the opposition have themselves been the members of a union of one form or another. I am too, if belonging to the South Australian Farmers Federation constitutes belonging to a union. It certainly does inasmuch as I see that the opportunity for cooperative and collective bargaining strengthens my hand. I am comfortable with that and I welcome the existence of unions because of what they do for the bargaining power of employees. It seems not to suit the government to recognise that on this side of the House there is widespread recognition of the value of unions. All that we are saying, in reflecting on this report, is that the concept of enterprise bargaining is not of itself something new. In fact, particularly in rural industries, enterprise bargaining has been a fact of life for years. As someone who came out of a labour intensive rural industry, I can indicate to the Main Committee that as a business we always paid above the award because we wanted to, because we wanted to keep in place our valued employees who were making a real contribution to the business. Furthermore, while the member for Capricornia suggested that the member for O'Connor had only been successfully involved in enterprise bargaining because the truck drivers with whom he was negotiating were six feet tall and three feet across, that is not quite fair of the member for Capricornia. The reality is that I have been engaged in enterprise bargaining with grape pickers who were as petite as the member for Capricornia and were still successful bargaining operators because they knew that I had a crop that I wanted to pick, and I knew that they had the capacity to be cheerful employees and I would happily pay above the award in order to achieve that sort of cooperation. That was an unstructured form of enterprise bargaining. The concept of enterprise bargaining, far from being something on which the government has a monopoly, is something with which the opposition is entirely comfortable. It is wrong to create the impression of a them and us mentality about enterprise bargaining. The opposition is not anti-union and, frankly, we are anxious to enter into the sort of cooperation with employees keen to work that enables the total enterprise in Australia to be enhanced. Current enterprise bargaining agreements in Australia tend to take two forms: either certified agreements between the unions and the employers, or enterprise flexibility arrangements which are entered into between the employers and the employees. The significance of the secondary one is not that unions are excluded but that there is an opportunity for employers and employees to enter into independent negotiations if they so choose. The opposition does not seek to exclude employees from any of these arrangements. In fact, as I interjected to assist the member for Capricornia, the opposition seeks to ensure that existing minimum wage arrangements are retained, that occupational health and safety arrangements are retained. We have never walked away from the obligation that all employers should have to pay overtime, leave loading, annual leave and sick leave, and never has the opposition suggested that the superannuation arrangements currently being negotiated should in some way be abandoned if the opposition were to come to power. We are comfortable with the concept of enterprise bargaining and with the arrangements that have been entered into and we welcome the opportunity for employees to choose whether",137,Representatives Main Committee

Furthermore, one of the things that ought to be celebrated by all Australians is the fact that in this nation, under the present government, we have a safety net that ensures that exploitation, while it can still occur-Blind Freddy would agree with that-at least is minimised because society at large says that everyone should be entitled to some form of safety net if employment is not available to them. No-one in the opposition has ever suggested that that safety net should be pruned. For too long it has been too easy for government members to suggest that opposition members simply sit here seeking a chance to be exploitative in the way they deal with employees. Frankly, in my own experience and in the experience of those colleagues with whom I have spoken on both sides of the House, I think that is a quite unfair misrepresentation of what it is that motivates the opposition. I have but one desperate plea as a member of the parliament and as someone involved in the debate on industrial relations, and that is to ensure that we do not put in place those requirements that are a deliberate disincentive to employers to employ people, because I consider the exploitation of unemployment is also something that every Australian should be conscious of. In unintentionally making it more difficult to employ people, we instantly ensure that those people live lives that therefore are less purposeful than would be the case if they were in employment. The member for O'Connor has made the point that there are 800,000 small businesses in Australia and that if in fact they were able to employ more people that would mean a more competitive and productive economy, and there would be a real impact made on the existing levels of unemployment. In my concluding remarks, I will quote briefly from the report. In the conclusion to the summary of the report, reflecting on what the public servants dealing with enterprise bargaining in Australia have achieved, it says: Many of the changes that were observed, for better or worse, in Australian workplaces were changes that would have occurred anywayand I think that is significantBut it also appeared that there were some patterns that distinguished Part VIB agreements from other types of agreements, and these comparisons were summarised in the conclusion. Part VIB workplaces, compared to other non-VIB agreement workplaces, were: more likely to reward employees for putting in extra effort or hours; less likely to exclude groups of employees from the agreement; and less likely to provide for different rates of pay rises for employees covered by agreements. Those objectives are ones which both opposition and government would laud. The concept of enterprise bargaining is not of itself a unique panacea. Rather, it reflects the way in which Australians generally would like to enter into agreements between employers and employees in order to maximise the productivity of the workplace. That additional productivity augurs well for the future of the balance of payments figure in Australia and for the opportunity to have a more competitive and more lucrative Australia in which all Australians will want to live. Enterprise bargaining in Australia, but first I would like to take up some of the points that have been made by those opposite. On occasion, on both sides of this chamber we resort to",139,Representatives Main Committee
275,Mr Griffin (Corinella) (10.47 A.tn.),"We are here today to talk about the report entitledWednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1397 rhetoric in respect to the positions of our opponents and also we possibly laud our own positions; however, there are a few issues I would like to take up. As the member for Wakefield ( Mr Andrew) is still here, I would like to address some of his comments. I do not think that, generally, on this side of the House there is a view that the opposition-in terms of the views of individual members of the coalition-is totally antiworker, or that it wants to drive down working conditions. I have friends who are members of the coalition whom I respect in terms of their commitment to the views that they hold and their basic wishes for this society. However, the question really gets down to the results of policies. The question also gets down to just what the policies are. In terms of the Liberal Party, and of the coalition as a whole, we have to look at what its policy has been in the past and what its policy is now. Elements of that policy are now being dragged out-and it is almost like pulling teeth-with respect to industrial relations. They have made a commitment to the no-disadvantage clause, although to an extent it is rather vague in comparison to the existing government's position. Historically, in terms of Jobsback, the coalition also has a position on things like the basic reduction and erosion of award conditions, with, for example, the $3 an hour award wage proposed by the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard). Conservative coalition governments in various state jurisdictions are also doing some fairly extreme things. Their intention may not be for those actions to have extreme results but, coming from Victoria, and not wishing to labour the point about the Premier, the fact is that when you look at what is occurring in Victoria with respect to ordinary workers, and the conditions they face when they go to work every day, there has been a real impact. People come into my office every day of the week, as they do to the offices of members opposite. I do not know whether only people associated with the Labor Party come to my office and only people associated with the coalition go to their offices, but we seem to be hearing very different stories. Quite often, people come to my office who are in a situation where they have been subjected to a form of abuse with respect to their working position because of changes in the state award system which have severely impacted upon them and their families--wen with respect to their take-home pay. Certainly, when I speak about the question of the coalition's policies with respect to these issues and their result, I bear no ill will to the members opposite in personal terms. WhatI worry about is the actual result of those policies. No matter how well founded they may be in terms of theory and no matter how well founded they may be in terms of the members' personal views and their ideology, the fact is that, as we see happening in states like Victoria and Western Australia, those policies are just not working. I would take up another comment by the member for Wakefield with respect to his example about the truck being left on the boat. I can also quote some examples of personal experiences when I was working on a station in New South Wales, longer ago than I care to remember. The circumstances were that I was driving a tractor and I was getting three bucks an hour. I found out subsequently, about six months later, that every other worker on every other farm in the surrounding districts was getting five bucks an hour. The only way I was able to address that issue was to pull on my own personal little strike at the time we were about to plant the wheat, and that was quite effective. I guess it could be called enterprise bargaining; I guess that at the time. I saw it as being militant industrial action on an individual basis. In those circumstances it did work, and in those circumstances it was necessary. MC 1398 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 20 September 1995 The person I was employed by was not a bad fellow, but the view he had related to his circumstances and the position that he held with respect to the business. The circumstance with many employers is not that they are bad-and I do not think that they are-but that they have a very clear and abiding commitment to their business and to what they are doing. That tends to give them a perspective which relates to their position and that is understandable-it is totally understandable. However, the question is: does that in the end mean a result which can be worse for workers than it should be? The answer there, I think, is yes. Also when we look at the question of what is seen as a fair and reasonable claim, whether it be through enterprise bargaining or through other forms of action or negotiation, the fact is that it is always better to look back, and see what was fair or unfair historically-to see how unfair it really was-rather than looking forward. Historical claims are always easier to understand and to accept. I have had numerous occasions where, in years gone by, as a union official dealing with employers, I have had the argument put to me, 'But we can't afford this.' That is often the case: no argument, that is often the case. But on quite a few occasions, in circumstances where we have reached an agreement on the basis of what the employer said was something that was not sustainable, I have gone back to that workplace 12 months later or whatever, and the fact is that it has been affordable and it has been achievable. The employer often is prepared to agree that was in fact the case, but then give you the same answer about any future claim you may make. Again, that is understandable from their position. With respect to the circumstances of the individual truck driver and the boat, I guess that enterprise bargaining in the more formal sense, as this agreement discusses, is about avoiding those sorts of circumstances. It is about having a situation where, if an employer and an employee do n.egotiate on a formal basis, we know what the ground rules are, we know where we stand. The circumstances are then that we do not have forms of industrial action of that nature taking place, or, if they are taking place, certainly they are on a much reduced level. That is one of the successes of the government's industrial relations reforms over the yearsand they have evolved in various ways-that there has been a major decrease, a historical low in industrial action. I know that there are other issues relating to that. There is also the question of the overall impact of the recessionary period; there is also the impact of job losses in particular industries. That has all, I suppose, created additional fear in people's minds about maintaining their jobs, and about their willingness perhaps to take action. It has also meant that areas of the work force that are traditionally not heavily unionised have grown while others have decreased. We are seeing a situation, over the last three years or so as the recovery has occurred, and as employment has improved in many of those industries, where industrial action is still at a historical low. I do not think you can say it is one or the other totally, but I think that there has to be some recognition given to the fact that the government's accord process, the negotiations and the reforms within industrial relations have had an impact. Both the member for Wakefield and the member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey) commented that enterprise bargaining has always occurred. Agreed. No doubt about that. I guess I would say that much of what we do in this place-and I think it is the intention of both sides in terms of their beliefs-is regulate, to an extent, the operation of the economy. There are arguments about how far that regulation goes, and there are also circumstances where different variations on the theme occur. But the fact of the matter is that we are partly about trying to regulate Wednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 1399 the operation of society, and the circumstances of enterprise bargaining are such that there has to be a situation where there are more formalised approaches taken in general. The real issue is not the question of the six-foot truck drivers, or the very articulate smaller people who are, in fact, able to use their skills to good effect with reasonable or sometimes unreasonable employers. A work force is a very varied and different area, and people often require those sorts of regulations and rules in there to assist with the processes of agreements with employers. As a former union official and, I suppose, someone who has followed the classic sort of hack development that is often pointed out by the coalition with respect to Labor Party politiciansnot that is has done me that much good-I have often dealt with employees whose real problem has been a lack of knowledge with respect to their rights and a lack of understanding about how they work. I am sure that has been the experience of those opposite also. In those circumstances there is a need to articulate those views. In a situation such as the one in Victoria, where basically the guts of the rule book have been thrown out, the end result is that employees feel even more exposed, more unsure of what they are entitled to and more able to be taken advantage of, often by people who, I stress, are not seeking to take advantage of them. The employees are merely in the competitive environment of industrial relations, which has existed for an awful long time. They are endeavouring to maximise their own benefits from an involvement in the productive process while employers are about trying to maximise the benefit to them and their business with respect to profits and therefore income. That is understandable, but it does require regulations for the process. The Enterprise bargaining in Australia report is the first comprehensive review of developments in bargaining at the enterprise and workplace level. It covers a nine-month period from 30 March to 31 December 1994. The report was prepared by the Department of Industrial Relations and draws on several sources of information, including the department's formalised federal workplace agreements database, which contains information on federal enterprise agreements formalised by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which commenced operation in the period under review. The workplace bargaining survey 1994, which is the largest work based survey of both managers and employees undertaken in Australia to date, conducted nationally at 1,060 Australian workplaces with 10 or more employees, was another source of information. Research was conducted within and outside the department, including an analysis of transcripts and decisions from Australian Industrial Relations Commission hearings. Consultations were conducted for the report with a broad range of organisations with an interest in enterprise bargaining, including employer organisations, the ACTU and unions, groups representing women and ethnic communities, other community organisations and relevant government agencies. There· was also consultation with the sex discrimination commission and the Affirmative Action Agency. The report reviews developments under part vm of the federal IR Act which has two types of enterprise agreements: certified agreements negotiated between employers and unions and enterprise flexibility agreements made directly between an employer and his or her employees, provided a majority of employees approve. The report concentrates on developments in the federal sphere but does provide some comparative data on workplaces in the formal state systems and workplaces with unregistered agreements. MC 1400 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 September 1995 A number of messages come out of the report. I will be brief, given that I have probably spent too much time discussing the comments of previous speakers. The first message is that overall the extra protections for employees introduced through our legislation are having a positive effect. Bargaining under our federal system is fairer for employees. The comparative data within the report shows that, compared with other forms of agreement, new federal agreements are more likely to result in wage increases for all employees, and that women and part-timers have seen it as giving them a fairer chance to have a say within the process. More employees in workplaces with new federal agreements, some 63 per cent, had received a wage increase in the previous 12 months than had employees in other types of workplaces. The second message from the report is that the federal system not only is fairer but also is delivering better coverage. We have seen a significant increase in agreement making in the federal IR system and, through that process, by protecting employees, the government's reforms are helping to boost employee¥ participation in and confidence in bargaining. That will have a result with respect to the quality of work and industry undertaken through business, and that will have a better result for the economy as a whole. The system is delivering good economic results, with 96 per cent of agreements including at least one provision to improve productivity at the workplace and provisions relating to hours of work, training and work organisation found in the majority of agreements. Compared with unregistered agreements, new formal federal agreements were more likely to have received wage increases based on productivity, and nearly 80 per cent of workplaces with new federal agreements reported an increase in productivity in the previous 12 months. It is starting to show results, and I think results which go past the anecdotal discussions of, say, the member for O'Connor earlier today. The report also shows that a number of people who were critical of these reforms at the time have in fact been proved to be wrong. In the lead up to the Industrial Relations Reform Act, some employer groups and conservative commentators said that giving employers the right to strike when negotiating a certified agreement through a sanction-free bargaining period, taking the secondary boycott provisions out of the Trade Practices Act and dealing with secondary boycotts through the Industrial Relations Act would lead to a massive increase in industrial disputation. That just has not happened. Another argument, which was put by the ACCI and others, was that the federal agreements were just meaningless, that they would be add-ons to awards and in that way, clearly, are wrong. But, again, a review of the agreements that have been reached show that, arguably, only a small number appear to be simply add-ons. The circumstances were that agreements from the perspective of workplace managers were seen to have represented a complete settlement of the package of pay and conditions that ought to apply in a workplace or enterprise. Many of those agreements involved an overall restructuring of someone's award conditions but often the agreement addressed particular issues that were a particular problem with respect to that business. I had the experience, as an official in years gone by, where often the argument from an employer would be, 'It's this issue I want to fix. The rest I can live with. It's okay.' That is what has been addressed through this process. Overall, the report is a handy document with respect to the changes that have occurred. It shows that the reforms are moving in the right direction. I commend it to the House. (Time expired) Wednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 1401 a few remarks about the 1994 annual report on enterprise bargaining in Australia. It is interesting listening to members opposite speaking on the topic of industrial relations. The accusation of course comes out, as it inevitably did then, that some members on our side are inherently anti-worker. We would of course strongly dispute that. What we are in fact is proAustralia. It is quite clear that the industrial regime is absolutely critical to the future of Australia. The reason why we in Australia have dragged the chain so much in terms of the restructuring of our economy is simply that the government of the last 12 years has been hamstrung to a very large extent by its relations with the unions. We do not need to look any further than that as one of the major reasons why the restructuring of the Australian economy has been so slow-although there has been an increasing realisation on the other side of politics that it needs to be done. To their credit, I think some of the leadership of the Labor Party do know what needs to be done. I notice that the president of the Labor Party, the member for Lalor( Mr Barry Jones), is here this morning. Certainly, the Prime Minister( Mr Keating), I think, understands what needs to be done, as do some of his ministers. However, it has been made quite clear time and time again that they have been unable to deliver because they can go only as far as the union movement-the union leadership in particular-allows them to go. There is a fundamental conflict of interest within the Australian Labor Party and because of that they will never be able to deliver the structural reform of the Australian economy that the times demand. Mr Barry Jones-Do you think there was a faster rate of change under the Fraser government? on so far since 1983. I accept the criticism of many aspects of the Fraser government, but the fact is that in the last 10 years, when there needed to be an accelerated rate of change, the Labor Party has not been anywhere up to delivering that rate of change, in a world where there has been a realisation that there has been a rapid rate of change. Let us look at our Asian neighbours. In Singapore, for instance, the standard of living has doubled-however that is measured---every 10 years since the 1960s. The New Zealand economy---our government wanted to be critical of the process of change which was going on there at one stage-is now bearing the fruit from the in-depth accelerated structural change that has occurred, while we have been largely sitting on our hands. The Labor Party knew the directions that had to be taken. However, it has not been able to deliver and this report indicates that quite clearly. The report talks about the quantity of change. That was my impression in reading through it. On that measure, on the quantity of change, it looks very good. It is able to report, as the minister has reported in the parliament, about the extent of the coverage of the work force by enterprise agreements. When it gets down to the actual facts, it talks about quantity rather than quality of change. It has been at that level that the government has been incapable of delivering. The debate on these issues is largely stifled by the fact that the government has been hamstrung in its relations with the union movement. In the debate on industrial relations in the main chamber yesterday, I pointed to the cosy relationship that exists between the Labor Party and the union movement.

In the last 12 years, between $130 million and $140 million of taxpayers' money has effectively been given to the unions by virtue of direct grants and tax concessions. All legallyMr Barry Jones-But there are no direct grants to the unions. yesterday. Government patronage of the union movement exists to that extent. The other side of the picture is more alarming because it is actually a two-way street. Prior to the 1993 election, the ACTU received grants of $1.3 million from the government for a whole range of purposes. It does not really matter whether or not it is called training-a lot of it is fairly specious. At least, on the face of it, it is not illegal. At the same time, the ACTU put $1.2 million into its campaign against the coalition at the 1993 election. Almost all the money it received in grants from the government was used against the coalition. The extent of the patronage that exists between the Labor Party and the trade union movement is such that, at that level, it is really a matter of the one who pays the piper calling the tune. That is why this country has been largely hamstrung in the area of industrial relations over the last 12 years. We are accused of being anti-worker but the government has operated in the interests of a small sector of the Australian community, the trade union leadership and some of their apparatchiks, to the great detriment of the majority of Australia and Australians, and that is the great pity of it. The government has been unable to deliver, other than in some quantitative sense, what was necessary. I would like to back up a bit here and say that, quite remarkably, in about 1991, the government came to a realisation that it had missed the boat in terms of industrial relation reform. Let us remember that, up to that point, it was totally intransigent on enterprise bargaining. It was something that we had talked about on our side of politics for many years, although, as the member for Lalor observed, the timing was not right and nothing was done prior to 1983. That is when the whole process of change in our part of the world, in particular, accelerated, although it had been happening in parts of Asia prior to that. The facts are that the government was finally dragged screaming to the realisation that there had to be a move into this new era of industrial relations. Prior to that, we were totally locked into the colonial system and the whole shebang, the whole box and dice, of arbitration and centralised wage fixing. The union movement realised too late that there had to be a change and the government was actually allowed-that is what it boiled down to-to go down that track. As I say, I believe some of them knew that that was the way to go, and I pay credit to those who were smart enough to know it. I suspect that many others were smart enough to know it too, but their factions tell them. I do not know which faction the honourable member for Corinella ( Mr Griffin) is in, but no doubt he is also told-how far to go down those tracks. The leadership of the trade union movement slowly woke up to the fact that they had to get with it and that they had no choice. So we have entered into this process of what amounts ultimately to a Claytons form of enterprise bargaining, because it has so many restrictions placed upon it-both legislative and otherwise-that it really is still failing today to deliver the pace of reform that the circumstances actually call for.",145,Representatives Main Committee

281,Mr Bradford,"I have not got those facts in front of me; I am just recalling them fromWednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1403 The rhetoric of the member for Corinella, who spoke before me about 'Up the workers!' and all that sort of rhetoric that we still hear from members in the Labor Party, is really quite passe. In my view, it is something out of a bygone era. Ultimately, we have to come to a point where we must decide what is best for Australia and not what is best for a few trade union officials, particularly those who are in parliament. The member for Corinella admitted, and he is quite right, that Labor party members are so dominated because the government is comprised of former union officials. In my dealings with them, I learned this business at the coalface, in employing large numbers of people who were members of trade unions. I learned at a fairly young age what their real motivation actually was, but I also came to understand that trade union officials do not understand-not that they are incapable of it, but they choose not to understand-what the real world is actually about and what business is all about. But even all of that has changed in recent years, because I think we are operating in a much more enlightened environment than we were when those sorts of conflicts actually were going on. There is now a much greater appreciation-by management in particular, but also by workers by and large-that ultimately everybody is better off and the cake actually becomes bigger through an appreciation of what our profits and sales are actually all about. The recent report which showed that Australia was, in some senses, the wealthiest nation on earth should probably give us some comfort, but what it actually does is demonstrate, more clearly than anything else we have seen in recent times, the great gap that there is in this country between its potential and its actual performance. By almost every measure, our performance in economic terms is very poor. Ultimately, of course, our international competitiveness is the major problem that we are faced with in this country, in terms of making our way in the world with the ongoing balance of payments problems that we continue to have. The aims and objectives of the industrial relations legislation have been expressed as being to enable the spread of enterprise bargaining and the protection of employees' interests through the maintenance and strengthening of the award safety net. We come to an impasse in these sorts of debates when we talk about the status quo. The starting point for all of the negotiations, from the government's point of view and from the unions' point of view, has always been the status quo. It has always been assumed that, in some ways, that was the point to start at; whereas, quite clearly, in many respects it was not the point to start at. In fact, the safety net, as somebody observed the other day, rather than being a safety net had become a hammock for many employees. There is a need, of course, as we recognise on this side of the House, for a balance between what might be a free-for-all in enterprise bargaining in terms of a laissez-faire approach. But the emphasis on protection of employee interests has been very largely at the expense of employer interests and, ultimately, it is the employers who actually provide the jobs. You can only go on for so long biting the hand that feeds you before you realise that that will not work and that, indeed, it is not working. The fact that it is not working is reflected in the high levels of unemployment that we have had in recent years. Despite the very best attempts of the government to disguise that fact, clearly unemployment is on the rise again, even though the government has thrown millions of dollars at the problem by putting people onto all sorts of training schemes and giving them these new work opportunities, and so on. These are basically for the short term, to get them into a situation where they are at least not ostensibly unemployed. But the level of MC 1404 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 September 1995 unemployment and underemployment in this country is huge. Realistically, taking the total level of unemployment and underemployment, we are probably looking at a figure closer to 15, 16 or even 20 per cent of the Australian work force, rather than the eight or so per cent that the official figures actually divulge. The unfair dismissal legislation which we dealt with in the parliament yesterday-which the minister claimed was an improvement on a good system but which, in fact, was only a minor improvement on a very bad system-really does not help us at all to overcome these problems. In the end, employers will take the attitude, as they have the right to do, that if you cannot fire them, why would you be motivated to hire them? That effort alone has been another example of the incapacity of the Labor Party to handle the situation that exists. There is a lot more that could be said about this report. But the bottom line, in my view, is that it demonstrates a success in quantitative terms and not qualitative terms. I really fear that this government, as it has demonstrated over the past 12 years, has a total incapacity to move Australia as the times demand. (Time expired) parliament that you can always rely on to provoke the opposition into getting excited, it is industrial relations. In fairness, I guess that could be said of both sides as most of us on both sides of the House certainly have views on matters to do with industrial relations. But you always get this from the opposition; you get people coming in one after the other and doomsaying about how dreadful our economy is and how dreadful our industrial relations system is. We have had people protesting this morning that they are not anti-worker. I guess some of them might not be anti-worker and there might be some goodwill, but they are certainly anti-union. And how dare we have unions in this country! These are unions which are democratically elected, hopefully; are not perfect, necessarily-but nobody is perfect; but, certainly, are organisations elected to represent working people. And what a dreadful thing that we have unions in this country that actually play a part in industrial relations! You can see from the Accord, which first came in in 1983, and we are now up to Accord Mark VIII, how effective that has been in ensuring effective industrial relations in this country. It has not always been the workers who have been terribly pleased with various decisions or agreements arising out of the Accord. Some workers might think that wages have been kept too low, or whatever. But, if you look at it objectively, you can certainly see that what we have in this country is an industrial relations system which does work, where there is consensus, where there are benefits for both employers and employees, for unions and business alike, and where, most obviously of all, there is a huge decrease in the number of industrial disputes. With one exception, I cannot recall a major federal industrial dispute-a significant one, one that has brought the country to a halt-since 1983. dispute in about 1989, or whenever it was, I cannot recall a major federal industrial dispute. During the previous speaker's address, the member for Lalor( Mr Barry Jones) pointed out the comparison with the Fraser years. The Fraser years are years that I remember very well, as I was a fairly young new trade unionist in those days in the public sector.

We do not hear much from the other side about the cosy relationship between business and the Liberal Party. Where do they get their funds from at election times? We have only got to look at health policy, where one of the most predatory and greedy trade unions-if I can stretch the term-the AMA, virtually write the coalition's health policy. Enterprise bargaining in Australia discusses progress in enterprise bargaining. Our enterprise bargaining system has a legislative background. The Industrial Relations Reform Act came into effect on 30 March last year. The act was designed to encourage enterprise bargaining, while providing guarantees to ensure that employees are treated fairly and cannot be disadvantaged by bargaining. That is in direct contrast with the opposition policies. We keep hearing that there are too many restrictions, legislative and otherwise, on enterprise bargaining. Those restrictions are there for a very good reason: to protect workers and ensure that people are not disadvantaged by bargains which are struck. In relation to the award system, the main elements of the legislation are: employees are protected by awards that set fair and enforceable minimum wages and conditions of employment that are maintained at a relevant level; the award safety net is strengthened by guaranteeing access for all workers to minimum entitlements relating to minimum wages; there is equal remuneration of work for equal value; there are conditions relating to termination of employment, including unfair dismissal-we hear a lot about that from the opposition-and there is the right to 12 months unpaid parental leave. I do not think that any employer in this country has anything to fear. Any fair, sincere employer who follows due process has nothing to fear from unfair dismissal legislation. We have had so much hype and nonsense from the opposition, clearly for electoral reasons. Their scaremongering over this legislation seeks to alarm employers and to deter them from employing people. It is one of the most disgraceful disinformation campaigns I have seen. Nobody has anything to fear from due process. I am familiar with due process as it has been practised in the public sector over a long period of time. People should not be dismissed unfairly. They should be dismissed if they are not performing or if they do something wrong, such as stealing money. There are processes to allow that to happen. But to protest about the existence of unfair dismissal legislation is farcical. The legislation includes minimum entitlements giving effect to International Labour Organisation and UN conventions. Other elements seek to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the basis of race, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability-I do not like the term 'mental disability' as it appears in the legislation; it should be intellectual or psychiatric disability-marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin. These are basic equal opportunity provisions. The Industrial Relations Commission is also required to take account of ILO Convention 156 in performing its functions. In the bargaining stream the act provides for two types of enterprise agreements: certified agreements which are negotiated between employers and unions, and enterprise flexibility",148,Representatives Main Committee
285,Mr Haviland,"And fairly poor economic circumstances, as we are reminded of quiteMC 1406 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 September 1995 agreements, EFAs, which are made directly between an employer and his or her employees, provided that a majority of employees approve. I remind opposition members that I have not always followed the official government line on enterprise bargaining. Nor, for that matter, am I always in agreement with the official trade union line on enterprise bargaining. I was previously an active trade unionist in the public sector, and I recall that in the early 1990s, when enterprise bargaining was first on the agenda and debated, that there were many of us-particularly in the public sector, but right across the union movement-who were concerned about the likely effects of enterprise bargaining. I recall writing an article, which I circulated within my union, in which I expressed concerns about enterprise bargaining, particularly as it related to the public sector. I believed then that enterprise bargaining was a by-product of the economic rationalist culture that unfortunately seemed to dominate the government, and particularly central departments like Treasury, Finance and Industrial Relations. It also had its adherents, unfortunately, amongst the senior ranks of the ACTU and amongst many senior union officials around the country. I believed that enterprise bargaining had the potential to enable unionists and workers to be divided into bite sized chunks to make it easier for employers in the negotiating process. That came about because of the removal of the centralised wage fixing system, which a lot of us had seen as a safety net in itself over the years. Indeed, as this report recognises, there were fears that groups such as women, migrants, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, et cetera, could be disadvantaged through enterprise bargaining. I found it ironic that this was happening in an era when the trade union movement was going through huge structural reform. This involved amalgamations and the formation of megaunions, much of which was for reasons of efficiency. I agreed with most of the amalgamations although some of them have gone a tad too far now with these huge super-unions within which the rank and file tend to think they get lost. There are some problems with the extent to which amalgamations have gone but basically I agree with the philosophy of amalgamation of the myriad of unions that we had. I found it ironic that on the one hand you had an amalgamation of unions and on the other hand you had a push to divide up workers into enterprise groups for the purposes of bargaining. Nevertheless, it was recognised amongst my colleagues in the public sector that enterprise bargaining was here and that those who wanted to oppose enterprise bargaining had lost the battle. I guess where the debate hotted up in the public sector was on the issue of agency bargaining. Instead of the APS being the enterprise for enterprise bargaining, there was concern that we were going to be broken up into different agencies. It was feared that workers in different government departments would be subject to different bargains and different wage outcomes, et cetera. However, I am pleased to say that I have recently been informed that common sense has prevailed in the public sector for basic wages and conditions negotiations. The APS is to be the agency and we will not have differential wage outcomes for public servants in different government departments. I think that would have been a bit of a farce. Having made a few comments and having expressed my reservations when I was in the union movement about enterprise bargaining, I would have to say that at least under Labor's system of enterprise bargaining there are some safeguards in place, unlike what we could expect from a coalition government, as we have seen in various states around Australia. Wednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITrEE MC 1407 I tum to the report. It points out quite clearly a number of messages. It points out that the extra protection for employees introduced through our legislation is having a positive effect and that bargaining under our federal system is fairer for employees as compared with other forms of agreements, particularly those put in place by state conservative governments. New federal agreements are more likely to reward employees for putting in extra hours and effort. Employees in workplaces with new federal agreements were least likely to report an increase in working hours but, where hours had gone up, employees were more likely than others to have also received an increase in weekly pay. That is, they were more likely to get a fair deal in the work effort bargain. Compared with other forms of agreements, new federal agreements were more likely to result in wage increases for all employees. More employees in workplaces with new federal agreements, 63 per cent, had received a wage increase in the previous 12 months than had employees in other types of workplaces with other types of agreements. Compared with other types of agreements, new federal agreements were more likely to be seen by women and part-time workers as giving them a fair chance to have a say in workplace bargaining. In workplaces with new federal agreements, women said that they were consulted just as often as men were, but in workplaces under other types of agreements women were considerably less likely than men to have been consulted about bargaining and were less likely to say that they had had a fair chance to have a say in enterprise bargaining. Also, compared with other agreements, federal agreements were more likely to be seen by women and part-timers as making them better off. The report goes on to some other very important areas. The second key message from the report is that under the federal system these agreements are also delivering better coverage and that, because of the way in which the federal government industrial relations framework protects employees, workers feel more confident about entering into agreements. Consequently, there is a significant growth in enterprise and workplace agreements, particularly in the federal industrial relations system and in the services sector. The take-up rate in the federal jurisdiction accelerated after the reform act took effect. There were over 1,450 new federal agreements formalised in the reporting period, more than doubling the rate of agreement making of the pre-reform act period. The majority of new federal agreements, that is, 76 per cent of those agreements, came from the private sector. We now have about 5,500 agreements formalised, covering 58 per cent of federal award covered employees. No wonder people are flocking from state awards to federal awards, particularly in Victoria. The third key message is that these agreements are helping to encourage the spread of enterprise bargaining and helping to deliver good economic results. There is plenty of evidence of that around the country. We hear a lot from the other side and from the conservative media that these enterprise agreements will cause more industrial disputes. That is clearly wrong. As I said before, I cannot remember a significant federal industrial dispute since 1983. Once again, I think there is an element of scaremongering in that. The enterprise bargaining report is an interesting report. Although there are some sobering messages in it, which I do not have time to go into, at least under our system workers will be far better off than under the coalition, and they well know it.

286,Mr Sinclair (New England) (11.32 A.m.),"It is worthwhile having a report on enterpriseMC 1408 MAIN COMMlITEE Wednesday, 20 September 1995 brought to wage negotiation. Whether or not the report reflects what it should in terms of an analysis of the state of play at the workface-I am not sure whether it is the work force or the workface, because this would seem to me to exercise a number of views with respect to employees and wage conditions-it seems to say very little about public interest and what the impact has been on the overall state of industry. Nor does it state the extent to which, as a result of enterprise bargaining and the Labor Party's changes to industrial relations, there is a better prospect for those who are unemployed getting a job, those who are in search of part-time jobs receiving part-time employment or those who are on welfare receiving some opportunity of getting into the work force. The report says a great deal about a narrow subject and says nothing at all about a lot of the matters that we, as parliamentarians, should address. Fundamentally it does represent, yet again, something of the interface between the Labor Party and the trade union movement. It is sad for the Labor Party's sake, rather than for anybody else's sake, that they have not been able to look beyond that relationship. It is demonstrable, with a large number of employees voting with their feet by leaving the trade union movement, that there are increasingly persons who are not being represented by the relationship between the trade unions and the Labor Party, who traditionally would have seen their natural political alignment with that political force. The report tells a great deal about a narrow part of the subject but very little about where we are going. When I look at it, it makes me wonder whether there are not still fundamental problems in enterprise bargaining, although, from the perspective of the coalition, it is a far better means of negotiating wages and conditions than now exists. The changes that the Labor Party has introduced are still too narrow. There is too little flexibility and we need to look very carefully at what are the minimal conditions which need to be provided. I do not see that providing an arbitrary role for the trade union movement in negotiations, after an enterprise agreement has been negotiated and before ratification is in any way advancing the cause of good relations and harmony in the workplace. Nor does it go towards addressing the overall question of whether or not enterprise bargaining is a better way to achieve productivity in industry. Fundamentally, the problem we have in Australia is that we have a lot of unemployed. What the government fails to understand is that enterprise bargaining should be looking both at the way by which you can employ people and people can be employed to the mutual advantage of each and, at the same time, at how you can make the whole of the workplace more effective and more productive and you can get more jobs. The more complications and the more difficulties there are in aspects of your industrial relations administration, the harder it is, particularly for small business employers, to employ people. There has been a good deal of discussion in the parliament of the degree to which the unfair dismissal provisions now apply and how people can be dismissed-whether or not they are able, in a small business, to be dismissed on the grounds of a person's unsatisfactory behaviour or aspects related to personal incompatibility. All these complications make it harder and harder for small business to employ people and I do not believe that in the rigidity of enterprise bargaining, as it is now structured under part VIB of the Industrial Relations Act 1988, there is sufficient flexibility to address that question with the overall public good in mind. The other aspect that worries me is whether or not, in the overall relationship between the parties, there is enough treatment given to labour on-costs. If we are looking at one of the real Wednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1409 disincentives against employment today, it is not how much an employee receives but how much his particular place costs the employer and, consequently, the extent to which that person is far more expensive to the employer than immediately is apparent. The total labour package is far more than the wage paid to the employees. As we have seen in international comparisons, in many instances Australian workers are not overpaid, but the labour on-costs are excessive and consequently there are major difficulties. Another problem that I see in the report is that that sector of the community that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, and I represent, the rural community, does not have as much of a part in enterprise bargaining as larger corporations. To my mind, it has always been a problem with Labor that they have looked at big business and big unions as being a way by which big government can flourish and they can flourish with it. In rural Australia it is the individual rather than collective bargaining force that is so often important. It seemed to me, when enterprise bargaining was first mooted, that there was a significant advantage in our being able to develop the concept of being able to once again relate the person who is in charge of a business to the person who is employed in the business, and come out with a negotiated arrangement which takes account of the whole framework within which they are employed. In rural Australia, so often the conditions vary from region to region, state to state and property to property. Enterprise bargaining tends to take account of the power of a collective trade union, so that if you are looking at award conditions affecting the shearing industry, for example, they are not negotiable between an individual who operates his or her own woolshed and the people who work in that shed; they are negotiated on a much wider basis. In that climate, I do not know that you necessarily provide the conditions that are best suited to the particular enterprise. It is for that reason again that I have reservations about the present structure of enterprise bargaining within the presently worded part VIB. It is important that there be enormous flexibility in workplace arrangements. It is important not to continue the old division that used to exist. It ensured that, where there were negotiations around the terms and conditions of employment, they seemed to take place between an industrial relations officer of a company and a trade union official. I felt they were unsatisfactory. It is far better having an arrangement where the people are involved in the workplace and the person who owns the business or is managing the business can actually talk to the people who are on the work floor. Unless you can achieve that, too often the conditions do not relate to a particular enterprise. That is all reflected in the fact that, in this report, there is a good deal of comment about the impact of part VIB, on employees and on particular minority groups, all of whom are significant and all of whom are important. There is no real consideration of the impact of part VIB on employment generally or its impact on employers or productivity. It tends to focus on the old battleground of two classes, and I suggest that these are now archaic. It is no longer just a matter of employer and employee. It is a matter of public good and public benefit and productivity and how to deal with the unemployed. It is matter of getting people back into the work force, albeit perhaps under different terms and conditions. These things are important. Above all, when looking at this report, it has to be remembered that there are still about one million Australians out of work, including people on various make work programs. A very large percentage of the total work force is totally excluded from enterprise bargaining. Nothing in enterprise bargaining, in this report and in the legislation that Labor has framed, provides the opportunity for people out of work to get back into the work force. Unless it identifies MC 1410 MAIN COMMITI'EE Wednesday, 20 September 1995 what it will do for business to improve our productivity, to make us more competitive-with total quality management and all these other facets of competition-unfortunately, enterprise bargaining is going to form only a small part of the total analysis of how a particular enterprise works and its efficiency. I tum briefly to the report to address a couple of aspects. Page xxxi of the summary headed 'The impact of part VIB agreements on employees' mentions that the average annual wage increase of employees covered by part VIB of the agreement was in the order of four per cent. It suggests that is a fairly significant achievement. To my mind, one of the difficulties with that is that it is not just in wage increases that one should assess the benefits to an enterprise. I think there are all sorts of other facets which are really important-for instance, the likelihood of the job being a permanent job; the extent to which the workplace itself is a better workplace than it was before; the extent to which the person's take home pay is increased. A wage increase, more often than not under our PAYE system-the taxation applied by the Labor government-means that a person's pay is significantly different from the amount the person puts in his pocket at the end of the week, the fortnight or the month. For that reason, the measure of comparison is not necessarily right. On page 73 of the main report, 3.3, 'Union involvement in enterprise flexibility agreements', is another one of the real downsides. If there is a negotiated agreement without the union initially being involved, the unions are automatically given, under this sell-out between the government and the ACTU, a right to intervene. I know there are circumstances where employees may be disadvantaged by the relative bargaining strength they exercise against management and the employer, and it is important that that be recognised. But it does not apply universally and, too often, on the basis of a negotiated arrangement, there has not been full account taken of the opportunity of a particular business to stay in business. If the union has the capacity to intervene in every instance, it does not look at the capacity of the business to survive or at the overall conditions within that particular business place to the same degree that it looks at whether or not its own members or the extended membership is advantaged or disadvantaged by that particular agreement. I am afraid that self-interest by the trade union movement, in many instances, has meant that its membership has suffered. I mentioned page 205, 'Impact on employees-overview', when I was talking about the lack of matters that are identified within the report. In my mind, it is not just a matter of the impact on employees that is important. I think you have got to look at a far wider subject, and I regret that has not been taken up anywhere in the report. Finally, looking at the section headed 'Management and unions', I think we have to understand that it is not just a matter of relative bargaining skills; it is a matter of relative advantage. I do not think relative advantage necessarily flows from the way in which this report has been addressed. On page 298 in section 6.9, there is a comment I just want to refer to before I close. The second paragraph says: While the report has highlighted some areas that will need to be addressed in future reports, particularly issues for non-English speaking background employees, provisions under Part VIB appear to have also generally promoted fairer outcomes for employees than might otherwise have been the case. I think that shows that, if we had a proper enterprise bargaining system without the undue restraints which Labor has imposed on it, the concept is right. Unfortunately, I do not believe that what has been introduced under part VIB by the present Labor administration is right. Wednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1411 That that is so is illustrated by the intervention of the federal government in a particular enterprise bargaining arrangement I noted in the paper yesterday, where I understand a work force have decided that they are no longer going to take sick leave and have negotiated a wage increase in order to compensate for it. They have done it on a totally fair and open-minded basis; they have done it to get more pay; and now the federal government is intervening to disrupt that enterprise arrangement. I do not think that is fair. I do not think it is desirable. I think it illustrates, yet again, the failure of enterprise bargaining under the Labor structured changes to industrial relations legislation. speaker, the member for New England( Mr Sinclair), dealt with. One was that he said people were leaving their trade unions. That is not correct. People may not be joining trade unions, but that is because of a different work situation in Australia with different situations and different ways of working, the increase in part-time and casual work and a whole change in the industrial work force of the country. The change has resulted in less manufacturing employment and a move to a whole range of different jobs which have never traditionally involved organised labour. That is basically why there has been a decline in union membership in the country. It is very interesting that the member for New England raised issues about shearing sheds and said that we could have different rates from one shearing shed to another. That would be a very interesting concept, with one shearer shearing alongside another shearer and one being paid more than another. It is a different matter when it is a learner and a shearer. But it will be a very interesting time if different rates are introduced into the country, between one shed and another, and there will be a very interesting argument when the shearers might all live 500 miles away and we are relating it to the actual negotiated position on a particular shed. I find that a pretty fascinating position. It basically comes down to an individual bargain and an individual contract being struck on the job. It will be an interesting time if we ever get to that in Australia. That also brings me to the point that I believe you get to the lowest common denominator with that sort of approach. That is, one contractor applies for a contract and, as that contractor winds back his cost structure, the lowest he can wind back, the further down he can get the labour component, the better chance he has of getting that contract. Therefore, you get the lowest common denominator in wages coming in to the individual and you get that through all sorts of industries in this country. It would lead to a very low paid work force without very much dignity at all. The first annual report, Enterprise bargaining in Australia, is a comprehensive review of the results of developments in enterprise bargaining at the workplace level. It is required under the Industrial Relations Act. This part of the act was originally designed to encourage enterprise bargaining while providing guarantees to ensure that employees are treated fairly and cannot be disadvantaged by bargaining. That is the crunch of this debate and what the previous speaker was talking about, because those on the other side of the House really are about making sure there is not any disadvantage rule-that somebody can go down as low as the employer can drive them. The further down they can get you the better the opportunity. That will be the name of the game; that will be what enterprise bargaining is about. It is about bargaining someone's wages and conditions",151,Representatives Main Committee
287,Mr Adams (Lyons) (11.46 A.m.),"I will just deal with a couple of points that the previousMC 1412 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 20 September 1995 as low as possible so the employer can win a contract or can gain some other advantage in the marketplace. In reforming industrial relations in Australia, this government put a strong emphasis on protecting the interests of employees. Right through the restructuring of industry which this government has tackled and has had to take on, at times there have certainly been great difficulties in some of those approaches but at least there has been an opportunity from this government's point of view to give support to the interests of employees. That has of course been coming from a Labor government. In addition to the importance of equity in its own right, adequate protections were seen as encouraging the participation of employees in bargaining. If we get into the enterprise itself, where bargaining is taking place, we want to get people to take up the opportunity to discuss bargaining with an employer. At issue here are the nature of employee safeguards, the effect of the agreements on wages and conditions, and employees' own assessments of the impact of change and bargaining on their working lives. I see that the report deals with some of that and I see that the less consultation shown by employees, the worse off they feel-the more they feel they are being discriminated against or they have lost out on the bargaining process. The more consultation, the more involvement they have, the better off they certainly feel about gaining a benefit from the bargain. In the federal scheme there are several legislative tests or requirements in addition to the consultation requirement designed for a more effective and fairer outcome. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission must be satisfied that there are tests that have been met in order for a new federal agreement to be certified or approved. The no disadvantage test requires the AIRC to be satisfied that an agreement does not, in relation to its terms and conditions of employment, disadvantage the employees whom it covers. This means that the AIRC will not approve an agreement which results in a reduction of employees' entitlements and protections taken as a whole, unless the AIRC considers that such reduction is not contrary to the public interest. In order to have access to agreements, employees' terms and conditions of employment must be covered by an award. The annual report for 1994 shows that there have been several significant gains with growth in enterprise and work place agreements, particularly in the federal industrial relations scheme and in the service sector, with bargaining spreading across a large range of industries to cover a majority of employees right throughout the federal scheme. The report did identify some concerns and these are bound to occur in this system and in any scheme that is starting up. These include some lack of skills and resources for agreement making; improvement in workplace relations, women and other groups and bargaining; and the commitment of those involved-that is, people committed to proper bargaining rather than not bargaining from one side to another or bargaining one down because one is stronger than another, or one not having the skills or the information to bargain fairly. While the Labor government is trying to iron out some of these problems and to develop better relations between employers and employees, I do not see very much progress from the other side at alL The other side continues with the argument to get rid of the 'no disadvantage' rule so that it can drive conditions and wages down. The other side of the House is about opening up the system so that a bargain can be driven for the lowest possible wages in this Wednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1413 country. The other side will continue to do so and this is the policy it will take to the next election. This policy comes from the support of the other side of the House for individual contracts. The bottom line of the other side of the House in its bargaining position will be to have people sign individual contracts. As somebody walks onto a work site, they will be asked to 'sign here'. Suddenly, the worker will find himself or herself working alongside somebody who is doing exactly the same work but who is being paid twice as much or a third as much again as the worker is being paid merely because he has been there a bit longer or there has been another agreement reached and his contract does not come up for renewal again. This is hardly a situation for industrial harmony or for getting people to work together to improve productivity. In the long term, it is a recipe for suspicion, jealousy and disruption. The quality of work is sure to fall and the situation will act as a disincentive for people in the workplace to work as a team. There will be no enthusiastic feeling for work and no pride in being rewarded for helping to make the company successful in any way. Desperate people will sign on for the sake of getting a job; that is what other people play on and have always played on. But, if people cannot meet their basic commitments in life-housing, food and transport-they will become the working poor of Australia and they will be forced into having to survive with these minimal conditions and wages. It may be thought that it is great for the bosses to control conditions, but, if the other side of the House has its way, we will going back to other eras of our history, with charities being forced to cope with more and more handouts and with people not being able to make ends meet. There needs to be a safety net and there needs to be a means by which people can ensure that they are not used and abused by the bad employers. In an adjournment speech recently, the honourable member for Grey( Mr Wakelin) talked about how small business will pick up all the unemployed people in Australia. The member for Grey quoted somebody-he said that it is an old statement-in saying that there are 700,000 small businesses and that, if they all employ one new person, Australia will do away with the unemployment issue. It is such a naive view to think that it is possible for all small businesses to take on another individual. As this report on enterprise bargaining shows, there is a great deal of enterprise bargaining coming into play. There have been agreements reached during which everybody concerned has shown goodwill and where pluses for both sides have occurred. Where there is goodwill and a system of not disadvantaging employees, through enterprise bargaining major gains can be made in productivity and profitability and, therefore, everybody involved with the enterprise is better off. But the enterprise has to be based on goodwill and the debate and the bargaining have to be fair and reasonable. However, to achieve this situation, you need some rules in place so that people are not disadvantaged. The no-disadvantage rule is of major importance to the working people of Australia. I also believe the report shows the transparent and open approach that this government has to industrial relations. People can see where we are and what we are doing, as opposed to those on the other side, who are continuing not to announce their full policy or tell working people of Australia what they could expect under those on that side of the House if they were in government. I think that is a very dishonest position. That is certainly a position that I will be pointing out to most of the workers around my electorate in Tasmania-that the noMC 1414 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 September 1995 disadvantage rule will certainly disappear, that individual contracts will be the go under a government from the other side and that people will certainly be much worse off. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired) about previous speakers in this debate on enterprise bargaining. Firstly, there have been some comments about unions and how the Liberal Party is anti-union, how we want to bash the unions and how they are a very separate enterprise. In fact, the Australian Labor Party is the political arm of the union movement. We all know that and I think it is time that we actually started admitting that in this place. The union movement, we all know, started up a hundred years ago or thereabouts and established its own political arm called the ALP. To question that, one has to look at the way that they are funded. They are funded in a lot of ways by government grants. If we look at the amount of donations the unions pay back to the ALP, being the lay party, one then thinks there must be some sort of collusion here, or alleged collusion, between the union movement and the ALP, using taxpayers' funds. But also we can look at the members of parliament on the ALP side who are former members of unions. The current president of the ACTU is about to join the parliament, if he is successful in the next election; we have Minister Crean, the member for Hotham, who is a former president of the ACTU; and the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, was a member of the ACTU as president. Although we have not put our IR policy into the workplace or into the political environment yet, already the president-elect, Ms Jennie George, is saying, 'We are not going to be working with the Liberal movement.' There has been some suggestion about union disputation reducing over the period of the ALP government. Of course it would be. Why would they want to have a dispute with their own party? That is the reason why there is no union disputation during this period of ALP government, because they in fact run the government themselves, so why look bad? It is also interesting to note that the member who just spoke, the member for Lyons( Mr Adams), talked about individual contracts. He is going to be putting this in writing, advising his electorate about it. I hope he does because he may be found to be wrong. Who knows what our policies are, but I hope he puts all that in writing. report for the Department of Industrial Relations on private enterprise bargaining in Australia. n is my view that the whole issue of enterprise bargaining has been hijacked by the high farce of Australian politics and the breast-beating of the industrial relations club. It seems from anecdotal evidence, and even in this report, that many Australian workers are being left behind in the important process of determining their own conditions of employment. The biggest thing that concerns many of the people I speak to in my electorate about employment is not necessarily unemployment but job security. They are afraid of losing their jobs. Although in Western Australia we have the lowest unemployment in Australia and we have rapid growth over there, they are still afraid of losing their jobs under the current federal arrangements. If one reviews the report and looks behind the bureaucratic gobbledegook, which one encounters in many reports, one can see some potential problems with the course on which",155,Representatives Main Committee

292,Mr Richard Evans,"I am very pleased to join the discussion today on the 1994 annualWednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1415 Australian industrial relations is heading. It seems that the beneficiaries of this course of New Age IR policies are in fact big business, big unions and those involved in the industry club of IR. Small businesses, employees of small businesses, non-English speaking migrants and, in many cases, women and part-time workers are not the beneficiaries. The warm and fuzzy feelings given to us by the many who support the current arrangements are simply hollow rhetoric based upon expediency of politics, for it seems that the word 'human' has been taken out of the new IR regime. No longer do we have 'human' resources and 'human' relationships, so important in the modem workplace. Rather, we now have a desire to seek greater return on the invested dollar. Gone is the need for enterprises to base their operations on providing a service to the market and to the many stakeholders-not shareholders, but stakeholders-associated with an enterprise, and thus to contribute to the development of a healthy community. What we now have is an industry basing itself on financial profits. There is nothing wrong with the notion of basing yourself on profit, as long as it is in direct proportion to the vital development of the greater community; but, now, these enterprises are mostly seeing their employees as figures on a balance sheet. In human terms, enterprise bargaining has focused enterprises on value for money and it has ignored the greater importance of humanising an enterprise. There are exceptions to the rule on any issue, and some enterprises are empowering their staff; yet, so often, enterprises are fixated on dollars rather than on people. It is important to reflect upon the changes that our world has been facing over the last 20 or so years. We are in the grip of a major crisis of change, a transitional period. We are going from the industrial age into the information or technology age. Two hundred years ago, we went through a similar period of transition. It was called the Industrial Revolution and it lasted for about 50 years and was a period of great crisis where we went from the agricultural age into the industrial age. There were people who saw the opportunity within crisis-since crisis can offer either danger or. opportunity-and there were countries, companies and organisations that saw the opportunity to go into the industrial age at a rapid rate of knots and to develop in that way-America and England being two good examples. A good example of the countries that wanted to hang on to their old agricultural ways and wanted to hang on to their old agricultural structures would be the countries of eastern Europe. Moving forward 200 years, we are now going through another period of transition which is really challenging everything in our society. We are challenged in our community, our education system, the way we do things, and everything that we do-just as happened 200 years ago in the Industrial Revolution. What we are challenged to do is to move from the industrial age into the information age or the technology age. We are finding, of course, that the structures of management are breaking down. People are trying to make the hierarchical pyramid structure that we had in the industrial age flatter and meaner. Of course, that is not working. What is working is a network structure where you have independent work modules who are empowered for their own decision making capabilities and who can operate independently with a common vision in mind. The key to this networking and empowering of industry, companies and enterprises is in fact a reduced and relaxed industrial relations systems. But what we see is a more structured approach. Even the report says, on page xxxiv, 'Many of the changes that were observed, for better or worse, in Australian work places were changes that would have occurred anyway.' MC 1416 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 September 1995 We have a system of enterprise bargaining still based upon the industrial age; and, although industry and enterprises are crying out for some change, we are not really seeing any change. We are seeing a continuation of industrial age thinking, driven by industrial age managers and supported by industrial age unions.We do not see New Age thinking which empowers employees to participate in decision making and work strategies. As an example of that, page xxxv of the summary in Enterprise bargaining in Australia says: Evidence from employees on workplace cooperation suggests that, both for workplaces with Part VIB agreements and for non-VIB workplaces, there remained considerable scope for improvement of workplace relations. A large part of the responsibility for this is in the hands of management. A weak performance by management, in both Part VIB and non-VIB workplaces in improving information flows and employee participation in decision-making, in the context of growing calls on employees to increase effort or work under great stress, and increased pressure on their ability to balance work and family lives, is a major reason why there were not more employees expressing the view that they had been made better off as a result of workplace bargaining. It is largely up to managementindustrial age management, by the sound of thisto find better ways of dealing with this collection of issues. Where it does not, it may find that employee willingness to continue the process of negotiation and change at the workplace-level may wane ... I tend to agree with that summary, because I do not think the actual enterprise bargaining system is working, for the reason that the people involved-whether they be big business, big unions, managers, unionists or whatever they might be-are still tied up in the notion of industrial age thinking and have not moved forward into the information age. We see that the very authors of the report are concerned about the process. Another example of the IR system not yet working effectively is the statement of the authors that it was 'less likely to provide for different rates of pay rises for employees covered by agreements'. In other words, if you are the best worker in an enterprise, you will get paid exactly the same amount of money as the worse worker in an enterprise. I, as an individual who wants choice in an enterprise, suggest that is unfair. Any fair-thinking unionist would agree with me, I think. However, they are stuck in the industrial age thinking, and they say, 'Lowest common denominator: let's pay everyone the same and let's forget about paying or rewarding people who want to put in.' In other words, if an employee wants to assume the rights offered by an employer, and accepts the responsibility of putting effort into their work, why should the employee be discriminated against? Enterprise bargaining, in fact, is discriminating against those employees who want to put the effort in and increase the opportunity of potential income increases. This is but one of the examples of where the enterprise bargaining system is letting down employees who have confidence-great confidence-in their own abilities, and have to accept this notion of lowest common denominator pay. Why should someone who wants to put the effort in have to accept the lowest level? It says here, according to the authors, that it is less likely to provide different rates of pay for employees covered by agreements. Why can the better employees not get paid more? I support the principles of enterprise bargaining. However, I believe that there is much to do within the whole area of workplace reform. One of the areas that needs reforming is the understanding that we are out of the industrial age and we are moving into empowering Wednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMlITEE MC 1417 employees in the decision making process. We have to accept that. I have yet to see thatwanting to move away from the industrial age, into the information and technology age-from major enterprises, I have yet to see that from major management organisations, and I have yet to see that from major unions. A very good example of the reason the unions are suffering in this area is their membership downfall. They are not getting into the service industries which are servicing the information age. All the commentators say there should be some change in workplace reform. All the practitioners say there should be some change. Employees have stated, in this report, that they want to do more and they are capable of doing more. Yet the IR club is wallowing in a scheme which is old-world. It is still just wanting to project the scheme that it has developed over many years, which was structured well for the industrial age but is not appropriate for the information age or for individual networking modules with individual decision making capacity and strategies. It is not appropriate for any of that at all. For the sake of a profitable future for our young people who are suffering under the policies of the government, because they are not getting employed in our industries, we need to urgently address these issues and look at enterprise bargaining. Perhaps the IR clubs should consider that there are things other than paying on the lowest common denominator and that we should be looking at rewarding those who want to put the effort in. comments on the report Enterprise bargaining in Australia. It is an issue that I, as a former union official in the service sector, have some considerable interest in. I also have some interest in the structural changes that are going on in our economy which are, amongst other things, making things fairly difficult for unions in many sectors. They are also leading to changes in how wage fixing occurs, how bargaining over pay and conditions is conducted and associated issues. Let me go through some of the main findings of the report. Firstly, enterprise bargaining in the federal system is now pretty widespread and it has become entrenched throughout the majority of workplaces covered by federal awards. Secondly, the extent of this coverage is significantly greater than has been the case within the state award systems that have enterprise bargaining as an adjunct. Thirdly, enterprise bargaining in the federal system has produced better outcomes, both with respect to pay and remuneration for employees and with respect to productivity and efficiency improvements for employers, than equivalents in the state systems. Fourthly, enterprise bargaining is better accepted by workers and unionists in the federal system than it is in the equivalent state systems. Fifthly, there are significant areas of the service sector that are significantly less permeated by enterprise bargaining than the remainder of the work force or industry. This is partly because of the fact that most of these areas tend to be predominantly covered by state industrial relations systems rather than by the federal system, although that is not exclusively the case. Finally, enterprise flexibility agreements--enterprise bargains for non-unionists-have, to date, spread only in a fairly limited way. Those are probably the major themes that I extract from the report. There is certainly a lot of very interesting data in the report. I commend the report to the parliament as a worthwhile exercise in seeking to understand the early stages of a new and very different industrial relations system in this country. Perhaps some of the more interesting aspects of the report relate to the findings on the perceptions of workers affected by enterprise bargaining, and some",158,Representatives Main Committee
293,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (12.16 P.m.),"I welcome the opportunity to make someMC 1418 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 September 1995 of their attitudes on what enterprise bargaining has meant for them. Surprisingly enough, it is not all positive. Given my own experience with enterprise bargaining as a trade union official, predominantly with people for whom enterprise bargaining was fairly difficult, that does not come as a great surprise. There are a variety of statistics in the report. For example, the report estimates that at the end of 1994 roughly 1.46 million workers, or 57 per cent of employees, covered by federal awards are covered by enterprise bargains. I think it is very much a tribute to the efforts of those involved in both designing and managing the new system, including the minister, that enterprise bargaining has managed to spread to that number of people that quickly. Agreements are more common, according to these statistics, in the larger, more heavily unionised parts of the economy and in the public sector, both of which should come as no surprise. Reverting to my comments earlier about the extent to which there are negative responses to enterprise bargaining from workers, approximately one-third of workers surveyed indicated that in their view, in the enterprise bargains that they were now subject to, they had not had a fair chance to have a say in the process of determining their own pay and conditions through the enterprise bargaining process. That is an issue that requires a fair bit more examination. It certainly is a disturbing conclusion, one that my own experience suggests is not a great surprise. It is important for us to understand where enterprise bargaining has come from and why it is that we are seeing a decentralisation of the industrial relations process in Australia now. There is a tendency amongst some in the union movement to regard this as some sort of New Right plot, yet another sell-out by a devious Labor government or other such epithets. This is a fairly superficial analysis. Really, enterprise bargaining has emerged as a product of structural economic change in our society and, in essence, three critical and interrelated factors. The first of these is diversification in the production process. The main award that I used to deal with as a union official-originally the commercial clerks award and subsequently the clerical and administrative employees award--covered somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 workers in the state of Victoria, ranging from the smallest enterprise up to BHP head office. Back in the forties, when that award and others were probably in their heyday, the notion that you could have a single document setting out in effect a comprehensive set of terms and conditions, a comprehensive employment contract covering that number of people working across an incredibly diverse range of enterprises, had some merit. These days, with the types of activities being performed by office workers, the types of skills that they are being asked to employ and the demands being placed upon them by their employers, the needs of their employers are infinitely more diverse than they were back in the forties and fifties. It is becoming increasingly difficult to have that sort of broad, catch-all award covering such a diverse array of enterprises and such a vast number of people, because of the intrinsic diversification that is going on in the workplace within the production process. For customised work arrangements that are emerging, we are inevitably going to need more customised employment contract arrangements. That is the first of the three influences that have produced enterprise bargaining and will produce further change. The second of these influences is internationalisation. What that has done is to put enormous pressure on Australian industry, particularly trade exposed industry, to get rid of entrenched, inefficient work practices, demarcations and a variety of other things. Essentially, they have been allowed to develop and remain because of the protected status of much of Australian Wednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITI'EE MC 1419 industry for many years. With exposure to international competition and a much harsher international environment putting a lot of pressure on many Australian companies, the heat has understandably gone on many of these practices. However glibly people may look at these things and decide that they should be eliminated, it is not easy to do so when they actually get down to the practical grassroots problems, when they are facing a given situation in the workplace with a group of workers with established arrangements, established entitlements, a given level of morale and commitment to the firm. It is not easy to change these things. Having been part of it in a number of areas, I understand this only too well. The third factor which has driven enterprise bargaining has been the growing gap in pay that the market is offering to people according to their skills so that those with greater skills and greater flexibility and adaptability are increasingly attracting a higher and higher premium for those skills. The old centralised system, including paid rates awards, has been cracking under the strain of that increasing market pressure for higher pay for higher skilled workers. That in itself is a problem for government and a problem for the solidarity of our society, and has to be tacked in other ways. There are, however, serious problems with enterprise bargaining and I would like to comment on just some of them. The first and most obvious is that the impact of enterprise bargaining on industrially weaker workers, such as those I generally represented as a union official, can be quite adverse. This is an understandable consequence of a more market based system of wage determination. Particular groups in the work force, such as women workers who tend to occupy less industrially powerful positions, casual and part-time workers, people from a non-English speaking background, people with lower skills or very broad generic skills that are easily replaceable, lack bargaining power and lack muscle. If there is a system such as enterprise bargaining that is predominantly based on muscle, then inevitably those people are going to suffer relative to others. Blue-collar workers, particularly the skilled male blue-collar workers in many parts of industry, have a fair bit to trade in the game of enterprise bargaining. They have the ability to do deals and to back up their negotiating power with muscle to ensure that they get reasonable deals. Also, unlike many service workers, unlike many workers in some of the New Age areas that the honourable member for Cowan( Mr Richard Evans) referred to, their productivity is amenable to measurement. One of the great difficulties that my union had with enterprise bargaining was that, with the type of workers that we represented-office workers, often multi skilled, conducting a range of tasks according to what day it was and what was going on-it is very difficult to measure changes in their productivity. This is a problem which ultimately means that some people are going to benefit a lot more from enterprise bargaining than others. The experience that our union has had in many areas of enterprise bargaining has been that deals that we have ultimately been forced to accept have often included loss of very basic things such as tea breaks, people working unpaid hours, chronic understaffing being entrenched and a range of other things, whereas people with more muscle, on the shop floor, for example, have been able to do deals for similar increases in pay without the serious loss of conditions. I give a simple example with respect to the Ford Motor Company and the enterprise bargain where my union and the former ADSTE union were ultimately bludgeoned into accepting an enterprise bargain for a six per cent pay increase, which other unions, the blue-collar unions, also got for fairly limited trade-offs. The trade-offs that were ultimately forced out of our MC 1420 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 September 1995 members were a shift to monthly pay, working three hours a week extra for no additional pay, and a variety of other more minor trade-offs. Our members voted three times against accepting this deal and opted to stay on their current wage rates if that was the deal but, ultimately, the company was so determined to force this change through, even though it was clearly detrimental to their work force, that by applying individual pressure, by engaging in union busting tactics, they were ultimately able to get enough of our members to agree individually so that eventually the resistance of the membership to this deal collapsed, and the outcome was fairly predictable. That is a fairly good illustration of the types of things that happen under enterprise bargaining. Those who have less industrial muscle, those who have less to trade off, are often going to end up with adverse outcomes. It is important to remember though that there is a significant difference between the position of the government and the labour movement position on these issues and that of the opposition. What the opposition is ultimately on about-and I think the honourable member for Cowan expressed it fairly well-is individual contracts. Although the government and the labour movement are moving towards a more decentralised system, ultimately because of the broader forces in the society and in the economy that I referred to before, there still is a collective basis of social equity underpinning the system through things like safety net increases, award protection and the like. The conservative parties would tear all this away. They are trimming, shifting and trying to pretend that they will not but there is no doubt that if they do get elected these things will not last very long. What they are about is redistribution from the industrially weak, from the economically weak, to the economically strong. Jobsback was a recipe to destroy the award system, to put in such farcical mechanisms as the employee advocate to try and undermine the role of independent trade unions and ultimately to move people in the work force onto individual contracts. The difference between the opposition and the Labor Party is that we support collectivism. We support collective social justice and not survival of the fittest. As I indicated, the honourable member for Cowan just put forward a very good exposition of a New Age version of survival of the fittest. Why should the employee who works a bit better not get paid more than the employee who in the subjective-and often flawed-judgment of the employer is not quite as good a worker. That is ultimately a recipe for social division. It is ultimately a recipe for inequality and it is in complete contrast to the sort of hypocritical cant that we heard yesterday from the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Georgiou) and from various opposition members about the growing inequality in our society. On the one hand, they complain about that inequality but, on the other, they are seeking to put in place policies which will massively increase inequality and unfairness in our society. So enterprise bargaining does have some dangerous aspects to it which tend in that direction, but it is occurring for broad, structural economic reasons. The government has put in place protective safety net measures to ensure that those who are weakest economically and industrially are substantially protected in the new wage fixing system that we have.

294,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (12.31 P.m.),"I am very pleased to join this debate in which we areWednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1421 that I was a little saddened to hear some of the rhetoric of the honourable member who has just completed speaking, the member for Melbourne ( Mr Tanner). in the Australia of 1995. What we should be seeking to do, as members of this place, is to encourage an industrial relations system which will deliver fairness, cooperation, productivity, flexibility and, indeed, an overall better result for Australia. The Minister for Industrial Relations ( Mr Brereton) could only be described as a hapless individual because he has come into the parliament on a number of occasions and brought in various industrial relations amendments and, time after time, he has been forced to return to the chamber because his amendments have been proved not to work. Enterprise bargaining is a very major reform in Australia. Unfortunately, the government has taken the coalition's terminology but has brought provisions into the law that have ensured that enterprise bargaining has simply not worked as it should. The Labor Party, of course, is heavily dependent on the trade union movement and heavily dependent on the trade union scare campaign at election times. One really ought to look at the comments made just after the 1993 election by the aspirant president of the ACTU, Jennie George, when she said: What the employers have got to understand is that we won the election in March and this billthat is referring to the industrial relations billis a payback for the commitments that were made by the government in the course of that election campaign. Really, what Jennie George was saying was that the government bribed the union movement, the government had to deliver, and the industrial relations bill which was introduced by the minister and which became law was a reward for the union movement. We all know that that reward has not worked and the minister has had to change the legislation over and over again. The report we are noting here this morning comprises almost 400 pages-399, in fact-and I must say that there really was no good news for the minister there. There was no real joy for him in the reaction which this report received throughout the Australian community. It is fairly clear that employers are not happy; it is very clear that many employees are not happy, including women. So while the minister has put the best gloss that he could on this report from his own perspective, he really has to accept that his approach to enterprise bargaining has not worked. One only has to look at the Financial Review on 21 August 1995 where a report points out: What has been hailed as one of Australia's major industrial relations reforms-the push for enterprise bargaining-is causing widespread dissatisfaction throughout the workforce, with a significant proportion reporting deteriorating job satisfaction, greater stress and reduced job security. The honourable member for Melbourne, who spoke previously, pointed out some of the problems that the work force sees in relation to the government's approach to enterprise bargaining. We now have a situation where only 22 per cent of Australians are covered by enterprise agreements. That indicates that the government has not progressed as far as it could have in improving the acceptance of this changed work system in the country. Twenty-two per cent of all workers is not a very high percentage. One could look at the higher proportion of public",164,Representatives Main Committee

When we have a position where only 22 per cent are covered it is fairly clear that the government really has not gone as far along the road as, indeed, it should have. The government also continues along the road of its scare campaign. We find that members opposite and the trade union movement go out into the newspapers and the various media outlets trying to suggest that we in the coalition are seeking to strip away basic working conditions and that we are seeking to return industrial relations to the law of the jungle. They are imputing bad motives to us and yet it is clear, if one looks at the major address made by the shadow minister for industrial relations, the member for Flinders( Mr Reith), only a short time ago, that what the government has been saying is simply incorrect. We ought to have honesty in politics, we ought to have accountability in politics and, indeed, we in the coalition will have honesty in policies. We will deliver our policies prior to the election and, what is more, when we are elected to office we will implement our policies, unlike the current government, which was prepared to say absolutely anything prior to the last election in order to crawl into office. Of course, once the current government was elected, the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) laughed in the faces of the Australian people and said, in effect, 'These are only promises to get us over the line. We're over the line and we're now tearing up these promises.' Remember the l-a-w tax cuts, and so on? It is a very sad indictment of the government's approach to politics to find that major players on the government's side continue to misrepresent our position. The Treasurer ( Mr Willis) says that we are seeking to hack away at these safety nets. The Minister for Industrial Relations says that we are seeking to take the machete to the award safety net and to cut it to pieces. The honourable member for Lilley( Mr Swan) says that Mr Reith is committed to abolishing the no-disadvantage test. The honourable member for Petrie( Mr Johns) says that we are seeking to demolish the very struts underneath our system of awards and that the nodisadvantage test will be kicked away. The reality is that the coalition will retain a nodisadvantage test; the shadow minister for industrial relations made that point very clearly. It probably will assist the chamber if I make it very clear what we intend to do as a coalition in the area of industrial relations after the next election. The thrust of coalition policy will be to ensure that Australian workers receive higher pay in more productive workplaces. The coalition will maintain the current award system overseen by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The coalition will support the jurisdiction of the AIRC to deliver safety net wage increases for the lowest paid workers. The coalition will establish minimum working conditions for agreements to ensure adequate protection, especially for the low paid workers. These conditions will include the relevant applicable classification award hourly rate. The coalition will make it easier for employers and employees to enter into direct negotiations about wages and conditions at individual workplaces. Obviously, for the workplaces with no union members, the coalition will not allow union bosses to intervene where they are not invited. Of course, that is a matter which will not please Ms George one iota. The coalition will ensure a fair go all round on the vexed unfair dismissals question. The coalition will restore section 45D and section 45E of the Trade Practices Act. We will support the right of workers to either belong to a union or not belong to a union and we will abolish union preference. If workers do want to belong to a particular union, the coalition will support their right to belong to a union of their choice and, as a result, the coalition will permit the dis-amalgamation of unions where this is the desire of the unionists themselves. We will retain Wednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1423 a fair and reasonable no-disadvantage test against a fair and reasonable set of minima. Of course, we find that government members opposite continue to go out into the media and continue to misrepresent our position. They stand condemned. It is clear from the report on enterprise bargaining that we are debating today that large sectors of the work force are not satisfied with what the government has achieved in the area of enterprise bargaining. It is clear that the minister is on the ropes with respect to enterprise bargaining. It is clear that the minister is no longer driving the agenda here: trade unions are, indeed, flexing their muscles and the minister is reacting to trade union pressure. It is obvious that large numbers of workers feel that they have not been consulted by the government on its reforms. They certainly have not been consulted on the way the government has implemented some of the enterprise bargaining. I think the minister ought to go back to basics. He ought to go back to the drawing board. He ought to pick up more than the coalition's words 'enterprise bargaining'. He ought to get to the substance of what we seek to achieve, which is, of course, to introduce a system of fairness, cooperation, productivity and flexibility. The minister has not been prepared to do that. The minister has not made anyone happy with his efforts. Women are upset by the report which has been handed down. Women's groups have claimed that women have not adequately benefited from the changes in the enterprise bargaining area. There has also been the suggestion that the enterprise bargaining that has occurred has favoured men. The simple fact of the matter is that only 22 per cent of Australian wage and salary workers-the earners-are currently covered by enterprise agreements. Sadly, the small business sector-the small work forces and the small workplaces-has hardly been touched by the enterprise bargaining arrangements. The large public sector and private sector businesses have largely picked up the enterprise bargaining changes that the minister has brought in. Unfortunately, so many of the award conditions which ought to be discussed between employers and employees have automatically been sucked up into those enterprise agreements. We support a reasonable set of minima. However, the government's whole approach to enterprise flexibility is exposed by the government's intention to support an appeal against the Tweed Valley Fruit Processors Pty Ltd enterprise flexibility agreement. This company was given $26,000 from the government's handouts which are designed to encourage EFA agreements. What happened was the EFA was approved by an overwhelming majority of employees and the AIRC, but its flexible sick leave provisions are now being challenged on appeal by the ACTU and the government is using taxpayers' money to support that appeal. Workers under this particular EFA have not given up their sick leave. In fact, they will be paid for eight days sick leave, the award provision, irrespective of whether they take it or not. Their right to take time off when they are sick is unaffected as is their protection against dismissal for absence because of illness. We have a situation where an EFA protects the workers. The EFA in effect says that, although people might on average take only half of their sick time, every worker will be paid for a full eight days sick pay whether or not the person is sick. If a person is sick, he or she is still able not to come to work. The government is appealing against this after it has contributed $26,000 of taxpayers' money to facilitate the negotiation of this very agreement. It is clear that the ACTU, yet again, has been able to crack the whip and the government has reacted to ACTU pressure. The workers and the employer are prepared to agree to this very reasonable arrangement and yet we find the ACTU is not happy. The ACTU is not happy MC 1424 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 September 1995 that workers at Tweed Valley Fruit Processors Pty Ltd are going to get paid eight days sick pay, whether they are sick or not. It is bad enough for the ACTU to appeal, but to find that the minister and the government are prepared to support the appeal using more taxpayers' money, I think, is absolutely outrageous. That exposes, once and for all, the fact that the government's approach to enterprise flexibility is a complete and utter sham. The government gave $26,000 to encourage this agreement. Everyone talked about it; everyone agreed. We now find that, because the ACTU is not happy, the government is going to use taxpayers' money to, in effect, undermine, or seek to undermine, the agreement which $26,000 of taxpayers' money helped to promote. I think the government stands condemned. The government has failed in that only 22 per cent of employees are covered by enterprise flexibility agreements. The government has failed in that small business has not been covered adequately by these agreements. The government has failed in that real flexibility has not occurred. The government stands condemned because it has misrepresented the position of the coalition. It always undertakes scare campaigns, but the Australian people have seen through those scare campaigns. I believe that the Australian people are looking for honesty in politics. They are looking for accountability in government. The policy which will be announced by the coalition will be fair and reasonable. It will encourage enterprise flexibility agreements. The Australian people will support us at the next election. They will sweep those opposite from office as, indeed, they should be thrown out of government. (Time expired). the paper on the report Enterprise bargaining in Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will appreciate, probably better than most, that some quite provocative remarks have been made by speakers from the opposition. I want to respond in a wider context before I get down to the element of enterprise bargaining in Australia. I rejoice in being the member for Chifley. My electorate is named after Ben Chifley, a man who had a distinguished record not only in the trade union movement but also in the Labor Party, and as Treasurer and Prime Minister of this country. I am proud to belong to the Australian Labor Party which is a part of the wider labour movement; that is, the movement with an industrial wing comprising unions, and a political wing comprising the Australian Labor Party. I, too, have had a modest involvement in unions, for which I make no apology. I do not understand why opposition members seek to deride organisations that have as their aim and sole objective representing ordinary workers-the ordinary men and women of Australia, the ordinary young people of Australia. I find nothing inherently wrong in it. In fact, I think it is a real tragedy that only approximately 25 per cent of the work force in Australia is now represented by unions. Time after time in my electorate I have seen people being taken advantage of in the workplace because they have no union representation. One of the first principles that the opposition needs to understand is that people do not necessarily come to the workplace equally empowered. That is certainly true of a lot of employees. We have seen a lot of changes in the 13 years of Labor government. We need to remind ourselves what the industrial scene was like prior to the election of a Labor government. There was, for example, a wages blow-out. That is, workers were getting wage increases, but inflation",165,Representatives Main Committee
297,Mr Price (Chifley) (12.46 P.m.),"I am pleased to speak on this motion to take note ofWednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 1425 was very high and so they were not getting the real benefit of those increases and it was like a dog chasing its own tail. There were a lot of industrial disputes, one might even say confrontations, sometimes actually provoked by the previous government. It goes without saying that this government has enjoyed a record period of industrial harmony. But, more than that-and I think this is central to this proposition of enterprise bargaining-the previous industrial scene was characterised by highly structured unions, by demarcation disputes, and by a management system where confrontation was promoted. I will demonstrate the change in the relationship between employees and employers in this period of Labor government. I was a member-as was the member opposite-of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training when it was doing an inquiry on skills. I was talking to one of the union delegates at a paper mill and he said, 'Before the changes here'-and he was talking about productivity agreements and multi skilling-'what we used to do is clock on, and, when we clocked on, we left our brains behind.' I thought that was a very insightful description of the paucity of the situation. I spoke about the issue of multi skilling. We have seen in the metals trade some 300-odd different awards collapsed into nine-the idea that a worker not only can do one job but is trained to do a number of jobs. These were, and are, revolutionary changes compared with what there was before. What does enterprise bargaining cement? It cements the idea that both employers and employees are stakeholders in organisations, that they need to cooperate constructively and that they can do that within the framework of enterprise bargaining, such that both are not disadvantaged and such that both are advantaged. It is very interesting in this report that workers covered by enterprise agreements, on average, are getting higher wage increases than those that are not. Here is another important point from a Labor perspective: we have never believed that the way forward is by reducing wages-in other words, that we can fuel further economic growth by slashing and hacking at ordinary workers' wages. I regret to say that there is so much in what I hear of the contributions of honourable members opposite and in their thinking that indicates that this still has a central place within the coalition. Enterprise bargaining is not about that. Enterprise bargaining is about two groups sitting down and discussing their conditions of employment, and changes to those conditions of employment, such that neither is disadvantaged and both are advantaged, and workers actually get increases. It is about harnessing the knowledge, enthusiasm and ideas of workers to make constructive input into the workplace. This was not the case. This was a rare exception in 1983 but now it is almost so commonplace that we take it for granted. The honourable member for Fisher( Mr Slipper) says, 'Oh, it's terrible.' He says that the unions bribed the government and we are introducing legislation to satisfy the unions. We have made no secret of the fact that we belong to a labour movement. We make no secret of the fact that we consult with unions. But we consult with a lot of other people. Let me give you an example, Mr Deputy Speaker. At one stage I was responsible for defence industry policy and we were doing a review. It is true that I consulted with the unions; I consulted with the ACTU. Basically, I went out to the factory floors and consulted with the employers and some of the employees. A statistical analysis would show that we consulted more with the employees than we did with the unions or the ACTU. MC 1426 MAIN COMMITfEE Wednesday, 20 September 1995 That is the Labor way-we like to listen: we do not like to reject ideas; we like to consult. And we have disagreements from time to time. You would never believe it, listening to the honourable member for Fisher. But of course we are interested in the welfare of ordinary people. That is what the Labor Party is all about. We are interested in how workers are faring. We want them to be the winners out of any system, not the losers. Maybe that is what distinguishes us. I should mention another centrality in our approach to labour relations. We have been able to sit down with the ACTU and develop accords. Unlike the history of John Howard when he was Treasurer, we have not had a wages explosion. We have done very constructive things for the so-called social wage. We have done things that I am inordinately proud of that the Liberal Party or the conservatives wish to destroy in government. Let me give you an example. We have negotiated the situation so that ordinary workers, as opposed to private enterprise executives or public servants, should have the benefit of superannuation, and it is compulsory. We are going to make sure they do not dip out. What do the opposition want to do? They want to do exactly what they did with the national welfare fund, which they destroyed. They are destroyers of workers' superannuation. A fully funded superannuation fund in the 1940s was destroyed by Menzies in the 1950s. Now we are saying in the 1990s that every worker ought to have a reasonable entitlement to his own superannuation. We think this is a measure long overdue but we do not think this measure lacks equity. We do not think it is unfair. But what do opposition members want to do about it? They say, 'Look, this is wrong. This is coercion. What we should be doing is the old Liberal trick of putting rorts into the tax system, getting rid of the compulsion and then if people want to save for their superannuation they can.' That used to be the system under which everyone had the same opportunity to save but women hardly had it at all and ordinary workers did not have it at all. We have changed that. I just hope that the ordinary people of Australia understand that, while our system of industrial relations has meant that they have had to make many changes, for which I thank them, and many sacrifices, for which I thank them, these things are under jeopardy at the next election. Do not assume for one moment that the Liberal Party will somehow abandon this fixation of wanting to see workers unrepresented. We had the member for Fisher saying, 'Well, of course, we're going to dis-amalgamate unions, we are going to allow them to dis-amalgamate,' when all the management theory says about organisations that you need to have a customer focus, that is, union members; you need to provide services, that is, services for union members; and the greater your revenue stream, that is, the larger the union, the greater potential you have to provide these services. This is somehow excommunicate anathema to opposition members. What they want to see is thousands of small unions. In fact, they would love to see an enterprise with 50 members have its own union. Well, I just do not understand it. I just do not understand why they want to attack ordinary people and their conditions of work this way. It doesn't make sense in management terms or organisational terms and it is a vicious attack on ordinary people. I was saying that workers have made a lot of sacrifices. I believe they have. They have seen a whole revolution occur in the workplace. As I have said, they have seen the demarcations go which used to provide them a measure of security, if you like, a measure of employmentnot something that I would justify. They have seen multi skilling come in. They have had to go back and get extra skills-be trained and re-trained. They have seen downsizing. They have Wednesday, 20 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1427 seen massive productivity increases. This is again a difference between a Labor government and a Liberal government: we believe that through work organisation, through new ways and better ways of doing it, through capital equipment, you can dramatically increase productivity, as we have. The other way we can increase productivity is to make labour cheaper. That is the conservative way. We reject that. We have seen lots of organisations downsize. BeforeI came to this place, I worked for Telecom. There have been massive changes and downsizing tnere and changes at a rate and pace that have almost been dysfunctional. That is not unique. It has been occurring right throughout Australia. People have adapted and coped and I congratulate them for that. I congratulate them for their positive approach. They have responded well to these changes. As this report suggests, enterprise bargaining is here to stay under a Labor government. Its reach will be increased dramatically. Ordinary men and women of Australia are not going to be disadvantaged in the process and we will not attack worker organisations. The enterprise bargaining report is a good report. As many people as possible should get hold of a copy of the report and they will find that the government has done well. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Lindsay) adjourned.
