I will paraphrase a few of the that so excited was the government’s backcomments he made as I think they are parbench, the Liberal and National party memticularly relevant today. He said that back in bers, that none of them are going to speak on 1996, during the TV leaders debate-the it. None of them are prepared to front up. famous debate where we had John Howard None of them are in the House at the moand Paul Keating debating issues of the statement to speak on this bill and I believe none of the nation-John Howard made some inhave put their name down to speak on this teresting remarks at that time. In his concludbill. So excited, so enthused, so well coning remarks, he said that the Keating govnected and in touch with the community, ernment had been in office for 13 years, that they just do not bother to speak. Maybe they it was arrogant and remote and that there was have nothing to say on fuel retailing. Maybe a widening gap between rich and poor. He they do not understand just how much pressaid that we had the worse current account sure fuel prices put on ordinary families. I do deficit in the world-and I will forgive you if not want to say too many words about it, but you start to laugh as I go through these, Mr maybe they are like the member for WenDeputy Speaker McMullan-and that there tworth, who unfortunately made a gaffe by was a growing social division.

That is not only into this place and do something. You would the situation that people face today, but it is not have to be too cynical to make the judgeeven worse.

203,The Speaker,"Order! It being 9.30Monday, 14 August 2006 ----Mr Jenkins took the chair at 4 pm. Corporations and Financial Services Committee Report Debate resumed from 19 June, on motion by Ms Burke: That the House take note of the report. Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (4.00 pm)-It gives me great pleasure to make some further remarks on this valuable and, I would say, far-reaching, timely and adventurous report entitled Corporate responsibility: managing risk and creating value. Some of the feedback so far is that it has been a very good report, well received by business and that we are setting up for things in the future. Often in this place we are creating legislation after the event, so it is quite nice to be ahead of the game in some respects. I do want to say, though, that it is quite frustrating to be involved in so many committee reports that are ignored by this parliament. I have been involved in several really good, longreaching and breathtaking reports that have just sat on the shelf and nobody has paid any attention to. SoI hope that, in this area of corporate social responsibility, some people will take note and actually put into implementation some of the 29 recommendations that are contained in this report. At the outset, what do we mean by corporate social responsibility? It means many things to many different people. On a flippant level, people think of a corporation being a good social citizen by donating money to philanthropic services. Many corporations came along and said what great citizens they were because they had donated their staff’s time to various charities. That is laudable but it does not mean that they are a corporately responsible organisation. Labor members of the committee asked for this inquiry because corporations are changing. Some of our corporations nowadays are larger than, and have greater wealth than, some nation states. They are entities that can have a significant impact upon our society, our culture, the environment and even upon political process. The massive growth in business and international trade make the external impacts of corporations greater than ever, and with that comes costs, as well as benefits, to society. To put into context what we mean by this, I quote from the supplementary report by Labor members: The Labor members consider that corporate responsibility is fundamentally an issue of sustainability. Corporate responsibility is not primarily about charity or company philanthropy. The World Business Council on Sustainable Development provides a useful definition: “Corporate [social] responsibility is the commitment of business to contribute to sustainable development, working with employees, their families, the local community and society at large to improve their quality of life.” So we say this is going to be the reach of corporations. We believe, in the long run, that they should look at reporting upon these initiatives; indeed, it is in their own best interests. In a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, BP Group Chief Executive, Lord Brown, recently stated: MAIN COMMITTEE Good, successful business is part of society, and exists to meet society’s needs. That is the purpose of business at the highest level. So businesses at the highest level are recognising that they do have responsibility to our society at a greater level. When we look at corporate social responsibility we ask: who are the stakeholders who must be considered when people are making reports? Who are the individuals that these corporations should be considering, engaging with, talking with and getting back to? Much of the information before the committee looked at environmental impacts. This is vitally important and I do not dispute that at all. One of the things that did disappoint me greatly was that, when corporations look at their responsibilities in the wider context of society, very few actually looked at their employees as being part of the stakeholder group who should be taken into consideration. Indeed, there were many reports about who should be considered in these groups. ‘Stakeholders’ has a very flowing meaning and can have different looks. We need to look at this in a comprehensive manner and say: ‘Yes, various organisations get a tick-a big, gold star. They are great corporate social citizens, at one level, because they have donated money to a charity or because they have made some changes to the environment after ravaging it by whatever means.’ But they did not look at the whole picture; they did not look at the impact upon their staff. I think this is one of the failures of much of the work that has gone on here. It should be about all stakeholders within the corporate social responsibility framework and not just one. You do not just get to pick and choose and say, ‘We’re good corporate citizens because we have done this bit.’ You must be a good corporate citizen across the board. A similar comment was made by the Australian Centre for Corporate Social Responsibility: The Australian Government may have numerous ways in which it encourages corporate social responsibility, but a lack of coherence and focus of initiatives and policies makes this difficult to ascertain. The point I am getting at is that we do not know what we are after and what we are making people do. One of the fundamental findings of this report is that we need good government leadership to say what good corporate social responsibility is, what you need to do to report and what measures you should be reporting on, and these measures should be validated. So many of these reports say, ‘We’ve been great corporate social citizens because we undertook this initiative.’ But there is no validation of the reports to say that the community found that there was a benefit or a service, or that companies, particularly those involved in the mining sector, had left the environment in the way they said they had. One of the other issues investigated at length in this report was directors’ duties. At the time, the committee was looking extensively at James Hardie and the claim made by one of their senior executives that they could not provide compensation because it would be in breach of their directors’ duties. If they provided funds to the people who had been injured, this would actually be against what they needed to do as directors because it would obviously reduce shareholder value. Much of the evidence before us was to say that, no, directors’ duties are not that limited, that they do have what is known as the ‘enlightened self-interest test’ and that there was no need to change the law. The committee came out with this, but I think this is a thing we need to do as a watching brief. Indeed, we need only look at the waxings and wanings of James Hardie to say that directors’ duties should be put more clearly under the spotlight. I think it is beholden upon all of us MAIN COMMITTEE who are now shareholders, by virtue of one thing or another, to also accept the duty of ensuring that directors are fulfilling their obligations not only to us as shareholders but also to the wider society. Never again should we have a corporation saying, ‘We can’t pay compensation to staff we have maimed, and many of whom we have killed through neglect, because it’s going to take away from shareholder value.’ Their staff were stakeholders and they had a responsibility to them. I would like to quote again from the Labor Party’s supplementary report. It states: While this committee cannot make a definitive determination as to the legal parameters of existing directors’ duties in practice, Labor welcomes the ‘enlightened self interest’ interpretation of directors’ duties put forward by a range of business and legal witnesses. We hope such an interpretation is representative of the understanding and practical exercise of directors’ duties in future. As I say, it will be a watching brief. The committee report states: The committee is of the view that the Corporations Act permits directors to have regard for the interests of stakeholders other than shareholders, and that amendment to the Corporations Act is not required. Indeed, this is the case at the moment, but there is no case law on it. Nobody has taken that further step of going to the law and asking, ‘Is this the actual interpretation of it?’ Some very interesting witnesses came forward on this part. But we will need to monitor it. Hopefully, we will never again have a situation like James Hardie, in which directors have less responsibility towards their employees-stakeholders-than they have toward their shareholders. The committee found that we need to encourage sustainable reporting, that we need to encourage businesses at all levels to take it up and that we need to provide parameters in which they can do this. There were many examples of how reports are currently made, what initiatives are looked at, what is reported and what is not reported. The committee was strongly supportive of the GRI measure that is currently being used throughout Europe, but we need to see if it is applicable to Australia. A great deal of the information said that, if we go with mandatory reporting, we will just have a ‘tick a box’ approach in which corporations can say, ‘Yes, we’re good to our staff, we’re good to the environment, we’re good to this and we’re good to that.’ I dispute that, but that seemed to be the weight of evidence coming back to us. But we need to set some benchmarks. We certainly need the government to lay down some foundations that say: ‘This is the way to do it; this is how good businesses will do it in the future.’ Indeed, good businesses are doing it now. Again, the report says: The committee takes the view that although it is not appropriate to mandate the consideration of stakeholder interests into directors’ duties, or to mandate sustainability reporting, there is a need to seriously consider options to encourage greater uptake and disclosure of corporate responsibility activities. One measure that we could start with would be to encourage government departments to be doing their own reporting, and we heard that while there are measures whereby government departments are encouraged to do that, particularly in the area of procurement-and particularly green procurement and green waste-very few of the Commonwealth departments are doing this. The report says: Of particular interest is an example from overseas: the United Kingdom industry-led organisation Business in the Community, a network which works with business to develop practical and sustainable solutions to manage and embed responsible business practice. MAIN COMMITTEE I think this could be adopted now and we should ask the Australian government to look at the recommendations in the report and provide seed funding for such a network in Australia. wishing to embarrass the Clerk of the Committee, the chair wishes to indicate that by the wonder and means of information technology, the Assistant Votes Officer, who is cocooned somewhere in the bowels of this building, has advised the Chair that the member for Chisholm spoke with leave of the committee as the original proposer of the motion and has not closed the debate. The Chair has acted in the belief, confidently, that the Main Committee had no objection to such course of action. tee on Corporations and Financial Services entitled, Corporate responsibility: managing risk and creating value. The committee’s inquiry closely examined the increasingly important corporate governance issues facing Australian companies today. In the past, the corporate world often relegated corporate responsibility from an environmental and social perspective to one or two paragraphs in their annual reports. Generally, the view was that the only thing of value to a business was the bottom line-that is, financial profit or loss-and social and/or environmental issues were not given due consideration. In the past, corporate responsibility was not viewed as profit-making within the business structure, and subsequently was not considered an important aspect of business operations. Increasingly, however, corporate responsibility is being viewed with much greater emphasis and importance by Australia’s business community and, indeed, by corporations globally. Often the term is applied somewhat erroneously to describe charitable deeds by a company-a donation to a good cause or sporting sponsorship, for example-but corporate and social responsibility should go well beyond that. The term is best described in practice as a company or organisation considering, managing and balancing the economic, social and environmental impact of its activities. This is also referred to as triple bottom line reporting or accounting, and our committee found that over the past decade corporate responsibility has moved and developed practical mechanisms for companies to assess and manage their nonfinancial risks and maximise their long-term financial value. We have seen in recent years how companies are increasingly coming under pressure from consumers and their own shareholders to consider the social and environmental impacts of their business decisions. We have witnessed a new group of investors who believe in the concept of socially responsible investments, challenging companies to consider their ethical and moral obligations to the community. Thus, the demand for greater corporate responsibility is being driven at contrasting ends of the corporate world by consumers and investors. One example which best underlines my strong view on corporate responsibility is the manner in which vegetable growers have been treated by some in corporate Australia. When the fast-food chain McDonald’s chose early last year to cut a contract for potatoes from my electorate in north-west Tasmania in preference to imports, it raised in many of my constituents’ minds the question of whether such corporations do have a social conscience. That decision by McDonald’s has had long-term ramifications for the vegetable industry not only in Tasmania but throughout Australia, particularly when one considers it was all done for an estimated additional profit of $4 million Australia-wide or just a few extra cents per packet of french fries. It gave rise to the fair dinkum food campaign, which I am proud to support, and it MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Notices

205,Mr Baker (Braddon) (4.11 Pm),"I also rise to speak on the report of the Joint Commitbrought attention to the failure of large corporations to support the communities from which they profit. My complaint against a corporation such as McDonald’s is that they did not once stop to consider, as a major buyer of produce in Australia, that they have a duty to consider the effect their actions would have on the long-term viability of an important industry such as Australia’s vegetable industry, nor did they stop to consider the effect their actions would have on other communities within Australia. Another example of where I suggest there is an opportunity to encourage a greater sense of corporate responsibility is the wholesale destruction of rainforests in such places as the Amazon and Borneo. Also, in my home state of Tasmania, the local forest industry, which employs directly and indirectly over 10,000 workers, adheres to world’s best practice: it sets a standard. However, the Tasmanian forest industry has to compete with imports from overseas, timber that has not been harvested in accordance with the world’s best practices, timber that has been harvested from forests using the ‘cut and burn’ method, where no attempt is made to renew the resources and where dangerous workplace practices are the norm. We have to compete at home as Australian furniture and paper manufacturers look for the cheapest timber. I believe there is a case for Australian companies to decide that they will only use timber that has been harvested in accordance with world’s best practice. Thinking globally, there is a case to be made to other countries to be more discerning in their choice of timber and woodchips. RecentlyI visited a 100-year-old timber mill in my electorate and one of the directors made an interesting remark on those who protested against the forestry industry. He said that protesters would be out in the streets with their placards one day and buying a piece of furniture the next day made from timber that originally was a tree in the Amazon rainforest, whose trees, in a frightening manner, are being wiped out in grave numbers. We all hold the environment close to our heart, but there is a real inequity here. In my view, this is certainly a case where many companies at the national and international level should come under some pressure to ensure that the wood products that they are buying are from a renewable resource harvested in accordance with world’s best practice. Corporate responsibility is not about dictating to companies that they cannot make decisions that are in the best interests of their shareholders but about encouraging companies to consider the social and/or environmental impacts of their actions as part of the decision making process. Along with that comes transparency in their annual reports. Along with that comes a movement away from their only emphasis being on profit and the financial aspect of reporting. Throughout this inquiry many of the companies and directors involved demonstrated that they are prepared to listen to the views of stakeholders, which was refreshing. This reinforces the finding of our committee’s inquiry that the vast majority of Australian company directors are moving forwards, not backwards. This view essentially allows directors to consider and act upon legitimate interests of stakeholders other than shareholders to the extent that these interests are relevant to the corporation. One could never give a better example than the mining industry, especially with Australia’s vast resources. Some have described corporate responsibility as an insurance policy, a defence against bad publicity from perhaps unrelated events or decisions. The public, however, is becoming more and more cynical of corporate philanthropy, so it goes beyond that. Corporate responsibility in Australia is still in its develMAIN COMMITTEE opmental stages and, in the course of the inquiry, the committee was encouraged by the evidence of increasing engagement by Australian companies and government agencies with sustainable practices and sustainability reporting. However, as a nation and as a country we still have a long way to go. There is still much progress to be made and it is important that the Australian government and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, where appropriate, continue to monitor this progress. The committee strongly supports further successful engagement in the voluntary development and wide adoption of corporate responsibility. The committee believes that the recommendations contained in this report will play an important part in progressing the future of corporate responsibility in Australia and making our great nation even better. ments on the report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services entitled Corporate responsibility: managing risk and creating value. This was a very interesting and stimulating inquiry. The inquiry was initiated by Senator Wong. I would like to thank her for taking the initiative to refer this matter to the committee because it certainly did turn out to be an interesting inquiry. My particular area of interest in the inquiry was that of directors’ duties. The honourable member for Chisholm referred to the ongoing debate and the various submissions before the committee on directors’ duties. The motivating factor for that emphasis on directors’ duties was, as the honourable member for Chisholm indicated, the statements by the chairman of James Hardie that they had no choice but to take a very hard line with the victims of asbestosis because they were restricted in their directors’ duties to only acting in the best interests of their shareholders and not necessarily in the best interests of their employees or former employees. The chairman of James Hardie called for a safe harbour to allow directors to take the interests of other shareholders into view. Corporations Law is quite specific as to a director’s duties. It states: A director ... of a corporation must exercise their powers and discharge their duties with ... care and diligence ... Section 181 of the Corporations Act 2001 adds two other requirements. It requires directors to act (a) ‘in good faith in the best interests’ of their corporations, and (b) for a good purpose. The Corporations Act also sets out a business judgment rule. A director can rely on the business judgment rule to show that they have carried out their responsibilities. They need to show that they have made the judgment in good faith for proper purposes, did not have a material personal interest in the subject under consideration, informed themselves about the subject matter of the judgment to the extent they reasonably believed to be appropriate, and rationally believed that the judgment was in the best interest of the corporation. It is fair to say that the majority of people making a submission to the inquiry did not support the view of the chairman of James Hardie that a safe harbour is required. The majority of people, including some very learned experts in the field, had the view that the current law was more than adequate to protect directors taking an enlightened approach to their decisions and taking into account the interests of other stakeholders as well as those of the corporation. Some, especially non-government organisations, called for a more prescriptive approach requiring directors to take other stakeholders into account and putting a positive duty on directors to act not only in the interests of the corporation but also in the interests of the wider society. That is not something that the committee or I support. That would open a Pandora’s MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Committees
206,Mr Bowen (Prospect) (4.19 Pm),"I will take this opportunity to make a few brief combox. It would raise a great deal of questions as to directors’ duties and bring in a great deal of uncertainty as directors went about their task of running companies. The Labor members of parliament on the committee decided not to recommend a change in directors’ duties at this time. We feel, however, that the issue must be kept closely monitored. If it is necessary to go down this road, if it is necessary to clarify directors’ duties to remove doubt that directors have a responsibility to or an entitlement to act on behalf of other stakeholders, I personally would be attracted to the model adopted by the American Law Institute in rule 2.01(b) that directors and managers may have regard to ethical considerations that reasonably could be regarded as appropriate for the responsible conduct of their business. This was best outlined to the committee by Professor Paul Redmond of the Faculty of Law at the University of New South Wales. Perhaps unlike other evidence that the committee heard, Professor Redmond’s evidence put the case that there was not a rich elaboration of common law on this subject and that the guidance for directors is scant when one looks at the cases that have been before the courts in recent years. I must say I was very tempted by Professor Redmond’s argument, but we have decided to leave it for the time being. I stress that this matter may need to be re-examined if we see more directors coming forward, claiming to be straightjacketed by directors’ duties and claiming that they cannot act on behalf of other stakeholders such as people who have been very severely affected by asbestosis, mesothelioma and other diseases as a result of the actions of a corporation. During this inquiry we were reminded of the very good work that has been conducted by corporations and non-government organisations in the field of corporate responsibility. I was attracted, for example, to the work of Oxfam and their international Mining Ombudsman. Oxfam agreed with my suggestion to them during the hearings that it would be better if this role were carried out by government and not by them-it would have more weight and more official status. One day we may get to the level where the international Mining Ombudsman is run by government and not by Oxfam. That is not to take away from the very good work that they do. Good work in corporate responsibility is being done by companies across the field in Australian industry. I would like to thank the committee staff. This was an onerous inquiry. The travel was extensive. I think the committee made it to every capital city except Darwin to hear evidence, so the task was substantial. To Dr Marinac, to Kelly Paxman, to Stephen Palethorpe and to the other staff, I would like to add my thanks to those that have been expressed by other committee members. I commend the report to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee Report Debate resumed. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (4.26 pm)-I support the motion that this report by the Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee be noted. I acknowledge the contribution of my committee colleagues and state that they were outstandingly facilitated and even improved by the staff of our secretariat. The report on the payment system is an important one. The payment system has been of some contention because of the recent reforms by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The payment system itself refers to arrangements that allow conMAIN COMMITTEE sumers and businesses to exchange payment for goods and services. Those instruments include cash, cheques and electronic funds transfers via both credit and debit cards. Non-cash payments obviously require arrangements and movements between accounts at different financial institutions, and of course a fee attaches to those transactions. The Reserve Bank of Australia has regulatory responsibility for that payment system in order to control risk for the consumer-for all parties, in fact-and to promote efficiency and competition. It also has the role of facilitating the system as banker to the Australian government. A major issue for the Reserve Bank, and therefore the committee, was that the payment system must give clear price signals that enable informed choices by the consumer-and that is a laudable aim. It is important, too, that the free operation of the system is possible through the removal of restrictions that might limit entry into that payment system and therefore stifle competition. The reforms initiated by the Reserve Bank since 2000 will be reviewed again by the Reserve Bank in 2007. There has been some debate that that review undertaken should be not by the Reserve Bank but by some independent arbiter. However, the committee found that this process was most acceptable and considered that the Reserve Bank is the most appropriate body to do this. It is evident that the Reserve Bank does have the expertise. It also has the access to data that is essential for the proper scrutiny of this system. Personally, I doubt that any other body could act totally independently in such a role, given that the banks themselves and financial institutions are such a well-organised and powerful group of lobbyists when protecting their profits and interests. SoI am pleased that the committee has recommended that the Reserve Bank do its own review. The other problem that was looked at was that there was a situation for consumers that did not seem fair. The report validates for them that the RBA’s activities go to their best interests. The concerns of the RBA and the committee arose from the fact that credit card transactions were in fact cheaper than EFTPOS transactions. That does not make sense. EFTPOS has lower risk attached to it, because EFTPOS transactions are expenditure from cash that is already held in savings accounts; plus, when EFTPOS is used in stores to access cash or payments, the banks save quite a deal on administration and agency costs in terms of wagesunlike credit card transactions, where the risk is higher and the validity rests on one signature. In Australia, that risk translates to $100 million per annum through credit card fraud. A cynic such as me would suspect that this unusual fee structure, which is certainly out of line with what one would expect, is in fact convenient for credit card issuers because it would make credit cards more attractive to customers and easier to use. There is no pin attached to them-simply a signature. That means of course it is very easy for a consumer to incur debt without any pain and without any difficulty, and, for most people, that debt then goes on to attract interest or fees. It is important to note that the total of these fees from interest on credit cards has actually overtaken the interest paid on mortgages in this country. Australians are carrying $36 billion of debt at the moment, on 13 million credit cards, and one would imagine that, with the pressure on household budgets from increasing petrol prices and interest rate increases, this debt can only go up. Of that credit card debt, $26 billion attracts interest-$26 billion of the $36 billion is not just paid back on time; it sits there as a debt with interest attached. Banks, of course, look forward to that revenue growth; and it certainly benefits them. MAIN COMMITTEE Submissions to the committee that opposed the Reserve Bank of Australia’s reforms to correct this imbalance and make EFTPOS cheaper suggested that the resultant savings to merchants from reducing those interchange fees were not being passed on to consumers. The committee found no evidence to substantiate that claim or refute it. However, clearly, when merchant fees are high, it is a given that those costs will be passed on to consumers via higher prices. The savings of $580 million that have been made since interchange fees have been reduced can only benefit both merchants and customers alike. Credit cards clearly hold advantages for those who use them as a payment instrument rather than as a credit instrumentthose who pay them off every month without attracting any interest or fee. Those people are usually the wealthiest people in our communities, and they usually gain rewards such as frequent flier points for using their credit card in that way. They are virtually being paid to use their credit card by those unfortunate people who fall into the credit card debt trap and therefore continually pay interest. The burden of meeting those bonus obligations and reward points is passed on to those who can afford it least. The major aspect and achievement of this report is the committee’s recommendation that all parties involved work together to improve the technology so that the payment system is protected-including the protection of the integrity of all those payments by implementing pin based authorisation for credit cards and not just requiring a signature. Visa recently said that this would be quite easy, that it is possible, that the technology is there and that most people are set up to do that straight away. I hope banks and financial instisutions embrace that recommendation. Implementing online functionality for EFTPOS cards is another part of our recommendations. Anyone with teenage children will know that you cannot book a concert or a ticket to a big show without a credit card. Many young people cannot really afford those credit cards and, unless they have a mum or dad who will do that transaction for them, they do not have the ability to use their savings accounts online. That is another debt trap for many people. SoI hope the recommendation on that is embraced. There is also a recommendation on the adoption of chip technology. I congratulate the Reserve Bank of Australia. The report clearly shows that it put the interests of consumers foremost in its role as the Australian banker to the Australian government and the Australian people. I look forward to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration hearing on monetary policy with the Reserve Bank later this week, and I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding service of Governor Macfarlane. It has been a pleasure and a very instructive experience to work with him and to observe his input into the economy of this nation. Certainly, his dealings with the committee are always ones we look forward to and learn so much from. I also congratulate Deputy Governor Stevens on his upcoming appointment as Governor. The Australian people have been well served by both these gentlemen, who continue to demonstrate their independence and their devotion to upholding the interests of this nation. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. MAIN COMMITTEE Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Report Debate resumed. which was tabled in the House by the honourable member for Fadden, on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, on the subject of Australia’s relations with the Republic of Korea and developments on the Korean peninsula. I raised some of the human rights issues created for Australia by the situation on the Korean peninsula, and I will return to those. I do not think any report by this parliament on the Korean peninsula can avoid the circumstances of the last few months with regard to missile tests from North Korea and, in general, the security and strategic situation affecting all of the people of North-East Asia. I spoke in particular earlier about the dilemma of getting aid to the starving people of North Korea without strengthening the regime of the so-called Dear Leader, whose irrational policies are the reason that North Korea cannot feed itself. I spoke also about the situation of at least 100,000 Korean refugees in China who China refuses to recognise as refugees and who as a result cannot be helped by the UNHCR. Instead, these starving refugees face the risk of being sent back to North Korean labour camps-in many cases to certain execution. This further opportunity in the Main Committee will allow me to analyse some of the broader issues raised by the report relating to the security situation on the Korean peninsula and Australia’s possible role in finding a solution to the Korean impasse. The North Korean regime is a new phenomenon in the world. It is not just a dictatorship, not just a rogue regime and not just a failed state. It is a criminal regime, a regime which acts in a consciously and deliberately criminal manner, with the sole objective of keeping itself in power so that its leaders can live in corruption and luxury. This is a regime which engages in corrupt and illegal currency transactions, as was recently shown in the Banco Delta Asia affair. One of the Macau casinos was the place where it was laundering all of this North Korean counterfeiting of other people’s currency. This false currency was deliberately printed by the sovereign government of another country-not by the Sopranos, not by some crooks, but by the government of another country deliberately and fraudently faking other country’s banknotes. North Korea was counterfeiting the money of other countries and laundering it through a Macau casino in order to have access to vast amounts of foreign currency. This regime in Pyongyang which has dealt drugs out of its embassies in Europe, which has tried to smuggle heroin into Australia, which has assassinated South Korean cabinet ministers and which has abducted dozens of people from Japan so they can be trained as spies-dozens of totally innocent people who might have been walking by the beach or been in a supermarket. They were just picked up by North Koreans and taken to that country completely against their will, never to be seen or heard of by their families. While the Soviet bloc was still in existence it was assumed that North Korea was an orthodox communist regime, albeit a rather strange one with its bizarre personality cult of Kim Il Sung. It was assumed that when the Soviet Union collapsed North Korea would go the way of East Germany and Albania, in the dustbin of history, but instead the regime survived. It was assumed that when Kim Il Sung died the regime he had built would then collapse. But instead when the great leader finally passed on in 2004, power passed to his even more bizarre son MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Committees
207,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (4.35 Pm),"Earlier today I spoke briefly on the reportKim Jong Il, who has raised the regime to new heights of criminality. The most alarming aspect of Kim Jong Il’s regime over the past decade has been its determination to develop nuclear weapons, its defiance of the international community and its reckless acts in testing its missiles by firing them towards and over Japan. This is the obscenity of a country in which at least one million people starved to death during the great famine of the 1990s-a famine which was certainly aggravated by natural disasters but which was caused fundamentally by the regime’s own economic policies. So here we have a country in which a million people starved to death in the 1990s. We in Australia, this vast prosperous country, are close to it. This is a regime which is, at the same time, using every bit of revenue corruptly obtained from foreign currency counterfeiting and from selling drugs all around the world to develop nuclear weapons. In 2000, Kim Jong Il assured the then US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, that the missile tests North Korea conducted in 1998 would be the last and that North Korea would participate in multinational talks to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. He gave similar promises to the then South Korean President, Kim Dae-jung, in response to South Korea’s ‘Sunshine Policy’, a well-intentioned-some would say futile-attempt to get North Korea to behave like a responsible member of the international community. But I must say that I understand the South Koreans. They opened up towards North Korea, they tried to engage them economically, and it was not clear at the time that this was a futile policy. It was done with good intent and we have to give the South Koreans credit for that. Unfortunately, North Korea instead pressed ahead in secret with the development of nuclear weapons, pocketing the various bribes given to it by the US, Japan, China and South Korea as rewards for its promises of good behaviour. No-one who is familiar with North Korea believes that Kim Jong Il had the slightest intention of keeping the promises he gave to Secretary Albright or to the South Korean President. As Nicholas Eberstadt, the Henry Wendt scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in the Wall Street Journal in July: Plainly put, North Korea’s survival strategy is a policy of international military extortion. North Korea’s rulers have concluded that it is safest to finance the survival of their state through the international export of strategic insecurity and military menace. Consequently, the leadership, as a matter of course, strives to generate sufficiently grave international tensions, and present sufficiently credible security threats, to wrest a flow of essentially coerced transfers from neighbours and other international targets sufficient in volume to assure the continuation of what Pyongyang describesmonstrouslyas “our own style of socialism”. To date, Pyongyang’s predatory security strategy has actually worked rather well. After all, the DPRK, unlike so many other communist regimes, has neither vanished from the face of the earth nor compromised its claim to totalitarianism. I say that as a person who has a long record of opposition to communism but who can distinguish between the realistic form of it practised in China, just across the North Korean border, and the monstrous injustices that are being done in North Korea. In my view, the security crisis in North Korea cannot be resolved without addressing the heart of the problem: the terrible crimes the North Korean regime is committing against its own people-and there is an axiomatic link between North Korea’s reckless external behaviour and the ruthless character of its role. MAIN COMMITTEE My friend Carl Gershman, the Chairman of the National Endowment for Democracy, who was here in Australia today, argued in the Washington Post in 2003 that the government in North Korea is fully aware of the famine-so much so, that it deliberately uses it as a weapon against parts of the population that are classified as least loyal. It is estimated that, in the system of political prisons and labour camps in North Korea, 200,000 people are being held at the moment and that in the last decade 400,000 prisoners have perished in the harsh conditions of the camps. In keeping with the dictate of North Korea’s founder, Kim Il Sung, that class enemies ‘must be eliminated through three generations’, parents, children, grandchildren and other relatives are sent to the camps. In December 2002 the Far Eastern Economic Review published a satellite photo of one of these camps, in Haengyong county, which holds 50,000 prisoners who are regularly tortured and executed. It will one day probably become as infamous as some of the concentration camps in Cambodia or Germany. In negotiations with the South Korean regime, prudence and simple morality demand that any agreement should include measures to protect the refugees that I have talked about and measures to end the famine. I believe that the proposals of the current South Korean government-some of the arguments recently made by the South Korean foreign minister-and a resolution that is before the US congress neatly mix this concern with security and human rights. We have to remember that one of the great developments in Europe in the 1990s was the Helsinki agreements. A Helsinki agreement for the Korean peninsula would end the silence on North Korean human rights abuses, increase international pressure on the regime and commit the signatories to a different vision of North Korea from what now exists. It may not ultimately liberate the North Korean people from the terrible crimes that are being committed against them, but we thought the same in eastern Europe. I believe that Helsinki agreements for North-East Asia, particularly for the Korean peninsula, would be a very good development towards the end of the liberation of the persecuted people of North Korea. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. Afghanistan Debate resumed from 9 August, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the following document: Australian Defence Force commitment to Afgahistan-Ministerial Statement, 9 August 2006. statement by the Prime Minister regarding the deployment of additional Australian troops to Afghanistan. This statement was supported by the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives last Wednesday. Before noting the additional deployment that was spoken of in that statement, I pay tribute to those troops who have already been deployed. A number have been deployed not only from the 1st Brigade in Darwin but also from your own area, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, as I understand it. I know that you have also participated in a number of farewells for the troops who have been deployed to Afghanistan. troops have been injured today? MAIN COMMITTEE",165,Committees
208,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (4.45 Pm),I rise to support the motion to take note of the,167,Ministerial Statements
209,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lindsay),"Is the member for Barton aware that someon that, but we express our appreciation and we recognise the contribution of our troops around the globe. Currently in Afghanistan there are approximately 240 personnel in the special forces task group, made up of SAS members, commandos, an incident response regiment and also logistics personnel. They are supported in their operations by two Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment. That group-consisting of approximately 110 personnel involved in air crew, maintenance and support-is doing a tremendous job already in Iraq in particularly trying and increasingly dangerous circumstances. The level of violence in Afghanistan increases as a result of a number of factors, including the climate. As I understand it, moving into the warmer months is itself a cause for enhanced violence. There are other factors that I will refer to briefly. As I indicated, I have had the opportunity of farewelling several deployments to Afghanistan. One of those occasions was in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, where I met up with you there. To see the obvious emotion of not only the troops who were leaving but also their friends and their families is itself a moving experience. But you appreciate what those troops are doing for their country and indeed for the prospects of those who live in Afghanistan: giving them the prospect of a better life is vitally important. You also appreciate the impact on their families and the tremendous contribution that the families of our troops make to the missions undertaken by our soldiers. The reality is Afghanistan and the events that unfold in Afghanistan are vitally important to our regional security. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, Afghanistan is, if you like, the central office of the primary terrorist organisations of al-Qaeda, working in cahoots with the Taliban. There is no doubt that that is, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, terror central. It is probably the general region where Osama bin Laden is located, perhaps in the border area between Afghanistan and Pakistan. There is no doubt that Afghanistan has provided a training base for terrorists in South-East Asia; several people charged with terrorism offences in Australia have also been trained in Afghanistan. In other words, Afghanistan has been, and clearly has been proven to have been, a base for international terrorism. It is also the centre of a massive opium crop valued at in the order of $3 billion a year, and that crop finances criminal, insurgent and terrorist activity generally in Afghanistan, as well as the fundamentalist organisations who ply the trade in order to raise funds. Unquestionably, it is also being used to fund terrorist organisations in the South-East Asian region. As well as the likelihood of the opium and its ultimate product, heroin, ending up on the streets of our cities and other cities in the world, the revenue from that atrocious trade is unquestionably being used to support terrorist networks around the globe, in particular in the South-East Asian region. So our troops have been engaged in a vitally important exercise. Their numbers, as was announced last Wednesday, are appropriately going to be increased. A reconstruction task force will be deployed. Originally, it was intended that there would be about 240 personnel as part of that reconstruction task force. Approximately half of those would have been engineers, as well as support from a company of infantry and a light armoured company group. In view of the escalating violence in Afghanistan, the opposition supported the announcement of the additional troop deployment made last Wednesday by the Prime Minister. There will be an additional 30 troops with the regional task force and there MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Ministerial Statements
210,Mr Mcclelland,"Yes, I have been briefed on that. We are waiting for the full detailswill be an additional company group of approximately 120 personnel to provide enhanced security. We welcome that deployment. All we would say is that, in view of the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan, we would obviously like to see that security detachment put in place before the reconstruction team is deployed there. It is unquestionably a dangerous environment. As I have indicated, there are climatic conditions involved. Just as the expression in the United States regarding the warning of an Indian summer when there were warm days came about through the likelihood of an Indian attack, the reality is that that seems to be the situation in Afghanistan-the violence increases during the warmer summer months; in the colder periods it decreases as the groupings move back to their mountain hide-outs. So climatic conditions can increase the violence. Indeed, as a United Nations report indicated recently, so too has the opium trade that has continued to flourish, and that is funding so much of the activity of insurgents-insurgents who are motivated by their political ideology, indeed fanaticism, as well as criminal groups who are themselves wanting to maintain their ability to continue to make profits from the evil opium trade. In Afghanistan there is a mix of violence from those political elements as well as from the criminal elements, and that is a very dangerous cocktail and a very dangerous environment for our troops to be deployed in. Having said that, and for those reasons, we fully support the additional troops that the government has announced. We note that the government has announced that it will review the troop deployment, the nature of the troop deployment and the size of the troop deployment in approximately six months time. That is appropriate. Indeed, it may be necessary before then to review whether that deployment is adequate. Certainly, from the opposition’s point of view, as the Leader of the Opposition said, if it is necessary to supplement that deployment with additional resources, additional troops or additional equipment then the opposition will be fully supportive of that. In that context, as we understand it, the Chinook helicopters will currently be deployed until about April next year. Again, we call on the government to examine whether that deployment of the Chinook helicopters should be continued beyond that time and possibly enhanced. Helicopter support is vitally important to the security of our troops on the ground in terms of surveillance, in terms of backup and in terms of medical evacuation. That is an area in particular where we know the demands on our aviation regiment, but the reality is that they provide a particularly vital resource for our troops in Afghanistan and we ask the government to look at continuing that deployment beyond April next year. There have been concerns expressed in the media about both the integrity and the quality of the Afghani government. They are certainly issues to look at. But the reality is that we cannot ignore the plight of the Afghani people, for the security reasons that I have mentioned but also simply from the point of view of their own security. What they are confronting currently is a situation literally where what you would describe as bandits, standover people, are using extreme violence to enter towns and villages and, through the threat of violence and the actual use of violence or summary executions, obtain the subservience of those in the villages to their will. You cannot allow that situation to occur. What our troops have done already and continue to do is protect ordinary people from the threat of that ruthless violence. That is something that we cannot ignore. Nor can we ignore the fact that the evidence is clear: Afghanistan, as I have indicated, is clearly a base of terrorist activity, with the opium trade and the financing and training of terrorist activity. It is not, and MAIN COMMITTEE it was not when the United Nations supported activity in Afghanistan, based on questionable motives; it is clearly a haven for international terrorism. The Leader of the Opposition in his reply mentioned that it was regrettable that our commitment in Afghanistan was wound back, together with that of the United States and the United Kingdom, as a result of the focus shifting to Iraq. If you recall, the focus shifted to Iraq on the basis of what proved to be failed or false intelligence that there was an imminent threat of the use of weapons of mass destruction, which of course have not been found, whereas from the outset we have constantly been aware of Afghanistan itself being a haven for terrorist activity. There is no question that, had we continued, had these nations generally continued their involvement to the full extent in Afghanistan, we probably would not be seeing the upsurge in violence or the extent of it as a result of the vacuum being filled by the Taliban and the insurgent and criminal groups, who have come into the vacuum to re-establish themselves. It is all very well to talk in terms of the wisdom of hindsight, but perhaps that was a lesson that was too available to ignore. I have also been asked whether Australia, being a small deployment among, I think, 25 countries providing reconstruction teams, will make a difference. Anyone in doubt should simply look at the experience of New Zealand. They have maintained their reconstruction team from the outset. Not only reports but the evidence indicates that, in the region where they have been deployed, they have made a significant contribution. In summary, this is an essential deployment not only from the point of view of giving the people of Afghanistan some prospect of a reasonable life in the future but also from the point of view of international security, in particular Australia’s regional security. We indicate our tremendous pride in our troops, and we also recognise their families. We indicate that we are here and available to provide any support that we need to not only to our troops but also to their families. Heritage) (5.00 pm)-In rising to support the Prime Minister’s statement to the parliament on the Australian Defence Force commitment to Afghanistan, I want to address, firstly, the global challenge that we have to face during the course of our lifetimes and our time of responsibility in this parliament-most particularly in relation to radical Islam and the civil war which is raging within the Islamic world, a radicalism which some in the Islamic community would seek to spread. Secondly, I want to deal with the core strategic points within the Middle East and the areas where we have to address these problems. Thirdly, I want to deal specifically with Afghanistan and the expanded and renewed commitment which the Prime Minister outlined to the House last week. The challenge we face at a global level is derived from a notion within certain streams of Islam-Wahhabism and related elements-which seek to bring forth an Islamic caliphate. Their perception is a long-term one. Their objective is an Islamic based, extremist world. But it is to be achieved over 100 years. It is a patient, considered and utterly ruthless approach to bring about a particular concept of how they believe life should be lived. Their primary target, firstly, is the conversion of mainstream Islam to this radicalised version. Their base for much of the last 15 years has been the hills, the mountains and the villages of Afghanistan. When the Taliban was in power in Kabul what we saw was that Afghanistan was a cradle and a nurturing ground for much of this radical Islam. The strategic objective en route to this notion of MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Ministerial Statements
211,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andan Islamic caliphate was to establish a base in one of the primary Islamic countries. That means the destabilisation and the collapse of society as we know it-whether it is in Saudi Arabia or Egypt; whether it is in Pakistan or Indonesia. The method used to bring about this is twofold: firstly, it is a direct process of destabilisation in these countries themselves, and, secondly, it is about causing the West to disengagemaking sure that, from their perspective, whether it is al-Qaeda or associated groups within the tradition of Wahhabism, the West finds it simply too painful to engage with the Islamic world, the West withdraws, the economies of these countries collapse, there is a collapse in the stability of the governments, and, as a result of that, there is a vacuum and that vacuum is filled through a Taliban style regime. That is the mechanism, the process, which they are seeking to use to bring about, firstly, a beachhead. They had one in Afghanistan. It has been lost, but there is still a significant and profoundly important battle being carried out. Secondly, that is the staging point which they wish to achieve en route to a much more dramatic and much more global conflict. The nature of the conflict is of a civil war within the Islamic world. It is a minority; it is an extreme and absolutely fearless-and I say that unfortunately in the worse sense of the word-minority who have no sense of the meaning of life and who place no value in many cases on their own lives, on those of people of their own faith or on those of people of other faiths. It represents the continuation of a tradition dating back to the most extreme ‘isms’ to have populated our world over the last few centuries, where life can simply be expended. Having said that, and recognising that some members on the other side understand thisthe member for Melbourne Ports has been quite a strong advocate in this fight against global extremism-I think it is incumbent on us to look at what are the strategic battlegrounds that we have to address. In the Middle East today, we range across at least four critical fronts where we have to deal with the support for pluralism, the support for those Arab societies which seek either a secular state or which practise a moderate Islam-in essence, support for mainstream Islam, a religion which has so many positive elements but which allows people of all different persuasions to live life as it should be lived. The first of those areas is Iraq. I briefly mention Iraq, noting that there have been other debates on this topic, but that has been an inextricable element in the campaign-that to walk away from the battleground there, as some would preach, to disengage, would simply be to allow precisely those forces that are seeking to gain control in Afghanistan to gain control in Iraq. Whether one agrees or disagrees with the original rationale for the conflict in Iraq, I think it is an entirely separate question as to whether that now means that we should disengage as an international society, because my view is that that would be simply disastrous. It is a tough, brutal and long task that we are engaged in. The same people who led an unforgiving regime of human rights atrocities have teamed with those linked with al-Qaeda. So the affiliates of Saddam Hussein have linked with the affiliates of al-Qaeda and together they are seeking to destroy stability, they are seeking to destroy progress towards democracy and they are seeking to make their own people victims as a means of achieving that destabilisation in Iraq. So it would be a human rights nightmare and an abomination to walk away, and it would be a strategic catastrophe, I say with great respect to the House. I respect the views of those who do not believe that it was appropriate or the right thing to do to topple Saddam Hussein. I respectfully disagree with that view. I think he was the leader MAIN COMMITTEE of perhaps the worse and most abusive regime with regard to human rights of any in the world over the last 25 years-although he had some stiff competition, I would have to say. That is my view in relation to Iraq. The second area is in relation to Palestine and the Palestinian Authority. We have deep reservations as a nation about the role played by Hamas-that it fails to recognise Israel’s right to exist. I think it is profoundly important as a key to resolution of the conflict that there is a recognition of Israel’s right to exist. I also think, and I have said publicly, that the only guarantee of security for Israel in the long term is the creation of a two-state solution. I think that is fundamental as we go forward. I think there must be a two-state solution-that it is the right thing for people under the Palestinian Authority and it is the right thing as a long-term, critical and indispensable element of guaranteeing Israel’s security. As somebody who has lived in that country, who speaks the language, I have a deep belief in and support for Israel, but I also disagree profoundly with those who would deny the Palestinian people a homeland in the long term, because that is not a solution. That is simply neither right in principle nor is it a solution to the problem there. Moving forwards, I note that the third area is the tragedy in southern Lebanon at the moment. Lebanon was the great hope for the spread of democracy in the Middle East and the colonisation of the southern parts of Lebanon by Hezbollah, which have preyed upon a weak state, has meant that area has become a catalyst for conflict. My hope is that it can be stabilised and that the Hezbollah militia can be disarmed. I think that is a critical element in dealing with a solution towards stability in that area. We have to disengage Syria and Iran from support for this militia, but that is a long-term practice. It is a critical part of the fight. Against all of that background, the crucible for this conflict in many ways has been Afghanistan. That is because that is where the Taliban and al-Qaeda found their roots over the last 15 years, flowing out of-and I confess this-the work of the mujaheddin. They became an illegitimate child thereof. In that context there has been significant progress in terms of the democracy of Afghanistan. What we have seen is real GDP growth of over 12 per cent in the current year. Critically, what we also see is the development of democratic infrastructure. The elements of democratic infrastructure are fundamentally important to giving that country a chance to go forward in the fight to establish its own future. The role of women, particularly the entry of women into Afghanistan’s parliament and councils, is tremendously important. My understanding is that 68 women were elected to the lower house of the Afghanistani parliament and that they took 27 per cent of available seats, with 121 women in elected provincial councils-all of which was once unthinkable. It was simply unthinkable five years ago that perhaps the most oppressive country in its treatment of women would now be a country with a quarter of its representation coming from women. Similarly, since 2001 2.3 million children under the age of five have been vaccinated against polio, almost eradicating that disease. These are elements of real progress, but there is a profound fight. That fight comes from the challenge of al-Qaeda and those linked with the former Taliban regime who have a role in much of rural Afghanistan. They are continuing to try-and in some cases they have had success-to take on the international coalition forces, to take on the work of the United Nations and to take on those people who would seek to improve the quality of life there, to establish democracy and ultimately leave Afghanistan to itself. That is our goal: to have a free and MAIN COMMITTEE functioning Afghanistan. These people who have used, I absolutely acknowledge, in many cases the proceeds of opium and other drug related products to bolster their finances must be stopped. So against that background Australia plays a critical role. We are a small number in terms of presence on the ground, but there is no doubt that our impact has been significant. There have been many conflicts in which we have been directly engaged. Against that background, what this statement has done is commit Australia to provide 150 additional ADF troops to reinforce the reconstruction task force and provide enhanced force protection on the ground. At present the reconstruction task force is working in Oruzgan province, in southern Afghanistan, on reconstruction and community based projects. Its aim is to build the long-term viability of Afghan communities. It is part of winning the war on the ground, not just through military conflict but, much more importantly, through constructive community development. The reconstruction task force will receive an additional 30 members-and these members will include command, security and protection, engineering, administrative support, and tactical and intelligence services personnel-as well as Bushmaster infantry mobility vehicles and Australian light armoured vehicles, or ASLAVs. They will be bolstered by an additional contingent, an infantry company of 120 personnel to provide enhanced force protection-and I have no doubt that some of them will be drawn from your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, from the military bases at Townsville. They put their lives on the line. They serve for a greater cause. I could not express more strongly my profound respect for the work and courage of the Australian Defence Force. Ultimately, they are engaged in a great global mission. It is a mission that is not without controversy-and that is the beauty of our democracy. But I believe that what occurs in Afghanistan is of profound significance to the four conflicts I have outlined in the Middle East. It is of profound significance in helping to lay the foundations for democracy and openness. Nothing is more important in giving the world a chance to defeat the spectre of radical terrorism-radical Islam-and that is how we truly give ourselves an open way forward. stan and the government’s announcement that it will enhance that deployment. I say that as a person who has fiercely opposed the involvement of Australian troops in the invasion of Iraq and, indeed, opposed the decision of the United States and other allies to be involved in that conflict. The situation in Afghanistan is wholly different from that in the Middle East and, in particular, Iraq. Following the 11 September, 2001 attacks in the United States, the evidence clearly identified the involvement of the Taliban and Osama bin Laden’s network, based within the country borders of Afghanistan. It became clear in the months that followed that incident that the Afghani government was not going to take any action whatsoever to restrict or bring to account al-Qaeda and those who were clearly responsible for the organisation and execution of the attacks in the United States. As events subsequently unfolded, it was difficult to disassemble the network that al-Qaeda had established in Afghanistan and the Taliban government that was operating in Kabul. The decision taken, led by the United States, to invade Afghanistan, to change the regime and to seek to bring al-Qaeda operatives to account was supported by both sides of this parliament, by the Australian people and, most tellingly, by an extremely broad coalition of world opinion. It was not just the traditional allies of the United States who supported that decision to MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Ministerial Statements
212,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (5.15 Pm),"I support Australia’s deployment of troops to Afghaniinvade Afghanistan; it was a decision supported by most countries of the world, including most Islamic countries, who understood that the al-Qaeda network that was operating within Afghanistan as a terrorist organisation was a threat to the good order of nation states everywhere. It is a pity that the focus of the response to terrorism was then shifted by an incredibly foolish decision taken by the current American administration, encouraged and supported in part by the current Australian government and the Prime Minister, to divert both resources and attention away from that conflict to an extremely ill-advised invasion of Iraq. That has presented us with a range of other problems that are not the province of this debate, but which I would be happy to have the opportunity to comment on at another time. The decision to scale down the commitment in Afghanistan created a vacuum. The government that was established in Kabul was left very much at the mercy of warlords and interest groups. In the months and years that followed the relocation of American assets from Afghanistan into Iraq, and our decision to remove all of our troops from Afghanistan, that vacuum was filled by a resurgent Taliban and al-Qaeda network and by drug lords. It is difficult, I think, to separate those two. It is hard to fathom where the line between criminals involved in the poppy trade and terrorists merges or separates. Indeed, I think there is a good deal of overlap. I have no doubt in my own mind that the terrorists are quite happy to finance many of their activities through the poppy trade. Equally, I am quite sure that many of the warlords who operate the poppy fields are more than happy to pay protection money to al-Qaeda to ensure that the authorities are not able to cause them any grief. As America and Australia turned their eyes off the ball and ignored that problem in Afghanistan, the Europeans stepped up to the mark. In this debate, we should acknowledge the contribution of the NATO allies, in particular in Europe, who provided a substantial number of troops. Rather than be diverted into that foolish conflict in Iraq, countries such as Germany and France committed substantial defence assets to try to maintain peace and order in Afghanistan. Indeed, for a good part of that time, Germany led the mission in Afghanistan. That is not something most newspapers in Australia would report. The general image at the time was that our European colleagues were somehow letting the side down because they did not want to go and invade Iraq. In fact, our European allies were the people who had their eye on the ball when we took ours off. Even our New Zealand friends had their eye on the ball better than we did. They actually maintained a special forces unit in Afghanistan. I believe we maintained one person-a lieutenant colonel. We had one officer in Afghanistan for that period of time, and that was the token gesture by the Australian government. In April 2004, Kevin Rudd, the shadow minister for foreign affairs, visited Afghanistan. On his return, and as a result of the things he saw and the advice he was given whilst he was in Afghanistan, Labor called for a return of Australian troops to Afghanistan. I am pleased, belatedly, that the Howard government have seen the need to do that and have come on board. This is not the first deployment. We already have a substantial number of SAS troops in Afghanistan. However, this deployment is a substantial boost to that existing deployment. Afghanistan has had a very troubled history for far too long and the people of Afghanistan have suffered at the hands of a series of repressive and harmful regimes. They deserve to have an opportunity for peace and prosperity, the same as the rest of us on this planet. I hope that MAIN COMMITTEE the efforts that we are now a part of will help produce that for them, as we endeavour to reduce the influence of the warlords and the terrorists who are camped within that nation. This deployment has sometimes been referred to as a peacekeeping deployment. Its official title is a reconstruction task force. I think that masks the true situation. Currently, there is not very much that is peaceful about Afghanistan. There is certainly plenty of reconstruction that is needed, but this is not a building site; it is a war zone. It is a war zone that is hot. It is a war zone in which there are, on a daily basis, clashes and killings on both sides of the conflict. We are endorsing an action by the government to send troops to what I think is the most dangerous environment that we currently have people deployed to. There is no doubt that downtown Baghdad and other places in Iraq are dangerous, but I think the deployment we are now committing to in Afghanistan is, without doubt, the most dangerous deployment that we have sent Australian troops to. The fact that it is dangerous has been recognised by the government in its decision-I think, correctly-to bolster the number of soldiers who are going to protect the engineers. It should be said that the engineers are not civilian engineers. They are army combat engineers. I am sure that they are quite capable of looking after themselves. But the government has correctly decided to increase the number of infantry troops that we will be sending to protect them. I believe that number now stands at 120. I am quite happy to say at this juncture that, if circumstances indicate that that is insufficient to provide the necessary security, we should not hesitate to provide additional troops or additional resources that they may need to ensure their protection. We already have somewhere in the order of 200 special forces in the country and they have been involved in some of the most difficult conflicts that have been undertaken. Very little is reported about what goes on there, and I think that is a pity. We have a bit of a mushroom treatment within the Australian Defence community, I think, when it comes to these matters. There are good reasons why a whole host of things, when it comes to security, are not made public, but if you compare the cone of silence that is placed over Australian activities with that which applies to either the UK forces or the United States forces you have to wonder what it is that makes so many things so secret for so long when it comes to Australian troops. I think there is a risk that the defence community and the government run in maintaining that cone of silence for too long and in too many areas. It is a risk of public cynicism or lack of support. I do not think that exists at the moment, and I am not trying to raise that as a concern today, but I would urge the government and the defence community to take the people of Australia into their confidence more on these matters, to explain more fully the role that our troops are performing and, when we have had incidents-and I believe there have been 11 in Afghanistan where Australian soldiers have been wounded-to allow the Australian people to have some idea about what has happened to those Australians, because a lot of Australians are concerned about that and they do not want to be just fobbed off. If you were in the United States, you would actually find out about it. You would find out about it probably because there would be media embedded. But, if not, you would find out about it because the US congressional system would ensure that the hearings on the hill would reveal it. We do not have that process here and I think the government should be less secretive about these things than it is. I think the defence community should be less secretive. MAIN COMMITTEE There was a very good article in yesterday’s Sunday Age written by Tom Hyland about this deployment, where he correctly characterised it as a conflict rather than a peacekeeping activity. He made mention of the fact that some of the troops that are being sent to provide protection are coming from 5/7RAR. He quoted from their official website as to what their role is. I think it is worth repeating because it draws into sharp focus the fact that this is a deployment in a difficult situation that is life threatening. This is not simply a peacekeeping activity. Part of the reason we know that is that the 5/7RAR are being sent to provide protection, and this is what their job is, quoted from their website in Tom Hyland’s article: To seek out and close with the enemy by shock action, fire power and manoeuvre, to kill or capture them, to seize and hold ground by day or night regardless of weather or terrain. That ain’t peacekeeping, but that is the fact of life in Afghanistan at the moment. The area to which the Australians have been deployed is one of the more lawless parts of Afghanistan, and it is going to be important that our Australian troops are provided with all of the support they require in materiel as well. I know that the government have a couple of Chinooks in Afghanistan to provide support to the existing contingent. I would urge the government to review the level of support for the expanded contingent to ensure that there is immediate access to airlift capability if needed either to evacuate the injured or to quickly relocate troops if they find themselves in a difficult environment. Equally, there needs to be the necessary support with fire power, with air cover and with artillery. We do not have those assets there. We are relying on other countries to provide that support to our troops. That means we need to make sure, firstly, that our troops will be operating in a theatre where the command structure involves those assets and, secondly, that the protocols are in place so that the Australian troops can call in that support and receive it in a timely manner if they need to. I assume those things have been put in place. The government have not in fact made statements that I am aware of to reassure the parliament that those matters have been dealt with. I give the commanding officers of the Defence Force more credit than I would the government to be satisfied that those things are in fact in place before we would be involved in deploying our troops to such a dangerous environment. But it is important that we do have that support for those troops who are going to be undertaking a very dangerous activity. Along with every other member of this parliament, I want to also add my best wishes for the speedy and safe return of all of the Australian troops who are being sent on our behalf and in our name to undertake this dangerous exercise. I said at the outset that I view this as a wholly different conflict to that in Iraq. This is the battle that has to be waged whether we like it or not-and we do not. Sane people do not like going to war, it seems to me, but this is the war that has to be waged as a result of the threat we all now face from non-state terrorism. It is important for all of us, not least the people of Afghanistan, that a stable, democratic government exists in that part of the world, and I wish those Australians involved in this effort a speedy return, a safe journey and, as always, a job well done. sponse to the Prime Minister in relation to the deployment, he had this to say: It is a deployment which has bipartisan support and we would say to the government: ‘As you make your calculations of what is required for the troops in the field, if they require additional support from MAIN COMMITTEE",173,Ministerial Statements
213,Mr Edwards (Cowan) (5.31 Pm),"When the Leader of the Opposition spoke in reother elements of their military forces then they ought to get it.’ This is a very difficult task and a dangerous task on which they are engaged. The member for Brisbane, who just spoke, has touched on a number of issues which I want to speak on. We know now, following the foolish deployment to Iraq, that for reasons the government have kept to themselves they did not deploy enough personnel when they went into Al Muthanna. This put immense pressure on the troops on the ground, who had to do the job on the one hand but on the other hand had to absorb the losses from the ranks as other military personnel went about other jobs or went on leave or whatever. The deployment in Iraq did not contain sufficient men to do the job properly, and the fact that the job was done properly is a reflection of the courage, the dedication and the professionalism of the troops on the ground. But I would hope that following that mistake, which was rectified further into the deployment, we would not make the same blue in Afghanistan. It seems to me that the Leader of the Opposition was absolutely spot-on when he said in response to the Prime Minister, ‘If they require additional support from other elements of their military forces, they ought to get it.’ Whether it is additional support to help maintain the very active patrolling that they will be doing or to simply ensure that they have adequate casevac and other dust-off facilities, it is important that they have them. I want to touch on some other issues which were briefly referred to by the member for Brisbane in his very well-informed speech which certainly showed a great deal of knowledge about what is happening on the ground in Afghanistan. I want to refer in more detail to the article in the Age yesterday written by Tom Hyland. Tom Hyland is described as a senior reporter with the Age, and under the heading ‘Unclear and present danger’ he says this: The public is left ignorant of what is being done in its name, while soldiers and their families go without recognition. The body of the article goes on to say: We have become used to the Federal Government sending troops overseas. They go away on deployments, to peacekeeping operations, to train allies, to help restore stability and aid reconstruction. No longer, it seems, do we send troops to war where their job, at its most basic, is to kill the enemy and risk being killed themselves. “More Australian peacekeepers bound for Afghanistan”. That’s how one news bulletin headlined last week’s news that the Government was sending extra troops to southern Afghanistan, a region in the grip of a resurgence by Taliban extremists that is taking a steady toll on Afghan and allied troops, not to mention civilians. He goes on to say this: The reality is, there is no peace to keep in southern Afghanistan. This is especially so where the Australians are headed-Uruzgan province, the home of the Taliban, the site of the first victories in the American-led “war on terror” after the September 11 attacks, and one of the most dangerous places in a very dangerous country. The headline also reinforces a wider community misunderstanding. For if we’ve become accustomed to the Government sending troops and police away on “deployments”, we have also come to expect all of them will come home again, notwithstanding the deaths of Sergeant Andrew Russell in Afghanistan in 2002, protective service officer Adam Dunning in the Solomons in 2004, Warrant Officer David Nary in Kuwait last year and Private Jake Kovco in Iraq this year. MAIN COMMITTEE One of the personnel that Tom Hyland did not mention, of course, was young Private Clark from 3RAR, who lost his life in the Solomons while on patrol. But he goes on to say this: These deaths have been private burdens, not national ones, carried only by the dead men’s families and friends. And of the soldiers, only Sergeant Russell died as a result of enemy action. The new and expanded role in Afghanistan might change that, because the troops going to Uruzgan are heading into a particularly nasty war. In announcing the despatch of troops, the Government conceded the soldiers’ role was dangerous, with the Prime Minister saying any military operation in Afghanistan carried “significant risks”. But the extent of that risk, and the measures being taken to minimise it, was obscured by the wording of the announcement, which emphasised the troops’ reconstruction role in “community-based projects”. The Government is sending 150 extra troops, most of them to help protect a Reconstruction Task Force (RTF) due to start moving into Uruzgan this month. In May, when the Government announced it was forming the RTF, it said the 240-strong force would be half army tradesmen and engineers, and half infantry and armoured vehicles to defend them. The reinforcements announced last week double the protection force, meaning there will be about 150 reconstruction troops, protected by 240 infantry. In other words, despite its name, the majority of the taskforce will be made up of fighting soldiers from the 6th Battalion and the 5th/7th Battalion. The member for Brisbane mentioned what was contained on the website of the 5/7 RAR battalion in relation to its operational role. So not only are we strengthening the protection force; we also have to understand that those engineers, as well as being involved in reconstruction, will also have to man the perimeter and will have to accept their share of infantry style tasks in addition to their reconstruction work. They are trained in these roles and, if they need to, they will acquit themselves well. I am just making these points and referring to this article because it drives home what the member for Brisbane says-that is, there is this cone of silence. There is this blanket that seems to be pulled over the operations of our troops overseas. Sometimes the best we get in relation to their operational tasks and the way they are going about them is perhaps a silly response to a dorothy dixer, which unfortunately this Minister for Defence seems to be getting better and better at. But we do not get good information from the government or, indeed, enough good information from Defence as to the role of our troops, the work that they are doing and the way they are going about that. Indeed, further on in his article, Tom Hyland says this: Trying to get information from official Australian sources is like entering a parallel universe, where responses often bear no relation to the question asked. I could say to Tom: ‘Welcome to the club! Come and spend a bit of time sitting in question time listening to the questions that are asked and trying to match them to the answers given.’ I want to make this point: our troops that we send overseas have responsibilities. They have 100 years of history and 100 years of proud heritage. They do not fail to meet their responsibilities. Where there is a failure of responsibility is back here in Australia. I think Tom Hyland has put his finger right on it. The member for Brisbane has mentioned it. I think this government has a responsibility to show a bit more common sense, to show a bit more maturity and, I might say, to show a bit more respect for the troops and their families in the way that it disseminates information about what our troops are doing overseas. The role that our troops are performing-the professionalism, the courage, the tenacity, the dedication and the perseverMAIN COMMITTEE ance to work in those types of environments-demands more than some of the silly stupid dorothy dixers we get out of this Minister for Defence. We want the government to step up to its responsibilities. We want the government to keep the parliament and the people of Australia properly informed as to the nature of the work that our men and women are doing overseas, the nature of exactly how it is that they are making a difference, and we also want a bit more respect shown for the troops in the way that information is disseminated. I call on the minister to step up to the plate, to show a bit more maturity and to go about his tasks in a way that reflects a bit more responsibility. Indeed, I think it is a very extreme responsibility when you are a Prime Minister, a Minister for Defence or a Leader of the Opposition and you have troops overseas. We want the government to meet those responsibilities. I just want to close by saying that in my view we should never have pulled the pin on Afghanistan. Why did we pull out from Afghanistan when we did? We must have known that we were going into Iraq when we pulled out of Afghanistan. Why did we cut and run from Afghanistan? Why did we leave those people to themselves? We went there and fought a very damaging, total sort of warfare, not just in the hills and not just in the mountains but in areas which impacted on civilians-civilian men, women and kids. We left that country as a basket case. That is not a word I have picked myself but it was a word that was used by the Afghani ambassador when I asked him about the nature of things in Afghanistan after we had pulled out. The sheer number of landmines that were planted over a very long period of time in Afghanistan meant that anywhere outside of the capital, Kabul, was a very dangerous place to be. The issue of landmines meant that area that was required for agriculture was denied to people. People could not move back into areas to resettle them and, of course, landmines were often used to protect the illicit, illegal but very well cultivated crops of drugs. We had a greater responsibility to those people of Afghanistan, and it is certainly time we stepped in there to meet that responsibility. I agree with the member for Brisbane: those European countries that are so often derided by members opposite as being part of old Europe or whatever saw where the real threat was, saw where the real dangers were and saw where the real responsibility was too-to the people of Afghanistan-and I think they have met them. I am pleased that we are back in Afghanistan. I hate the thought of ever having to deploy our young men and women overseas, and I look forward to a time when we will find other options. But they are there. I know they will do a good job and I hope they all come back safely. Our thoughts go out to them and their families. I say to their families: if they ever want any help or assistance, they know where we are and they should not hesitate to contact us. can take than a commitment of troops overseas. When we look at the situation in Afghanistan, there is clearly a case for this deployment to go ahead. Labor stands to support the government on that, but we also demand that the government support the troops properly in the field and, on their return, ensure that they get a fair go and the sort of support they require to do the job we know they can do. We support our troops and we have confidence in them. Australian troops have gone to a range of theatres overseas in peacekeeping roles and in roles such as this-which, I think, is far more than peacekeeping-and have always performed with great credit, with great professionalism and with great dignity. As other speakers have said, we also MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Ministerial Statements
214,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (5.45 Pm),"There is no more serious decision that a governmenthave to look at why we are returning to Afghanistan in the circumstances that we now face. I would just like to remind the House of a motion some time ago that stated: That this House: (1) recognises the continued, central importance of Afghanistan as critical to the war against terrorism; (2) recognises that al Qaeda, the Taliban and associated terrorist organisations continue to pose a security threat to the government of Afghanistan; (3) recognises that removing this threat requires both the political transformation and economic reconstruction of Afghanistan with the full support of the international community; and (4) recognises that Australia must play a significant and substantive role, both bilaterally and multilaterally in under-pinning a long-term, secure future for the people of Afghanistan. That motion is incredibly relevant to this debate. It could have been said by the Prime Minister. It could have been said by the Minister for Defence. It could have been said just the other day in the House at the time of the initial motion to take note of the deployment and the undertaking of this commitment, but it was not said then; it was said on 29 March 2004. It was moved by the member for Griffith and seconded by me, in private members’ business, following our return from Afghanistan just a few weeks earlier. The circumstances we now face in Afghanistan should not be a surprise to anyone. That the circumstances were a surprise to this government, and that it took so long before serious action was taken, says something, I think, about the way this government operates and the sorts of choices it makes with respect to where and how it commits. What we are dealing with now is not new. The Prime Minister actually tried to take some cheap political shots at the member for Griffith in the House the other day when moving this motion-talking about opportunism. The fact is that the member for Griffith said this on the record years ago. He made it clear, after we visited Afghanistan, that there was a continuing clear and present danger there and that the circumstances faced by Afghanistan remained an international concern. He said we had cut and run too early in a situation where it was not right. We heard earlier the comments made by my friend-and I am happy to call him a friend-Ambassador Mahmoud Saikal on the circumstances in Afghanistan. Having heard the very words of President Hamid Karzai in the palace in Kabul, I know that those circumstances were clear back in 2004. But what did we have? We had one person left from the Australian commitment at that stage. When we came back from Afghanistan and raised these issues with the government, we were laughed at and ignored. Now we are going back again and, I can tell you, it is worse now than when I was there. There is no doubt about that, from the reports that are coming through. There is no doubt that the situation our forces face over there is worse than it was when we were there in 2004. It was obvious then, as it has become obvious now. I go back to a speech some time ago in which someone said: The importance of Australia’s role as one of the countries that went into Afghanistan and as one of the countries that stays there and helps with the rebuilding is absolutely paramount. There are enormous jobs that are required to be done and there is a range of innovative ways that they are being tackled by the international community. One of the projects that was discussed with us was PRTs-province reconstruction teams. These projects are being undertaken by the Americans, British, New Zealanders, Germans and others, but there is not a PRT that the Australian government has chosen to sponsor as yet. I would certainly urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs to look at the issue of PRTs as being something that Australia could do in addition to what it is currently doing to help rebuild that country in a holistic MAIN COMMITTEE manner. If we do not deal with these issues now, we will find ourselves in a situation where we have to deal with them in the future. That is a direct quote from a speech I made in the House on 29 March 2004. I am happy to quote myself in these circumstances because for once I was right. The situation was clear then-and what are we doing now? We are backing up a PRT run by the Netherlands. I support that. I think it is an excellent idea. We have to look at what we can do in respect of rebuilding Afghanistan, because the situation in Afghanistan with respect to the drug trade, alQaeda, and the Taliban-and its central role in the development and fostering of international terrorism in that region-must be dealt with. One thing we heard loud and clear from the people of Afghanistan, and from the leadership of that country, when we were there was that they have a long history of fighting in this area, a long history of being invaded, a long history of removing invaders and repelling them, and a long history of being ignored. If it continues again, we will find a similar situation. There is no doubt, and it was clear at that time, that we got out too early. There is no doubt, and it was clear, that the Americans embarking on what they have done in Iraq was a very bad move. It was clear, from everyone we met in Afghanistan at that time, that there was absolutely no doubt at all that the job was still to be done-and now we are seeing the result of that. I wish our troops all the very best. As I said earlier, I have tremendous confidence in them, their professionalism, their training and their capacity to be able to do this job. But they need not only our support here in this chamber; they also need our support with equipment and logistics. They need our support from go to whoa to make sure that they can do the job we know they can do. What we do not need is a situation where, all of a sudden, the government wakes up, as it has done on this occasion, and realises that it got out too early. It is another example of a foreign policy failure from this government. It is typical of how it has handled these issues over the years. It says something about the fact that it has not got its eye on the job. It is one thing to follow the Americans-and I can understand why, in some cases, that would be what you would do-but you can certainly see here another example of foreign policy by this government in which it is going back to fix something that it should have done properly in the first place. I know there are other speakers who wish to speak tonight, and we are running out of time, so I will leave my comments there. I wish the troops all the very best and safety in what they must do. for Bruce on his passionate exposition of the case for supporting our troops in Afghanistan, and the very serious way in which he has responded to this extra deployment, which the opposition quite responsibly supports. There were also the very serious speeches made by the members for Barton, Brisbane and Cowan. Together with them, I want to contrast the contribution by the member for Bruce against the absence of speeches from the other side. It is all very well for people to turn up to nice parades of our military and photo opportunities et cetera, but where are the speakers from the other side on this issue? There is not a single member of the government backbench to speak on deploying our troops overseas to the most dangerous deployment, at the moment, of anywhere that Australian troops are deployed to in the world. People know me in this House. I am not a person who bashes the government on naMAIN COMMITTEE",179,Ministerial Statements
215,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (5.53 Pm),"I want to congratulate my friend the membertional security issues when I think there is a national interest at stake. I have made that point many times. But the absence of government speakers on the Afghan deployment is a disgrace. I challenge the government to bring in some more speakers, when this debate resumes, so they too can address these issues that are of concern to the Australian people and to the great service people who are going to Afghanistan to work on our behalf. I may resume my remarks when the members for Griffith, Chifley and Ballarat-those on our side who also want to speak-have that opportunity, but I want to look at one issue in particular raised by my esteemed friend, that greatly admired professor of public diplomacy, Professor Bill Maley, in the Sydney Morning Herald recently. Professor Maley was looking at what happened to Afghanistan and why the Kabul democracy’s prospects have declined like this. The new constitution was adopted in 2004. There was a peaceful election in October 2004. It seemed that things in Kabul were improving. Unfortunately, because of the failure of the Western countries that were so loud in their rhetoric but so negligent in their action, Afghanistan has had occur to it the kind of vacuum that the members for Bruce, Barton and Brisbane described so well. You had the Taliban reviving. You had the repeated failure of Western countries to go ahead with the commitments that they had made in the famous Berlin conference post the defeat of the Taliban in Afghanistan. At the Berlin conference, let me remind the House, billions of dollars were promised for reconstruction in Afghanistan. According to Professor Maley, a scholar who is highly trusted in this area-he is probably one of the world’s leading international experts on Afghanistan-only a fraction per capita of what Kosovo and even East Timor have received has been given to the government of Afghanistan. Maley makes an even stronger point when he says that the World Bank has criticised what is called a second civil service of UN agencies and private commercial contractors receiving rewards that are astronomical by Afghanistan standards but doing little to foster local capacity. Not enough is trickling down to the ordinary Afghans. To quote him exactly: All this has created space for the Taliban to surge back, with active Pakistani backing. This is also something that people who are serious in this House should look at. We had the visit of President Musharraf to this parliament. While we all support Pakistan’s involvement in the war against terrorism, it seems that the Pakistani intelligence service, the ISI, is involved in the resurgence of the Taliban-as it has been in the past. This is a disgrace. Given Australia’s good relations with Pakistan, we should be more active in putting that issue to the Pakistani government. Professor Maley continues: The Afghan army is proving too expensive for the Afghans, so the security sector is subject to the vagaries of budget decisions made in foreign capitals. The police force is only a pale shadow of what is needed, and the size of the opium economy poses a real risk that Afghanistan could become a narcostate. It is not too late to turn things around, but time is short. The Afghan Government needs to refocus on the delivery of competent, clean and inclusive governance, with particular emphasis on the delivery of security through effective community policing. For its part, the wider world needs to ensure that its practical commitment matches its effusive rhetoric. Too much of the “assistance” to Afghanistan has been crafted to meet short-term Western needs for effective counterterrorism and the eradication of opium crops without sufficient attention to what the Afghans’ long-term needs might be. MAIN COMMITTEE The irony is that in the long run the needs of the Afghans for social and political stability reflect the very thing it is in the long-term interest of Western powers to promote. The first challenge for Australia, therefore, as it deploys soldiers to the danger zone of Uruzgan is to think very deeply about exactly what they are going there to do. Of course, particularly having just been on one of the parliamentary Defence Force deployments, I now have a better understanding and feeling for the service people on active service like the ones who are going to go over there. They have acquitted themselves already with great distinction. In fact, one Australian received the highest US award ever for our role in Operation Anaconda in which Australian soldiers, the SAS in particular, were responsible for saving the lives of many Americans in a very crucial battle with the Taliban some short years ago. But we have to consider the situation of our people in this new deployment very seriously. With the time running out, I seek leave to resume my remarks later and go the full 15 minutes, if that is okay with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I know that there are other people on this side who want to speak. As I say, through the Government Whip present here, I challenge the government to bring speakers up here and consider this very important deployment, this very dangerous deployment where we are probably going to see Australians killed. I do not like to say that, but that is something that the government should take more seriously than it is at the moment. Leave granted; debate adjourned.

227,Mr Dutton,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The qualitative multi source feedback process is commonly used across the Public Service and is the process used to gather leadership behavioural feedback on managers in the Australian Taxation Office. This is mandatory for managers at the Executive Level2 or higher classification levels. The process involves receiving feedback about an individual’s leadership performance from that individual’s manager, direct reports and colleagues. This particular process involved the feedback being gathered through interview. It also involves having the individual complete a self assessment on their own performance. The feedback questions are structured around the Australian Public Service Commission Integrated Leadership competencies, namely Shapes Strategic Thinking; Achieves Results; Cultivates Productive Relationships; Communicates with Influence and Exemplifies Personal Drive and Integrity. (2) The Commissioner advised that he considers this investment provides strong value to the individual and himself in terms of both performance and development and is a significant input into decisions on succession and placement of senior staff. Workplace Relations (Question No. 2956) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in writing, on 7 February 2006: (1) Is he aware that the former Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Cobb, refused to answer the question on Radio 2DU Dubbo “What do you do if your employer refuses to talk to you? How then do you negotiate an agreement” in respect of the new industrial relation relations legislation. (2) Will he provide an answer to the question. (1) No. (2) The Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) as amended by the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Work Choices Act) maintains the existing right of employers and employees to choose whether or not they wish to make an agreement, and if so, the type of agreement that suits them best. The Act does not, and should not, force either party to enter an agreement against their wishes and/or best interests. Therefore, the existing legislation protects employers and employees against action taken with the intent to coerce them to (for example) agree, or not agree to make a collective agreement. It also prohibits the application of duress to an existing employee or employer in connection with an AWA. These protections are maintained under the Work Choices Act. If an employer party to a proposed collective agreement refuses to negotiate, then their employees may, subject to the Act’s procedural requirements, take protected industrial action in support of their claims. Also, the Work Choices Act requires employers to genuinely try to reach agreement with either the relevant trade union/s or employees before they can take protected industrial action. Murray-Darling River System (Question No. 2957) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in writing, on 7 February 2006: How many gigalitres have been restored to the Murray-Darling river system since the Corowa Meeting of 2002 resolved that the system needed environmental flows.",188,Questions In Writing
228,Mr Andrews,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,189,Questions In Writing
229,Mr Mcgauran,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The Murray-Darling Basin Commission provided a report to the May 2006 meeting of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council on the use of environmental water in the River Murray. Since November 2003, existing water available to the environment has been actively managed by jurisdictions and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. This work has contributed towards meeting the ecological objectives for the Living Murray six Icon Sites. In this context, 2005-06 represents the most active season of environmental management in the history of river regulation. Over 36,000 hectares of the natural environment of the River Murray system and Icon Sites has been deliberately watered for environmental purposes, using approximately 915 gigalitres of water. The sources of water used included a combination of the accumulated Barmah-Millewa Forest Environmental Water Allocation, other existing state-based environmental allocations (e.g. Victorian Murray Flora and Fauna Entitlement, NSW Adaptive Environmental Water), River Murray surplus flows, above entitlement flows to South Australia, and water recovered from the Joint Government Enterprise. More specifically, about 510 gigalitres from the Barmah-Millewa Forest Environmental Water Allocation was released to achieve one of the most significant colonial nesting waterbird breeding events in recent decades and the spawning of threatened fish such as Silver Perch. Environmental water was also delivered through various means such as flow enhancement, pumping/siphoning, weir manipulation, and use of regulated creeks/channels to reinvigorate stressed floodplain vegetation including River Red Gums, and to fill wetlands across Gunbower Forest, Hattah Lakes, Chowilla Floodplain and the River Murray Channel Icon Sites. Water was also released through the Barrages at the Murray Mouth to provide temporary freshening of parts of the Coorong and fishways along the River Murray Channel were operated continuously for nine months. Due to dry conditions, environmental watering opportunities in 2004-05 were limited, but included combining surplus flows with water from the NSW and Victorian environmental water accounts to water Barmah-Millewa and Gunbower Forests, Hattah Lakes and Chowilla Floodplain. In addition, there was sufficient flow into the Lower Lakes to release about 40 gigalitres through the Barrages and into the Coorong and through the Murray Mouth. In May 2006, the Australian Government announced a cash injection of $500 million to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. The funds will accelerate all previous Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council and Commission decisions including providing additional resources to invest in water recovery measures under the Living Murray Initiative and to make best use of the recovered water. Under the Initiative, four initial water recovery proposals were approved by the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council in November 2004. Of these, the Australian Government announced in early 2006 investment of $37.2 million in the Victorian Goulburn Murray project to recover 145 gigalitres of environmental water, which is expected to be available in July 2007. The Australian Government is expecting to invest in the other three proposals in 2006-07 to recover a further 90 gigalitres, including 44 gigalitres from the Darling Anabranch pipeline project and 25 gigalitres from the decommissioning of Lake Mokoan. At the most recent Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council meeting, South Australia announced a package of measures under the Living Murray Initiative to recover 35 gigalitres, including 13 gigalitres which is expected to be available for environmental use in the first half of 2007. At the same time, NSW presented a strategy to recover an estimated 71.5 gigalitres. Additional water for the Living Murray Initiative will be recovered in future years with an average of up to 500 gigalitres per year ultimately available for River Murray increased flows. To speed up the recovery of water under the Living Murray Initiative, the Australian Government recently announced a Water Through Efficiency Tender to encourage the adoption of on-farm and offfarm water efficiency measures as a means of obtaining permanent water entitlements. To ensure productive capacity is maintained, the tender will only acquire eligible water entitlements from holders who can propose offsetting water efficiency measures. Under the Joint Government Enterprise, 38 gigalitres of environmental water has so far been recovered for the River Murray. Additional water will be recovered in future years with an average of up to 70 gigalitres per year ultimately available for River Murray increased flows. Australian Defence Force (Question No. 3047) Has his office or department undertaken an assessment on the extent to which salaries of ADF members have kept pace with private sector salaries over the past five years; if so, what does that assessment reveal. Members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) receive regular across-the-board pay increases under the ADF Workplace Remuneration Arrangement (WA) and the Star Ranks Remuneration Arrangement (SRRA). The current arrangements have delivered a cumulative pay increase of ten per cent to ADF members over the life of the arrangement (6 May 2004 to 3 November 2006). This equates to four per cent per year. Over the past five years (March 2001 to March 2006) the ADF has received cumulative pay rises of 21.5 per cent through the WA, a little over four per cent per year. A comparison of movements in ADF salaries with the Average Annualised Wage Increase (per employee) produced by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations shows that movements in ADF salaries under the WA have been in line with those in the public and private sectors over the same period.

(7) Has his department estimated the cost of removing the current restrictions on the FBT exemption for property owned by the employer; if so, what is the expected take-up rate of this concession. (8) Is the FBT policy regime applied to child care achieving the objective of encouraging employer investment in child care. (9) Is the Government aware of rigidities in the supply response which would limit the number of new places created as a result of granting a FBT exemption. (10) Does the cap on after school hour care places restrict the supply response. (1) Yes.",189,Questions In Writing

Goods and Services Tax (Question No. 3114) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 27 February 2006: (1) How many businesses claim the immediate write-off of $1000 provided for under the Simplified Tax System. (2) How many businesses with turnover less than the $50,000 annual threshold were registered for GST purposes and paid GST in the last 12 months. (3) How many businesses with turnover less than $50,000 which paid GST within the last 12 months chose to register for GST purposes. (1) For the 2004-05 income year, approximately 100,000 businesses claimed the immediate write-off of depreciating assets less than $1,000 each, provided for under the Simplified Tax System. (2) For the 2004-05 income year, approximately 275,000 businesses with a turnover less than $50,000 were registered for GST purposes and paid GST. (3) Of these 275,000 businesses, approximately 255,000 businesses chose to register for GST purposes.

233,Mr Dutton,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is follows:(5) How many small businesses did the ATO take legal action against in 2005 and in how many of these cases was (a) a conviction recorded and (b) a prison sentence imposed. (6) How many small businesses were forced into bankruptcy by the ATO in 2005. (7) Has the Small Business Debt Assistance scheme reduced the number of serial defaulters. (8) What action is taken against small businesses which ignore their tax obligations and are continually in debt to the ATO. (9) Do debt collection practices distinguish between one-off defaulters and serial offenders; if so, how; if not, why not. (10) Does the ATO take funds directly from the bank accounts of small businesses which repeatedly ignore their tax debts; if so, (a) how often has this action been taken, (b) what criteria are used to determine if this course of action will be taken, (c) has this action forced any businesses into bankruptcy, and (d) is this practice going to be reviewed. (11) Does a small business tax debt have to be over a certain amount to attract bankruptcy proceedings. (1) (a) and (b) At the end of June 2005, there were approximately 885,000 small business collectable debt cases (debt not subject to dispute or associated with insolvency) to the value of $7.68 billion. At the end of June 2006, there were approximately 914,000 small business collectable debt cases to the value of $8.11 billion. (2) At the end of June 2006, 92 per cent of small business debtors comprised debts of $25,000 or less. (3) 128,000 taxpayers who were in scope for the Small Business Debt Assistance Initiative have cleared their pre 30 June 2004 debt(s). (4) At the end of June 2006, there were around 80,000 small business collectable debt cases in a current repayment plan with the ATO. (5) The ATO commenced legal action against 36,462 small businesses during the 2004-05 financial year. (This figure includes garnishee notices, statutory demands, director penalty notices and ATO actions subject to Court processes.) (a) and (b) Generally, prosecution action is only initiated against taxpayers who do not lodge outstanding statements or returns or those who fail to comply with a notice issued under either section 260-5 or 353-10 of Schedule1 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (TAA 1953). A notice pursuant to section 260-5 empowers the Commissioner to collect tax debts from third parties who owe, hold money for or who may hold money for, an ATO debtor. A section 353-10 notice requires a person to supply the ATO with information or to attend or give evidence with regard to collection matters. (6) During the 2004-05 financial year, 166 small businesses became bankrupt following ATO initiated proceedings. (7) With regard to the Small Business Debt Assistance Initiative, the overall default rate for promises to pay was less than that of the general debtor population. The administrative certainty of payment by way of direct debit appears to have been an effective collection tool evidenced by the ongoing payment of arrears. (8) The ATO wants to see viable businesses continue to trade. Businesses are encouraged to approach the ATO where they face difficulties in making payments. Correspondence and phone contact are made before firmer action strategies are applied. Legal action is generally only taken after appropriate warnings are given and, where necessary, the ATO will take action leading to bankruptcy or company wind-up where debts are not addressed.",192,Questions In Writing
234,Mr Dutton,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(9) Since the release of the Inspector General’s Review of ATO Small Business Debt Collection Practices, extensive work has commenced on differentiated debt and debt analytics. The early results of this work are now being used to inform debt collection practice. (10) Yes, where small businesses are not willing to pay their taxes the ATO will take firmer action. This includes the use of garnishee powers. (a) Between1 July 2005 and 30 June 2006, 6,598 garnishee notices have issued to third parties who owe, or who may hold money for small businesses. (b) Garnishee action is generally only taken after appropriate warnings are given. (c) The ATO does not collect this information. (d) The ATO continually examines its approaches to administering the tax system. (11) To initiate bankruptcy or wind-up proceedings, the minimum amount of debt owed to a creditor must be $2000. This is a requirement of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (for individuals) and the Corporations Act 2001 (for companies). Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (Question No. 3174) Mr Georganas asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 2 March 2006: (1) Will he release the interdepartmental committee’s report on the investigation of the sustainability of the PBS. (2) Has he established how many pharmacies will close across Australia if the report’s recommendations are implemented. (3) When did the investigation into the sustainability of the PBS commence. (4) Which organisations were (a) consulted and (b) invited to make submissions as part of the Committee’s investigation. (1) The report is an internal working document and as such is unlikely to be released. (2) I have held initial discussions with the pharmaceutical sector, including the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, to assess the potential impact of some possible changes to the PBS. These discussions are at a preliminary stage. (3) PBS affordability is a matter of ongoing consideration by the Government with ideas developed and explored within Government on a routine and ongoing basis. (4) (a) and (b) The Pharmaceutical Industry Working Group, jointly chaired by the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, the Hon. Ian Macfarlane and myself, has provided an opportunity for ongoing dialogue with the pharmaceutical industry around PBS issues. As outlined in my response to question 2, I have commenced preliminary discussions with the pharmaceutical sector on some possible changes to the PBS. Abortion (Question No. 3194) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 27 March 2006: (1) Has he read the article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 3 March 2006 titled ‘Mixed response to $51m pregnancy hotline’. (2) What is the verifiable number of abortions occurring annually as a result of medical procedures financially assisted under Medicare and what is the data source of that number.",193,Questions In Writing
235,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) What is the total number of abortions occurring annually including those as a result of medical procedures financially assisted under Medicare and privately funded and what is the data source or sources of that number. (4) Can he confirm that the figure of 90,000 abortions per year is an accurate estimate of the total number of abortions occurring in Australia each year. (5) Will he act to amend Medicare item numbers so that it is possible, while preserving a woman’s privacy, to determine the exact number of Medicare funded procedures occurring specifically for the purpose of procuring an abortion; if so, when will this be fully implemented; if he will not act to amend Medicare item numbers, will he explain why not. (6) Is the policy objective of the Government’s $51 million pregnancy support scheme to reduce the number of abortions in Australia; if so, will he explain how the scheme will achieve this. (1) I have been provided with a copy of the article. (2) to (4) There is no single authoritative or complete data source on terminations of pregnancies in Australia. This means that it is not possible to give a precise number of terminations each year. It is possible however to combine data from a number of sources to provide an estimate of the number of terminations each year. The annual average number of terminations over the 10 years to 2004-05, including those as a result of medical procedures financially assisted under Medicare and privately funded, is estimated to be 87,000 per annum. The data sources are hospital data supplied by states and territories under the reporting requirements of the Australian Health Care Agreements and Medicare Benefits Schedule data. Detailed information on the sources of this data follows. National Morbidity Casemix Data Set (NMDS) The Australian Government receives unit record data from the states and territories on public and private hospital utilisation including information about admitted patient procedures. This data is provided under the Australian Health Care Agreements and forms the NMDS. This data includes information against a number of codes which together indicate the number of terminations occurring in public and private hospitals. These codes comprise: medical abortion; unspecified abortion; failed attempted abortion; other abortion1. The quality of the source data reported through the NMDS is a matter for states and territories. My department has written to each state and territory jurisdiction to seek their comments on the NMDS data held against the codes specified above. By writing to individual jurisdictions, the department has made every endeavor to verify the accuracy of the data with the states and territories. However, it is not able to independently verify it. Ultimately, the accuracy of the data relies on coding standards and issues of completeness which cannot be ascertained by my department. Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) MBS claims data provides a further source of information on terminations each year, as it identifies procedures which occurred outside hospital for which a Medicare claim was made. Two MBS items are of relevance: MBS item 35643 (6469) – evacuation of the contents of the gravid uterus by curettage or suction curettage. This item covers terminations but will also apply to those situations where there is a missed abortion (the foetus has died but not been expelled) and trophoblastic disease which is an abnormality of the placenta and in some cases is cancerous. This MBS item should not include",194,Questions In Writing
236,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:those situations where the woman has had a miscarriage or where the woman is not pregnant such as scraping the lining of the womb to try to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding. MBS item 16525 – management of second trimester labour, with or without induction, for intrauterine foetal death, gross foetal abnormality or life threatening maternal disease. MBS data includes cases of foetal death, miscarriage and trophoblastic disease and may therefore overstate the numbers of medical terminations. (5) There are no plans to amend the relevant Medicare item numbers. (6) The policy objective of the Pregnancy Support Counselling measures is to improve support services for pregnant women. While there are already a range of pregnancy counselling services available to women and their partners, women may be unaware of available services or may find it difficult to access them, particularly in rural areas and after hours. It is important that women are able to access non-directive counselling when they are uncertain about a pregnancy and that they are able to do so quickly. By providing an MBS item for this purpose, a broad network of service providers becomes available, increasing the likelihood that women will be able to get the support they need. The Helpline will assist women in areas where access to appropriate general practitioner and allied health professional services may be limited. It will also benefit those who need assistance after hours, providing a quality service option for those who prefer to remain anonymous or to receive counselling and advice in a non-clinical setting. Partners, who will not be eligible for the MBS item, will also be able to receive advice from the Helpline. The Helpline will provide a service which is professional and non-directive, and available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 1 Terms are defined as follows: ‘medical abortion’ – medically induced abortions; ‘unspecified abortion’ – documentation not available; ‘failed attempted abortion’ – either medically induced or other abortion which is incomplete or unsuccessful; ‘other abortion’ – any specified abortion other than an abortion that could be coded elsewhere. In 2003-04, of the terminations of pregnancy across Australia recorded in the NMDS, 98.2% were for ‘medical abortion’, 1.5% were for ‘unspecified abortion’, 0.1% were for ‘failed attempted abortion’, and 0.2% were for ‘other abortion’. Chifley Electorate: Programs and Services (Question No. 3203) Mr Price asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Administration, in writing, on 24 March 2006: (1) What programmes and services do the department and each agency in the Minister’s portfolio provide for Indigenous communities and individuals in the electoral division of Chifley. (2) In respect of each programme, (a) what sum is spent annually (i) nationally and (ii) in the electoral division of Chifley and (b) how many people is it intended to assist (i) nationally and (ii) in the electoral division of Chifley. swer to the honourable member’s question: Department of Finance and Administration (Finance) Commonwealth Grants Commission (CGC) Commonwealth Superannuation Administration (ComSuper) Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board and the Public Sector Superannuation Board (CSS/PSS)",195,Questions In Writing
237,Mr Costello,"The Minister for Finance and Administration has supplied the following an(1) Finance, CGC, ComSuper and CSS/PSS do not provide any programmes or services for Indigenous communities and individuals in the electoral division of Chifley. (2) Not applicable. Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) (1) The AEC does not provide specific programmes or services for Indigenous voters in the division of Chifley. However, within the electorate of Chifley, along with all other divisions in Australia, a school and community visits programme is provided where AEC staff deliver public awareness activities on request. In 2005-06, Chifley staff have visited primary and secondary schools and had 250 participants attend their public awareness sessions. The AEC is developing a northern and remote strategy which will target Indigenous voters. This strategy will cover both public awareness and enrolment activities and is designed to increase electoral knowledge and improve the accuracy of the electoral roll in remote areas of Australia. (2) (a) (i) and (ii) It is estimated that $162,000 will be spent nationally on Indigenous public awareness and enrolment activities in 2005-06. There was no budget identified for Indigenous-specific programmes in the division of Chifley in 2005-06. (2) (b) (i) and (ii) In relation to its public awareness and roll management activity, the AEC always aims to maximise the number of eligible electors on the electoral roll. Chifley Electorate: Programs and Services (Question No. 3210) Mr Price asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, in writing, on 27 March 2006: (1) What programs and services do the department and each agency in the Minister’s portfolio provide for indigenous communities and individuals in the electoral division of Chifley. (2) In respect of each program, (a) what sum is spent annually (i) nationally and (ii) in the electoral division of Chifley and (b) how many people is it intended to assist (i) nationally and (ii) in the electoral division of Chifley. Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Indigenous community organisations, businesses and individuals in the electorate of Chifley have access to the suite of industry development programs administered by the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources. In some cases eligibility for applying will depend on the entity meeting specific criteria under the program. The Department administers two programs which are specifically focused on indigenous Australians – the Business Ready Program for Indigenous Tourism and the Indigenous Partnerships Program. Information on these programs is provided on the Department’s website www.industry.gov.au and in the 2006-07 Portfolio Budget Statements for the Industry, Tourism and Resources portfolio. Tourism Australia also undertakes a range of activities to foster the development of the indigenous tourism sector. These include providing funding and support for Indigenous Tourism Australia, which facilitates consultation with the emerging indigenous tourism sector on existing and potential policies and programs and encourages indigenous tourism ventures, as well as a range of promotion and marketing activities. Further information on these activities is provided on the Tourism Australia website www.tourism.australia.com and in the 2006-07 Portfolio Budget Statements for the Industry, Tourism and Resources portfolio. (2) (a) Information on annual national funding for these indigenous programs and activities is provided in the 2006-07 Portfolio Budget Statements for the Industry, Tourism and Resources portfolio. Funding for these programs and activities is not allocated on an electorate basis. (b) The Business Ready Program for Indigenous Tourism is a pilot program that is expected to support in the order of 60-70 indigenous tourism businesses across Australia. No businesses in the electorate of Chifley have received assistance under this program. The Indigenous Partnerships Program is a facilitation program which is focused more broadly on fostering the development of mutually beneficial relationships between indigenous communities and the mining sector, rather than on individual customers. Similarly, activities undertaken by Tourism Australia are also focused more broadly on facilitating the development of the indigenous tourism sector, rather than on providing targeted assistance to individual customers. Chifley Electorate: Programs and Services (Question No. 3212) Mr Price asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, in writing, on 27 March 2006: (1) What programs and services do the department and each agency in the Minister’s portfolio provide for indigenous communities and individuals in the electoral division of Chifley. (2) In respect of each program, (a) what sum is spent annually (i) nationally and (ii) in the electoral division of Chifley and (b) how many people is it intended to assist (i) nationally and (ii) in the electoral division of Chifley. swer to the honourable member’s question: While no funds were provided by my department to Indigenous people in the electorate Division of Chifley during the 2005-06 financial year, there are several programmes available to Indigenous communities. For example, Indigenous communities can receive financial assistance through the Indigenous Heritage programme, Envirofund and, for remote areas, the Bushlight programme. The Indigenous Heritage Programme provides financial assistance to projects that identify, conserve and promote the Indigenous heritage values of places. Through Envirofund Indigenous communities are encouraged to undertake local conservation or natural resource management projects. The Bushlight Programme provides financial support to remote communities with the aim of increasing the use of renewable energy resources.

Taxation (Question No. 3251) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 28 March 2006: (1) How many taxpayers have been covered by class rulings in relation to s.23AG of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 between 2000 and 28 March 2006. (2) What was the cost to revenue of these rulings. (1) and (2) The issuing of class rulings in relation to section 23AG of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 between 2000 and 28 March 2006 have no revenue impact. As an individual taxpayer (that meets the requirements of section 23AG) may utilise this section regardless of a class ruling applying, there is no cost to revenue from the class ruling being issued. A class ruling provides certainty to participants by stating or confirming the tax consequences about the application of the tax law to a specific class of persons in relation to the particular arrangement. As a result, the exact number of taxpayers using the ruling cannot be given.
