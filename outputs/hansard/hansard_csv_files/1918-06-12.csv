I answer in one reply the questions of the honourable member and of the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford). Yesterday the honourable member for Herbert askedIs the Acting Attorney-General( Mr Groom) aware that the moratorium regulations are expressly excluded from all contracts for the sale or leasing of properties of any magnitude? I have been engaged in two transactions in which there would have been no sale if consent had not been given to such exemption being stated in the contract of sale. Will the bonorable gentleman state whether the owner of a house occupied by the dependants of soldiers in the same way could contract himself out of the provisions of .the moratorium ? The War Precautions (Moratorium) Regulations provide that those regulations shall not apply to any mortgage, agreement for sale and purchase, or lease containing an optional or compulsory .purchasing clause, which is executed after the 20th September, 1916, if the mortgage, agreement, or lease contains a condition or covenant expressly excluding the provisions of the regulations.

This represents roughly a fourth of the year's Supply, ancl stretches through the months of July, August, and September in the next financial year. Some honourable members may not care for the procedure ' adopted-that is, postponing the ordinary Estimates for 1917-18, and asking the Committee to give attention to Supplyf or next yearbut the main object of the Government, in recommending this procedure is to give the Senate some work to do. close down discussion? two chances of generally discussing financial and other matters.

Taking into account £2,077,427 brought forward from the In valid and Old-age Pensions Fund, and adding to that the revenue received for the first eleven months of this year, namely, £26,208,060, we get a total in hand of £28,285,487. The expenditure . out of revenue for ordinary services, apart £20,153,347, and for services in connection with the war-representin g in terest and sinking f u n d , war pensions, and other war services-£8,160,404 .

The amount of revenue received from direct taxation during tbe first eleven months-the period which .€6,182,219 . As the estimate for the year was £10,000,000, it will be seen that fully one-third of the anticipated revenue from direct taxatiou is expected to be received during the last month of the year; and judging by all the indications of the inflow of revenue, and the savings which the Departments can effect, as well as the condition of the public account on the 31st May, we shall bave a small surplus at the 30tli June, as I indicated when introducing the last SupplyB ill . I said on that occasion that it was expected that there would be a surplus of at .least £750,000. The Treasury officials see no reason for varying that calculation. That is all the information that honourable members can expect at tliis stage; but if further particulars are desired, I shall be glad to give them on the Bill or at a later stage in Committee. Acting Prime Minister has stated, it is a rather unusual procedure to be discussing Supply for the next financial year when we have not passed the Estimates for the present year. The faul t lies in [211] the fact that the consideration of the Estimates has been postponed until they cannot be dealt with, except during the last few sittings of the House. ence of the last three years. ou several occasions; but it is a procedure against which I have always protested, even while I was a member of a Ministry, because it is not fair to continually hang up Estimates and deprive honourable memfrom tlie war, has been bers of the opportunity of discussing them before the money is spent. We are now starting off again to spend next year's money to t h * extent of £5,500,000, excluding war expenditure, which, no doubt, will be covered by a separate B ill that it will be impossible to discuss during 'the next few days'. I do not suppose that In ' addition to these it is the intention of the Acting Prime Minister to bring forward any proposal for works to be constructed out of loan funds before the House adjourns its present sittings. Of course the Government w ill run the business of the House and of the country to please themselves, independently of any advice that may be given from honourable members on this side, but they would be well advised in I am covering-wa s their own interests to allow honourable members the opportunity to criticise the way in which it is proposed to spend money before the money is actually spent. I hope that there are sufficient honourable members on the Ministerial side who w ill make their influence felt, and object to the procedure of spending money before opportunity is given to criticise the Government's proposals for spending ;t. The Acting Prime Minister tells us that he has nothing further to add in regard to the question of fixing the price of meat, and that further information during the present sittings depends upon the speed with which the Acting Minister can accomplish his task. I hoped that we would have a definite scheme placed before Parliament before it rises. I regret exceedingly that it w ill not be my privilege to remain during the discussion of this important matter. As a matter of fact, I cannot remain during the whole of the present sitting.

It is possible that members opposite have, in their secret caucus told the Governr ment their real opinions, and that, therefore, Ministers have reluctantly, nine months after the presentation of the first report of the Inter-State Commission, decided to take action: though exactly what they propose to do, not even their supporters know. I again protest against the taking away from Parliament of an opportunity for the f u ll discussion of the Estimates. deal properly with Estimates covering an expenditure, including war expenditure, but excluding expenditure on buildings constructed with loan monev. of about £80 000.000.

Ministers have been in office for more than thirteen months, b u t not one measure can be mentioned which will bring the ending of the war nearer; and all matters of vital"" importance to the people have been avoided. these matters left off the list that the honourable member prepared when attending the Government House Conference? at that Conference to provide the Government with a policy.

This was recognised by those who attended the Government House Conference. Honourable members who read the report of the discussion that took place there will see that we did not make the removal of the abuses stated on our list the price of our assistance to recruiting; b u t I say, deliberately, that it is useless to attempt to get recruits without an honest effort to remove those abuses. Instead of Parliament going into recess, members should have an opportunity to deal with the various problems that confront the community.

91,Mr Pigott (Calare) [3.55],"Tn eI have something to say regarding the proposals for the fixation of the price of meat; but, in deference to the wishes of honourable members generally, I shall defer my remarks on that subject until the Estimates come before us. There are several matters to which I desire to direct attention, the first of them being the outrageous conduct of the Defence Department sanctity of Australian homes by raids upon the houses of respectable citizens. In my electorate, several such raids have been made, most of those who have been interfered with being persons who have lived for many years in the locality, and possess characters against which no word of reproach has been, or could be, uttered. I shall give some definite in stances of the action of which I am complaining. Apparently, no longer in Australia is the Englishman's house his castle; no longer does the Australian householder enjoy the right of a British citizen to freedom from molestation while within the four walls of his domicile. Here is one case in which the military authorities acted with gross callousness and impropriety. A t Forest Lodge, a suburb of Sydney, there resides a Mr McGinnis. He, with his -mother ancl sister, has been living there for a number of years, all three being persons of the highest character, greatly respected in the neighbourhood. They have played their part in public undertakings, and the sister especially has taken a large share of the patriotic work of the district. Last week, without notice, and in the absence of Mr. McGinnis, the military authorities came to their house, and demanded instant admission. The mother and daughter were locked in a room, and the military then ransacked the premises from top to bottom. They took possession of the personal and private belongings of the household -famil y photographs, private letters, and similar things which most persons cherish. These they bundled together, and took away. To show the callousness of the raiders, let me add that the baker, in his ordinary round, knocked at the door while they were there, and they refused to allow either mother or daughter to go to the door, and get bread from him. dent is that McGinnis is an Irish name, ar,0 that the family supports the Labour party. But by no stretch of imagination [ 2 1 1 ] -2 .can they be regarded as Sinn Feiners, or in sympathy with the enemies of the Empire. They can get no redress for the wrong that has been done to them; and their request that their photographs and other personal belongings shall be re(Dalley [3.57] turned has been coldly refused by the Defence Department. This kind of thing should be stopped. Surely the military authorities, before taking action on in in violating the formation, can ascertain from the local police and magistrates the character of r the persons complained of! But they do nothing so sensible as that. . An unknown "" nincompoop"" has only to send to them an anonymous letter stating that so and so are suspicious persons, and a military squad is sent to raid the premises. I challenge the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) to investigate this case. Every word that I have said can be proved to be true. swer to the honourable member's statement before very long. whom I have been speaking have a character which stands as high as that of the Postmaster-General. The case demands an answer. These people belong to no society that can be regarded as unlawful or opposed to our K in g and country. They are respectable citizens, who desire only to be allowed to go about their lawf u l occupations in the usual way. But they ask to be protected against the outrageous violation of their homes by the military authorities. Another case is that of Mr J. J. Brennan, of 224 Elswick-street, Leichhardt. Perhaps the name conjured up fancies in the minds of the military authorities because an honourable member of that name gives the Government rather a lively time in this House. The people to whom I am referring have been personal acquaintances of mine for a number of years, and they live in my constituency. Mr Brennan writes to meI beg to bring uncler your notice an extraordinary act of pillage on the part of the military authorities committed against me and my home. On Thursday last four men, the leader of The only explanation of the inciwhom read a warrant, entered my house and ransacked ft in every part. They even counted every coin that they could find.

114,' Mr Charlton (Hunter) [4.25],"point of view that the Estimates in respect of the current financial year, which closes on the 30th inst., have not yet been passed. Generally speaking, the proposed votes for which those Estimates provide have already been expended. The House has fallen into the objectionable practice of allowing the Estimates to remain undealt with until practically the close of the financial year to which they relate. No one can say fchat this is consistent with our duty to scrutinize expenditure to observed, and to safeguard the interests of Australia. It is hardly to be credited thafc a deliberative body would allow more than eleven months of the financial year to elapse without dealing with the Estimates relating to it . We are now asked to grant Supply to cover the needs of the Government until September next. enter my protest against this practice, as I have done on previous occasions, since I certainly do not think it makes for the best interests of the country. I desire now to draw attention to the constitution Since the outbreak of war, many Boards have been appointed, and it seems fco me that, in respect to practically all these Boards, we have made the mistake of appointing to them only those directly interested in the services' or commodities to which fchey relate. selection is that the public has not the confidence that it should have in these Boards; and I have no doubt that the practice leads largely to an increase in the cost of living. no escape from that position. bers of these Boards will naturally look after their own interests. urged that we should have on the Shipping Board men who are experienced in the shipping industry; but I do not think that the Board as constituted will work in the best interests of Australia in this time of crisis. are interested, not only in shipping, in the supply of coal; and it is to their advantage Commonwealth has leased, and for which we pay, should carry the commodities in which they are personally concerned. this way they derive -a considerable adT vantage. the use of these vessels.

Isi t not reasonable that there should be on these Boards representatives of the people themselves? The position is, however that the general public are T not represented on any of the Boards that have been created by the Government. I wish to make it abundantly clear t h a t those who control tbe shipping have opporfcunties to use it to their own advantage. Take, for instance, the position in regard to coal, which is required «hiefly in connection with industrial operationsthroughout Australia. Inter-State companies to which I have referred hold an interest-and in most cases the predominating interest-in certai n mines. therefore, that these vessels should carry, the particular coal in which they are -chiefly interested. They first of all make sure of securing good prices from the Government for the use of their vessels; and if those vessels are employed in carrying their own coal, they secure, in addition the profits arising from thafc trade. -companies. is only a limited amount of coal in consequence of the war. Foreign trade is cut off, and available boats are rightly taken for the conveyance of wheat. The Inter-State shipping has also been reduced, the boats having been taken off the coast and placed elsewhere, and industries are languishing to a certain extent in every State owing tp the want of «oal. Ifc is in the interests of the community that what shipping we have, and especially the shipping the Government is paying for, shall be kept constantly engaged. Every vessel should be promptly despatched, and on arrival at the port of destination, unloaded, and re-loaded without delay. The Shipping Board should have somebody at a port like Newcastle to see that the loading is expedited, so as to insure a supply of coal, and, at the same time, keep those engaged in the coal trade employed. Some time ago, at my request, a list of the vessels that had been delayed afc Newcastle in the way I have described was prepared for me by a good authority; and I shall only quote sufficient to show the present state of affairsDelay to s.s.

Just imagine vessels waiting for particular kinds of coal when there are thousands of tons of coal on the waggons near by. We have to pay so much per ton per month for these boats, and we ought to see that we get a f u l l return for our money. I have -quoted sufficient to show that we are not getting the best out of those boats, although at the present time ' our prosperity hinges on the supply of coal. the shipping control?' all recent cases that I have quoted. for the waiting? in some cases sufficient labour is'not engaged, although there is plenty available. I do not know who is responsible, but the vessels are under the Navy Department. dule attached to all the contracts ? tracts; these vessels are under the Government. tracts with the Victorian and South Australian Governments? of that phase of the question just now, but of the delay in the loading at Newcastle. All the vessels, I contend, should be under Government 'control; and, in deed, a Board has been appointed for that purpose. Whatever contracts there may be, if, is the duty of those concerned to see that vessels are ready for loading, and that there is loading ready for vessels. If it is a certain coal that is required for a contract, and it cannot be supplied at a particular time, the vessel available ought to take coal for some other person, another and a later steamer being used for the purposes of the contract. The whole business requires regulating. The particular instances I have given are quite sufficient to justify the Government in taking some steps fo remedy the state of affairs at Newcastle. Again, I suggest that there ought to be' a local Board, consisting of two ship-owners, two mine-owners, and representatives of the Waterside unions and Miners' Federation, to see that both coal and men are there when wanted, and that the vessels are sent to sea with despatch.

127,Mr Charlton,"I am not speakinggreat demand for shipping; and, surely, we ought to utilize the shipping we have to its fullest capacity ? Most of the companies represented on the Board are also interested in particular mines; and in order to keep those mines going regularly, boats are held up to be, used for the carriage of the coal. We have formed pools in connection with wheat, wool, and other commodities, and in this time of national stress we ought to see that none of our shipping is allowed to lie idle for want of a little good management. I do not say anything against the'Shipping Board, but cn all such bodies there should be a repretimes, but why should some men be idle sentative independently of those directly interested. supposed to watch the interests of the public. so at a time of national crisis such as that through which we are now passing, when everything is at fever heat? The Government watch the interests of the public by appointing a number of Boards to control certain things. These Boards submit reports to the Government from time to time, but I venture to say that no Minister can go into the details of the transactions carried out under the control of the Boards. A t present, we are asked to go into recess in order to enable Ministers to formulate a financial policy, because they have not time to do it when the House is sitting. In these circumstances, how can Ministers afford the time to watch the interests of the public in connection with the different Boards which have been appointed to control affairs on their behalf? My argument is that each Board should have on it a representative of the public interest. The people outside would then feel that they were getting a fair deal. If , on these Boards, there were representatives of both labour and commercial interests, instead of giving representation to one section of the community only, it would certainly create a far better feeling in the community. Of course, it would seem to be absurd to put a man without shipping knowledge on a Shipping Board, but I contend that the appointment of a-few men of sensible judgment to the various Boards would enable the public to get better treatment than can be secured under the present arrangement. Certainly, there should be some one' on the Shipping Board outside those who are directly concerned in the shipping business. . In the Newcastle district there are many mine-owners who are not getting a fair deal. They have opened up a good class of coal, but, because the shipping people are interested in other districts, their mines are lying idle, while mines in other districts are kept going full time. Surely at a time like this, every one should be able to get a fair share of the work that is available. Every one should be prepared to carry, his fair share of the load that has been placed upon us in connection with the war iu these abnormal while others are probably doing better than they have ever done in their lives before? It is a matter that should be remedied. Other things have been rectified. Surely this matter can also be rectified. The proposition that I am putting forward is eminently fair. The injustice to which I have drawn attention snould be attended to, yet nothing is being done. Men in my district are working perhaps for two or three days a fortnight, while others' in other districts are working eleven days a fortnight. The men to whom I refer cannot live-on what they earn. Surely some scheme can be devised whereby all the coal required for our steamers can be taken in fair proportions from the different collieries. abundance of old men in the honourable member's district. able to find room elsewhere for the others. orable member why it cannot be done, and the truth of my statement would strike him if he only knew the district. The cessation of the foreign trade in coal, has practically accounted for a falling off in coal production to the extent of fully 50 per cent. Prior to the war the coal mines frequently raised 100,000 tons of coal in the week, and as much as 120,000 tons was the output at times; but now the figure is down to about 50,000 tons per week. Many new mines were opened up to meet the bigger demand prior to the war, and now that there has been such a falling off in the output the work available for the coal miner has been considerably reduced.

133,Mr Charlton,"I can tell the honhowever, is that the method of taking all the coal required from one district means that men in that district are in regular employment, whereas other mines are getting next to nothing of the trade. I may tell the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) that, although fully 3,000 men have enlisted from the Newcastle and Maitland districts, there are now between 2,000 and 3,000 men in the former district alone who are not working more than half time. They have to accept assistance from their fellow workers, who are willing to divide their wages with them; but, if we could divide the work under a better system each man. would be able to put in at least eight days a fortnight. Those who are now working f u l l time are quite satisfied to share the work with their fellow men. It speaks volumes for them that at this time of crisis they are prepared to give up part of their crust to their fellow workers. It would be in the interests of the difgrowers will participate to the extent of ferent States to utilize our steamers to their fullest capacity so that as much coal can be shifted as it is possible to move with the limited tonnage available. ""We cannot supply' the coal requirements of the Commonwealth with the vessels at our disposal, so that we must utilize them to the fullest extent possible. The Shipping Board as now constituted is notsatisfactory. Other interests besides the shipping interests should be represented. As the Commonwealth is paying so much money for the use of the vessels taken over from the shipping companies, steps should be taken to see that the interests of the public are properly represented upon the Board which is controlling the movements of the ships. As far as possible we should see that every member of the community carries the load which has been imposed upon us by the times through which we are passing. My proposition is a fair one, and should be adopted by any Government which happens to be in power. In a time of national crisis there should be harmony in the community-w e should not have little pinpricks occurring, and when we find them r w& should attempt to remove them. This matter should be set right in the interests '-of harmony in the community. I bring the matter forward so that the Government may give some consideration to it. Mr Charlton. Minister and Treasurer) [4.56] I would like to make an announcement in regard to a matter which the Government have had under consideration for some time, and in which many honourable members are vitally interested.. It is in connection with the Australian wool clip. The negotiations which have been proceeding for several weeks between His Majesty's Government and the Commonwealth Government have been satisfactorily completed. The Imperial Government have extended the purchase of the Australian wool.clips for a period covering the currency of the war and onefull wool year, commencing on the 1stJuly, after the termination of hostilities,, and ending on the 30th June following. The flat rate of Is. 3£d. per lb. of greasy wool, as at present, has been arranged for the term, plus charges to cover expenses from fche wool warehouseto f.o.b. steamer. The Australian wool50 per cent, in any profit accruing from, the sale of wool for other than British Government purposes. The conditions as to appraisement and payment are to be as per current contract. The control will remain in thehands of the Central Wool Committee, who have successfully conducted the wool scheme since its initiation, and who have the confidence of the wool-growers. This transaction is the largest ever completed in Australia. The estimated returns, embracing two wool clips only, will exceed £100,000,000, and it is by far the largest wool transaction ever recorded in the world. Before negotiations were opened it was necessary for the Central Wool Committee to engage for the storage in Australia of large quantities of wool at three or four principal ports in order to take advantage of every available ton of shipping. These temporary warehouses are in course of erection, and will be available for the carry-over of the present and storage of the recently acquired clips. To Commonwealth wool-growers and sheep-breeders, this Imperial Government wool purchase gives a security previously unknown in the pastoral history of Australia, and the circulation of theproceeds practically means stability to financial and commercial institutions throughout the Commonwealth for the period covered by the agreement.",38,Delays To Ships At The Port Of Newcastle

It is calculated to. maintain and increase the financial stability and general prosperity which Australia has enjoyed for the last two years. I would like to take the opportunity of expressing the gratitude of this Parliament,' and the people of Australia, to Sir John Higgins, the chairman of the Central Wool Committee, for the most able service that he has performed gratuitously in this matter and in other connexions, with so much assiduity, zeal, and efficiency for the last three years -be detrimental to the industry in general -Upon this motion I desire to continue the few remarks which I was making last night. It is singular that, on the question of supply of foodstuffs to the people the Ministerial side of the Chamber is filled with "" shrieks"" of silence, yet immediately the Acting Prime Minister makes an announcement that some more coin is to go into the pockets of the big pastoralists of Australia, and make their breakfast table pretty secure, there is a general uprising among honourable members sitting on that side. able member think that the arrangement entered into is a good thing for the working people also? it is singular that what I have described should have occurred. bad thing for them if that money were not coming into Australia. better if some of it was to go into the pockets of the people who helped to create it.. is why the Savings Bank accounts of the workers of the country are decreasing, while the big banking accounts are increasing. have increased from £75,000,000 to £109,000,000 since the war. inember goes through my electorate he will not find very much of an increase of Savings Bank deposits among the people there. However, I must congratulate the j)astoraIists on their annexation of this money from the Imperial Government, and I hope theywill open their hearts and give the workers a much larger share of it than they have hitherto had. Perhaps, after the announcement of the Acting Prime Minister, there will not be so much hostility displayed to fixing the price of meat, such as is shown in to-day's issues of the Age and Argus. To resume my remarks on the profiteering displayed by pastoralists, to which exception was taken last night, I desire to draw attention to the report furnished by the Inter-State Commission. They do not take the view that it would to fix prices. On natre 40 of their report they sayI t was common opinion that the grazifig industry has never been so prosperous, more particularly for the mixed farmer and "" the small man,"" as it is now; hut it was contended that in some instances the losses of the year of drought had not yet been overtaken, and that the present prices should be left available as a compensation for the past and security in case of an adverse future. ' The opinion of the Commission is supported by a tabulated statement on page 42 of their report, from which it appears that in 1913 the value of the products was £49,385,000, and in 1916 £64,024,000 a net increase of something like £14,639,000. On these figures, I cannot see that the cattle kings are in danger of having to pay Is. 6d. for a hook so that they may seek work on the wharfs in consequence of the fixing of the prices of meat. The effect of fixing the prices of meat will be similar to that of fixing the prices of flour and bread, which has been the elimination of the speculator and the middleman, while the producers and the consumers have got a fairer deal than they were getting.

In a statement of the financial position of the Queensland Government's butchers' shops appearing in the report of the Auditor General for the State, it is set out that for a period of eleven months, which ended on 30th September, 1916, a net profit of £2,564 19s. Id. was made, although the making of a profit was not aimed at, the shops having been established to serve the public. resulted, even though the price of meat was reduced over 100 per cent. It may be objected that the Queensland Government shops have an advantage over private establishments, but the report states that that is not so, and that a saving was made by the abolition of extravagance and bad management. For the first lot of meat sold through the Roma-street shop the price paid was i d . per pound above that at which meat was being supplied to the British Government, the meat being some intended by a private company for Melbourne consumption. For its Romastreet butcher's shop the Queensland Government pays a rental of £30 a week to the Railway Department of the State, a rental which would compare favourably with any in Melbourne or elsewhere for similar premises. point out that the squatters have been making immense sums out of their flocks, hut that the average worker or consumer has been mulcted to the extent of from 4s. to 7s. per week by the increase in the price of meat. A t page 5 of the second report they deal in these terms with the consumption of meat in VictoriaThere was a singular difference of opinion on the important question whether the consumption of meat has fallen off as a consequence of the increased prices. Some retail butchers insisted that they sold as much as before in the industrial districts; while, on the other hand, the secretary of a very large trade union, with 12,000 members in Australia, pointed out that it was impossible for working men's families £o pay away for meat so great an additional part of their wages. He said that from figures collected by him the consumption of meat before the war was from 10s. to 12s. 6d. per average household. At present prices the same amount of meat would eost «15s. tp 18s. 63., which, he suggested, is beyond the means of working-class households. It is shown that the consumption of meat per head of population in New South Wales fell from 259 lbs. in 1913 to 181 MT. Wallace. lbs. in 1916a drop of 78 lbs. Thirty years ago, when sheep could be purchased for Is. 6d. or 2s. per carcass, the average man may have bought more meat than he really needed, but since the establishment of freezing chambers and the development of the export business has made meat so much dearer, he has not bought more meat than he has needed, and consequently he must harm himself by any curtailment of his consumption. The result of any reduction of the present consumption of meat must be to reduce the This profit physical standard required by squatters and other employers, of those whom they employ to make tlieir profits.

It will tend to better organization in the industry, making the producer no worse off, and the consumer better off, and the middleman and speculator will be, to some extent, eliminated. The Commission's report deals with a glaring case of speculation, though it is camouflaged to some extent .in the report. The facts are these: In October last, during the strike, Mr Tom Field and his colleagues were formed into a pool by the New South Wales Government to regulate the meat supply of Sydney, the Government having a representative on the Board. Their first action was to increase the price of meat by 4d. per lb. all round. After the abolition of the pool, meat ""was still sold at the increased price, and Mr Tom Field, when addressing a meeting of master butchers, retailers and others, in the presence of the Government representative, and when there was plenty of champagne flowing, pointed out that one of the things upon which the pool could compliment itself was the complete disorganization of ""that set of bandits, the Australian Meat Em-",40,Delays To Ships At The Port Of Newcastle

I ask the honourable member who was the bigger bandit-the man who in war time was exploiting the community by increasing the price of a necessary-commodity, or a set of employees who were trying to obtain a living wage?

Sufficient evidence has been adduced to show that the Government ought to. take some action to fix prices, and I suggest that if the M in ister in charge of prices is in a quandary as to how to proceed, he might read this little book, published by the Ryan Government, and I am sure that Mr Ryan and his colleagues would be pleased to give the Minister further very valuable assistance. I turn now to the price of kerosene.

Since that date I believe that the Prices Commissioner has allowed a further increase on kerosene to 16s. per case, and benzine to about 26s. per ton as compared with £ 1 0 per ton now. before the Inter-State Commission showed that freights did not affect the position to any extent. The Vacuum Oil Company has increased its capital from £800,000 to £1,600,000 in three years. That fact is proof that the profits have gone, not to the ship-owner, but to the Vacuum Oil Company. The position in regard to kerosene condemns the Government in the eyes of the public as not being sincere in their attempt to fix prices",41,Delays To Ships At The Port Of Newcastle

The Government are not dealing fairly with the community when they allow a company of this description to flagrantly exploit the public. Every inquiry that has been held in regard to prices has shown that exploitation is in progress. To-day we read in the press that certain persons had interviewed the Prices Commissioner, and recommended that certain prices should be fixed for their commodity, and the Commissioner adopted the prices they proposed. does that with wages. the Arbitration Court exhaustive evidence is heard from both sides, but in regard to price fixing the Government accept the dictum of the manufacturer or middleman. retailer is asked to give evidence. The inquiry by the Inter-State Commission in regard to the price of boots disclosed that leather was adulterated and that the people were overcharged. Retailers admitted that when a person went into a shop, and did not care for a boot offered to them at a certain price, the boot was taken away and labelled at a higher price, and sold to the customer as a different article. Those practices show that the traders have no conception of their moral duty to the public. What right have they to foist upon the customer a rejected article at a higher price t The following extract from the Miners' Magazine for A p r i l of this year shows that in England the authorities have a more effective method of dealing with this problemHow THEV no ITIN ENGLAND. In England the Army Council has taken a hand in the shoe industry by naming and describing what is necessary to manufacture a serviceable shoe and establishing a maximum price at which shoes shall be sold to their people. The manufacturer is required to stamp on the top of the shoe his registered number, and on the sole of the shoe its selling price, which is not to be advanced or raised. The selling price ranges from $4.50 for the work shoes to $6.39 for the better grades of dress shoes for men. Women's shoes sell at from $3.16 to $5.96. There are but thirty-nine types of shoes described by the War Council, and no other kind may be manufactured during the war. The law also prescribes that the heels of women's shoes shall not be higher than one and three-quarter inches. Similar action should be taken in the Commonwealth. If the Government are really desirous of solving this problem, they should consider the advisability of taking control of' various industries, placing them under Government supervision, and insuring that the people get a fair deal, not only during the war, but also after neace is declared. -Unfortunately , there is a conspiracy of silence on the Government side, and a united effort on the part of Ministerialists, to shut up this House, and to Mr Justice Higgins prevent the discussion of some of those most serious problems that are confrontH e does not.

Being 12,000 miles away from the ' scene of the awful conflict that is raging in Europe, we can surely devote a little time in Parliament to looking after the interests of the people. Honourable members may see in the Library the Hansard volumes of fche Imperial Parliament, which show that that Parliament was almost continuously in session from January, 1916 T till the end of December, 1917. That is a serious reflection upon the Commonwealth Parliament. The British Government, although having to face bigger problems than confront us, and although having greater responsibilities than have the Ministers of the Commonwealth, are yet prepared to meet Parliament, and allow a free discussion of their every action, and f u l l debate on all measures brought before Parliament from time to time.

When I asked that an inquiry should be instituted in regard to the action of this military official, I was told that it was a matter for Mr Speaker, and after Mr Speaker had laid the facts before the House, honourable members opposite were loud in their assurances that they would assist in promoting an inquiry.

At the same time a military official sits in judgment on our correspondence, deciding whether it is good for us to receive that correspondence, or whether it is judicious that our constituents should be allowed to communicate news to us that is not of the slightest military value, so far as giving information to the enemy is concerned.

Sir Edward Grey (as he then was), in the speech he made to the House of Commons at the outbreak of the war. told the country of the informal-no t binding-consultation s which had taken place with the French about what would happen if a great emergency arose. We could not tell in those days whether or not the country would desire that we should throw in our lot on the side of France. But there was one thing which was clear, that if there was even a chance of our so doing, we ought to prepare beforehand. We did that. We took informal counsel with the French General Stall', turned. ancl they gave us, broadly speaking, this advice -that if we could put' 100,000 men within fifteen days on the eastern frontier of France we should have made such a contribution to -the Military Force of France as would probably enable her to hold any attack that might be made, while our enormous Fleet was operating in other ways on the sea. We resolved, after consideration, to raise that force from 100,000 to 100,000, and aimed at placing it in its posiFrench Socialists are advocating to-day. tion on the frontier in twelve days instead of fifteen.

There were published then the secret treaties between Russia, England, and Prance, and between Italy and the other Powers. The war aims"" stated in those documents are not those to secure which the war is being fought. Those treaties do not show that the Powers are fighting to make the world safe for Democracy. On the contrary, they provide for the dividing up of the spoils. We have been told that what is desired by Italy is the restoration of Austrian subjects who are really Italians; but we find that it is proposed to tear from Austria a purely Austrian province, just as Alsace and Lorraine were torn from France in 1871. world should have the government acceptable to its people, who should be allowed to determine what form of government they would like, and what nation they should be joined to. lish and Australian Labour parties are advocating the same thing. I think that the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) will agree with me that other countries should enjoy the right of self-government which we in Australia claim; the right to determine the laws by which they w ill be governed, and to choose those who are to administer those laws. I contend that the moral aspect of the question should be placed -before the people, and that the people should be made to realize that they are behind a right cause. The Allies stand to gain considerably, from the moral view-point, When the if they can convince their own peopleI speak now more especially with respect to the people of Australia, just at. this time when the Government, and those behind them, are saying it is absolutely necessary that recruiting should be stimulated. The argument that the people of Australia should not be permitted to read those secret agreements is fallacious. I sincerely wish the Allies would state their aims, and that the Central Powers would give expression to their purposes.

I repeat that the moral force that would be gained by the Allies would be incalculable. If the Allies would say, "" We want no territory and no indemnities,"" and if we could prove that we have nothing to lose and everything to gain by that expression, then they would have performed a universal service. If the Allies would say, "" We are prepared to remove the barriers between the workers of the Allied countries and those of the other combatants; and, to prove our bona fides, we are willing to allow men and women representatives of the workers of the various countries to meet together and see if any real reason exists why this awful slaughter should continue,"" something, indeed, would haye been accomplished.

Probably, Germany might refuse; but that would only make my argument the sounder. If the Central Powers refused, they would stand convicted in the eyes of their people of the working classes, and in the eyes of the world, as the powers responsible for prolonging this terrible upheaval.

The following particulars aretaken from the Manchester Guardian, which quotes from the Investia and Pravia of 23rd November, as follows:1. A confidential telegram of the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Bussia) to the Ambassador in Paris, 5th March, 1915 (No. 1226) :"" On 23rd February (Sth March), the French Ambassador, on behalf of his Government, announced to me that France was prepared to take up a most favorable attitude in the matter of realization of our desires, as set out in my telegram to you (No. 937), in respects of the Straits and Constantinople for which I charged you to tender Declasse my gratitude. In his conversations with you, Declasse had previously more than once given his assurance that we could rely upon the sympathy of France, and only referred to the need of elucidating the question of the attitude of England, from whom he feared some objections, before he could give us -more definite assurancein the above sense. Now the British Government has given its complete consent, in writing, to the annexation, by Bussia, of the Straitsand Constantinople, within the limits indicated by us, .and only demanded security for its economic interests and a similar benevolentattitude on our part to the political aspirations of England in other parts. For me, personally, filled as I am with most complete confidence in Declasse, the assurancereceived from him is quite sufficient; but this Imperial Government would desire a more definite pronouncement of France's assent to the complete satisfaction of our desires, similar to that made by the British Government.. 2.

The Chairman. Inter-State Commission, Sydney. Bear Sir,-Tw o deputations, representing the Wholesale Meat Traders and the Producers' Association, of New South Wales, waited upon me. to-day in connection with the proposal of the Government to adopt the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission to fix the local price of meat on the basis of the Imperial Government contracts, and made statements which would appear to call for further consideration. As you are aware, the Government had instructed Mr Whitton, Chief Prices Commissioner, to take the matter in hand, with a view to giving effect to the Commission's recommendations; but after hearing the statements of the deputations, I have come to the conclusion tliat it is advisable to re-open the. question, to give them an opportunity of placing fresh evidence before you. In the meantime I have promised to stay proceedings. Will you be good enough to arrange for the persons interested having an opportunity of placing their case before the Commission as early as possible? I should be glad if Mr oWhitton could attend, in his official capacity, to take such part in the inquiry as may be necessary. I have the honour to be, sir, your obedient servant, (Signed) W. M. HUGHES. That letter is very strange, having regard to the fact that the Commission had already submitted two reports in similar terms to the last report, and the Prime Minister knew, from the evidence submitted to the Commission, that the price of meat was too high. Yet, after caref u l consideration of the Commission's two reports, he decided to defer action until the exploiters had had a further opportunity of placing their views before fche Commission. Even after fchafc body reported for the third time, it was only the force of public opinion and the persistency of houorable members on this side of the House that compelled the Government to take action. If there had been no protest from the public press and from members of the Opposition, the reportof the Comn.ission would be in the waste paper basket. I wish to deal briefly with fche statements made by the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) in order to show the inconsistency of members on the Goof the Committee. [Quorum vernment side. Last night, the honourable member stated that the members of the I desire first of all Commission were men of integrity and ability.

I will tell the Committee how fche price of meat has been regulated throughout Australia. In the pastoral districts, where stock and station agents are operating, and where there are frequent sales of stock, the agents advise the pastoralists as to when there is likelv to be a shortage, or over-supply, of stock on the market, so thafc the stock-breeders may know when to bring their stock along in order to get the best price. In that way, the price of meat is being regulated. Many producers are not getting the f u l l value of tlieir product, because the profit is derived by the middleman, who is permitted fco exploit the public. honourable member. that the price of meat is not too high. That necessary commodity is not within reach of the working man, and, therefore, it is necessary for the Government fco take action so thafc the working man may be permitted to get a sufficiency of the necessaries of life.

Por those reasons, he can speak with some authority on pastoral matters, and he ought to be able to come to the assistance of the working classes by seeking to bring about a reduction in the price of meat. He knows well that meat prices have risen out of all proportion to those of any other commodity. doing what I could to assist the working classes to get cheap meat. that remark, because, if the honourable member were sincere, he would have assisted the Government in reducing the price of meat.

In Queensland the Imperial prices operate to assure the grower of a fair return. Further, the abnormal high price of wool will leave sheep pastoralists in receipt of greater returns, even with .the price of mutton reduced, than before the war. That is quite true. The sheep pastoralist will not send his sheep to fche meat market at all, but will keep them for the purpose of growing wool. The Pederal Government have assured wool-growers that during the currency of the war, and for twelve months afterwards, the price of wool will be 15d. per lb. plus'freight. It is, therefore, only reasonable to assume that the sheep pastoralist will keep the bulk of his sheep for wool instead of sending them to the meat market. honourable Queensland is in a remarkably good ; Referring in Sydney last week to the QueensTreasurer Theodore said that what had been done was merely the first step towards a comWhen only twelve shops had been in operaf7,000, and since then a further eighteen shops had been established.

Board should be constituted which should be compelled to sit continuously in every part of this country. It should have the power to say what the prices of necessary commodities shall he. In my opinion the whole of the commodities of' life used by the workers should he brought under its jurisdiction. At present a few articles that are regarded as necessary commodities are dealt with, whilst exorbitant prices are charged for a vast number of articles that are not so regarded, but which are sold by a great number of merchants and distributors throughout Australia. The people of this country are being exploited by the prices charged for boots, clothes, and various other things, but no action is taken by the Government to prevent what is being done. There are thousands and tens of thousands of hungry children throughout the Commonwealth to-day who are crying for meat, whilst the great patriots and the Win-the-warites of Australia are sending the price of meat up to the greatest possible extent. There are thousands and tens of thousands of bare footed children in the Old Country crying for boots, whilst those controlling the sales of the article are permitted to raise the prices to such an extent that the working people of the British Empire cannot afford to purchase them. the boot into them."" have been put into the present Government more frequently than it has heen, because they have never attempted to reduce the cost of necessary commodities. When the exploiters decide to send up the price of an article, they wait upon the Prime Minister, with certain arguments in favour of their proposed action, and the right honourable gentleman, with the Necessary Commodities Commission, determines to permit them to increase prices to the fullest possible extent. That was done by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and also took place quite recently in connection with the boot Most honortrade. In every branch of industry the Government have permitted the exploiter to put up the price of goods.

Some little time since, I drew the attention of the Government to the profiteering carried on in the interests of , the Standard Woollen Company, a German business concern, which had been declared an enemy firm; but I did so, evidently, with no result. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Jensen), in answer to a question that I put to him today in regard to this company, which is now in process of liquidation, made the following observation: The question of tlie disposal of any profits secured over the book values is at present receiving my attention, and the honourable member for Darling can rest assured that, if practicable, any undue profit will be passed to revenue. The"" Win-the-war"" Government are quite content to allow profiteering to be carried on in the interests of the German firm, whose business they are now managing, through the official liquidator, and they promise that whatever undue profit is made shall be paid, if practicable, into the revenue. These extra profits are practically bled from the people of Australia. As the result of the shortage of woollens in the Commonwealth to-day, hundreds of tailors are being displaced.

The official liquidator, appointed by the Government, is a Mr Sherlock, and he is acting in co-operation with the manager, a German, who conducts the business from his office in York-street.

The official liquidator, who, by virtue of his appointment by this Government, is in charge of the business of the Standard Woollen Company, is acting'in conjunction with the German manager in putting up the prices of woollens held by it. Taking advantage of the acute shortage of woollens', this combination is robbing the people. It must have the blessing of honourable members opposite, otherwise, after my protest of a few weeks ago, it wouid have been discontinued. We are now told deliberately, T by the Minister for Trade and Customs that, if practicable, a certain proportion of the profits will be paid into the Consolidated Revenue. That will not help the .people who are being robbed. Hundreds of tailors in Sydney have been displaced, and many small tailoring establishments have had to close up because of the great shortage of these goods. The company has in Sydney and Melbourne £40,000 of stock still undisposed of. Its Adelaide stock has been sold at an increase of from 300 to 400 per cent, on the 1914-15 invoices.

This robbery of the people must not be allowed to go on. Honourable members opposite are just as responsible for it as is the Minister to whose Department it relates. When I laid this information before the honourable gentleman a week or two ago, he should at once have taken action to put an end to this wholesale robbery. His does not intend to do so. On the contrary, he proposes to allow this German firm, and its German shareholders, to rob fche people fco a greater extent than they have done, because every day the prices of woollens are increasing. When I first brought this case forward, I made a certain offer to the Government, and that offer still stands good. I am prepared to givefche'names of four reputable firms in Sydney who will buy fche whole of the company's stock at a price which will allow for a fair rate of interest, and a fair margin of profit,on the 1914-15 invoices.

Thereupon, he said, "" You cannot see h i m . "" I replied, "" Ask him again."" He went to fche Consul-General again. The latter shook his head, and spoke in a low tone of voice so that it was impossible for me to hear what he said. ""Goldbraid and brass buttons"" came back, and said, ""He will nofc see you.

Ifc is a pitiable and damnable position that we have reached at the present time. I wish the Government well in their infamous conduct. do not intend to occupy very much time, bufc there are a few matters with which I wish to deal. There were quite a number of questions upon which I had intended to speak in connection with our boys overseas. I have presented to the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) and the Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) statements concerning the treatment of the lads oversea, and I wish to say that those honourable gentlemen have met the circumstances fairly generously. The Minister for Defence recognises the seriousness of the position, and has proraised that immediate steps shall be taken to remedy what is wrong. I did not wish to mention any of these matters, because I recognise fche very serious position thafc fche Allies are in at this juncture; but I owe a duty to the lads I left behind, and realize that something must be done in certain matters. However, as I say, I thought ifc wise not to« mention them unti l I had at least given the Government an opportunity to do .something; and I trust thafc the Minister will be true to his promise. I only wish that the Minister for Defence, or some representative of the Defence Department was in the House tonight, but perhaps the Postmaster General( Mr Webster) will take a note of what I say. During the time. I was in London and France, I recognised very keenly the necessity there is for Australia having a Minister of the Crowni n London-somebod y who represents the civil power of the Commonwealth. Australia is, indeed, MrM c GRATH I sincerely hope ifc will. Canada has her Minister there, and the boys from the Dominion have somebody to whom they can appeal. High Commissioner? sioner has no power whatever to deal with the complaints that are made. He is not in a position to do so; he is not a re-* sponsible Minister, but a public servant pure and simple. We have sent 300,000 soldiers to the other side of the world, and placed them completely afc the mercy of the military. If there is one section of the community that is without a soul ifc is the military. Human life is of very little consideration indeed over there, and our lads are going through much suffering at fche present juncture.

It is thought that, because a man has had seven days' pay deducted, he has been guilty of some dishonourable act, whereas it may only mean that after, perhaps, years of good conduct, he is fined for having overstayed his leave ten minutes, and the fine is inflicted by an officer who never heard a But the influences at shot fired. The fine appears as a red mark in the pay hook, and, of course, comes to the knowledge of the parents and relatives here. This ought not to be, and the fines ought to be remitted. The Australian is the gamest and best soldier the worldhas ever seen-n o better .fighter than he can be found. He has never been guilty of disobeying an order on the battlefield. It is his vitality which impels him to break rules in search.' of a little pleasure, and makes him the gamest of soldiers. When he has paid the supreme penalty, these little offences should not be brought to the knowledge of his people in the way they are. The matter of deferred pay is causing much anxiety and trouble to me, and, I suppose, other honourable memhers. I am besieged day and night with interviewers, and letters and telegrams from all over Australia. "" M v boy was killed twelve months ago,"" a letter will say, "" and I cannot get the deferred pay."" Why is this? in eight months. to be done in three months.

Many of the lads when they come hack desire to start a little business, but, in the absence of their pay, this is impossible. Strong representations ought to be made to Horseferry-road, and to the HeadQuarters in France, and those in control informed of the trouble and difficulty caused in Australia by this delay in the settlement of accounts.

I trust the Minister will go into the question of promotion, particularly the I have drawn the attenpromotions given to-day to certain recruiting sergeants. There ought to be no such thing as a sergeant, corporal, lieutenant, or major in the administrative Head-quarters. The members of the staff there ought to be plain Mr Jones, or Mr Brown, because that is the civil part of the Department. An increase of pay should be given for good work, but no military rank. That is the thing which is causing more bother than enough in London.

That is Mr Smart, the man who ran ths "" Win-the-war "" paper during the election of 5th May. Yet he never enlisted! That reminds me of the gentleman who came over there, and by some influence honourable became head of the Australian Headquarters in London. His name was Robert McC. Anderson.

If he is marked Cl in Great Britain, that means ""back to Australia,"" and if a man is marked Cl in Bombay he certainly ought to be back here. They have told me of another little trouble. While they are in camp in Bombay they are allowed only two meals, but they are paid 3d. to buy the third-meal. They do not complain about the amount, but when some of them have come back to Australia, and have been given their discharge, the military authorities have refused to recognise that 3d. which has been entered up in their books. It amounts in some cases to a fair sum, and the military authorities have deducted it from their payments, regarding it as an overpayment, in settling their accounts. The secret treaties referred to by the sidine), were published freely in Great Britain, and they were not denied in the House of Commons When I left England it was my intention to deal with them on my arrival in Australia, but I realize now that this is not the time to talk about them. All our efforts should be concentrated on bringing the German offensive to a stand-still. It must be stopped, and the sooner we can do it the better it will be for humanity. The discussion of secret treaties will not bring it to an end. We cannot talk terms of peace with the military junkers of Germany, who are in absolute power in their own country.

The position is about as serious as it can be. Paris is threatened, the Channel Ports are threatened, the Motherland is threatened, and our very national existence is threatened. I am proud of the country to which I belong, I am an internationalist so far as Socialism is concerned. I have not the slightest hatred of the Germans as a people, because I recognise that the system under which they are living has made them what they on this country of ours. I want to live in this country, and I want to do so under the rule of Australians. We may have our wrongs, and there may be differences among us, but we have adult suffrage here, and once every three years we have the opportunity to settle differences amongst ourselves. It is because I want to see our nationality preserved that I am anxious that we shall have as few differences as possible among ourselves at this juncture. Whether we were wrong in entering the war or not, we have sent our boys away, and given them our promise that we shall stick to them. Our obligation to them must be fulfilled. We cannot desert the lads who are now fighting with their backs to the wall in order to prevent Paris from being taken, and prevent the Germans from reaching the Channel.

She is putting up this big offensive in the hope of making one gigantic scoop which will force France to her knees and compel Great Britain to sue for peace. She is suffering tremendous losses.

I believe that Great Britain entered this war with the highest of ideals, namely, to honour the word which she had given to Belgium, and to preserve the neutrality of that country, but history will judge us, not by the disinterested purpose we had when Ave entered the war, not by our mind as we went in, but upon the way in which we come out of it , such as by claiming annexations or looking for other people's territory. I believe that we can come out of the war with the ideals we had when we entered it. We ought not to want new territory. Our sole requirement should be the recognition of the fact that we made so many sacrifices and lost so many of the flower of our manhood fighting for a fine objective. If we secure that objective, it should be our only reward. I hope that the present offensive will soon come to an end. Wheni t does it will be time to ask the Allies to revert to the -position of 1914. appreciate the remarks of the honourable He has certainly made some very serious statements in connection with our Forces overseas, and I am glad that the Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Wise) and the Minister in charge of recruiting ( Mr Orchard) were able to hear him. I trust that these matters will be inquired into, and, if necessary, rectified. I am sorry to have to break ground widely different from 'the subject of the interesting address of the honourable member for Ballarat, but I wish to deal with I do not think that Germanyi i able member fof Barrier( Mr Considine) a few nights ago, in connection with the price of meat, and with some statements made to-night by the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Nicholls). To hear honourable members opposite speaking, one would believe that the State of Queensland is the place for cheap meat. The alleged cheapness of meat there has been rather overboomed, because, when we come doAvn to bedrock, Ave find that the actual position is not nearly what it has been represented to be. Quite a wrong impression has been created. It is true that the Queensland Labour Government have purchased pastoral stations at a cost of something like £750,000; but they have not paid cash for them, or for the cattle on them. They have been bought on debentures, which posterity Avill have to honour. I contend that the utilization of debentures for the purchase of live stock is not legitimate business, because they are a disappearing asset. If a drought should happen to come along, fche asset may not be there when posterity comes to foot the bill. There is also ah impression abroad fchafc fche Queensland Government supply their butchers' shops with meat from their own stations. That impression is also entirely wrong. The Government have not killed a single beast from any of their stations for the puipose of supplying the State butchers' shops. They have certainly sold a number of cattle from their stations fco owners in New South Wales, and they have supplied various meat Avorks in Queensland at 4$d. per lb., the full price under the Imperial contract. in the Enoggera market. casions when the yarding at Enoggera was small, and 'fche Government have run in a number of bullocks for fche purpose, they say, of keeping the market down, but if they were really anxious fco give the people of Queensland cheap meat they would enter into legitimate compe-",66,Sasanoff

322,Mr Mackay,"There have been octition with the private butchers' shops, which they are certainly not doing now. Instead of selling their bullocks to the meat works, I contend that every beast the Queensland Government breed or own on their stations should be sent through the yards for the purpose of keeping up the supply. One would gather from the statements which have been made in this House that a large proportion of the people of Queensland are being supplied with cheap meat, but according to a report of the State Auditor-General, less than 7,000 families are being supplied, which, on the average of five to a family, means that about 35,000, people out of a population of over half-a-million are getting alleged cheap meat. families dealing with private shops would get meat at a cheaper price on account of the State butchers' shops selling cheaply ? ber refers to a trifling benefit. This is what the State Auditor-General says in connection with the State butchers' shops in his report upon the accounts of the State industrial undertakings for the period ending 30th June, 1917Under the agreements with the various meat companies, the prices paid for beef and mutton by the State butchers' sbops, from April to 31st December, 1916, were as follow:Frozen beef, 3fd. per lb. Chilled beef, 3Jd. per lb. Mutton, 4Jd. per lb. From the 1st January, 1917, and continuing to the end of the war and for three months thereafter'Frozen beef, 34d. per lb. Chilled beef, 3d. per lb. Mutton, 4Jd. per lb. The profit on the shops-£5,91 3 19s. Id -is equivalent to 3.7 per cent, on the turnover, £160,118. The conditions under which the business is conducted are exceptionally favorable, primarily due to the low price at wbich the meat is obtained, thereby enabling the shops to sell at correspondingly low prices and without any expense for soliciting custom, delivery farmers simply deal in stock. of meat, cost of collection of moneys, and bad debts. HereI would like to mention the fact that this meat is not obtained legitimately. It is quite apparent that Great Britain is giving a large subsidy to the Queensland Government. The arrangement made with the meat companies provides that 12,000 tons, or one-tenth of the total killings, whichever is the lesser, shall be supplied to the Queensland Government for the State butchers' shops, and that the Imperial authorities shall pay the Queensland Government 4§d. per pound on the meat exported. That means either that the British Government"" are paying at the least £900,000 too much for their meat, or that the Queensland Government are responsible for taking at least another £100,000 out of the pockets of the graziers; for those figures represent the difference between the rate of 3^d. per pound for the 12,000 tons of meat which the State Government have commandeered and the rate of 4£d. per poimd which the British Government are paying for their meat. It is quite time this matter was brought before the House in a proper way. I am in f u l l sympathy with the consumer in regard to the price of meat. It is certainly too high, and it is the duty of-the Government to attempt to control it in some way or other. I think, however, that on this question of price fixing the Government are beginning to find out on how many different lines it is really necessary to fix prices in order to do anything like a fair thing by the whole community. It seems to me that once they dabble in price fixing for certain lines, they will find others that ought to be fixed also; but, apart from that, I am quite in sympathy with the consumer at the present time, because I can well Temember that, when cattle were much cheaper than they are now, stock-owners were doing well. It is only within the last two or three years that there has been any considerable rise in the price of cattle, and I believe that the dealing element has been largely responsible for this increased price. One has only to move about in the country centres to realize how the same cattle come into the sale-yards time and time again. In fact, in some districts even the Queensland is not likely to suffer very much as the result of any action the Government may take; but I would be sorry to see the small producers of the other States suffer through the fixing of prices. I do not think they will, because it is apparent they must have had a considerable number of cattle when prices began to rise, and if they happen to hold cattle at",67,Sasanoff

I know that dairymen generally go to saleyards, and, if they see a line of poddies, for which they have pasture, they buy. The whole business community are affected in very much the same way. A large numher of business people in the early days of the war had huge stocks on hand, for which they have since obtained big prices; and if, at the conclusion of the war, they hold big stocks, for which they paid high prices, which war competition will reduce, in Ihe long run the position should balance out all right. Whether this will be so or not, the fact remains that, at the present time, consumers are paying far too much for their meat, and I submit that the Government have to decide between restricting, export, which would be unfortunate, considering that export would be for the benefit of troops overseas, and supplying the people of Australia, if there is a shortage, by fixing upon a price that would enable the consumer to get his meat at samething like a fair rate. I think it is possible to have a fair deal in this matter, and I believe it can easily be .arranged without injuring the producers to any extent. Another matter to which I desire to refer is the claim for storage of meat made by the Queensland Government on the Commonwealth Government. I mentioned this matter when the last Supply Bill was under review, and the Treasurer ( Mr Watt), by interjection, assured me that it was being investigated, with a view to obtaining a refund. I should like to know as early as possible what progress is being made in this matter, which I regard as important. In order that the facts may be properly appreciated by honourable members, I shall read an extract from the report of the Queensland Auditor-General on the accounts of the State industrial undertakings. It will be found on page 9, in paragraph 20, thusRegarding the amount of £19,627 8s. 4d. shown above as having been received from the that it represents payment by that Government of this State's claim for storage charges 1917, on all frozen meat held in store to the of the Commonwealth Government. . . . As no payment was made by the State profit and loss account. Some capital has been made put of the fact that the State butchers' shops have shown a profit, but the sum includes this £20,000, which, I maintain, was taken from the Commonwealth in a manner which I do not think is creditable to the Queensland Government. It is necessary that I should also read what the Auditor General of the Commonwealth has to say on this subject. His remarks will be found in paragraph 33, as follows:33. Storage Charges on meat paid to Queensland Government -In the months of June and July, 1916, an agreement was made as between the Governments of Queensland and tbe Commonwealth for tbe supply of an estimated quantity of 4,000 tons of frozen beef which was required for the troops in training camps in some of the States. In the month of November, 1916, it was pointed out to the Queensland Government that owing to the difficulty experienced in obtaining freight to all the States where it was intended to use frozen beef, and to other circumstances which could not be foreseen, it was not likely that more than 1,800 tons would be required by the Defence Department. It was therefore requested that the State Government reserve that quantity only for the Department's requirements. A reply was received to the effect that owing to the meat companies ceasing operations for the season it became necessary to reserve sufficient beef to fulfil the order for 4,000 tons, and that a balance of 2,705 tons was then ""reserved and now held in stores on behalf of Commonwealth Government pending freight being available."" On the 6th December, 1916, the Minister acting for the Premier of Queensland drew attention to his letter of the 15th May, 1916, to the Acting Prime Minister, which, among other things, proposed that "" in the event of any works closing down with meat in store on your account, payment be made by you in full at once, and if not taken delivery of any storage incurred to be paid for by your Government,"" but he mentioned that storage would be charged only in the event of the Queensland Government being called upon to pay same by those storing beef on the Commonwealth's behalf.",68,Sasanoff
325,Mr Rodgebs,"Will you explain how Commonwealth Government, I find, from the",69,Sasanoff
326,Mr Mackay,"I thought I made it from the 31st December, 1916, to 31st March,A claim was made by tbe State Government on the 31st March, 1917, for interest, £1,365 Is. 6d., and for storage on 5,824,339 lb. of beef from 31st December, 1916, to 31st March, 1917, at l-16d. per lb. per week, £19,717 16s. 2d., and this claim was accompanied by a letter from the Minister writing for the Premier, which said:-""In the event of this Government being called upon to pay these charges we shall have to ask you to recoup us to that extent."" The; charge for interest was waived, but the £19,717 16s. 2d. for storage was paid to Queensland on the 28th June, 1917. An application was then made, for audit purposes, for certified copies of vouchers showing the payments made to the several, meat works for the storage of meat for the Defence Department. The reply received from the Queensland Government"" was "" that the settlement of storage claims against this Government for meat held on State and Commonwealth account was adjusted when the new agreement for meat supplies was drawn up, without any cash transaction, and therefore no receipts were exchanged between the parties."" The Acting Secretary, Department of Defence, states that "" the Premier's colleague, the Honourable J. M. Hunter, informed officers representing the Prime Minister's Department and the Department of Defence at an interview at the Auditorium Buildings, Melbourne, on 19th June, 1917, that the amount of storage had been actually paid by the Queensland Government to. the meat companies for storage of meat."" In the meantime, the only voucher I hold in support of the payment of the £19,717 16s. 2d. is the claim made by Queensland, the payment of which is signed for by the supervisor of the Queensland State retail butchers' shops. Eitlier a serious error has been made by the Queensland authorities, or the Commonwealth Government has been far too ready to hand over to it something like £20,000 of the money of the people of Australia. I trust that the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) has not forgotten this matter, and that he will have it fully investigated. the money has been obtained wrongfully he should insist on its being refunded. I desire to make an explanation which may prevent an interjection which I made from being misunderstood. I am informed that General Eetherston was responsible for recommending what the honorahle member for Ballarat( Mr day who is not his superior in attainMcGrath) was the first to suggest, namely, that artificial limbs for maimed Australian soldiers should be made here, and that there should not be any difference between those supplied to ofiicers and those supplied to privates, an absurdity which prevails in England, and is in keeping with the manner in which the survivors of the Balaclava charge were treated in that country. I had one man under me in St. Mary's Hospital who had been operated on eighteen times, and they could not provide him with a gocart, although he had lost both limbs; the students had to collect sixpences for the purpose. How many of those heroes died in the workhouse! About ten years ago I had the portraits of those who survived taken, and Reynolds Weekly, a democratic newspaper, shamed the British public into providing for tie latter days of these veterans. Personally, I thank Dr. Eetherston for having been so wise as to make this recommendation, fearless of the storm of abuse that may rage against him in England. It is creditable to the honourable member for Ballarat that he was the first to expose the unfairness of the English system. Those who heard the speech of the honourable member for Ballarat to-nignt about the treatment of our privates will be in sympathy with Kim. In this war, the privates risk more than the officers, who are not culled upon to lead their men, as they used to do in the past. Possibly, the advance in the science of warfare justifies the keeping back of the ofiicers, hut there should be no differentiation in their favour. If there is not room on the ships as they are now fitted up to bring back to Australia the soldiers who ought to return, let the officers' quarters on board be swept away, so that all the accommodation may be available for soldiers. As I have stated on a former occasion, I intend to advocate the giving of the same payment to officers If he finds that and men, and the same uniforms, food, pensions, and allowances for dependants. Some of the men who are generals here will never see the Eront, and run no ri#k of heing killed. Possibly one of them would be ashamed to go to England, because there he would be the least eligible man serving under the British flag. There is not an officer in Australia toments.

Where are General Cuscaden and his brothers? tralia, where they can never be injured. To-night I have been addressing a large meeting on the subject of the fixing of prices. I thank the Assistant Minister( Mr Greene) for the courteous answers which he gave the other day to two questions asked hy me. I askedWill he, in order to prevent citizens being unjustly charged, have the lists of retail prices for food posted in a permanent place in all post-offices, showing the local prices? To that the reply given wasRegulations are being prepared requiring the missionfixed prices to be exhibited in the shops themselves. That is even better than the suggestion contained in the question. The second question wasWill he have printed on such lists the name of the Commonwealth officer to whom citizens could write if overcharged? To that the answer was "" Yes."" Many persons do not like to go to law, and I am sure that if the public knows where te write when overcharging is suspected, the overcharging that has been too frequent in the past will be largely prevented. I was asked at the meeting when these regulations would take effect, and I replied that I could hardly say, but that I trusted that, as Parliament was going into recess, the price-lists would ho published all over Australia within a month. This should enable the poor and lowly to get food at the prices fixed by the Government. Only members of the Ministerial party are opposed to the fixing of prices, though all the members opposite are not without sympathy for the men, women, and children of this country. I pay my meed of praise to Messrs. Piddington and Mills, who have written Dr. Maloney. history in their report on the meat question. On 23rd October Messrs. Piddington, Swinburne, and Lockyer forwarded a report on the fixing of prices. These four gentlemen are paid a large salary to do certain work, . and they have honorably performed that work -Their* report, however, was kept back. Why?

As you are aware, the Government had instructed Mr Whitton, Chief Prices Commissioner, to take the matter in hand, with a view to giving effect to the Commission's recommendations, but, after hearing the statements of the deputations, I have come to the conclusion that it is advisable to re-open the question, to give them an opportunity of placing fresh evidence before you. In the meantime I have promised to stay proceedings. The Prime Minister did not say that to common workmen and women who have a difficulty in paying for the meat for their families. He said to the Chairman of the Inter-State Commission, "" MeantimeI have promised to stay proceedings."" The letter proceedsWill you be good enough to arrange for the persons interested having an opportunity of placing their case before the Commission as early as possible.

The Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) now has the intention of fixing prices so that the worker shall get meat at a f a i r charge, based upon the wholesale price, which w ill be insisted upori by the Government. The only comment I can make upon that is that if the Acting Prime Minister brings such a state of affairs about he w ill have done better work than his colleague in the whole of the time he has been PrimeM in ister. We are told that sheep are not as numerous as they were. In 1916 they totalled 76,668,000 for the Commonwealth. number is not as great as in preceding years. Quite true, but when we know that 40 per cent, were ewes bearing lambs, and that such ewes have 60 per cent, of lambs-to which two prominent squatters agreed as being very small-if those figures are worked out it w ill be found that they represent an increase of 18,000,000. Last year the number was greater than in any other year Australia has known. And how much more will it be this season ? Is there any need to wonder, therefore, that the Commissioners, upon sworn evidence, statedThe sheep in the Commonwealth are greater in numbers than in 1913, while the number of cattle is about the same as in that period. The present prices of meat for home consumption in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia are about 100 per cent, higher than the prices in 1913. The Imperial contract prices, after deducting | d. per lb. for freezing, are about 65 per cent, higher than the prices ruling in 1913, when the flocks and herds of the Conunonwealth were about tbe* same in number as at present. If the meat slaughtered in that year had been sold at the prices now suggested, the increased return to the grower would have been £13,500,000. The Imperial contract price for wool as compared with the pre-war prices gives an inI n the case of bacon and ham there -was a ; creased annual return per sheep of not less slight increase from 7.9 lbs. to 8 lbs. than 4s. per head.

That should be a year and a half, and Inter-State Commission says, on page 47 perhaps nearly two years. considerably over twelve calendar months. a marked falling off in the consumption per The recommendations are1. Tliat the Imperial contract prices, less a deduction of f d . per lb. (freezing charges), be fixed as the maximum wholesale prices for meat in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth (including Fremantle), Hobart, and Launceston, such prices to include delivery by wholesaler, where, as in Sydney and Melbourne, that is the custom of the trade. In Adelaide the maximum wholesale price for beef to be i d . per lb. higher than in the other cities named, the maximum wholesale prices for mutton and lamb to be the same as in those cities. 2. That the prices so fixed be used as a basis for fixing the price on the hoof of cattle, sheep, and lambs in the centres where there is no wholesale meat trade. In those centres an official declaration should be made of the maximum weights upon which the bidding is to be based. We have been told that that 3. No action seems necessary with regard to retail prices, which (the evidence shows) will conform to wholesale prices. Well, that may or may not be. The prices, fixed wholesale to the Imperial Government-for which we have to thank Mr Ryan, Premier of Queensland, more than any one else, since it is to his farseeing policy that this has been duearePrices to Imperial Government-Beef, 4Jd.; mutton, 5Jd. Prices to the Queensland Governnfent-Chilled beef, 3d.; mutton, 4id.; frozen beef, 3Jd. That, in a nutshell, shows how a Government can control prices. The Commission also indicated that unfortunate women and children were suffering-as also were the men-foo d having gone up so high in price that, owing to the limited resources of the workers, they could not possibly pay for it . The statistics show the following reductions in the consumption of meat per head of population:1907-9. 1915-16. lbs. lbs.

332,Mr Watt,,72,Sasanoff
333,Dr. Maloney,"have been obliged to curtail tbeir consumption of this commodity and that the poor of the community suffer privation in this respect. In the present inquiry evidence concerning these views from a personal, rather than a statistical, stand-point was brought forward. In Adelaide a leading retail butcher (whose statements were supported by others) spoke as follows:When meat can be sold at reasonable prices the consumer buys larger joints. In the case of mutton and lamb, for instance, he would be induced to take full quarters. In this case, the butcher practically gets rid of the carcass without much trimming or waste, and is able to Bell at a less margin We should continue the work for which we on cost than if he has to cut the carcass into small joints and pieces. On high prices the public are forced to buy small quantities, and there is a big demand for chops, steaks, and small cuts. As a consequence, there is a waste and loss, and a quantity of prime meat' suitable for joints finds its way into the factory. It is significant that the average household now has a roasting joint for the Sunday dinner only, whereas it used to be customary to have these joints perhaps two or three times a week. Corroborative evidence was put forward in Melbourne, where, in 1917, the practice of selling lamb by the quarter (averaging 7* lbs.) has been displaced in favour of selling by the single pound to meet the reduced purchasing power of the community. In Sydney, witnesses who have been engaged in the distribution of relief for the distress occasioned by last year's strike, gave convincing evidence of the result of existing prices of the ordinary household. Of this evidence, perhaps the most important feature was the result shown that in order that the bread-winner may eat meat, children are to a large extent deprived of it. In the hemely language of one witness -""The father gets the meat and the children the gravy."" The seriousness of curtailing the meat diet of the growing generation of a nation whose fine physique is attributable in part to plenty in the past, and which has been a meat-eating people in an unusual degree, may be judged by the action taken by the Food Controller in the TJnited Kingdom. The following .cable appeared in the morning papers of the 6th April, 1918:The new national scheme of meat rations in Great Britain reduces the ration of butchers' meat by one-third, and correspondingly increases that of other meat. It allows children over six years of age an adult ration, and boys between thirteen and eighteen years a supplementary ration. At the meeting I addressed to-night were business that we may proceed with? two women who asked me when the price Limit the speeches to a quarter of of meat would be reduced. elicited the fact that one woman had to us go straight to a division on every prokeep a family of seven children on £2 15s. a week. Her case was not as bad as that of a.man who called on me to-day, and who has nine children and an income of £2 14s. a week. All the time the prices of meat and bread are rising. Who is to blame? Not the Government or Parliament ; but we shall be to blame if we take a holiday when we have work to do. I am willing to resign from my seat and contest it with the Acting Prime Minister on the question as to whether Parliament should at such a time go into recess. are paid £12 per week.

Are there any of these lengthy adjournments by the British Parliament, which is nearer the centre of war, and has a hundred times more trouble than has this Parliament? Does the American Congress adjourn? Parliament has often gone into recess during the war. such lengthy periods as those which this Parliament has adjourned from time to time.

Every member of the Committee is in almost daily receipt of communications showing that so far as the military administration of the country during the war is concerned, the experience of Australia is of a very sad and unthe war period, to win the war. There satisfactory character. member for Ballarat was able to speak of things from first-hand information, because he has been brought into close personal contact with them, and with each additional batch of returned soldiers. Those whose acquaintance with the war has been confined to Australia are discovering how general and well-founded, unfortunately, are the statements made by the honourable member. Our military experience is certainly most unfortunate. What the honourable member for Ballarat suggested is true. The Empire went into this war with the most high, noble, and honourable intentions, and Australia went into it with certainly the most honourable and laudable desires; but Australians are beginning to feel that, whether it is due to the unchangeable character of war and itsinherent vices, wrongs, and wickedness, however worthy their particular desires and intentions. were, all that was primarily right and laudable is rapidly being dispelled and dissipated. In regard to the conduct of war affairs by the Government, in order to lead up to what I wish to say particularly later on, I shall only say now that the Government have been in office for thirteen months. They were elected on' their own claim to have some special virtues which would enable them to win the war. They promised the people of Australia an almost immediate cessation of hostilities, an have resulted in the horrors of starvahonorable peace, virtues, blessings, and abundant satisfaction if they were elected. and have been exposed in all their nakedI t has to be admitted that while some little reform has been secured, every one that has been gained so far has had actually to be torn from the Government.

I wish it were. A wake is certainly the due of the Win-the-war Government. If they were to face the country at present, they would get their desserts, and an inquest would be held. The Government made lavish promises in regard to the war. I do not overlook the fact that our party also professed an ability, based upon a two years' administration during The honourable was a big difference in the policy propounded by each party but the basic T suggestion in each instance was the same. The present Government, however, by lavish promises and questionable methods, secured a majority in this House; and having a majority also in another place, they have been able to absolutely control the affairs of Australia. To-day we are faced with the position that, whatever else the Government may have done to carry out their policy of winning the war y they have shown an utter disregard for the interests of the masses of the people. They will go down to posterity as a Government that were good to their friends the profiteers and the "" patrioteers."" It will be said of them that, whoever else they forgot, they certainly did not forget those who financed and supported them, and who, also like the Government, have had an utter disregard for the interests of the people. The economic position in every country to-day is of very grave concern. Throughout the world we have to-day an economic situation unparalleled in history. It is one of the peculiar facts adding to the horrors of war, and one that will tell in the intelligence of the people against war, that the withdrawal from productive employment, of the men necessary to carry on the conflict, and the dissipation of the ordinary economic activities of the people, tion.

395,Mr Fenton,"The Government, Iare now saying that the small farmers will suffer most from the effects of this proposal. Honourable members who are acquainted with stock operations in this country must know that practically the same number of fat cattle come into the Homebush and Flemington markets every week. How is that managed? Commissioners are only able to provide a certain number of trucks. supply of stock is noticeable all the year round, and the Railway Departments cannot always be short of trucks. I have perused the files of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Argus, both Conservative papers, and I find there is a remarkable regularity in the number of fat cattle sent forward to each market. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the weekly yardings at Homebush for February were-1s t February, 1,582; 8th February, 1,657; 15th February, 1,804; 22nd February, 1,742. In the yardings of 15th February, there was this comment"" over 200 more than drawn for."" the month of May, the weekly yardings were-2n d May, 1,835; 9th May, 2,005; 16th May, 1,785; 30th May, 2,105. Practically the same number of cattle come forward every week, and any honourable member who has any knowledge of the stock business must know that arrangements are made, in order to yard only a certain number of cattle, so that the price may be kept up, and that if they know that the market is already overstocked, the agents wilt advise owners to hold off. Will any honourable member deny that? made that only a certain number of stock will come on to the market at a particular time. This proves conclusively that graziers are in collusion with stock and station, agents, in order to maintain the prices of stock. similar circumstances? press of 25th March of this year tells a different tale. The March prices for meat in London seem to have been pretty well on a par with the prices in Australia. It is true that the National Farmers Union passed a resolution asking the Comptroller of Foodstuffs that the raisers and fatteners of cattle in Ireland might be brought under the rules that were being applied to those in England. Beef bullocks were selling in Ireland readily at from SOs. to 90s. per cwt., the prices in England ranging from 75s. per cwt for oxen to 42s. per cwt. for fat cows, live weight. In Great Britain the sale of stock by one dealer to another has been prohibited in war time, being permitted only in exceptional cases. member recommend that here? not be allowed to gamble in food stocks. The Queensland Government have closely followed stock operations in Australia, and according to Mr Hunter, an able business man who is a member of it, one line of stock changed hands no fewer than five times within a comparatively short period.

But I should be glad if the Victorian Government were offering to returned soldiers inducements to settle here as good as those offered by the Government of Queensland.' cover so large an area as Queensland, but it has a fair amount of land yet undeveloped. Returned soldiers will naturally seek? to establish themselves where they can get the best conditions, and I regret that Victoria, because it is not enbine which is taking an unfair advantage joying the vigorous up-to-date administration that Queensland enjoys at the present time, cannot offer the same advantages as tliat State. Reference has been made to the fact that the Queensland Government has issued debentures for £750,000 to provide for Government-controlled stations. That the policy of the Labour Administration of that State meets with the approval of its people was shown recently by the verdict of the electors when Parliament had to submit itself for re-election after three years of Labour administration. to retain the Labour Government in office in Queensland comprised all the enemy subjects there, numbering about one-tenth of the whole population. those people are not such great enemies to Australia and the Empire as those who would perpetuate a system under which this community is being robbed from day to day. Chanter) -The honourable member's time has expired. I do not wish to delay the Committee, but this may be the only opportunity for expressing my views on a subject to which a considerable amount of attention has been given of late-the fixing of the price of meat. The position becomes serious when foodstuffs are so dear that some perprices in Australia. We-want more of the sons in the community are not able to purchase them, and that seems to be happening in regard to meat in parts of Australia. Even before the war it was one of the world's problems how to provide sufficient food to enable the poorer members of society to live, and to provide for the healthy development of their children. That problem may become even more difficult of solution after the war. But the fixing of prices is a difficult and complex matter. quorum to hear what a Ministerialist has to say on this subject. [Quorum formed.] Mr .ATKINSON I doubt that the attempt to fix the prices of meat will give much genuine relief to those who must command our sympathy. The report of the .Inter-State Commission shows that there is not in Australia any trust or comof the situation. If such an organization did exist, I should be prepared to do what I could to help to scotch it , because I am opposed to profiteering in any form. The Government in proposing to fix the retail prices of meat are taking a better course than was recommended by the Inter-State Commission, which proposed that the price of beasts on the hoof should be fixed. The recommendation of the Commission would, I think, have been found impracticable, because of the inconven£ ence, trouble, and delay that it would have caused to graziers and others connected with the pastoral industry. In no case would it have prevented profiteering. I am satisfied that the majority of the graziers and small farmers are not benefiting by the present high prices of meat. Much cannot be hoped for in the way of relief from this attempt to fix pricesy since it is a matter of supply and demand. It is partly due to the shortage of stock that prices have been so high; and when we hear people say-as the Commission has said-that we have in Australia to-day as many sheep and cattle as in 1913, -it may be fairly replied that not so great a proportion of the stock is fit for the market. A great many more sheep are kept for their wool than was formerly the case, and very many of the cattle are too young at this stage to be sent to the market. It would be a shame to market them too soon. What is really wanted is that we should help production. That is the way to reduce commodity. tion, Mr Chairman, to the state of the Committee.

416,Mr Atkinson,"If an attempt wasclass of people whom we should always encourage-the people whom we are always asking to go out into the back blocks, the people who are carrying Australia to-day. We ask them to endure all the inconveniences and hardships of country life, and at the same time we do nothing to prevent their ruin, in many instances. That is not the way to conduct the affairs of the country. Another point to which I desire to give brief attention is that we have heard a great deal about the high prices of other commodities; but nothing has been said as to the high price which farmers and others must pay for their implements, for the stock which they are bound to buy to carry on operations, and for food supplies and clothing. Honourable members opposite seem to forget that the cause of the high prices of meat is largely due to the general rise in the price of many commodities. Owing to the inflation of the currency in Australia, and to the widely extended purchases of war bonds, people are now buying as they never previously were able to do. They are making the price of meat higher because they are in a position now to purchase prime cuts, and will have nothing else. There was a time when they were forced to buy according to their pockets, which were not too well lined, and butchers could sell the whole of a carcass. The demand for choice cuts to-day is higher for the reason that people will have nothing else, and are in a monetary position to demand the best. It is all very well for big breeders to say they can sell at present prices, and make money, i-fo doubt, they can; but even Mr Kidman, when he said he was satisfied with the prices he was getting in Queensland, confined his remark to that State. He says, now, he could not afford to accept those prices in South Australia or Victoria, or other places where he would have to send his stock a distance. It is the man who has stock on hand, and has not a great capital outlay, who is really making the profit to-day. Many small men have been tempted, for the first time in their experience, to go in for breeding calves. Thev have done so because of the high prices ruling; but as soon as the price of cattle falls, many of those men will have to give up breeding. While farmers can get £4 or £5 a head for calves, they consider that they can make a better profit by breeding than by buying store cattle at £10 to £12, and selling them when they are fat at a few pounds'* rise. I remember hearing the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page) remark in this House some time ago that the grazier was only then getting a fair deal. Prices at that time were tending to rise, for the reason that the world's demand was growing, and the supply in the United States of America for export was not so great owing to the extension of home consumption. The honourable member for Maranoa, who understood the position, remarked that the graziers had had to stand the brunt of things for many years, and were at last only getting a fair thing. The big man can stand a knock better than the small man. There are not many Kidmans in Australia, but there are many small farmers who purchased stock at high prices, and will be almost ruined if the market slumps. Altogether there will be a big upset in rural industries. .1 know of a case where a man is working 800 acres, for which he pays a good rent. He employs six married men most of the year, and two single men, and also occasional labour. Owing to the price of calves he has done what he had never undertaken before; he has bred from 100 cows. But he says unless he can get £4 or £5 for calves he will have to stop breeding at once. Through his rent and wages he has an expenditure of £2 an acre before he oan get one penny for himself. There are many similar cases in my district. This person usually fattened 130 to 200 cattle, and, besides, he had to grow fodder to assist in feeding them. Oommittee is inadequate to the circumstances of the subject. I would ask that a quorum be formed. [Quorum formed.] that there is 100 per cent, rise in prices. Let us look at the other side. The man to whom I have already alluded bought thirty-eight calves, for which he gave five guineas a head. Similar animals could have been bought four years ago at £1 per head. He purchased sixty-one steers at £10 each. The price of similar animals before the war was £4 10s. to £4 15s. He bought fourteen store cattle at £13 17s.",81,Loading Employment Of Non Unionist S Veneeea L Diseases Repatbiation Employment Of Re Turned Soldiers Amalgamatio N Of Banks Remission Of Penalties Incurred By Deceased Soldiebs

Also, he secured forty-four heifers at over £10 per head, the pre-war price for which would have been £3 10s. Then there were sixty-three yearlings at £6 each. Previously he would have got them at £2 per head. He also bought eighty-one other yearlings at £6 5s. each, when only a few years before that he could have got them for £2 a head. There are hundreds of people throughout the Commonwealth who are in the same position. That should indicate to honourable members opposite, and to the public outside, that it is not the farmer who is making fabulous profits out of the increase in stock. I hope that when the Minister concerned gets to work, if there is any profiteering going on between the stage when the cattle leave the hands of the producer and the meat is actually retailed over the counter, he will be able to discover the responsible parties and punish them. I will do my best to help him. I do not think the Inter-State Commission have really given a verdict according to the evidence at the second inquiry. They seem to me to have ignored very good evidence then put before them, and to have stood to the original idea. should call it a delusion, not an idea. might perhaps have given a verdict slightly different from that arrived at by them. I hope the Government will deal with this question promptly, so that stockmost ingenious in overcoming a difficulty, owners may know how they stand. I am not going to criticise their proposal tonight, because we do not yet know what their actual decision is; but I reserve to myself the right to take what action I see fit when their final decision shall have been made known. Sitting suspended from 12.7 to 1.7 a.m. [1.7 a.m.] -During this debate we have heard a good deal concerning the sins of the Government. I propose to deal with a few of their peculiarities. The Public Service of the Commonwealth comprises as smart a body of public officials as is to be question that the union would have claimed found in any country, but, unfortunately, they are treated in a wav that is not calculated to get the best out of them. They have little hope of improving their positions, and the various Departments seem to go out of their way to apply to them regulations and conditions not calculated to improve the efficiency of the Service. In the Defence Department, for instance, a large staff of clerks is employed, and the Court decided that they should not be paid overtime until they had been working for seven and a half hours per day. A t that time it was the practice of the departmental staff to work seven hours a day, and those who returned after tea were paid overtime. Two years later it was discovered by some of the officials that since these men had been working for only seven hours when they left for tea, they should have been required, when brought back at night, to work for another half-hour without being paid overtime. The Department then proceeded in a most unjust way to get back as quickly as possible from men who were receiving only 10s. per day the money that had in this way been overpaid. No one will say that a married man at the present time can keep himself and his family comfortably on 10s. a day. And yet these men have had as much as £2 per month deducted from their salaries in respect to the overpayment of overtime. I know of one man who, because of these deductions, had to give up his house and rent a couple of rooms. practice resorted to? going on. The Defence Department is as will be seen from the following letter addressed by the secretary, Mr Trumble, to the secretary of the Australian Clerical Association:28th May, 1918. Dear Sir, With reference to your letter of the Oth May, relative to the deductions being made from the salaries of temporary clerks on account of overpayment of overtime, I am directed to inform you that the Minister is unable to approve of the request of the union to waive these refunds. It is considered that if by an interpretation of an award of the Courti t had been found that the Department had underpaid temporary clerks, there is no that retrospective action should have been taken. I am not going to blame Mr Trumble for this.",82,Loading Employment Of Non Unionist S Veneeea L Diseases Repatbiation Employment Of Re Turned Soldiers Amalgamatio N Of Banks Remission Of Penalties Incurred By Deceased Soldiebs

As a matter of fact, the Postal Department has refused to do anything of the kind. award of the Arbitration Court, which the Department refused to honour.

457,I Have Re,"Mr MATHEWS -No, it is clothing,that the resolutions carried at the Conference called by the Governor General with the object of bringing about amity in the community for a certain purpose, are given effect to. In spite of all that was said at the Conference, the position in Melbourne, at all events, is very acute, and I know that the conditions in my own particular division are not conducive to amity. course, that the industrial organizations should have conformed to the suggestions made at the Conference; but I maintain that it is the duty of the Federal and State Governments to do something in the direction indicated at the Conference, in order to bring about a better feeling in the community. Minister say that, no matter what we on this side did, the Government would carry out their part of the agreement? ment is entered into, ought not both sides to give effect to it ? Tudor, as the leader on our side, has claimed that he made no bargain; and the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), as well as the State Premiers, have agreed that there was no bargaining. When they met in Conference, the representatives of the Governments put their cards on the table, and said they wanted to bring about a certain condition in the community, so as to insure an increase in enlistments; and the representatives of the industrial organizations then pointed out that certain things were necessary in order to bring about that result. Governments could not agree to place organized unionism in the position it occupied before the strike, or before the taking of the first conscription referendum in 1916, so that men who have been victimized may again be in a position to earn a decent living. And what do we find to-day? We find that, not only have unionists received no concessions, but that Governments and private employers are fostering "" scab "" unions, whose funds are supplemented by the different employers' organizations throughout Australia. If that is to go on, and if the various Governments think that organized labour is down and out for ever, they are making one of the biggest mistakes they ever made. Members of these "" scab"" unions will find, eventually, that they will have to organize unions in the non-union movement in order to get from their employers and the Governments concessions which they will undoubtedly desire. To call these men ""scabs"" is hardly a fit name to apply to them. It is not nasty enough. There is no employer in the community who I may be told, of does not detest every one of them, but is using them as an instrument to beat tlie true Labour organizations. I know, myself, that in the past, after industrial trouble was over, employers looked upon "" scabs "" with contempt, and usually the best workers, who are also the best unionists, were given their old positions again. The fact that organized labour not the Prime is continually endeavouring to improve the position of its members is not to be condemned. Is there anybody who does not try to improve his position? if an agreesociety ? honourable member has advocated strikes But, against society. the honourable member. No man on the other side of the Cliamber will condemn any man in the community for trying to improve his position even by striking against society, because it will be "" goodbye "" to any improvement if ever organized labour becomes satisfied with the conditions of its members.

This is a very serious matter which cannot be treated lightly. There has been disclosed, as a result of an inquiry by the highest authority, a very grave condition of affairs in regard to the prices being extorted from the public in respect of one staple product in particular, and that is meat. members that the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) promised me, in reply to questions which I was justified in putting to him, that this subject would be dealt with by the House, but it is eviorder to relieve themselves of their duty todent from the present attitude of the Government that they have no intention of giving members an opportunity of dealing with it, and apparently there is no intention , on the part of the Governexecutive power by means of Australian law ment to let the people know, at least beand force. fore the House goes into recess, what they propose to. do. This matter affects the well-being of the poorest people in this community, and it is of such consequence that if the Government regarded only their own political well-being, they would at least have the courage to say what their policy really is. My time being limited-although know other opportunities may be given to me to speak at a later hour in the dayI want to refer specially now to the quesbetween the Italians in Australia and tion raised in another form by the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley), namely, the deportation of our brother Italians, and the conduct in regard to them of the Italian Consul in this country. I am loath to take advantage of the privilege of Parliament, to reflect in any way upon a public or private individual who is not in a position to reply under the same privilege that honourable members enjoy, but I speak on behalf of a large body of persons who have special claims upon our consideration. They are persons who have come here at our invitation, as approved immigrants, and are law-abidine domiciled persons, and I am satisfied that a very grave wrong is being done to them day after day by the Commonwealth Government, at the request of the Consul, wrongly, I think, sometimes called the Consul General in Australia for Italy. I hold in 3/r. Brennan. my hand a memorandum prepared by an Italian lawyer under instructions from representative Italians in this country, expressing their views almost unanimously, and expressing also the law, so far as the Italian law is applicable to this particular case. I propose to read the document, but, for obvious reasons, I will not give the signatories unless the truth of any statement is controverted,, or if my own good faith in bringing the matter forward, or its authenticity, should be doubted. The document is a translation from the Italian, and, therefore, in some I remind honourable respects, the English is quaint, though I think it Is, on the whole, very good English. It reads as followsDear Sir,Italians are not seeking for excuses in ward the Mother Country. Australia gave to Italy a special grant in permitting the latter to enforce in Australian territory the Italian law, and, what is still more important, in giving to the Italian law Furthermore, Australia gave to the representative of the Italian Government such an extension of power that the Consul, with the help of the Federal authorities, became a kind of despotic King, master of the liberties of Italians, interfering in every form of communication between them and the Italian Government, and in some cases cutting communication altogether. In respect of that matter, in particular, I this Government has shown a painful want of appreciation of its duty. It should not have cut off communication the Italian Government. This communication should have been left free and open. It is the right of a foreigner to communicate with his home Government. consul. shows the honourable member's want of knowledge of the law and practice in these matters. Some time ago, I quoted authorities in this chamber which make plain the nature of the position of a consul. A consul is a mere subordinate agent, without diplomatic status, powers, or authority. He has no right, except in special circumstances, to communicate with his Government regarding the people of his nation; and under no circumstances must he arrogate to himself the right to alone communicate on behalf of his compatriots with his own",86,Loading Employment Of Non Unionist S Veneeea L Diseases Repatbiation Employment Of Re Turned Soldiers Amalgamatio N Of Banks Remission Of Penalties Incurred By Deceased Soldiebs

In the face of the evidence which I put before honourable members a week ago, I was astounded to read in the newspapers that a young Italian has been arrested and convicted in Sydney of having made statements prejudicial to recruiting. In the course of the trial, the statement was made on behalf of the prosecution, and accepted, that no naturalized person had been arrested in connection with the calling up of men. Italian was fined £ 2 5 , or three months' imprisonment, for having stated the contrary, though, to my certain knowledge, a dozen, and perhaps a score, of naturalized men have been arrested under the rule of conduct followed by the Italian Consul.

The youug fellows to whom I refer are, under our Pederal law, deemed to be naturalized, although they do not possess letters of naturalization. The Ministerf o r Home and Territories has issued special certificates to them, stating that they shall be deemed to be naturalized; yet the Italian Consul has disregarded those certificates, which, strictly, are not necesThis young sary. A comparatively recent amendment of the naturalization law makes that perfectly clearAnd as Italians cannot communicate with the Italian Government, and cannot communicate with Consul Eles, who expels them from thc Consulate, the situation is unmistakably bad. 1. A Consul, as an employee with only administrative power, has no authority for making in his own name any call to arm's; he must Of course, they only give effect to the orders of the Minister for Defence, who, too, is acting under the powers of a special Royal decree. Now, the main question put forward by Italians is this: Does this decree exist; and, if so, how is it lettered? This question is not an immaterial one, because all the decrees dealing with calls to arms from the beginning of the war until October, 1917, always exclude the Italians resident in Australia from any obligation of serving. In a number of 2. One of the fundamental rules of law is the presumption of knowledge of law.

But Italian laws are not known in Australia, nor may Italian residents here be expected to acquaint themselves with laws which are not by published in Australia, and are generally useless outside the Italian territory. Consequently, thc legal presumption in this The Minister for case is just thc reverse of the ordinary, namely, Italian law is legally unknown to the Italian subjects in Australia. Then, if for some reason these Italian laws are to have force in Australia, the first duty of the Italian Government, before enacting obedience, was to make them known. And what did Consul Eles do in this connection ? Nothing at all, or worse than nothing. 3.

479,Mr Brennan,"All personsthe widest publicity. To this intent the Consuls of every Province (they are called Prefetti), from two months before the day of the medical examination, are obliged to specially publish the Koyal decree with the special regulations, if any, of the Minister for Defence, indicating the various <|as for the medical examinations, the regulations in connection with the separation allowance, and the various cases in which and means by which any citizen may appeal against any error or wrong of which he believes himself to be the victim. These regulations are made public, not only in the ways mentioned, but also by special manifestoes posted up in every market, at every busy point of every city and village, so that the people cannot avoid being fully warned. And all that is done in Italy, where people have endless other means for knowing the laws. Now let us see what Consul Eles did here, so far away from. Italy. At various times appeared in some papers a short advertisement (in English, too, sometimes), as the following:-""Al l Italians born in the years from 1874 up to 1899 inclusive residents in Victoria, are summoned to present themselves at the Drill Hall, medical examination. Failure to do so will entail the consequence of arrest.."" This, or another similar, was the publication made by Consul Eles in this part of the world, where Italian laws are unknown, and where Italians knew that they were exempted by tbe regulations of a few months before. 4. Consul Eles, in the exercise of his unBritish and un-Italian methods, thinks that Italians here are not free people with duties and rights; people who do not love their Fatherland, do not obey the laws; slaves or criminals, and subject, so he thinks, to his despotic will, from which there is no appeal. So he thinks, so he acts, drunk with the extraordinary power so easily acquired, and exercised under the unsuspecting credulity of the Federal authorities. Following this complacent opinion, Consul Eles did not feel obliged to give any warning nor any explanation, although we contend that he was bound by law to do so; but he himself, assuming the powers of an Austrian Emperor,, calls all Italians to the colours, abruptly requires them to destroy all their business, and to leave their families. And Australia is helping this policy of violation with the deportation of the Italian subjects. 5. This open contempt of people's rights Consul Eles has brought to provoking extremes, because to the great majority of Italians who went -to the Consulate for explanations, he gave a curt answer, and should someone have insisted on a more complete answer, the interview nearly always ended with the expulsion of the poor astonished Italian from the Consulate. The favourite argument of the Consul is:"" If you fail to obey my orders I will put you under arrest."" 6. "" Arrest"" was and is the most cherished idea of Consul Eles, and he used it freely. Mr Bretman. M. the medical examination the result of the visit of each man is laid down in a special book, and is signed by the doctor and the man concerned. Many have been dissatisfied with the examination and its results, and naturally were not willing to accept them as final. But Consul Eles protested irf each case, angrily and aggressively, that the book must be signed, threatening the objectors with arrest, and to keep them under arrest until the sailing of the contingent. Viggiano Francesco, Barea Bartolomeo, Testa Alfredo, Lorenzo Rodriguez are the names of some of the sufferers. 7. To unveil the mystery with which Consul Eles was carefully obscuring the matters relating to the call, a special selected Commission of married men was sent to him (Messrs. A. Pellegrini, C. Boffa, Gr. Travaglia, M. Lacava, and G. Santamaria). At the Consulate, Consul Eles explained that he would accord a reception to the Commission only under the condition that all the members had signed a declaration previously prepared by him, which he read, and the contents of which declared thc Consul to be an authority from which there was no appeal. Naturally that document was not signed, , for and the Commission came hack unheard. And, it must be remembered, that what the Commission was inquiring for, the Consul should have kept permanently posted up for the information of the Italian people. S. And so Consul Eles, with the Australian authorities, put Italians in a very peculiar and distressing position. From him there is no answer but rebuffs. To Australian authorities we are forbidden to go, and they do not seem inclined to give us any help against the unlawful proceedings of the Consul. To our Government we cannot apply, cut off as we are from Rome. We can only account for this sometimes contemptuous and sometimes aggressive attitude of tbe Consul by reference to his Austrian ancestry, of which he has recently expressed his pride. But if the Federal Government had not imposed in the Consul such boundless trust, he would have remained in his secondary situation of Consul, and from there he could not have thrown on Italians such a sequence of injustices, and on tbe Australian nation the responsibility of helping in the violation of the elementary rights of man. 9. This contempt on the part of Consul Eles toward Italians and their rights he has used indiscriminately against Italians and naturalized British subjects. A great many of the latter were summoned, and several were arrested, or threatened with arrest (Labattaglia, B. Santamaria, and others). And this happened, not by mistake of the officials, but apparently by the order of the Consul, acting with a full knowledge of the facts. At Port Pirie the anti-Australian policy found its most open expression. Vincenzo Salvemini, fisherman, a naturalized British subject, thirty-seven years old, of Port Pirie, trusting in tbe word of the highest Italian authority (never before seen in Port Pirie), who told bim of a"" endless number of pains and punishments awaiting bim in Italy should he fail to obey the call of the Consul, consented to present himself for medical examination. But before doing so he obtained from the Consul an assurance that he would be allowed three months' grace to arrange his business. Some other Italians, British subjects, followed Salvemini's example-Leonard o Caputo, Paolo Gagliardi, Sebastiano Meszina, Saverio Minervini, &c. But, three days after medical examination was passed, they received a peremptory order to get ready for leaving Port Pirie on the 22nd April, that is four days later. And it must be remembered also that the Italian Consul went to Port Pirie on the 8th of April for the medical examinations, which were passed on the 9-13. Notwithstanding that this unfortunate fisherman-in tears for his coming ruin-reminde d the Consul many times of his solemn promise, the Consul did not allow any delay, even for a week. Salvemini and the others are British subjects. Salvemini was, financially, seriously embarrassed as the result of these outrages on British subjects. 10. From the parliamentary debates we know that the Federal Government passed provisions by which dependants resident in Australia are receiving separation allowance as laid down for the dependants of the members of the Australian Imperial Force, and that a further allowance of 2s. a day is passed by Australia to the Baid dependants. The Australian nation in so doing follow that wonderful rule of humanity and respect for a high standard of living, which is the pride of this ultra-civilized people. But, as a logical deduction, we Italians feel the bitterness of the unavoidable consequence that the Italian Government call home the sons of Italy, leaving in the charge of a foreign country to care for and support, as generously as possible, their dependants. And we do not blame our Mother Country for that, whatever may be our bitterness, because the Italian Government always knew very well, until a few months ago, how far the general conditions and standard of living differ in the two countries, and so relieved tbe residents in Australia from serving. Then, again, we do not blame Italy if, even aware of these great differences, she calls Italians to arms without asking any special provisions for their dependants here; because we know that should the Italian Government depart from the common law, they would establish a very dangerous precedent. But we blame Consul Eles because, departing from his subordinate character of Consul, he influenced, apparently, the Italian Government to make a sudden change of policy in regard to Australia. We blame the Consul because he did not appreciate the problem and was content to make every Italian either a criminal or a beggar. 11. Consul Eles forbade us to call for assistance on any Australian authority, and told us that Australian authority will not have anything to do with this concern, which he alone has power and right to deal with. If so, then the Consul must officially make known to us in detail what the Italian and Australian Governments will do for the dependants of Italian soldiers from here. He must, officially, tell us to what amount the said dependants are entitled, and where are the offices and officials in charge of the payment, whether Italian or Australian. Italians must know what is the position of their dependants in case of death, and whether pensions will be under the Italian or the Australian regulations, and in what amount and subject to what conditions. Two days ago, in reply to a question, I learned, for the first time, that Australia would grant no pensions to them or their dependants. orable member think that Australia has acted generously to them ? treated very meanly, and what has been conceded has been done under the pres' sure of my° party and myselfBid Consul Eles do anything in this very important and human regard ? Nothing, so far as we know, and we are entitled to know, except persuading the Federal authorities that Italians are anti-Italian, unpatriotic, and so on. Italians are faithfully standing for the Fatherland and for obedience to law; they are not protesting against military service, but against Consul Eles' practices, which are against law, equity, and social justice. ' The state of things is now a very bad one, and the Federal authorities must give to it more serious consideration. It is no longer a mere matter between Italians and their Consul, or between the Italian Consul and the Italian Government, from which Australia is at liberty to hold herself aloof. Australia's confidence in Consul Eles' selfcomplacency leads to this conclusion : At the expense of Italy and of the Italians, as well as of the honour of Australia, she is helping tliis person to make his secondary function of Consul something which it ought not to be. Well, this conclusion may, perhaps, be a trifling one if you do not give any consideration to this fact-that the whole matter is a game in wbich Consul Eles is glaying.. in his private interests, and proves himself a more intelligent and keen player than all the Australian authorities together. Consul Eles seems to be the oracle for Australia, and, just as in the old times, the game is going well-absolutel y well-for Oracle Eles, beyond his own most ambitious hopes. Consequently, Australia as a matter of honour has the duty now of interfering in the question to abolish the right of censorshp indirectly conferred on Consul Eles, and to let the whole truth be known. orable member's time has expired. a.m.] -It had not been my intention to make any particular reference to price fixing in connection with meat supplies, as",88,Loading Employment Of Non Unionist S Veneeea L Diseases Repatbiation Employment Of Re Turned Soldiers Amalgamatio N Of Banks Remission Of Penalties Incurred By Deceased Soldiebs

483,Mr Finlayson (Brisbane) [2.12,"I had proposed to wait until the Govern^ ment had declared their policy; and, but for the remarks of the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) I would not have called attention to the subject at this stage. Nothing more lamentable in the administration of public affairs has occurred on the part of the present Government than their absolute want of control of the necessaries of life during the present critical period. I am prepared to admit that the late Hughes Government, and the Labour Government before that, also failed to an extent in their duty in the same matter. A Committee, under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Cook( Mr J. H . Catts), and composed of honourable members from both sides of the House, was appointed by the Labour Government to deal with the question of price fixing. accept our recommendations. Government either refused to give the Committee reasonable assistance or to honour its recommendations, whereupon it refused to carry on such a farcical prohappened in Queensland, with satisfacceeding. We have to admit that it has"" taken us a long while to make up our minds as to the necessity for doing something to protect the consumer. The Government have shown a desire to delay as long as possible in this direction. As I pointed out in the course of remarks earlier in the day's debate, every reform has to be dragged from the present Government. It is an unfortunate fact in connection with the meat problem that it is only in yielding to strong and indignant public opinion that the Government have been compelled to take some action now. What that action is to be is not yet apparent. been unwilling to tell the public what they Government, at the end of three years of propose to do. That is neither fair to the men who grow the stock, nor to consumers. Such an attitude must have a detrimental effect upon the market. It is obvious that until the Government have declared their policy there must be created and continued an unusually uncertain position of affairs with regard to the meat trade. is made public the stock -market will be of the Imperial and Allied troops. .That paralyzed, or else it will be a gamble. not affected to-day at all. buyers are buying up stock with the certainty that the Government will stand behind them. there is an uncertainly in the public mind in regard to the whole subject. It is especially unreasonable, because a statement has been made by Mr Greene, speaking on behalf of the Government, to the effect that they have determined upon a line of policy. But the details of that policy, and the particulars of how it is to be applied, have been left unannounced. The public remain in the dark as to how the whole business is to be controlled. Seeing that the Government were not prepared to go further than just exactly as far as Mr Greene did go, it would have been better to have said nothing at all. If the full statement is to be made through Parliament, I trust that opportunity will be provided for a discussion upon it. Meanwhile, I am particularly concerned in pointing out what has actually tory results to the public of tliat State so far as the fixation of meat prices and the control of the business are concerned. Rightly or wrongly, the Queensland Labour Government have paid special attention to this matter. The honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) sought to show that the business had been a conspicuous failure; but it is fair to remember that residents of Queensland who are most closely affected are also the most likely to be aware of its advantages or disadvantages. After considerable experience, now, the people of Queensland have stated in no uncertain terms that they The Government so far have approve of the policy; and the Labour effort, so favourably impressed the publie with the virtue of their methods that they were returned at the last elections with an increased majority. The meat question was one of the vital issues on which they appealed to their constituents.

489,Mr Finlayson,"It is obvious thatment. It was very satisfactory to the"" Imperial autliorities, and a very useful contract to Queensland pastoralists. It is satisfactory also to every loyal Australian that it was possible to enter upon terms for sucb an important purpose and at such a special period. The price was, aud is, reasonable; and, in fact, so satisfactory was the contract to the parties on both sides of the world that the Labour Government, when they came into power in 1915, were quite content not to interrupt or interfere in the arrangement. Since then the Queensland authorities have had to consider not only overseas supplies, but local necessities. The Government proceeded on a very satisfactory principle, namely, that the people of a country are entitled to prime consideration in regard to the products of that territory. Queensland was stocked with plenty of cattle and sheep, and was able to supply not only its own requirements, but, having a huge surplus over and above its contract supplies, was able to furnish meat to the markets of the other States. The Labour Government were committed, under their policy announced to the electors in 1915, to reduce the cost of living. That, indeed, was the election cry. That policy they honorably and rather effectively carried out. In some directions, in matters over which they had no control, they were unable to bring down the cost of living. But, as to one item of very great importance, the Government did effect a very substantial reduction; it is one which is the envy of every other State. In carrying out the policy of providing Queensland Government made repeated cheap meat to the people the Government offers of supplies of meat to the southern found it necessary to commandeer supStates. The Premier of Queensland inplies of meat. sources of supply, they had to create an House that his Government, in anticipaartificial source. Much comment has tion of relieving the southern markets, by been made upon the fact that they imdespatching supplies of meat, had composed on the meat companies and pasmitted themselves to the purchase of certoralists a demand for a certain supply at tain quantities from the meat companies, a fixed price; but there has been no very and that, when the southern authorities serious complaint that that was an unrefused to accept at the price named by reasonable price, or that it entailed any Queensland, the northern State Governdegree of nnancial loss to the producers. ment found themselves in the awkward On the contrary, we have clear statepredicament ments that the price so fixed was highly with the meat companies to take back the satisfactory.

The Government, in carrying out their policy, imposed an embargo on the export of live cattle from Queensland to the other States. That policy was severely criticised as being anti-Federal, and, indeed, illegal under the Federal Constitution; and, after a good deal of difficulty, the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), under the War Precautions Regulations, insisted on the removal of the embargo. It was removed, and cattle were despatched without hindrance over the border. While the embargo lasted it was freely stated throughout Australia that the high prices of meat in the southern States were due to the embargo; that the Queensland Government,' pursuing a selfish policy, .had created an artificial scarcity in the southern States, as the result of which high prices had been brought about. Well, if that was so, it should be reasonable to expect that the high prices would have been reduced upon the removal of the embargo. .Instead of a reduction, however, the prices have continued to soar until they have reached their present high, unreasonable, and altogether unfair standard. The embargo neither had the effect at the time claimed against it of forcing up the price, nor has its removal resulted in a reduction. By some means or other, pastoralists found that they were able-em bargo or no embargo-to secure high prices in the southern States. During the period in question, the Having no original formed me yesterday afternoon in this of having to reduce the amounts, and of having to make terms The southern Australia, for example, it was due to its Abattoirs Act. This requires that all meat sold in Adelaide «hall pass through the abattoirs, and undergo Government inspection there. effort, and, I think, accepted one small supply; but political influences came into operation, and private interests began to play a very active part, with the result that Victoria turned a deaf ear to any business proposals from Queensland. However, tbe Queensland Government, in pursuance of their home policy, very largely extended their offers of local supplies. They opened a number of shops, and it is interesting to note that the first lot of meat offered in the first State butcher's shop was purchased at ^d. higher than the price being paid by the Imperial Government for the meat at that stage being shipped overseas. Since the opening of that first Government shop, which now is a most successful business, other establishments have been opened up in quite a number of towns throughout the State, and further extensions are in prospect. of them. these shops opened before the next State election. to be. all the arguments advanced by honourable members opposite is that the people of Queensland rejoice in the fact that they are able to buy such good meat at such reasonable prices. The honourable member for Oxley( Mr Bayley) should be the last to decry this State enterprise, since he is aware that in a town in his own electorate the Government were faced with the difficulty of having either to close down the State butcher's shop there or to expend a large sum in refitting it to meet the increased trade. closed it down because they lost the seat. rect. The honourable member knows as a matter of fact that the new representative of that district in the State Parliament ( Mr Barnes) introduced a deputation to the Minister, asking that the way. State butchery in the town in question should not be closed, although he had this as in most other matters the chief himself stated during the election campaign that he was absolutely opposed to the State butcheries. The position today is that the Government are still unVictoria made some decided as to whether the business in the town would warrant the expenditure of £5,000 or £6,000 in properly equipping the State butcher's shop with refrigerating appliances, or whether they should close down the business altogether. A second deputation of the residents has waited on the Minister, and has made certain offers, so that the Government shall not take from the district this particular source of meat supply. The Government of Queensland are besieged with applications for branches to be established in all parts of the State. In trying to meet the wishes of the people they have said that where they cannot at present open a State butcher's shop they are prepared to supply to approved butchers at a rate which will enable them to sell at the prices ruling in the State butcheries. This is one illustration of an honest and persevering attempt on the part of a Government to meet this particular difficulty. Thati t is a difficulty honourable members will freely admit. It should be a source of satisfaction to us to know that in one State at least the problem has been solved to the benefit of the people, and not to the detriment of -With the £19,000 off the industry. The argument is advanced that the State butchers' shops in Queensland show only a certain proportion of profit. My complaint in that regard is that they show any profit. In providing the necessaries of life it is just as bad in principle for the State to make a profit out of the people as it is for private firms to do so. One of the arguments we advance in support of Socialism through State operations is that all profits over and above working expenses should disappear. The making of huge profits in connection with such an undertaking is no proof of success, and the making of small profits does not show lack of success. On the contrary, Socialism in these directions, effectively carried on, would result not in huge profits but in reduced prices to the people, because profits are not required.",91,Loading Employment Of Non Unionist S Veneeea L Diseases Repatbiation Employment Of Re Turned Soldiers Amalgamatio N Of Banks Remission Of Penalties Incurred By Deceased Soldiebs

498,Mr Finlayson,"And they do. I nworking expenses are in respect of distribution. If we could solve tbe problem of the distribution of food products, we should cut away a very heavy proportion of the expenses attaching to their supply. for instance, to confine the delivery of bread to one or two firms operating withi n circumscribed localities, that commodity could be sold at from £d. to I d . per loaf below the prevailing rates.

508,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),"the sooner we realize this the better it will be for our country and the world at large."" I have already warned both the Eederal amd State Governments that if they attempt to ""squelch"" the trade unionists of Australia they will cause trouble. They sliould not, ostrich-like, bury their heads in the sand and refuse to take notice of this menace. A t the Recruiting Conference convened by the Governor General certain promises were made on behalf of the Government, and having regard to them. I propose to read letters written by the secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters-the members of which cannot be said to be Bolshevikito the Victorian Minister for Agriculture, as well as to the Acting Prime Minister and others. This union, has heen organized for generations, but, as a result of the late strike, it is not now recognized as such. The Flour and Grain Workers Union refused to allow its members to be employed as carpenters unless they engaged through their organization. Dealing with this subject, Mr John Dias, secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners of Australasia, on 28th May last wrote the following letter to Mr D. S. Oman, the Victorian Minister for Agriculture:Dear Sir -In continuation of my interview with you on the 27th January, and subsequent correspondence, in regard to the Flour and Grain Workers Union discriminating against members of the above organization, by forcing them to become members of the Flour and Gr ain Workers Union, we have, it seems, ( arrived at some finality in this matter. . I am therefore enclosing you copies of correspondence forwarded to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, and Mr Brittingham, of the Victorian Produce Company Limited. Trusting that you will use your good offices, and thanking you for past favours. To the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) he wrote as follows on the same date :SirI enclose you copies of correspondence wi.th the Victorian Produce Association, in order that you may exert your influence with the Victorian Produce Company to prevent members of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners from being forced to join the bogus union (i.e., Flour and Grain Workers Union) and to cease their membership with this society. I was given to understand, by the late Mr away. In this morning's issue of the Age Elmslie, who had the whole file of correspondence in his possession, that after the Conference convened by the Governor General all obstacles in connection with our members working on the wheat stacks were to be removed. Mr Mathews. This has not been done, and the position therefore is as acute as ever. Trusting that we will have your good offices in allaying this cause of friction. Then, again, he addressed the following letter to Mr Brittingham, secretary to the Victorian Produce Co-operation Limited: Dear SirI have to thank you for the courtesy which you extended to me on my last interview with you on the 23rd May, 1918, when you were kind enough to ask me to state my case for the above organization to Mr Beere, of the Wheat Department, and I am pleased to say that we, at last, seem to have got to the bottom of this much discussed matter, as Mr Beere informed me that men can only be employed by and through t i e Flour and Grain Workers Union on the wheat stacks. He also informs mo that the Victorian Produce Company have an agreement with the Four and Grain Workers. Union to do their work, and if a member ceases to belong to that organization he will be discharged from working on wheat stacks. Asi t has now become obvious that your Association is the agency for bolstering up this bogus union, to our detriment, inasmuch as the rules provide that a member cannot belong to a legitimate Trade Union Organization, we have to accept this decision. But at the same time we would point out that there was an understanding arrived at by a Conference convened by the Governor General, that all further attacks against legitimate „ unionism should cease, in order that all obstacles to recruiting be removed. I have been informed that Messrs. Waterman, Quincey, and Clark, foremen on the wheat stacks, are particularly insistent that members of our organization must join the Flour and Grain Workers Union, and remain members of the same, if they wish to be employed, and continue in their employment, on the wheat stacks. I am therefore forwarding copies of this letter to the Minister of Agriculture, Mr D. S. Oman, and the Acting Prime Minister of tbe Conunonwealth, Mr W. Watt, so that the matter may be brought under their notice. The Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners is an organization of undoubted integrity, that has done much to uplift the wage-earning section of the community. I have, read these letters with the object of showing the Committee what it was generally understood would be the outcome of the Conference called by the Governor General. It was believed that, as the result of that Conference, the disadvantages under which unionists were labouring would be wiped it is stated thatMr Watt said yesterday that the necessity for renewed efforts to bring home to the people the gravity of the present position was shown in the decrease in the latest recruiting figures. A few' weeks ago there appeared to be every promise of a great awakening to the peril that was threatening the democracy of Australia and the rest of the world, but after that patriotic burst Australia seemed to be in danger of going to sleep again. Already Australia had witnessed the saddening spectacle of Australian battalions, with glorious fighting records, being broken up The Acting Prime Minister has admitted that after the Conference which was called by the Governor General there was an increase in recruiting. That increase was due to the fact that the sons of unionists and the dependants of unionists understood that they were not to be victimized for what had occurred between 1916 and this year. Y e t here we find that genuine unionists are being victimized in favour of "" scab "" unionists. The Acting Prime Minister now admits that there is a slump in recruiting. the fact that youths of. eighteen years of age will not be enlisted ? There is another union, known as the Australian Ship Wharf Workers Union, and in the Age of 27th May last there appeared a letter from its secretary, in which he took exception to my description of that organization as a non-union union. members weTe working only about six and a half hours a day on the wharfs. remarks purely to the question of what was promised by the Government at the Recruiting Conference. what is known' as the Yarra Stevedoring Company. In reality it is not a company, but merely a committee formed by the employers for the purpose of engaging men to work their ships. members had been w it h me last summer in the building which is used for the purpose of picking up the men required for this work, they would have been surprised that such a place could exist. The atmosphere in it was horrible. The place itself was lousy. The derelicts of society were there looking for work. Men had to be taken out from it and disinfected* Y e t the clean unionists were obliged to go there and consort with these dirty creatures. Further, a genuine unionist had no chance of getting employment until the members speech ? of the bogus union had been exhausted. There is another bogus union, namely, the ister must accept my remarks in the Naval Employees Union, which is regisform in which I am putting them. We [213]2 tered under the Arbitration Act . It s members get a preference over members of the genuine organization, namely, the Ship Painters and Dockers Union. I admit that in the Commonwealth yards the unionists get a fair deal, but in the private yards they certainly do not. Y e t we are asked to sink our differences and to join our friends opposite in the recruiting campaign. Further, quite a number of private firms outside those I have mentioned are victimizing the unionists of Melbourne. In my own electorate there is the Dunlop Rubber Company, whicb has made profits to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds, solely because of the duties which have been levied upon rubber goods imported from other countries, with a view to fostering local industries. But for the beneficent legislation of this Parliament, that company could not have made a cent. Last year a strike occurred at this establishment. H a d not the employers looked for it there need have been no strike atall. In other I do not think so. words, they wanted the men to strike, because the latter were then appealing to the Arbitration Courtf o r better conditions and higher wages. What happened? Whilst there were hundreds of tons of rubber which could have been used before the necessity arose to use fresh maa time its terial, the company insisted that the men should work on the black rubber, which had been imported during the strike. I I am directing my say that the industrial disturbance at the Dunlop Company was fostered by the employers as part of the conspiracy which There is also existed at the time to break down unionism. To-day, whilst other rubber firms in Victoria are giving unionists a fair deal, this particular firm is employing only "" scab "" labour. Isi t any wonder that If honourable the twenty-odd old men who were working there when the general strike occurred, ceased work in sympathy with the strikers I Eight of those men are to-day cracking stones because the company refuses to reemploy them. It refuses to re-employ ithem because, in their old age, they would not "" scab "" on their fellows. In such circumstances, do the Government expect the sons and grandsons of these men to have any feeling for the Empire or the flag about which we prate so much ?",94,Loading Employment Of Non Unionist S Veneeea L Diseases Repatbiation Employment Of Re Turned Soldiers Amalgamatio N Of Banks Remission Of Penalties Incurred By Deceased Soldiebs

I have already admitted that the Department which the honourable gentleman controls has done a strike. It purfair thing to the unionists. But the Victorian Government and the private employees are not doing that. As the Commonwealth Government are all-powerful it is up to them to exert their power in the direction of compelling others to do what is just to the community. I might But it refuses to do so. I go on enumerating instances of this sort all night. I say candidly that I w i ll not assist recruiting again u n t i l a fair deal has been given to the men who sent me to this House. For more than two years I assisted recruiting. to the utmost of my powers.

But T say unhesitatingly that no man is justified in recruiting unti l the British Government have definitely stated what are their war aims. We should then know exactly where they are. But, apart from the Y e t I am question of our war aims, the fact remains that' a Recruiting Conference was recently held at Federal Government House, at which a certain understanding was arrived at. Nothing has since been done to f u l f i l the promise which was made to that gathering so far as the private employers and the Victorian Government are concerned. The Government have made no attempt to conform to the desire expressed by the Conference. Nobody can prophesy what will take place before this Parliament reassembles after the recess. But if those who are opposed to genuine unionism think that they can break down the unions of Australia by the methods they are adopting, they are making a mistake. Their efforts w ill recoil upon themselves individually and collectively, and must prove detrimental to the best interests of the Empire, about which we talk so much.

Until that fact is grasped we shall not secure that amity for which the Eecruiting Conference was called by the Governor General. I desire to say a few words concerning the treatment which has been meted out by the Government to Germans in Australia. In my opinion, which is based upon a great deal of evidence, the Ministry have discriminated between Australian-born Germans who hold political views in opposition to their own, and the wealthy Germans of this community.

If a man is deemed to be dangerous to the community or to any of our Allies he ought to be placed in such a position as to . render him innocuous to the community, but political influence in regard to this matter has made the whole thing a farce and a menace, to Australia. Last night I drew attention to a German firm who, although declared to be an enemy firm, were still carrying on operations, the Government apparently being indifferent so long as they can get a cut out of the proceeds of this robbery of the people of Australia, prices having been put up 400 or 500 per cent., with the assistance of Government officials and the blessing of the Minister for Trade and Customs. This is one of the most shameful outrages that has ever been perpetrated upon the people of this country.

I do not wish fco say anything further now, except that this Government will be' known for their action in depriving Australian citizens of the franchise. Many thousands of re-, putable Australian citizens, born of German parents, are now denied the f i g h t to say who shall be elected to the National Legislature to frame the laws under which they are compelled to live. Government have adopted this most contemptible attitude for purely political reasons, but I remind them they are on very dangerous ground indeed. might as well go further, and issue regulations prohibiting every man holding political opinions different from theirs from having a vote at all. The position would then be simplified, for I believe this was the main reasdn actuating the Government in issuing the regulation disfranchising so many Australian-born citizens. a.m.] I am sorry the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Jensen) is not present, because this afternoon, when I was referring to the Vacuum Oil Company, he interrupted, and stated that, owing to the ruling freights, it was essential that the company should be allowed to increase prices. I think many honourable members would be .only too pleased if they could get into a concern with a financial history so attractive as that of the Vacuum Oil Company. In the Melbourne Age of 7th February, 1918, Mr Henry director of the company, was reported as having given evidence before the sittings of the Inter-State Commission. He said I may say, for that, in 1912, 1913, and 1914, the paidup capital of the company was £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0; in 1915 and 1916, it was £800,000; and in 1917, it was £1,600,000. He added that from 50 to 60 per cent, of the shareholders were British, and the rest were The n I shall have Americans, so that there were no Australian shareholders in the company at all. Mr Commissioner Swinburne read extracts from Moody's Directory w i th the object of showing that there was some connection between the Vacuum and Whether political in Standard Oil Companies, but this was denied by Mr Cornforth, and when asked about the turnover, tlie witness said that, from .1913 to 1917, it had increased by 9 per cent, in volume, and 81 per cent, in value, also that, during the past three years, 6*6 per cent, of the trade in kerosene, and 38 per cent, of trade in benzine, in Australia, had been done by them. Mr Hugh Hamilton, a director of the company, in his evidence, said that the price of kerosene before the war broke oufc, was 7s. 2d. per case, and benzine 13s. 4d. per case, and, in January, 1918, the price of kerosene was 13s. 6d. per case, while benzine was 23s. 8d. A t The a later stage in the examination, Mr. Hamilton said he thought 12£ per cent, profit on the turnover was fair and reasonable, and Mr Cornforth, when reThey examined, saidTwo-thirds of the total turnover of the company was in Australia. For the half year ending 30th November, 1912, the percentage of profit on turnover was 17.69 per. cent., and outside Australia for the same period it was 23.86 por cent. The respective figures in subsequent years were-1913 , 12.8 and 14.15; 1914, 12.87 and 13.11; 1915, 17.33 and 18.53; 1916, 20.03 and 20.48; and in 101.7 (six months ended 31st May), 8.51 and 8.59. He did not think the profit in a year would be equal todouble thc capital employed in the business. Commissioner Swinburne -It looks more like three times the amount. VVitness said that for the year just closed there was a difference of £30,000 between the turnover and the actual capital used in the ' business. Commissioner Mills -Virtually the capital has been turned over once. Commissioner Swinburne -On e and a half times, is it not? The Chairman -I s there a Vacuum Oil Company, apart from the several Vaccum Oil companies such as this one? Is there a parent company, or any group of subsidiarj' companies under one management?

Mr Wallace (West Sydney) [3.41,"Is it really a fact that the Vacuum Oil Company of Rochester has a number of subsidiary companies doing business in various parts of the world on the same lines as your company in Australia. I don't know. Witness, in reply to Commissioner Swinburne, said he did not think their profit on turnover was greater than that of any average business in Australia. All tliis goes to show that the company, by heavy increases in prices, were amply compensated for any extra outlay in the conduct of their business, yet, in spite of this, the Government allowed a further increase in the prices of _ these essential commodities. The increase in the price of oil may be unavoidable, because we are under the heel of the Vacuum Oil Company, but the Government should use every endeavour to make Australia independent of it. A million pounds, or even £2,000,000, would be well spent in providing us with a supply of oil. Were Ministers to take the advice of the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Finlayson), and follow the example of the Byan Government, by establishing socialistic ventures, the community would benefit. Under the "" come day, go day, God send Sunday"" methods that are ""being followed, we shall find ourselves at the end of this war where we were at the beginning, and the result of allowing the exploiter to continue his operations will be another cataclysm. It must be generally admitted that the cause of the war was the struggle of the commercial classes for possession of this world's goods, and a place in the sun. An old lecturer, to whom I have often listened, used to say that one should not mix charcoal, saltpetre, and sulphur and pray to God to make a plum pudding of it, because God had decided that the result should be gunpowder, and that, similarly, it was useless to mix competition, private property, and production for profit, and pray for a sound social system. Government honestly desires to grapple with social problems, and to make the world better, it will follow the example of the Queensland Government, which is benefiting the working and the producing classes alike, thus establishing good feeling in the community. The newspapers are blaming the Labour movement for its undoubted coolness towards the war. Some honourable members opposite claim to have been associated with the Labour movement and to understand its ideals and aspirations,"" but it seems to me that there is a screw loose somewhere. screws loose if the honourable member's plans were put into operation. munity has not objected to Socialism when it could get cheap wire netting from the State. In Queensland it has got thousands of miles of wire netting for nothing. in New South Wales for nothing, and few of our settlers can now get any at all. New South Wales have received a great deal of assistance from Labour Governments. The lot of the man on the land has been better under the Labour regime than under the old Liberal rule. been conferred by Labour Administrations, but in the course of a few years they have put an immense debt upon the land. strike, those on the land were having a bad time. Then came the strike, and a Uttle later the bank smashes. It was only after Labour had got going, and the banks were able to give back the money that had been locked up, that the settlers began to prosper; but since that time they have never looked back. The Government gives to the farmers all the assistance that it is possible to give under our obsolete conditions ofland settlement. It is impossible, because of the way in which settlement is scattered, to provide all the facilities necessary for bringing the produce to market. Under a sane land system we would not have one farmer 200 miles from the city, and another 300 miles, with the intervening country held by some big squatter or financial institution. At'one time a square mile could be If the bought for 5s., and thousands of acres were secured in this way, making a wise settlement of the country impossible. The only legitimate way to bring back the land to the people would be to adopt some such method as that suggested by i Brother Grant, or to confiscate it, and let it revert to the Crown. The workers have not had a fair deal during the war. At the beginning, they, like the rest of the community, took up arms in defence of the country. They were led to believe that it was a defensive war, a war to end war, and a war to",99,Loading Employment Of Non Unionist S Veneeea L Diseases Repatbiation Employment Of Re Turned Soldiers Amalgamatio N Of Banks Remission Of Penalties Incurred By Deceased Soldiebs

542,Mr Wallace,"Before the 1890uphold the rights of small nations. When, after twelve or eighteen months of fighting, it was thought that we were on top, certain statesmen made long orations advocating an economic war on Germany, and the seizure of territory. titled to a quorum. [Quorum formed.] little about problems of foreign policy, but when he began to hear the annexation , of territory and the extension of national boundaries proposed, he began to wonder what the war was about. While he has been giving his best for the prosecution of the war, his rights and privileges have been filched from him. This, of course, he resents, and it has therefore come about that to-day there is a pronounced anti-war feeling among the working class of Australia and of the world. It does not follow that the workers are willing to give up the game altogether, now that we are in it, but the stop-the-war influences can be as easily underrated as overrated. If it be wished to rouse the workers to greater effort, and to stimulate the feeling that was excited by the outbreak of the war, the conditions which obtained when the war commenced must be restored. It may be asked, What about the boys in the trenches? Now, those boys, when they left this country to fight for our rights, and to protect us from German aggression, did so on the understanding that certain obligations would be fulfilled. Those who were left behind look upon themselves as responsible for seeing that those obligations are fulfilled. When they saw that the conditions of the workers were being altered, they found themselves on the horns of a dilemma. If they allowed industrial conditions to be altered, they would be traitors to their mates. They had to decide between disloyalty to their country and disloyalty to their mates; and of two evils, they chose the lesser, preferring to be called disloyal to their country than disloyal to their mates. ber hear what the honourable member for member for Ballarat will bear out what I am saying. His position is the same as mine in this matter. You say that it is necessary to conduct this war to a successful conclusion. having entered into the war, it must be concluded in a manner satisfactory to all parties interested. finish. to say that we must gain a victory over Germany, but a decisive victory does not seem at all likely. General Smuts, who is a good patriot, and has done his best for the Empire, told the ship-yard employees recently that it was time that we dropped the idea of smashing Germany, and began to recognise that we could not do so. His views and ours exactly coincide. The Australian Workers Union has over 40,000 members at the Front; of the union to which I belong, between 3,000 and 4,000 members are now in the trenches, and most of the remaining 50 per cent, are engaged on war serviees. It is the same with every other organization. We have agreed to a repatriation scheme for improving the lot of the returned soldier; but many men when they come back will wish to resume their former occupations, and to return to the union which protected their interests in times of peace. While I do not say that the Government are deliberately trying to smash the unions, they are not in any way endeavouring to restore their status, as they promised to do. Until that is done, the workers are quite right in looking toward the finale of this war with no great anticipation. mates who are fighting for you ? that obtained in Australia before they went away should be restored before they return. It is within the power of the Government to restore and improve those conditions, and it will be the wiser course. It was. the attitude of an Australian Government which first precipitated the crisis during which those conditions were taken away from the workingmen; and it is up to the National Government of the Commonwealth to see that the original status is restored. Then there will be no reason to question the loyalty of the workers. The workers cannot be appealed to by any one telling them that this is a just war.

553,Mr Wallace,"Yes; the conditionswith the Labour movement knows that no war is just. say so. as we do here. A certain section of the labour community in America has adopted the same attitude as Labour here. Mr Samuel Gompers, President of the American Federation of Labour, has already announced that profiteering is going on in the United States, and he has addressed protests to the Government in that respect. The TEMPORARY ( Mr Atkinson) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. [3.52 a.m.] -The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Wallace) was rather unfortunate in quoting General Smuts. I do not know whence he obtained his quotation, but, during the debate, I happened to be reading a speech of General Smutsi n regard to the war, and I shall quote certain of his remarks: I verily believe that we are within reach of priceless and immeasurable good, not only for this TJnited Kingdom and group of nations to which we belong, but also to the whole world. But, of course, it will depend largely upon us whether the great prize is achieved now in this struggle, or whether the world will be doomed to long, weary waiting in the future. The prize is within our grasp, if we have strength, especially the strength of soul, which I hope we shall have, to see this thing through without getting tired of waiting, until victory crowns the efforts of our brave men in the field. ment made? 15th May of last year. I wish now to refer briefly to some of the remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney as to Labour's position in this war. I deny that the gentlemen who meet in the TradesH a l l , in Sydney, under the name of the Sydney Labour Council, and who pass resolutions against recruiting, represent the opinions of the working class of Australia at a l l. fche working class now. for them in greater measure, and in greater numbers, than do those who say that the working class is oppOsed to the Empire's position in the war, and te Australia's activities concerning the conflict. From the beginning of the conflict there has been within fche ranks of fche Labour party of Australia a section which, to-day again, has expressed itself in opposition to the war. The very first The y say the same war article printed in the Worker newspaper, in Sydney, was a protest against the first 20,000 men being sent from the Commonwealth to stand shoulder to shoulder with men of other parts of the Empire. That article opposed recruiting in any shape or form, but ifc no more represented the views of the workers than does that attitude represent them to-day. It represents the views of those and of those who have left no stone unturned to weaken the Commonwealth and the Empirei n the prosecution of the war. I regret that some of those who have asserted themselves in this way should ever have seen f it to take such a course. tion in New South Wales now? sence of certain honourable members from this chamber during the past fortnight is sufficiently eloquent as to the position in New South Wales. The attitude which some members of the Labour party as it exists to-day adopt with regard to such questions as the future of the Pacific, and, indeed, their general outlook upon the war, indicates a complete failure yet to realize what the war means and may mean to this country. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr. Wallace) speaks of the difficulties and troubles of the working class in Australia. On fche Unfortunately, many things have occurred which should never have happened. There was the stoppage of the transport of supplies to the troops, for example. There have been things which have not occurred in any other country, and which have not had the approval of organized Labour here. there have been no strikes in Great Britain? I speak have been no strikes that have prevented hospital ships from being despatched to fhe soldiers. I appeal to that section of the Labour movement which is inclined, if not yet determined, to oppose proposals which w ill make for the security of the Commonwealth in relation to the problems",101,Loading Employment Of Non Unionist S Veneeea L Diseases Repatbiation Employment Of Re Turned Soldiers Amalgamatio N Of Banks Remission Of Penalties Incurred By Deceased Soldiebs

564,Mr Hector Lamond,"Ther eof the Pacific. It has been said that the future diplomacy of the world will centre around the Pacific, and I cordially endorse that. So long ago as the time when, with foresight little appreciated, the then Premier of Queensland annexed New Guinea, I was impressed with the importance of the islands surrounding this Continent in regard to our future. Every year that has passed since, and every development in the Pacific, has emphasized to any thoughtful man that the Commonwealth is not and cannot be safe so long as those islands may be made the bases for aggression against this country. The war will afford au opportunity of righting the wrong which the British authorities did to AusLamond), who took exception to certain tralia at that time, and should secure to us more fully the advantages which the democratic institutions of this land have won for its people. I seriously appeal to those who are being misled with the suggestion that this Thomas McHwraith was not approved in is merely an attempt to grasp territory. I hailed with delight the declaration of the Prime Minister of thc Commonwealth ( Mr Hughes) of a Monroe doctrine for the Pacific. If that can be achieved as a result of this struggle I shall not regret it, even though some of my nearest and dearest friends have fallen; for they will not have made their sacrifice in vain if it will have brought security to the Commonwealth. the Monroe doctrine? Isi t to bo Australia alone? think it necessary to say that a Monroe doctrine for the Pacific does not mean that one nation alone is to stand behind it. NQ doubt, one purpose of Mr Hughes in announcing that doctrine in America was to enlist the sympathy of the United States with Australia's view-point. I hope that the statesmen assembled to take part in the Imperial Conference will see their way to framing such, conditions of peace as s'hall confer npon Australia that sense of security which a re-adjustment of the Pacific problem alone can confer. -I s no other honourable member upon the Government side prepared to say a few words? I am surprised that the promise which was given to this side of the House that full opportunity would be afforded to discuss the financial measures of the Government has not been fulfilled. This seems to be a Ministry of broken promises. Evidently there are other methods of applying the gag besides the closure resolutions within the Standing Orders. There is that method being pursued by the Government at present, of inflicting upon honourable members opposed to the Government the responsibility of carrying on debate in a state of mental exhaustion. How can honourable members at this hour apply their minds to the discussion of the problems which have arisen out of the circumstances in which we find ourselves? I desire to refer to some remarks by the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr utterances of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Wallace) in his expression of the position of the colonies in the Pacific. The honourable member for Ilia-' warra regrets that the action taken by Sir its entirety by the British Government. The honourable member surely has not looked at the map of Australia. Apparently, he is not seized with the realization of what puny results have accrued from the efforts to people this great continent. Are"" we entitled to take over all the islands of the Pacific for the purpose of their development ? And if we are going to take them over, what is to be our attitude towards the native inhabitants? How are we treating the natives in New Guinea at present? True, we are doing better in that respect, I suppose, than has been the experience bf natives in any part of the world. That improved attitude towards the benighted heathen is due to the presence of a Labour party in the Commonwealth. I have not known the Conservatives, or the so-called Liberals, to adopt towards the natives that Christian attitude which should be observed if we are truly our brother's keepers. I remember reading some time ago a book by Sir HarryH . Johnston on the negro races. He spent a great deal of time, and applied a very critical mind, to ascertaining what had been the treatment of the negroid races by the various nations. There was very little to choose between them wherever they were in control of coloured peoples-whethe r the rulers were Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, German, or British. Capitalists cannot be let loose uncontrolled among the coloured peoples of the world",102,Chairman Who Do Nofc Wish The Empire To Succeed

567,Mr Higgs (Capricornia) [4.2 A.m.].,"-in New Guinea, for example-and the natives continue to be well treated. The Labour programme is not in operation in British or German New Guinea. I take the greatest exception to the idea set forth by the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Lamond), that we should keep German New Guinea and take over the islands of the Pacific in the interests of this country. The further we get away from the coast line of Australia the more difficult it will be for us to defend Ausquestion for his work in unloading the tralia, and the more expensivewill be our military and naval systems. What advantage was it to Germany to hold German New Guinea? arose from Germany's ambition to take Australia. merely in the imagination of the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce). How absurd it is ! Germany will have more than she can deal with for a long time to come in Europe. The Minister for Defence said the other .day that Germany's main objectin the war was to get Australia. Of what advantage was the possession of German New Guinea to Germany before the war, seeing that the moment the war broke out her colonies fell away from her almost automatically, because she could not defend them ? And when it is said that the German Navy might lie up in one of the harbours of New Guinea, I want to know what the Germans would be doing with their Navy there? In the early days of Federation, when we had far more money to spend on idealistic enterprises than we shall have in the future, we thought of settling the Northern Territory. The Argus newspaper, which I am unfortunately compelled to read every morning in order to learn the views of the other side, urged that we could not hope to hold Australia unless we develop that Territory, and that Ave must spend money upon it. We have done so. Ever since we took the Territory over we have had in connection with it a growing deficit. What a bargain the Assistant Minister for the Navy( Mr Poynton) succeeded in making for South Australia with the Commonwealth! No wonder he received a presentation from his admirers. presentation in connection with the taking over of the Territory. seeing an inkstand that was presented to the honourable member. vices in connection with the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. expensive work that the honourable member succeeded in having carried out. I thought he received the testimonial in Northern Territory on the Commonwealth. Whilst that Territory was under the control of South Australia, the deficit in respect of it amounted to £150,000 a year. Since then it has been growing, until in 1916-17 we showed a deficit of £702,000 in respect of it. ber think it cannot be properly developed? It is the back door of Australia. as many a man is compelled to treat an area of three or four acres within easy distance of Melbourne on which he has built his home. He has a flower garden in front, and at the back he may have a small lawn, but he allows the hinterland, so to speak, to be undeveloped. And so until we have done a great deal more in the way of developing the south-eastern and south-western portions of this country, we must leave the Northern Territory practically undeveloped. member's party was in power with a big majority, it attempted nothing in the direction of developing the Territory. When Senator Thomas was Minister for Home and Territories we established a number of experimental farms on the Daly Eiver, but there was no market for the produce, and they were a failure. If we are prepared to have a deficit of £702,000 a year in connection with our* administration of the Northern Territory, it would be far better to build a railway through it. Such a sum would pay interest on about £14,000,000, with which we could build the line. Our financial obligations, however, will be so large very shortly that we shall be unable to permit of such a deficit. Honourable",103,Chairman Who Do Nofc Wish The Empire To Succeed

Did the British Government reply to the note sent by the many."" reply. to say as to the nrsition of Russia. The Pope wrote in favour of peace; and in my opinion the Anglican Church, to which I belong, has made a great mistake in failing to speak in favour of peace. Some of its clergy have done so, but the main body has not. pacifists at Home has prolonged the war. occasions ought to remember that they are the followers of the Prince of Peace, and should talk peace, regardless of the extent to which the people may indulge in fighting. According to a German military maxim, -when an invader is driven back he is beaten; and when the Germans were turned back from the Marne, it was then that the Allies should have discussed peace with them. The hon -able member for Calare( Mr Pigott) says that the pacifists in England have led to the prolongation of the war. My answer is that the speeches of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) have helped to prolong it. He said that we were to crush Germany, to bring her to her knees, and to boycott her for all time. The Prussian jingoes carried these speeches to the pacifists and said, "" This is what Mr Hughes, who is proclaimed by Mr Lloyd George to be a flame-bearer and Empire saver, has to say, as to our fate."" The result was that the Germans continued to fight to the uttermost. They acted on the defensive, and.were thus able to make a stand with a limited number of men, whilst the forces taking the offensive against them had to be numerically very much stronger. They continued on the defensive for some time.

Until they are prepared to tackle the high cost of living, I intend to seize every available opportunity to attack them. To-day responsible Government is a thing of the past. When Parliament gets into recess the Commonwealth will be governed merely by the dictum of two or three men who will sit in Cabinet and decide to issue ferred upon them by the War Precautions Act.

The Minister controlling Price Fixing( Mr situation. Greene), who has not yet been able to deal with meat, seems to be sometimes a little worried over the duties cast upon him, and I feel sure that if he were in Russia to-day he would have a great deal of sympathy for the Bolsheviki. If in his younger days he had read Stepniak's Underground Russia and Tolstoy's writings, he would have learned that so great have been the sufferings of the masses in Russia that revolution was inevitable. In view of this known condition of things in Russia, one can the more readily believe the statement that the Czar and those about him allowed Russia to enter this war because of the strikes that were threatened and were taking place in Petrograd in July, 1914, as the result of the growing social unrest in that country. apply to Germany too? degree than in Russia. ence between the two countries. the other day I came across some extracts which I had made from newspapers twenty-five years ago pointing out that the food adulteration laws in Germany were then stricter than in any other part of the world, and that effective labour protection laws had been enacted. Honourable members will perhaps remember that Bismarck, by the adoption of principles advocated hy Ferdinand Lassalle, initiated a programme which cut the ground to a great extent from under the feet of the Socialists, so that there has always been a considerable difference between Russia and Germany. According to the last Statesman's Yeaik-Booh, seventy out of every one hundred people in Russia are unable to read, whereas in Germany it was said that, prior to the war, more Shakespearean plays were being produced what I have to say on the subject of the than in any other part of the world. policy for the Government -[Quorum We know quite well that her educational formed.']-In Victoria as much as £2S system is most complete, and that it has per acre is being paid for land on which been responsible for her remarkable proreturned soldiers are to be settled. gress. of Commons Committee that went over to £2 per acre.

637,Mr Poynton,"Land might beis speaking of land in the settled districts. took it up 5 per cent, on his investment. Some of the land of which I speak is not cleared, and may cost £5 an acre to clear. We are going to spend, perhaps, millions in buying land for soldier settlers, many of whom will have had no knowledge of agricultural pursuits. Unless the Government provides for the distribution of the produce of these settlers, their lot will he a very unhappy one. What is the cause of the «xodus from country districts to the town? It is that, as a rule, the' man on the land has an extremely hard time. What recommends the country life is the freedom that it gives. Many, however, cannot resist the temptation of the city's bustle and excitement. the opportunities for education draw people to the cities. We are all moved more or less by the same motives, and the great desire ef the modern parent is to give his children th» best possible education. Farmers live ofttimes remote from schools and churches, and naturally, if they see the chance, are glad to get to the cities to educate their families. Now, the Cemmonwealth has the right to impose land taxation. member tax men off the land? in Queensland under Labour rule. Very few farmers there pay much in land tax. I consider that those who have been brought up in the country are privileged. City life is not healthy for many young persons. It is the country districts which, several months before the facts were made to a large extent, replenish the supply of brains to the city. Those in the country breathe pure air; they have to work hard, and they are exempt from the temptations f the city. I have the happiest recollecthat he gave what details he had to the tions of the decade that I passed at Orange, when between the ages of ten and twenty. We should apply our power to tax to compel those who own unused land along the railway lines to put it into use. If it is agricultural land they should be required to cultivate it, and if pastoral land, to put stock on it. We should exercise pressure by increasing the taxation on unused land. Travelling by train from Melbourne to Rockhampton one passes through millions of acres that are uncultivated, and on which there is not a hoof. The land is being held until seme one will offer the person who originally The public debt of the country is growing, but before we can establish a large and prosperous farming class in the country, we must provide railways and good roads, and thus encourage production. I think, too, that we should continue our shipping enterprise. Some honourable members opposite believe in a State line of steamers, but the large capitalists supporting the Government, and the directors of the private shipping companies, will not continue their support of the Win-the-war party if it proposes to keep the Commonwealth steamers running after the war. We must see, however, that the farmers who wish to send produce to London and More than anything else elsewhere can get the necessary refrigerated space without having to apply for if to some monopolist. Unless we adopt some comprehensive scheme for encouraging rural industry, the millions that we are to spend on repatriation will be wasted. Were the Postmaster-General present, I would draw attention to the need for proper motor vehicles for the transport of produce and the reduction of expenses. I desire now to draw attention to what honourable was a great mistake on the part of Those responsible. I believe it was the Minister for Defence who was really to blame for the suppression of the news concerning the torpedoing of two ships of the Commonwealth fleet. I refer to the Australdale and the Australbush. It is said that the news was known in Melbourne public. The Minister for Defence was informed of the circumstances by the manager of the Commonwealth line of steamers, and Senator Pearce has stated Acting Minister for the Navy, and that it was for Mr Poynton to make the news public when and as he thought fit. What was the reason for the suppression of t h e information ? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Atkinson) -Order! The honerable member's time has expired.

641,Mr Brennan (Batman) [5.32 A.m.].,"uncompleted matter which I was quoting, namely, a memorandum by representative Italian citizens, and prepared and endorsed by a legal authority of reputation in It a l y with respect to the position of the It a l i a n Consul here. The document proceeds:There seems no doubt, and no denial oi the Federal authority can destroy the fact, that telegrams and private letters of Italians were, and are, handed to Consul Eles. Telegrams of one Italian citizen iu Australia were loudly read in the private room of Consul Eles at the Consulate, on the 22nd of April-so loudly, indeed, that some Italians waiting in the next room to be admitted to his presence heard all the contents. Private correspondence of Italians is under censorship of the Consul Directly or indirectly, it is the same thing, because some of such letters are handed to and read by some person who is very intimately connected with the Consul. From his arrival in Australia, Consul Eles created a marked division between the Italian residents with enmities that never before existed among them. He offends the poorest and least-informed Italians, and intrudes unduly in their private business. This call to arms is intended for all Italians in Australia as a uniform body under tbe control of an unique administrative authority, namely, the Consul at Melbourne. All the other representatives in the various State capitals are only honorary consular agents. That ""the call is intended for all the Italians resident in Australia, with no distinction between tlie various States, is proved by the Consul's manifesto itself. Consequently, in a matter concerning in the same degree all the subjects within his province, the Consul of Italy should adopt a uniform application of principle with no regard to local divisions. The consequences of purely local action are very evident. Operations of the Consulate for the call started about the 20th January, so that up to date there are a. little more than four months' work to deal with the Italian residents in Victoria, South Australia, and Broken Hill, with a total of 750 men, of whom some 200 have sailed. Now, as in New South Wales there are, perhaps, 600 Italians; in Queensland, 1,700; and, in Western Australia, 2,000, twelve or fourteen months will be necessary to finish it. And, should the war, as we hope, be over in these twelve to fourteen months, what object can there be in this objectionable proceeding ? The' Federal authorities should order Consul Eles to finish the medical examination and the enrolment of all eligibles in Australia before Bending any other contingent abroad, and afterward to follow tbe rules of justice, law, and equity, which are properly applicable to every people, including the people of Italy. That concludes the manifesto, which is temperately worded, and yet is strongly reasoned, on the pant of men, who, with their knowledge of Italian law, and of what has taken place among their, fellowcounhymen, have delivered this strong in dictment. Their accusations are levelled against a gentleman who-the y feel-n o longer f a i r l y represents them here, and i a regard to whom they desire to make representations to their own Government. However, the Commonwealth Government are shielding and protecting the official in question from the criticism of his own countrymen. I now come to a matter which is of profound interest in connection with the war. I desire to bring forward certain facts, because, although the war is raging apparently at its very zenith, we do not know the day on which it may come to an end. When that does occur we should have the minds of the people in formed of most of the facts which are material in appraising the causes of the war. We require to illuminate the intelligence of our people with those wise counsels of ""forbearance and good sense which may enable them to grasp the fir3t opportunity of entering into negotiations for peace, thus facilitating the end of this colossal tragedy. I speak, as I have often spoken, with a confident belief that nothing makes more strongly for perpetual peace than the clear and courageous examination of our own acts and. motives. I refer to the growth of materialism and militarism in the minds of the public. I believe that the curse of militarism,, developing wifch special rapidity in the Prussian mind, has grown also in a marked degree in the minds of a section of the British people. I draw no great fundamental dictinction between fche junkers of Prussia and the junkers of any other country, including our own. It is a curious thing fchafc for many years after Waterloo there was no strong I m perialistic or militaristic feeling in Great Britain. J. Bruce Glasier, an Englishman deeply attached to his own country, writesLord Beaconsfield, speaking at Manchester in .1872, referred to foreign affairs in apologetic terms. "" The very phrase ' foreign affairs,' "" he said, "" makes an Englishman convinced that I am about to treat of subjects in which he has no concern,"" and he went on to excuse hi* dealing with those questions on the ground that upon them depended "" the increase or reduction of taxation, the encouragement or embarrassment of industry."" Mr Gladstone was almost as frigid towards military sentiment as was Quaker John Bright, and profoundly distrusted foreign politics. Speaking at West Calder 41879), he said: ""Porieles, the grout Athenian statesman, said, with regard to women, their greatest merit was never to be heard of. Now, what Pericles untruly said of women, I am very much disposed to say of foreign affairs-thei r greatest merit would bo never to be heard of."" Mr Chamberlain, in his Radical Programme of 1885, makes no allusion whatever to Imperial affairs, or to the Army or Navy; and so late as 1891, the Liberal party, in its famous Newcastle programme, consisting of twenty-four planks, has not a single reference to military or Imperial policy. Military questions had, in fact, ceased, as Buckle said, to interest the British public. Crimean War aroused patriotic feeling, chiefly as a great spectacular event, while the Afghan, Abyssinian, Gold Coast, Zulu, and Egyptian campaigns were looked upon as little more than glorified police affrays. But a change was looming on the horizon. The closing years of the nineteenth century saw the commercial classes beginning to raise their eyes with strange thoughts across the seas. Foreign countries, notably America and Germany, had, in the course of a generation, leapt forward as keen industrial rivals to Great Britain in the world's markets, and the pinch of competition had begun to tell on the profits and temper of British capitalists. In a dull way it was dawning on them that Britain's commercial supremacy was not, perhaps, after all, divinely appointed; and that if Britain wished to hold the first, or even the second or third place, she would have to work hard, and, perhaps, fight hard for it. They bethought them of we can only understand the real character of the colonies-of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa-no w grown into full nationhood and virtual independence, and thc hope flashed upon them of forming an allBritish combination against foreign competition for the profits of the world's market. And lo, suddenly thc star of the new British Imperialism burst into the sky, and with it its dark companion, the new British Militarism."" Here was the opportunity for men of fleshly instincts and fatal and facile capacity for idealizing the attributes of physical strength and spurious courage. Here was an open door for men of third class moral calibre like Rudyard Kipling, of whom Mr Glasier says he "" found himself magically transported into the blaze of London fame, and laurelled as the authentic singer of Britain's new Imperial day."" Theni t was that Mr Cecil Rhodes, flattering the imagination of the junkers and vaulting Imperialists of our own country, to quote Mr Glasier again"" Miraculously emerged from his diamond booth' in South Africa as the new man of destiny, plotting out the Empire at one end of the world in telepathic accord with Mr Joseph Chamberlain, of the British Colonial Office, at the other. The fates awoke and rubbed their eyes. History, opening a fresh scroll, headed her newchapters : "" The Cape to Cairo Bailway, The Jarnieson Raid on the Transvaal, Mr Brennan. and tlie British War against the South African Republics."" Mr Glasier's opinion of that war may well stand comparison with that of Professor Cramb, an "" educated"" ImperialistOf that wara war in which Great Britain treated as "" a scrap of paper "" her conventions with the Boer Government, wrested from them their independence, introduced Chinese slave labour under the newly-hoisted British flag, and brought the anger of every self-governing The nation in the world against our country, all in the interests of predatory capitalism-of that war of pure aggression, the late Professor Cramb, an enthusiastic apostle of militarism and Imperialism, says:"" It wa& the first event or series of events upon a great scale, the genius of which lies in this force named Imperialism. It is the first conspicuous expression of this ideal in the world of action-of heroic action which always implies heroic suffering. No other war in our history is in its origin and aims so evidently the realization, so exclusively the result, of this Imperial ideal. . . . It is a war between two ideals, between the two principles that strike deep into thc life history of modern States."" Such, then, was the "" first event,"" the "" first conspicuous expression"" of the new Imperialist ideal and its twin brother, the new militarism, in action. If, as a famous thinker tells us, movements by ascertaining their origin, by their origin let the new Imperialism and the new militarism be judged Mr Glasier rubs it in Flagrantly as Christian nations have set at naught the pacifist obligations of their creed, Christian teachers have hitherto generally acknowledged that war is accursed, and that peace and goodwill are blessed of God. It was evident also that, with the growing enlightenment of the people, and the spread of Democracy and social enthusiasm in recent times, the feeling of repugnance to war and brutal conflict of all kinds was taking a deep hold on the nation. It was clearly impossible to fasten the yoke of militarism on the nation, so long as the people were "" steeped in the superstition and maudlinn sentimentality of peace."" It was necessary to overthrow the' "" base ideals"" of peace, and exalt the "" greatness "" and "" glory "" of war. And so it came to pass. One after another of war apologists arose in quick successionprofessors, preachers, and politicians, who boldly challenged the old-fashioned ideas that "" might is not right,"" that "" force is no remedy,"" that ""war is inhuman, and ought to be abolished."" Darwinism, and the Old Testament were both appealed to, and seience and religion were mutually reconciled on this question, at least. In this pamphlet we have also the statement thatIt is to an English, not a German, writer that we owe the first explicit enunciation in modern form of the doctrine that militarism is the noblest expression of human energy, and that war is the highest means of social progress. The Philosophy of War, by James Ham, was published in 1877.. while as yet Treitschke was as, unknown in Germany as he was in England before the outbreak of the present war, and more than thirty vears in advance of Bernardi's Germany and. tlie Next War. . . . "" As for conscription,"" he says, "" if England cannot command voluntary soldiers enough to defend her homes and maintain her Empire, the sooner we give up the role of a powerful nation the better. A nation that cannot find voluntary soldiers of her own stock deserves to be conquered by any other who can."" Mr Norman Angelli n The GreatIllusion and MrJ . A . Hobson in his Imperialism: A Study pilloried a number of utterances by recent English and American apologists for war, in which slaughter and conquest are extolled as the supremest manifestation of the spiritual and material energy of mankind. To quote again from Professor CrambIn war and the right of war man has a possession which he values above religion, above industry, and above social comfort; in war man values the power which it affords to life of rising above Ufe, the power which the spirit of man possesses to pursue the ideal. Amongst the Powers and States of the Continent and of t h e world that (the strife from a high to an even higher reality) seems Germany's part at the present hour. And here let me say with regard to Germany that of all England's enemies she is by far tlie greatest, and by ""greatness"" I mean not merely magnitude, not her millions of soldiers, her millions of inhabitants, I mean her grandeur of soul. She is the greatest and most heroic enemy-if she is our enemy-that England in the thousand years of her history has ever confronted. member endorse that statement? view of which he, as a militarist, speaks, absolutely; from my point of view, as an anti-militarist, absolutely no. Huxley and Darwin, as a cultured friend reminded me a day or two ago, would turn in their graves if they found their views on ethics and evolution quoted with approval by the vain materialists and narrow militarists of our day. The point I am making is that the junkers have no reason to complain whether they be in our country or in any other. I and those who think with me have every reason to complain that men of the type of a Cramb, or, worse still, a Kipling, have contributed their share to that mental. condition which brought this war about. To continue to quote from this pamphletProfessor Karl Pearson speaks from a "" scientific stand-point "" in a similar strain : It is to the real interests of a vigorous race to be kept up to a high pitch of external efficiency by contest, chiefly by way of war with inferior races and with equal races, by a struggle for trade routes and the sources of raw supply. This is the national history view of mankind, and I don't think you can, in its main features, subvert ifc. Professor W . Ridgeway, Professor of Archaeology and Classics, Cambridge, is no less Prussian in his point of view. He saysA modern world, filled only with Democratic States, would be a stagnant pool in some shady spot in which no higher forms could live, but overflowing with all the baser sorts of life. In a word, a perfect peace humanity would perish from its own physical and moral corruption. Does the Postmaster-General agree w it h that? able member does. member knows that I do not. MrE . B . Osborh, a man of some standing in Great Britain, has writtenThat is why war, for war's sake, appeals to so many. It is a gymnasium of the naked soul, in which virtue .renews her hardihood after the corroding comfort of a long period of peace. . . . . War has always been, and still is the ultimate secret of progress throughout the demesnes of life But for war millions of battles, extending over millions of years, we might even now be nothing but mud fish, peacefully reposing in the secular slime. Theodore Roosevelt, that arch apostle of the cruel and crude policy of force, upon which my honourable friends opposite the honourable so stoutly rely, has saidWe must play a great part in the world, and F r o m the point of perform those deeds of blood and valour which, above everything else, bring national renown. By war alone can we acquire those virile dualities necessary to win in the stern strife of actual life. In this, world the nation that is trained to a career of unwarlike and isolated ease is bound to godown in the end before other nations which have not lost the manly and adventurous qualities. In an article in the Nineteenth Century and After, Mr Harold Fraser Wyatt, the founder and honorary secretary of the Imperial Maritime League, wroteVictory is the result of efficiency, and that efficiency is the result, of a spiritual quality. . . . . And the efficiency or inefficiency of its armaments is tbe determinincr factor in a nation's success or of a nation's failure, at that culminating moment of long processes of commercial and diplomatic rivalry-the moment of war.

646,Mr Nicholls (Macquarie) [6.1,"livery was necessary if the area under wheat in New South Wales was not further to diminish. Asi t was, wheat production was affected adversely because such a step was not taken earlier. Owing to the bad times experienced by the majority of growers, particularly the 'small men, during the last three years, the. wheat position has become most serious. It would seem doubtful if this was fully recognised by the Federal Government. Its present action indicates failure to realize the position in this State, or why is ths present attitude taken up ? Why should the Federal Government object to the Government of this State endeavouring to maintain the stability of one of our most important industries, when such a step can mean nothing but good for the Commonwealth? Whether other States consider it necessary or not to follow the example set by this State is surely a matter to be settled between the wheat-growers and tbe Governments of such States individually. But the Government of New South Wales has taken tbe only conceivable stand that could be taken. Even if its action in giving an additional guarantee had not been a wise step from the stand-point of preserving the industry, a pledge is a pledge, and must be honorably observed. That is one thing which the Government have not done. They have not respected their pledges. is stored in Australia? matter directly. Surely this fact cannot be ignored by the Federal Government, and if it persists in forcing the issue it is difficult to see how it can escape responsibility for any friction that might result. The position at present is a complicated and delicate one, but, firstly, tbere should be realization of the absolute need for harmony and co-operation in this period of national stress; and, secondly, that the interests of the wheat-growers sbould not be penalized in any dispute between tbe Governments concerned. I am of opinion that the wheat-growers should not be penalized because f r i c t i o n exists between two Governments. If the New South Wales Government can guarantee the grower 4s. a bushel upon all wheat produced within that State, the Commonwealth ought to guarantee either that amount or, say, 4s. 2d. or 4s. 3d. per bushel upon all wheat produced w it h in Australia. But there seems to be something radically wrong in the administration of the Wheat Pool throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth, because the South Australian Wheat Commission, some time ago, when dealing with the question of the amounts paid to the agents of that Pool, brought to light some of the most astounding statements which could possibly be published. Here is one of the statements made by the CommissionThe South Australian Wheat Commission has been the means of bringing to light some illuminating figures concerning tbe actual sums paid during the past three years to the Wheat Pool agents. The figures relate to the payments in only one State-South Australia -bu t they cover firms who operate in several States, and they are so large as to suggest the necessity for further analysis to show-(1 ) how much of the money paid represents commission netted by the agents, and (2) how much represents payments by the agents for work performed in receiving, stacking, and forwarding wheat to seaboard. From tbe forwarding to the Wheat Pool to 30th April, 1918, the agents in South Australia were paid over £1,000,000, according to the evidence of Mr G. G. Nicholls, the manager for the Pool in the State named, given in Adelaide on Monday last. In 1915-16, f445,274 was paid; in 1916-17, £490,788; and in 1917-18, £151,223; making the total for the three seasons £1,087,285. orable member quoting?

I wish to make the case for the farmers as strong as I can, but I cannot do so if honourable members continually interrupt me. I am particularly interested in the man on the land, and I desire to see his interests protected to the fullest extent. A t the present moment those interests are not being protected by the Government. No r are they being protected by agents operating on behalf of the Wheat Pool. member is wrong in saying that a firm in Mudgee has made money out of it . that they had made money out of the Wheat Pool.

However, I do not. want to discuss the business of this firm. I want to discuss the position of the farmers. The TEMPOEABY ( Mr Atkinson) -The honourable member's time has expired. a.m.] I am somewhat surprised that some of the arguments used by honourable members on this side of the House have not been replied to by supporters of the Government. When I was interrupted last night I was alluding to the Age newspaper, which, in its issue of 31st May, contained, I think, one of the strongest indictments it has ever made against any Government or party. Last night when I was addressing a large public meeting, comprising a number of working women folk, I referred to the fact that Parliament was about to go into recess, and when I asked them if they had the power of recall would they drag out the members and make them face the electors, . they declared emphatically in the affirmaHowever, I have tive.

The facts are flagrant-to o flagrant to pass from any mind capable of feeling abhorrence -for that loathsome brand of patriotism which cloaks a policy of private greed and cruelty with a fair national pretence. In its long history of criticism of Governments the Age has never used stronger I think that the honourable language than this. the same things about your party, you I did not even infer know. D r . MALONEY I am aware that the Age has said many things about me and my party, but in those circumstances I have always considered the Age to be wrong. In the present instance I believe We took his evidence that paper to be right, and Victorian members who are supporting the Government know that if their present policy is continued their seats are doomed. The Age continuesThe Inter-State Commission was deputed to He was make an investigation. It came to the conclusion that the prices were reasonable, and the Government promptly adopted the recommendation, to which the people submitted as to an authoritative decision. A little later, th* Commission was asked to'make an inquiry in respect to the abnormal cost of meat. After a patient examination it showed that the prices were far too high, and it recommended in this case also that they be fixed according Australian people be supplied at the same prices as are being received for meat that is exported. It is an infamy to say that the people of Australia should be compelled to pay more than the export parity for meat.",115,Chairman Who Do Nofc Wish The Empire To Succeed

Here is a great testimonial for the Liberal party! Angliss fined eighteen or nineteen times for having sold adulte-. rated sausage meat, or other offenses against the law. Another paragraph from the Age leading article statesWhile some men are making immense sums out of the industry, there is evidence of meat being denied to children because of its high price, with probably serious effects to their physique, and that there is world-wide precedent for national action. Surely that is strong enough. Our children should be able to get good and wholesome food. Another paragraph in the Age statedThe Government were asked in Parliament whether they intended to take action. The answer was delightfully political, and it ought not to be forgotten. The Government did not consider, said the Minister, that the recommendation ""was capable of practical operation."" Of course it is never practical to do anything that may injure the rich ; but we know quite well that if the people had the power to drag honourable members back, which I venture to prophesy they will have before long, honourable members on the other side, and perhaps some on this side, would be made to "" sit u p . "" The Age stated furtherThe income from stock during the two fat years of 1916-17-fro m beef, mutton, lamb, and wool-wa s £27,000,000 more than in 1913. The Commission holds that the determining faetor is, What price will pay the producer? Broadly, it says, the present prices ior meat are 100 per cent, higher in the case of beef and mutton (wholesale) than in the year' before fhe war, though the country contains as many cattle and more sheep. I cannot understand how any one can logically object to the course recommended by the Commission. Australia does not depend upon her herds, her coal, w»ol, or minerals. This country depends for its greatness upon its people, the majority of whom are workers, and I am speaking on their behalf now when I am protesting against thea endeavour of the exGovernment to get into recess. This Parliament is farthest from the seat of war, Yes ; but what did where murder is rampant, and where so many lives are being lost every day, and it is going into recess because the Government will not provide, honourable member^ with work to do. This Government will be judged by their actions, and they are going into recess so that the country may be ruled under the War Precautions Act. That is what it means. During the course of the debate an honourable member in khaki said that the civil power should always be dominant. Honourable members will perhaps remember that I always questioned Mr Pisher on this point whenever any measure was brought in , and if there was any doubt about the civil power not being dominant I did not hesitate to secure an amendment of the measure in order to bring it into line with what I consider to be the true principles of Democracy. I regret that that course haa been departed from, because although the War Precautions Regulations are not called laws, they are in effect laws, as under them citizens may be fined or imprisoned without any recourse to those legal protections of our liberties which are provided in our Constitution. On one occasion when I refused to accept the word of the Prime Minister( Mr. Hughes), he asked angrily, "" W h y w ill you not take my word? I am the Attorney-General, and in charge of the B ill . "" I replied that I would not take his word on anything, and repeated what I had said in Caucus-that I did not trust him. His sinuous mind w ill bring h i m to a bad end. He came to an executive of which I was vice-president, and said to us, "" Gentlemen, we wish you to join with those of New South Wales and Queensland, who have just passed a resolution promising immunity from opposition at the coming election to any Liberal candidate who w ill support the Watson Government against the ' Reidites' and the ' Ceokites.'

Mr Hughe3 then went to Sydney, and told them there that Yictoria had passed the resolution that I speak of, and asked them to do the same. He did not say that we had been induced to pass it by false pretences. The Sydney executive, being better Democrats, or knowing him better than we did, refused to clo what he asked. Ten days later we found that we had been lied to and deceived, and Mr Fisher, so long as he remained in this Parliament, was ashamed of the use that had been made of him. We resigned as a protest against what had been done, but we kept silence, and the matter was not allowed to get into the press. member continued for ye'as to follow Mr munity should be able to get it more Hughes. Then there was the unfortunate money lending transaction in Perth. Does the honourable member approve of that? There are about ten other dirty cases against the Prime Minister. Mr Sydney Kidman, the great cattle owner and grazier, is reported to have said, "" I am satisfied to sell my cattle in Queensland at the Imperial prices, because I make enough out of them. I reckon that we get more than they are worth, and the same with the wool. If other growers would give the Imperial Government so many bales in every hunman is one of the wealthiest men in Australia, and I put him in the same category as Mr Baillieu, who is reputed to be making, his second million, and who has been man enough to declare that'the war-time profits tax will not touch men like him. If Parliament continued in session, it would be possible to amend that measure. The honourable member for Grey( Mr Tudor's manifesto was a facsimile of the Poynton) knows well that our wine producers pay no Excise duty, and yet have increased the prices of their wines up to the prices of foreign wines, so that the Australian public are now paying twice as much as they used to pay for wine. At least, £300,000 could be obtained by Excise duties on wine without injuring the wine.industry. Similarly, the prices of beer and spirits made locally have increased. It was given in evidence before one Commission that, in Scotland, the cost of making a gallon of the best whisky was lOd. One may judge from that of the profit that is being made in Australia. In the Melbeurne Age of 1st Junei t is stated thatPrices for meat are nearly double what is reasonable, and, as a consequence, the stockowning interests are making extra war-time proflts to the extent of millions a year. The same statement might pretty well be made of bread, which, according to the information that I have, costs much more than it should. For this the Government are largely to blame, because they have allowed millions of bushels of grain to be destroyed by weevils, mice, and damp. I hold that the people of the country in which a commodity is produced should be able to purchase that commodity as the honourable cheaply as possible; that no other comcheaply, except during a time of famine. too frequently follows in the stepsof war. We know, however, that the people of England do not get meat at the price paid for it in Queensland by the I m perial Government, namely, 4fd. per lb.

Providence, if it has the control of Governments, must have been well satisfied with the work of those who held office during those year3. But the present Government have no record like that. They seem to have no ambition, either. They do not even try to show the patriotism which they claim Can any honourable to possess. A t the present time they are chasing the people's representatives out of this House as fast as they can. They first avail themselves of the War Precautions Act and Regulations, and then they fall back upon various Committees.

The people whom we represent look back on the past and realize that they cannot They have expect the Government and their supThe war porters in this House to hold the ideals which have always actuated men like myself. But we have been deluded and cast down, just as wealth has ever ground Honourable down the poor. After the declaration of the poll at the last general election, I was invited, as a successful candidate, to attend a meeting of the Trades and Labour Council in Sydney, and on that occasion made a speeeh which the Sydney Morning Herald paid me the compliment of reportNo Ministers ing. I said then, speaking with the greatest solemnity, that I deplored the fact that the great Australian Labour the opinion that, even before the return of the writs, the electors themselves would have cause to regret their decision. I feel that that utterance on my part has already been more than justified. Why should the Governmeut be so anxious to shut down this Parliament? We do not find the Parliament of New Zealand, or the British Parliament, closing their doors. The British Parliament consists largely of representatives of vested interests, but there is no anxiety on their part for an adjournment. The British' Government are desirous, in this time of crisis, to keep in touch with the wishes and ambitions of the people, and, in order that nothing may he left undone that ought to be done, Parliament is constantly in session. anxious to do the right thing should fear criticism. His Majesty's Opposition in this Parliament is charged with the duty, amongst others, of scrutinizing the actions panies and associations to be controlled of the Government, and of criticising them with the object of insuring the proper excould not serve two masters, that they must penditure of the publio funds, and a sound system of administration.

The TEMPORARY OHAIRMAN ( Mr Atkinson) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. avail myself of the additional half-hour to which I should, in ordinary circumstances, be entitled later on. Let me refer now to the fixing of the price of meat, which is a question of grave concern. the prices of necessary commodities generally is all-important. I an? glad that a section of the press which supports the Government has come to our assistance in urging that steps should be taken to prevent profiteering in connection with neceswould protest against the proposal to allow sary commodities, and especially in demanding the fixing of the .price of meat. The Government invited the editors of the big newspapers, a few weeks ago, to attend a conference, and, no doubt, then discussed with them many matters, including the reasons why the right of the press to criticise the Ministry should be curtailed. But a section of the press, to its credit, is urging that, in the interests of the people generally, the Government should proceed at once to fix the price of meat. I have had the pleasure ""of meeting, on several occasions, both in public and private life, the members of the Inter-State Commission, and am satisfied that they are anxious to give the people the real facts as to the position of the meat industry. I believe that, in their reports to Parliament, they have done so. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) and the honourable member for Hume( Mr Palkiner) are members of the Wool Board. They are interested in the meat industry, and they are using all the power they possess in a way that is No Government that is not befitting representative men. I said a few days ago that the members of another Board established by the Government were well-paid servants of the comby that Board. I pointed out that they either throw over the interests of the institutions from which they drew large sums of money, or retire from the Board. And so with members of the Board that has to do with the wool and, incidentally, with the meat industry. They are likely to throw over the interests of the people. One of them has said again aud again that he does not agree with thefindingsof the Inter-State Commission in regard to the fixing of the price of meat. What prisoner has ever agreed with a jury that brought in against him a verdict of guilty? I have never heard of a defendant who was satisfied with a verdict that went against him. The position is the same with regard to those interested in the meat industry. They are dissatisfied with the recommendations of the Inter-State The fixing of Commission. That Commission has found that the cost of living has been considerably increased as the result of certain operations, and I am sure that, if honourable members opposite were free to give expression to their unbiased views, they Parliament to go into recess, so that the settlement of this question of price fixing may be still further delaved. The Government display a most callous disregard for the needo of the people.

Had a Labour Government been in power, and had the Minister for the Navy( Mr absolutely forced by the pressure of publio Cook) been the Leader of the Opposition, I venture to say that when the Commission c presented its first report, if the Government more than did those who were in charge of had exhibited any indisposition to give effect to its recommendations, we should have had, not one, but numerous all-night sittings. There was sufficient information in that report to warrant any Governmentmoving in the matter. Yet nothing has been done. But the moment action was threatened in the direction suggested, these meat profiteers, who were extracting from the people annually no less than £27,000,000 more than they were receiving in pre-war times, immediately rushed to the Government to impress them with the hardship that would be inflicted by the"" fixation of meat prices. With what result? The Prime Minister sent word to the Commission, through the Food Controller, that they must go slow. I suppose he had read so many statements ahout the I.W.W. and the going slow process that he thought it would be a good thing for the Commission to go slow. these profiteers if the honourable member will not let us? knows more about the hardship that is incidental to the rearing of a family than does the Prime Minister. Yet he decided to allow the profiteers to continue exploiting the public. Would the Government have been Teturned to power in May of last year if tlieir attitude towards the cost of living had been known? They would not have had a dog's chance. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr allow thenvj and if they had not had the Wise) would never have been elected had he told his constituents that the report of the Inter-State Commission upon the price of meat would be pigeon-holed, and that the robbery of the people would he permitted to continue. There are no greater criminals in this world than those who exploit the public in the matter of foodstuffs. orable member refer as "" criminals "" ? people of the opportunity to obtain necessary commodities. It cannot be denied that before the fixation of prices in Great Britain a phenomenal increase took place in the cost of necessary commodities there. The Imperial Government were opinion to adopt the principle of price fixing. Nobody contributed to that result the cattle industry there. It was only when the price of bullocks was run up from £50 to £70 per head that the Government stepped in. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) has told us that the prices of the necessaries of life in France, where there is no price fixing, are double the pricesof similar commodities in England, where prices are controlled. America, too, has adopted the principle of price fixing. After all, it is opportunity which makes thieves. It is necessary for us to adopt the principle of price fixing in order to deal with the thieves who are interested in exploiting the people in the matter of foodstuffs. It is absolutely necessary that we should have price fixing. The Government in May, 1917, did not say a word in opposition to this proposal, because, when members who had been sitting on this side oi the House coalesced with them and got Ministerial positions, they must have known that, as a Government, they would be called upon to deal with this question. So far, however, they have done nothing to relieve the position, or even to substitute something else. sugar ? former Government, in which the honourable member was included.

This is no ordinary time, and at such a crisis in the nation's affairs the Government should call to its councils all who might render them assistance. Instead of doing so, they put an end to the meetings of Parliament. No other Government in the Empire has treated its Parliament as we have been treated by this Government. Is it because Ministers fear criticism ? God knows they have, given plenty of reasons for criticism. Never before has such lack of initiative been apparent in an Australian Parliament. enough in the State Parliament, where Jack was turned out to put in John, Governments having to depend for support on the vested interests.

The people are told that instead of spending on luxuries the money tliat they are 'receiving they should put it into their savings bank accounts. No doubt it would be a good thing for them if they did so. The Government should learn what is going on in other parts of the world, in Great Britain, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States of America. In all those countries financial matters are considered of the first importance in connection with the war. In the United States of America no less than thirteen Bills have been passed through Congress dealing with financial matters since that country entered into the war, in order to provide that the national -assets may be utilized for the purpose of carrying on the war. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Bamford) -The honourable member's time has expired. a.m.] I am glad that the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) is present this morning, because there are several It is not an unreasonable rematters of importance that I should like to bring under his notice. I direct his attention to the fact that the New South Wales Government have appointed a Board of Trade, and that if we are to take full advantage of circumstances arising out of the war we should have a Commonwealth Board of Trade appointed to consider what new avenues of industry may be opened up. The Government should be prepared to assist in the development of any new industry. It is said that, notwithstanding our losses in men and money, and the drain upon our resources, new industries will spring up in Australia after the war, but in my view it will be too late then to consider what industries might be deI used to think it bad veloped. We should now look carefully into the position of industries which depend for their continuance upon imports from abroad. I know of no better way of doing that than to appoint a .Board of Trade to systematically investigate these matters and report to Parliament. I hope that the war will soon be over, but Every financial expert in the certainly the country is looking to this Parliament to see that the fullest advantage is taken of circumstances arising out of it. In the electorate which I represent We have a community of only -there are several important industries which at the present time are hampered through the difficulty of importing necessary supplies required in the manufacture of the articles with which they are concerned. Notwithstanding the great railway and tramway systems of the Commonwealth we have so far been importing all wheel tyres for rolling-stock. As a result of the difficulty of securing freight at the present time our rolling-stock ""is being run down, and we should certainly begin as early as possible the manufacture in Australia of wheel tyres for railway rolling-stock. There are many industries which might be established, but before capital is invested in their development the sanction of the Treasurer must bo obtained. I do not speak of the present Treasurer ( Mr Watt), but I know that in the past, when men have been anxious to start new industries, and have sought the permission of the Treasurer for the investment of capital in them, they have received very little encouragement. They have been met with the statement, "" We want all the money for the war."" I think",121,Chairman To The London Parity In Other Words That T I E
709,Mr Riley (South Sydney) [8.2,"that is a short-sighted way of looking at things. hope that the present Commonwealth Treasurer will see his way to reverse some of the decisions of his predecessors, because it would be a step in the right direction to encourage the investment of capital in new industries in Australia. In my district there are many wool and tanning industries started, and in addition to the manufacture of wool-tops, perthem if you take so many bales of pelts sons are prepared to go, in for spinning and the manufacture of cloth. The establishment of these industries would be of vast benefit to the people. Of what use is it to send our wool away from Australia in a raw state only to import it again as manufactured cloth ? Australians have already demonstrated in connection with every industry that they have undertaken the intelligence and ability necessary to make it a success. I point out that the Wool Board is constituted of men whose' interests are confined to the growing of wool, and there are no representatives upon it of the fellmongery industry. This industry is dislocated at the present time because it is impossible to get shipment for pelts. tures are encouraged. The result is that we have nearly £1,000,000 worth of pelts prepared for the manufacture of the finer leathers which cannot be exported. talking of basils. supply also of tanned leather that cannot be exported. I do not blame the Government entirely for this, but I believe that the difficulty might be overcome by negotiation. stipulate that shipping space should be found for cured pelts. If the Shipping Board were looking after the interests of the manufacturers of this country they would provide that for every bale of dry skins exported the ships must take one bale of cured pelts or basils.

We have a right to know what the prospects of successful development are before we spend any more money there. The Government would be wise to appoint two or three members of this House to investigate the matter and report to Parliament. I congratulate the Government upon their expressed intention to regulate the price of meat. I regret that action in the matter has been so long delayed, but now that it has been decided upon, I hope that the price will be fixed at an early date. But I see a danger. A man in the meat business in Sydney said to me, "" It is all very well for the Government to fix prices, but so long as we can get good prices for our-wool, we will not send our stock into the market."" The Government's trouble will lie in the fact that men who are getting such a high price for wool will not send sheep to the market. fat stock would be a lunatic to allow it to become poor again. fat stock to the market after he has taken off the wool. But there will be a strong movement to ""prevent the Government regulating the price of meat, and Ministers will require to be firm. I hope that price fixing will be a success, because it is ""beout the enlistment of youths, and the Goyond question that we are paying too much for meat. There is a matter I should like to bring under the notice of the Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Wise). On last Saturday week,, after the men at Liverpool Camp were dismissed from drill, and were about, to sit down to dinner, the officers called them all out, and sent them on various parades. They were kept on parade so long that their dinner was wasted, and even when they were released they had to runto catch the afternoon train. Surely such things are avoidable in a camp like Liverpool. The ofiicers knew that the day was a half-holiday, and if special parades were necessary, they could have been called for the morning. The circumstances I have related caused a good deal of dissontent among the men, and they have been saying harsh things about the officers. The accommodation for the washing-up of dishes at Liverpool is very scanty, and after the first fifty men have cleansed their dishes, others have to wash up in water that has almost the. consistency and colour of soup. Surely the Government can provide adequate washing-up facilities, and if the Minister will attend to this matter he will do a good turn to the men"". In regard to the Opposition's attitude to the Government, we have no desire to hamper them, so long a3 we are given ample opportunity to discuss matters. I am prepared tor, assist the Government to win the war, and if they bring before Parliament any measure that has 4hat as its object, it will get support from honourable members on this side. ber. the Labour party. We are as much concerned as are the Government in the wining of the war. The Government should hesitate about enlisting boys under twenty-one years of age without the consent of their parents. I have been approached by many people who are' opposed to the Government's policy in this matter, and I know that the enlistment of minors has caused a good deal of friction.» So far, we have succeeded fairly well in getting recruits withvernment are making a mistake in depriving parents of their rights. The Government will be acting wisely if they revert to the old regulation, which required every youth under twenty-one years of age to get his parents' consent before enlisting. The Inter-State Commission has been taking evidence in Sydney in regard to the prices of boots. I hope that, when the Government receive the report, they will immediately undertake the regulation of prices. I have had the pleasure of visiting several large boot factories, and I have also known men who made boots by hand. It used to be possible to buy a pair of hand-made boots for 18s. 6d. Today, notwithstanding the introduction of up-to-date machinery, which enables one man to do as much work as thirty men were able to do on their knees, we are paying 50 per cent, and 100 per cent more for boots.

The Government's duty is to see that the people are not "" fleeced."" The evidence before the Inter-State Commission disclosed some very glaring abuses. Hardly any boot, that is made in Australia is branded to that effect. Nearly all are given fictitious names, and are branded as having been made in America or Paris. The reason is that the people have been led to believe that an imported boot is better than one locally made. Manufacturers should be compelled to stamp their goods ""Made in Australia,"" and, if that were done, we should get a better article.

I think the war-time profits tax will require to be recast. I know of firms which were established in New South Wales before the commencement of the war and whose business has increased tenfold during the last four years. Yet they will not be taxed to the same extent as will many new businesses. Why should big established businesses be practically immune from the war-time profits tax?

The financial position has become bonedust, so acute that we cannot continue borrowing as we have been doing. Any firm which is making profits should be compelled to give half those profits to the Treasury. I am prepared to lose half of my income, and I believe that every honourable member in the House would be willing to do the same if that sacrifice were made general throughout the community. The adoption of a policy of that kind would help materially to solve the financial problem. We should all assist in bringing about an equitable form of taxation.

If it was an ordinary matter before the House we -could, with some show of decency, allow honourable members an opportunity to get away early; but we are dealing with a Bill affecting the finances, which are most essential for carrying on the war. An Opposition which properly attends to its duties ought to see that money is not wasted, because expenditure wasted is revenue lost, and expenditure saved is revenue gained. We should be quite justified in protecting the revenue, because the Goveniment will not tax those who are able to pay, and therefore it devolves upon those who sit on this side to see that no unwarranted expenditure takes place with the millions of money from loans at the command of the Government. We are on velvet, and the Government ought to commend us for our action. If they put the case as I am putting it next time they go before the electors I am satisfied that the people will say the Opposition Were right and the Government were wrong.

There is too much rush about our procedure. No other Parliament is dealing with important matters as we are dealing with them. The Standing Orders should only be suspended to deal with questions of urgency. There is nothing urgent about the expenditure covered by the Supply Bill. I hope that Ministers will not lose all sense of reasonableness. It is no pleasure to me to say hard things in impressing on honourable members the folly of suspending standing orders in the present circumstances, when there is no warrant for it. There are serious items of expenditure covered by the B ill ; bur the same spirit which is behind this motion will attempt to push those items through the House without allowing honourable members the opportunity to discuss them. If I could only bring my honourable friends opposite to my frame of mind, thej' would later on be pleased with themselves for refusing to suspend the Standing Orders on this occasion. The press, which has exercised such a great influence in placing honourable members on the Treasury bench, cannot find any pleasure in the suspension of the Standing Orders on this occasion. I trust that honourable members will exercise the gifts with which the Almighty has endowed them, and which have enabled them to secure the positions they now occupy, and that they will not oppose the wishes of honourable members on this side who do not desire to have the Standing Orders suspended. I urge Ministers not to rush matters, and to have some regard for the poor creatures on this side of the chamber, who are trying to do their best to bring them to a realization of their responsibilities. There are; always two parties in a Parliament, and, because the party on this side stands for liberty and progress, it cannot fail to oppose thc motion. No oue with a knowledge of the principles of Democracy would support it. I hope that honourable members on thc Ministerial side will not [ 2 1 4 ] -, forget the very strong remarks which they have often made in reference to rushing Every honitems covering millions of pounds through the House. It was never thought, when Federation was established, that the provisions enabling the Standing Orders to be suspended would be put into operation for the purpose of preventing the discussion of financial matters. I really thought that the National Parliament would he a little above the ordinary fights that occur in the smaller Legislatures of Australia. The power to suspend the Standing Orders ought to be removed from the Statutes, in order to set an example to local governing bodies in Australia, and show. them that the stifling of debate should not be permitted, and that the privilege of the people's representatives to make themselves heard at all times should be jealously guarded. We know what the Government have been doing under thc War Precautions Act. A list has been supplied to us giving the names of persons who have, under the Act, more control at the present time than has Parliament, yetprobably not one man on that list, if he stood for election to any Legislature, would secure sufficient votes to run to more than three figures. I could speak volumes on this motion. I regret I have not the ability of another honourable member who was able *o make a nine-hours' speech. I doubt whether such a lengthy speech could be delivered upon this question. There is not sufficient material to enable it to be done. It is a national calamity that the opportunity to discuss financial matters should be prevented. Finance makes for that efficiency without which the war could not be carried on. I can hardly realize why the Government have brought this motion forward. They musthave done so in a moment of excitement. Ministers should be calm and deliberate, and should have a judicial frame of mind. They should not permit themselves to be carried away by excitement. A Scotchman once told me that if ever I was faced by a difficult problem it was best to take a night's sleep before attempting to solve it. If honourable members opposite would take the opportunity to secure a little sleep, many of them would be much wiser, and the suspension of the Standing Orders would be unnecessary. No deliberative Parliament should permit a suspension of standing orders while the finances are in such a muddle, and I hope that honourable members opposite will think twice before they give a vote in favour of it . If they would but give serious consideration to the reports which have been placed before them, and to the problems which would have to be faced after the war, they would not be prepared to suspend the Standing Orders. A statesman would look to the future. He would not be a lover of the suspension of standing orders. pend them at every opportunity. is thinking of the next election, l e t him put his mind to something above the level of the mere ordinary politician.

Mi-. SPEAKER I ask the honourable member to resume his seat for a moment. I am loath to interrupt the honourable member's speech, but however interesting an address on the general subjects with which he is dealing may be, I must again remind him that the motion is to suspend the Standing Orders for a specific object, and the discussion must be confined to the suspension of the Standing Orders for that object. be well advised in the interests of the country not to rush through the consideration of a financial measure by the suspension of the Standing Orders. We ought not to go into reces3 ignorant of what the proposed expenditure is for. I shall be in a position to tell my electors what I have done to bring honourable members opposite to a sense of their responsibility, and I have no doubt that that will secure my seat for me. Honourable members opposite should, instead of supporting the motion, take such a course as will not leave them ashamed to tell the electors what the National Parliament is doing. I am so free of self-interest that I am not considering my own side in this matter. I have no desire to monopolize all the talking, and there are other honourable members on this side who are just as much opposed as I am to the suspension of the Standing Orders. The rights and privileges of honourable members should not be curtailed, especially in the discussion of financial measures, and the Standing Orders have been framed to protect those rights in the interests of the liberties of the people. Once the attempt is made to stifle debate, Parliament becomes a place only for tyrants, and not for men who love liberty. a.m.] I protest against the motion to suspend the Standing Orders for several reasons. I look upon it as a challenge by the Government to a fight a I'outrance. Whati t means is that by the force of a continuous sitting and the application of the closure the Government will have their will. We have now heen sitting continuously for about twenty hours, and, whilst honourable members have been able to secure rest and sleep, the officers of the House, the Hansard staff, and the policemen on duty have been kept in continuous attendance. That is not fair. If there is to he a fight, let the Government use the closure. I may say that, if I were on the other side, from my experience of the present Government I would use it without fear whenever I thought it necessary. I ask, on behalf of the officers of the House and of honorahle members, that the Government should use the closure. I would have more respect for them if they did than if they persist in trying to weary honourable members on this side by a continuous sitting.

If , in spite of the wish of the people expressed at so many public meetings, the Government intend to go straight into recess, the sooner they do so the better; and I repeat that I would have more respect for them if they applied the closure at once than if they persist in their present course. I am afraid that the fight must go on as long as parties remain as they are in this House. [10.41 a.m.] I do not intend to protract the debate, but honourable members on the Government side must admit that the Opposition have certain duties to perform. The position of a majority of the people is acute at the present time because of the high cost of living. That question should be dealt with at once and while Parliament is sitting, so that honourable members may review what is proposed to be done. The Opposition may not have much power in the matter, but they should have the opportunity to criticise. The Government propose to go into recess, possibly for three months, and the position may become worse as time goes on. In the circumstances we should not be doing our duty if we did not protest against the delay in dealing with the matter. I agree that Ministers at the present time have a great deal to do, but there are other people in the community who also have important duties to perform. It is especially our duty to see that granted to His Majesty for the services of the Parliament shall have an. opportunity of consideringfchequestion which at the present time is of most importance to the public. The Government, in attempting to fix prices, must look for opposition from those whose interests will be affected; bufc it is their duty to consider the interests of the general community, and it is the duty of the Opposition to see that those interests are protected. I intend to vote against any attempt hy the Government to ' expedite business merely in order that Parliament may go into recess. I feel very strongly that the most important question of the fixation of prices should be dealt with by the Ministry while the House is sitting. 5881 Question-That the motion be agreed to-put .

It is quite obvious that neither, the country nor Parliament is of opinion that Parliament should adjourn when so many matters of urgent importance are demanding attention. The present Government have had charge of the affairs of this country for 399 days, and during that time Parliament has sat for only seventy-five days.

767,Mr Finlayson (Brisbane) [10.53,"5th May, 1917. I have here the Argus of the 28th March, 1917, containing the policy speech made iby the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) at Bendigo on the 27th March. That speech included a large number of items which the Prime Minister said would be the particular concern of the Government if they were returned to power. The"" Win-the-war "" policy was to be the dominating feature of their administration, but the events which have happened since prove what the Government and every intelligent citizen knew at the time, viz., that the Government could do no more to win the war than Australia was already doing. All that was possible was for Australia to proceed vigorously with the policy which up to that time had proved eminently successful. vernment have absolutely failed to redeem the promise they made to the people regarding winning the war. The people were looking then, as they are looking more pitifully now, for victory, and the Government have failed, as they knew they were bound to do, when they made ""win the Avar"" their slogan, because they knew that Australia's contribution to the war could only be of comparatively small assistance in bringing victory to the Allies. In protesting against the Government taking Parliament into recess I am concerned not only because their war policy has proved so utterly unsatisfactory, and because they have cheated the public of the policy which they promised, but because the Prime Minister's speech included a large number of items which, if the Government were sincere then, ov are sincere now, ought to be receiving consideration. It cannot be said that Parliament is being hastened into recess because there is no business to do, or because we are unwilling to do business. The reason can only be either that the Government are unable to agree as to the details of their policy or are unwilling to put their policy into operation. I shall review briefly some of the items of the policy on which the Government were returned to office, and we shall see how they have failed in every particular to carry out the promises made to the electors. Much was said by the Prime Minister regarding men, money, and products, and of the necessity for Australia making superhuman efforts to send to our kinsmen overseas a regular supply of foodAfr. Finlayson. stuffs. That the Government have failed in that particular cannot be contradicted. One item of the speech related to markets and prices, and the Prime Minister pointed out how necessary it was that particular attention should be given to securing oversea markets. He saidThe recently-imposed prohibition of imports into Britain has seriously affected the producers of every one of our primary products. The overseas markets are thus wholly closed or seriously affected, and the Government, in order tb protect the consumer from exploitation, has adopted a policy of appointing Boards to regulate prices and find markets. In respect of that policy the Government have been compelled to take aiction by the indignant protests of a disappointed public. Thirteen months ago the Government said they would protect the conThe Gosumer from exploitation, yet the position in Australia to-day is such that the Government have had to be driven to adopt such a policy by the stress of public opinion, and the reports of an independent tribunal which they appointed to investigate the matter. So far from the Government even knowing their policy, or having the courage to declare it, Parliament and the country are waiting to know what the Government mean, and what the details of their policy are in regard to one of the most necessary and common articles of food. Thirteen months ago the Government said, ""We will secure oversea markets for the primary producer, and protect the consumer from exploitation "" ; but we are waiting in vain for a statement from them. exploitation in connection with beef and mutton ? sion says there was not. ister, at Bendigo, said there was. to the Inter-State Commission. the Prime Minister's policy speech at Bendigo, and I make no reference to what thc Inter-State Commission has said. at Bendigo, say that there was exploitation in regard to meat?",130,Pairs

It is a fair and reasonable request that, before Parliament rises, we should have that policy placed before us; and I , for one, shall not consent to an adjournment until I have exhausted every means to induce the Government to declare themselves, so that we may know whether or not their intentions are satisfactory. The Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) said yesterday that it was not intended by the Government to make a statement this week. It is intended, however, that Parliament shall rise this week, which means that the only opportunity which consumers and the public generally have of voicing their opinions in an effective way will have gone, and the Government will be absolutely unhampered in what they may do. Mr .FALKINER -What of the protection of the primary producer? member for Hume( Mr Falkiner) reminds me of the fact that not only has the consuming public to be considered, but also the men engaged in production, who are in a very unfair and unreasonable position because of this delay. What objection can there be to letting the public know the Government policy? After the Cabinet meeting hehl last Saturday morning, it was announced that the Government had arrived at a decision, but the Minister in charge ( Mr Greene) publicly stated that, although a policy had been determined upon, no details had been finally arranged. We desire to have those details before the recess. We wish to know where we arc. We are the custodians of the people's rights, and OWT duty is to protect the people from that exploitation which the Prime Minister, thirteen months ago, said was then rife, and which, unfortunately, is rife, in a much more drastic manner, at the present moment. The Prime Minister, in that speech, said that the policy of the Government would be to guarantee a minimum price for wheat, so that a cheap loaf might be assured for the next three years. That the Government have done something more or less satisfactory in regard to the wheat question is, of course, to be admitted. I do not profess to know all the intricacies of the subject. I hear from some quarters that the farmers are satisfied with thc price, and, from other quarters, that there is dissatisfaction; but, whatever may be said in regard to wheat itself, we have to remember that nothing has yet been done effectively in regard to the price of bread to the consuming public. We had evidence in the newspapers only the other day that men who are prepared to sell bread at a reasonable price are unable to get flour, not only because of combines among the bakers to prevent competition, but also because of combines among the millers, who refuse to supply flour unless bakers are prepared to sell at a prico agreed on by the Bakers' Association. Board has dealt with that grievance. trouble is that the Prime Minister said something would be done by the Government to guarantee a minimum price for wheat, so that a cheap loaf might be assured for the next three years, and that, he thought, would be good news for the community as a whole. wheat has been fixed at 4s. 9d., so that that part is satisfactory. that 6d. and 7d. for the 4-lb. loaf is cheap in view of the supplies of wheat? where in the world. ment for intelligent men to advance!

829,"Mr Wallace,","Yes, and the followFrom the information I have obtained from the secretary and others employed, it appears that this vessel was loading at Brown's ""Wharf, Woolloomooloo, with wool for the Old Country. Unionist wharf labourers were engaged, and also non-unionists. The non-unionists were working on one side of the ship, and the unionists on the other. They were what is called "" winging out,"" that is, bringing the wool out from the ship's side to the square of the hatch. The unionists were putting three bales in the tiers. That is to say, they were putting the bales three high in every "" half-longer"" from the bulkhead. They could do that because of their greater skill. The non-unionists on the other side were putting only two bales where the unionists were putting three. The consequence was that on every "" halflonger"" of wool coming to the square of the hatch, the non-unionists were losing five bales. for the other bale? quired? is required in stowing wool. There may not be much skill required in stacking bales on top of one another in a store, but it is a different thing when loading it into a ship. In.the days of sailing ships and small steamers it was necessary to use screws, and also to double the hales, in order to get a certain amount in. In these days, with bigger ships, they have practically dispensed with the screws. In loading a ship you start from the bottom and work up all the time until you approach the upper deck. One man gets under a bale and puts it in position at the top, where it is held by a piece of wood or screw. The bottom bale is placed just outside the tier, immediately under the top bale. The middle bale is then placed on top of this, and the two are rolled into position. All this requires a certain amount of skill. If the middle bale happens to jut out 5 or 6 inches, the consequence is that you lose a bale of wool in your next "" half-longer."" A bale of wool, according to the usual practice, takes up 2 f t . 6 in. of space. The non-unionists were getting only two bales in height in every ""half-longer."" They could not get the third bale into position because they knew absolutely nothing about the work. Consequently five bales of wool were being lost in every ""halflonger."" because they were double. were dealing with single wool. In a space of this kind-the e heights-yo u cannot get two doubles. You can get only a double and a single. My information is that it was single wool, and that they were getting three heights in against two which were put in by other men. bands, because the practice is to dump two bales into one. cut. When two bales are dumped together, it is the practice to cut the bands. When a space like that has to be filled, it is necessary to use a double bale and a single one.

Certainly the practice may have been altered during the last five or six years. order to save space. available, it is not necessary to go to the trouble of double-dumping. shipped unless it is double-dumped to a certain height. All the space on shipping is now taken on the basis of bales being double-dumped to occupy a certain amount of room. cut? the bales would be undone. formation is that one party of men were getting this amount of wool into the vessel, whereas the others were not doing so.

There must be something wrong, and I will leave the matter for the Acting Prime Minister to explain. On the 29th of last month, thirty-three unionists were knocked off when they were working on the Australind, a Dutch ship, and non-unionists were put on in their place. If the work done by the non-unionists on the RajaJh was unsatisfactory, or if, as my letter infers, it was not necesreport of the Conference convened by the sary to take up all the space available, the same remarks must apply to their work on the Australind. I should imagine that, if the Government are anxious to get the wool away, they would do all they possibly could to get as much wool as possible into a given space .on a vessel on which it is being loaded. on whether a vessel is to be filled with wool. The Central Wool Committee receive instructions to ship so many bales on a certain steamer for, perhaps, an Allied port; and I take it that, in such cases, a certain amount of space only is available for wool. When we ship to London or some other port, and we can send away as much wool as we like, it would be a waste of space not to get in every possible bale. this ship was going to London. Perhaps the Acting Prime Minister will explain why inefficient men are employed in preference to men who have all the necessary skill for this work, and who are prepared to do the work at the rate of wage which is paid to the other men? I can see no economy in pursuing a policy of that description. allowing men who are not practical to load stuff into vessels? with certain cargoes. If tallow is being loaded into a,vessel, the chances are that half the cargo may be in the bilges if it is inefficiently stowed; but it makes very little difference when the cargo is wool. There is not so much liability to damage fostered by us. The Sydney Sun, in its The point is that the Government, through the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), before he left for the Old Country, decided that bygones should be bygones, and that unionists would be restored to the position they occupied prior to the strike; but during the last few weeks we find that the Government are still giving preference to non-unionists, and that they will not employ unionists when others are available; also, that unionists are knocked off in order to make room for non-unionists. This practice is altogether contrary to the spirit with which the Prime Minister received the Governor General, and it does not reflect any credit on the administration of the Shipping Board, or whoever is responsible for the loading and discharge of these vessels. I trust that the Acting Prime Minister will do something to rectify this grievance in the interests of the pastoralists, and also in the interests of the wharf labourers and the community generally. In the quarterly summary of Statistics, Bulletin No. 71, we find that the total revenue received from all sources was £34,067,434, and that the disbursements for the same period amounted to £87,181,669; that the net revenue was £6 19s. 9d. per head of the population, and the total disbursements were at the rate of £17 7s. 8d. per head of the population. We find also that the national debt amounts to the huge sum of £200,501,018. These figures require serious consideration, and I am pleased to find that the Acting Prime Minister has determined to set apart a financial session to deal with them. It is due to us to find out where we are going in the matter of finance, and it is up to the Government to bring down some policy of annexing the large profits which the reports that have been placed before honourable members show us have been made by some people in our community. We are given to understand that the war-time profits tax is totally ineffective to get at the large profits which are being made by oldestablished businesses, and that the industries which are affected by the tax are mostly those which have come into existence since the outbreak of the war; industries which, in my opinion, should be",136,Pairs

I have no desire to see Australia pledged up to the neck to the London Jews. It is time we raised some of the money in Australia. A new and . drastic method of taxation should be brougbt into existence for the purpose. However, in the promised special session I hope to have something to say on the matter of the finances, and I conclude by asking the Acting Prime Minister to see that the anomaly in connection with the wharf labourers is removed, and that the men to whom I have referred may be able to secure a fair share of the work which is offering on the vessels controlled by the Government. a.m.] -If I were asked which was the greater curse to mankind,' the war or tbe ravages of syphilis and gonorrhoea, I would certainly say that the latter was. In view of the experience that has followed all wars, and of the rapid spread of this disease, it is very essential that the Government should take immediate and adequate steps to protect the people of Australia, not only the men who are now returning to us, but also those who will return when the war is over. It i i my intention to mention some statistics in regard to the ravages of the disease and its effect upon society, but I deplore that they are not by any means as full as they should be because there is a certain amount of false delicacy about dealing with this subject, and because a good deal of unhappiness and divorce would be occasioned if medical men gave tine certificates of tlie causes of all deaths. cannot bring about divorces? they can do so. If it can be proved that a child's death is due to hereditary' syphilis it is proof that the mother or the father must have been affected by the disease. It has been recommended by the English Royal Commission on Divorce that venereal disease should constitute an incapacity for marriage, and in Australia it would most certainly influence the mind of the ordinary Judge in divorce proceedings. Our national debt is as cruelty. -construed. It has, as a matter of fact, been held to be cruelty. cult matter to prove from which side the disease came? easy matter. The Wassermann test would show it.

Because of mockmodesty, which leads people to speak of this subject with) bated breath, because of the old Biblical teaching that the sins of the fathers shall be visited upon the children, and for many other reasons, this question has not received the consideration which it deserves, and which it must receive at the hands of all Governments in the immediate future. If there were a system under which doctors would be obliged to furnish two certificates of death-on e for the relatives and family, in which the cause of death might be stated in any terms the doctor pleased, and one for the Begistrar-General, which should be absolutely confidential, and give the true cause of deatha vast improvement might be effected.

859,Mr Poynton,"That would not indiquestion of the influence of the disease upon divorce, on the ground of cruelty. Mr Knibbs is confronted by considerable difficulty in dealing with the statistics on this matter. General paralysis, locomotor ataxia, and apoplexy are essentially diseases brought about through syphilis. A few years ago locomotor ataxia was quite a common cause of death, but now, because its origin is known, it is not so common. People now die of locomotor ataxia, and their death certificate discloses a totally different cause of death. A good deal of apoplexy is caused by syphilis. A great deal of paralysis is due to the same cause. A certain amount of simple meningitis, palsy, organic heart disease, diseases of the arteries, and a certain amount of Bright's disease, debility, and such-like diseases, are also due to syphilis. Under the existing system adopted for the collation bf death statistics, it is imin the United States, no less than 20 per possible for us to arrive at the true state of affairs. Certain formulae have been laid down by the prominent syphilologists of Europe and the world for determining the frequency of venereal diseases. While these are fairly accurate, and give a good general idea of the prevalence of these diseases, we should not be dependent upon the use of formulae to decide, or, rather, to guess, how many people in our community are suffering from these diseases. ber any plan for stamping out the disease? shall deal with that later on. Many investigations into the matter have been made in Paris and in the United States of America, and especially in connection with the United States Army. I may inform honourable members that the investigation of the Surgeon-General's Department of the United States Army is probably the most complete investigation of the kind in the world. They may be said there to have control of the patient, and iminstance the recruit visits a recruiting mediately a man enters the United States Army he is subjected to the Wassermann blood test, by which it is possible to discover whether he is syphilitic or otherwise with practical certainty. On the percentages worked out from information collected by Dr. Cumpston and many other doctors in Australia, and by the special committee of the Australian Medical Association, I find that the estimate of the syphilitic in Australia is between 10 and 14 per cent, of the population. that somewhere between 8 per cent, and 10 per cent, of the children in Australia ai*e syphilitic. It has been proved by experiments throughout the world that, to estimate the number suffering from gonorrhoea, the syphilitic cases can always be multiplied by at least four. According to the latest figures, Australia has to-day a population of 4,894,824, and on a more conservative estimate, which I have worked out from the formula? generally recognised, there must be at least 4S9,5S9 syphilitics in Australia.

Warbusse, the writer of Medical Sociology, estimates that syphilitics may be multiplied by at least six, and not four, to estimate the number suffering from gonorrhoea. It is, therefore, a most conservative estimate of the number suffering from this disease if we multiply the number of syphilitics by four. I have said that there must be at least 489,589 people in Australia suffering from syphilis,, estimating the number upon a pre-war basis, and there must be at least 1,958,356 people in Australia who are suffering from gonorrhoea. In the United States army, I find that 2 per cent, annually are infected. That is to say, that in the course of fifty years the total population of the United States would be infected. But for various reasons, the rate of infection is not so high. By reason' of deaths and of syphilitics leaving the army, the increase due to infection over a period of years does not amount to the full 2 per cent, per annum. adults in Australia? number of adults. I have taken the whole population. The formula are always applied to the total, and not to the adult population of a country. The Committee on Venereal Diseases of the Australasian Medical Conference, held at Auckland, New Zealand, and which was attended by medical men in practice throughout Australasia, stated in their report, showing that my figures are conservative, that the decision to which they came was that the syphilitic represent from 12 per cent, to 15 per cent, of fhe total population of Australia. The conference did not estimate the percentage of those suffering from gonorrhoea, but merely said that a much larger number sufFered from that disease. number who are suffering from the disease or to the number who would at some time have suffered from it ? the term of gonorrhoea, with ordinary care, may cover but a very short period as compared with syphilis. of from 12 per cent, to 15 per cent., and the honourable member for Wentworth (Mi-. Kelly) asked whether that referred to persons who are at present affected, or were affected at some time or other. to those actually suffering from syphilis. I was referring to the syphilitic. Wc have to take into consideration the fact that syphilis is a very insidious disease. In a large number of cases, apart from the primary sore, or slight eruption of the 3kin, the sufferer does not know much about it. Tho primary sore is self-healing, and may hi a few weeks have entirely disappeared, but the poison Temains in the veins, and will ultimately go throughout the system. There is no part of the system which the spirochmta pallida -the organism. of syphilis-wil l not attack. Syphilis is always contagious, but there are stages when the disease is latent. There is no fixed stage or period at which it can be said that a syphilitic will or will not affect others. Generally speaking, from the time syphilitics acquire the disease until they undergo treatment either with salvarsan or neo-salvarsan, which is less toxic than salvarsan, or with kharsevan or neo-kharsevan and mercury, or with mercury, they are likely to be contagious either by intercourse, or if there are sores from which pus is exuding, by kissing or the use of the same utensils. Honourable members may assume that ten out of every hundred persons they meet are suffering from syphilis. That is a conservative estimate The British Royal Commission on Venereal Diseases reported that through the absence of the necessary statistics they were unable to arrive at a definite conclusion, but they were of opinion that syphilitics in England represented not less than 10 per cent, of the population. That is the most conservative estimate that has been made by any authority in the world. Dr. J. W. Barrett, of Melbourne, carried out a very interesting the test in connection with an eye clinic. Ho made a blood test of 500 consecutive patients, a great many of whom attended for mere errors of refraction, and not because they suspected that they were syphilitic.

Mr Clubbe, F.R.C.S., stated in evidence before the Commission that every year 500 children suffering from gonorrhoea are admitted into the Children's Hospital. Those figures are more significant than the statistics regarding adults, and one is led to wonder whether we are doing sufficient research work, or providing that education which is necessary to bring about a better state of health in the community. Every war is very productive of venereal disease, and the late Professor Neisser, of a German University, who died in 1916, and to whom the world owes much for his work in connection with syphilology, expressed the opinion that the disease is spreading so rapidly in the Gerservative basis, the prevalence of the disman Army, and thence throughout Germany in consequence of contact with the soldiers when they were on furlough, that ifc was essential that at any cost every officer and man in the Army should besubjected to the Wassermann test, and if showing signs of syphilis or gonorrhoea should not be allowed to return to private life until they were cured. In the Austrian exercise now my right to speak a second Army practically the same conditions were found. Professor Finger, another eminent syphilologist, who has done great work in syphilological research, estimated, according to a reprint of the report of the Medical Society of Vienna, published ih fche British Medical Journal, of 4th November, 1914, that of 7,000,000 men in the Austrian Army, between 700,000 and 800,000 were suffering from venereal diseases. He did not separate the two diseases, although they are totally distinct. Syphilis owes its origin to the xpirochata pallida, whilst the organism of gonorrhoea is the gonococcus. The latter was discovered by Professor Neisser in 1878, and the sptrochazta pallida in 1905 by Schaudinn. The Government can find ample scope for further research and for preventive work in connection with the soldiers. Lieut -Colonel Sir Herbert Maitland, prominent syphilologists vouch. He estiof the Royal Army Medieal Corps, stated mates that 75 per cent, of the total popubefore the Australian Royal Commission lation of Europe is suffering from that he recognised the rapidity of the gonorrhoea, and of the population of growth of venereal disease in Sydney America, 65 per cent. The United States since the war. 3?he war hae lasted nearly of America Surgeon-General estimates four years. Comparatively speaking, very few of our men have returned, but even those who have returned have left their mark upon society. During the first seven months of 1916 Lieutenant-Colonel Maitland personally examined 2,000 soldiers who. were suffering from venereal diseases. I am indebted to the Surgeon-General of the United States of America Army Medical Department for Bulletin No. 8, dealing with the prevalence of syphilis in the United States of America Army. As I have already said, because of the Army authorities having f u l l control of the soldier, adequate facilities for dealing with each patient hy applying the Wassermann test, and following up each case throughout its history, the figures from that source can be accepted as reliable, and as fully reflecting, perhaps on a conease in the United States of America. The same standard may safely be applied in connection with investigations in Australia. Extension of time granted. honourable members for allowing me to time. In the report of the Surgeon-General of the United States of America Army for 1913 he showed that venereal disease was responsible for 97.73 per thousand of the rejects in 1912; and in 1911, 111.67 per thousand; whilst amongst the coloured races the rejections from the same cause, in 1911, were 221.65 per thousand; and in 1912, 167.86 per thousand. The coloured races of America are in a very bad condition, and acquire gonorrhoea very early in life. Generally speaking, the negro races of America suffer more from venereal disease than the people of any other country in the world, with the exception of Zanzibar, tbe Gold Coast, and a few other portions of Africa. In Medical Sociology, Dr. J. P. Warhusse has collated from various sources a number of interesting figures, for the accuracy of which he and other",140,Pairs
877,Mr Blakeley,"I am thankful to that at least 20 per cent, of those from whom the Army is drawn suffer from syphilis; and, if that is multiplied by four-gonorrhoe a being usually prevalent in the proportion of four cases to one of syphilis-w e get a result of 80 per cent, of venereal disease, which shows that the estimate of Dr. Warhusse is very conservative. fhat out of 14,000,000 people 8,000,000 have either syphilis or gonorrhoea. When we take into consideration the fact that 20 per cent, of the population of America is syphilitic, and that that number can he safely multiplied by four to give the number of gonorrhoea cases, the figures are, as I say, conservative. It is vitally important to all countries that its children shall be born healthy-that they Shall be given a fair chance, not only of life, but of healthy life. Gynaecologists from many hospitals in Europe, and also from the Sydney Hospital, are of opinion that' of operations for inflammatory diseases i u women something like 70 per cent, are due to gonorrhoea and syphilis. As a specific instance, I may say that, in .1914, of such operations performed at the Sydney Hospital, 70 per cent, owed their origin to venereal diseases. These women were apparently respectable married women; for, in New South Wales, prostitutes are generally sent to Long Bay. These hospital patients are mothers of the future generations; and it is on the married women of the country we rely to produce healthy citizens. Then we are told that 75 per cent, of the cases of sterility in women in the TJnited States of America are due to venereal diseases; that 80 per cent, of the cases of blindness in the new born in the TJnited States of America are due to syphilis; and that 20' per cent, of the cases of blindness in the State of New York are due to gonorrhoea, with a fair quota due to syphilis. In Australia it is estimated that between 20 and 22 per cent, of cases of blindness have their origin in venereal diseases, and that anything up to 25 per cent, of the insane owe their condition to the same cause. These figures alone clearly show that these diseases are of vital importance to us, and that too much money could not be spent in their suppression. Professor Pinnard, a French syphilo-quired logist, in a series of 20,000 cases ofmisnegroes, so that it may be expected that a t carriage, found 42 per cent, associated with syphilis. What with miscarriages, sterility, and operations involving loss of productive powers, venereal diseases are truly a great factor in the population question. Hereditary syphilis, which brings a child into the world handicapped from the start, claims a This gentleman estimates mortality of over 60 per cent. In France, according to Professor Pinnard, 20,000 children die annually. In Bussia, syphilis is quite common; whole villages are sometimes attacked, and it is the few, and not the many, who may be said to be free of it. On the Gold Coast it is estimated that 30 per cent, of the natives have syphilis; and in Zanzibar some five-sixths of the population suffer from the fell disease. In a report on the prevalence of syphilis in the TJnited States of America Army, issued by the SurgeonGeneral, there is a significant series-of findings well worth repeating. In that report we are told:I . WITH REFERENCE TO THE MILITARY SERVICE. 1. A very large number of recruits, estimated at 16.77 per cent., are already syphilitic at the time they enter the service. 2. Since there are only 3.44 per cent, of white enlisted men on the sick report for syphilis, it is certain that the majority of these syphilitic recruits never are diagnosed. 3. Many of these undiagnosed cases of syphilis are admitted to sick report under other diagnoses, and a certain, but at present unknown, amount of expense is thereby incurred by the Government. 4. From2 to 5 per cent, of the commissioned personnel of the Army are already infected with syphilis at the time they enter the service. 5. The percentage of syphilis among white enlisted men of the Army, estimated at 16.08 per cent., is slightly .lower than the estimated percentage of infected accepted recruits. 6. Since there are about 3 per cent, of fresh, infections annually among these troops, it follows that syphilitics are leaving' the service in 6ome way faster than new cases are being acquired. 7. Study of the syphilitic registers of completed cases confirms this belief, because the rates for discharge for disability are twice as great for syphilitics as for. all enlisted men. 8. Wassermann surveys of military prisoners, insane soldiers, tuberculous soldiers, and inmates of the Soldiers' -Home also confirm this belief, because they all include a prevalence of syphilis considerably higher than that obtaining among enlisted men. 9. Syphilis is much more common among negro troops than white troops, and is acat a much earlier age in the case of very large percentage of coloured men are already syphilitic at the time they enter the Bervice. 10. The highest rate for syphilis encountered in these surveys is among the soldiers of the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry. 11. About 13 per cent, of the insanity in the service is directly attributable to, syphilitic infection. 12. There is a distinct tendency in any group of men for syphilitic infection to accumulate with advancing years, so that the older the group the higher ""the percentage of syphilis. 13. The percentage of syphilitic infection is lower among men in the Army than among similar men in civil life. II . WI TH REFERENCE TO THE CIVIL 1. We may estimate that about 20 per cent, of the young adult male population of the class from which the Army is recruited are infected with syphilis. 2. We may estimate that about 5 per cent, of the young men in our colleges are syphilitic. 3. This study confirms observations that have already been published indicating that sypnilis is so prevalent among negroes that it is possibly the greatest single factor in the production of disability and high mortality rates among the race. 4. The high percentage of syphilis among Porto Rican soldiers indicates that syphilis may be one of the important causes of disability among native Porto Ricans. 5. Since syphilitic infection is so common, is productive of so much disability, and has so far entirely evaded sanitary control, it is believed that syphilis is a greater menace to the public health than any other single infectious disease, not even excepting tuberculosis. The last line of that report is significant. I opened my remarks by saying that if I were asked which is the greater calamity-the present Armageddon in Europe or the scourge of venereal diseases I should say the diseases. never ceases. us; and in 1914, in Australia alone, out of a population of something over -4,900,000, there were 7,189 deaths from this cause. Hie report to which I have referred the opinion is expressed that when a man's daughter marries, the chances are one in five that she will become "" damaged goods."" When we take into consideration the fact that practically 20 per cent, of the population of America, and that, on a conservative estimate, 10 per cent, of the population in Australia, is affected, it is easy to understand that a man's ^daughter has a very fail"" chance indeed of becoming ""damaged goods."" ber propose to finish with a suggestion that there should be Federal action? lutely necessary that no soldier should be allowed to return to civil life until he has passed the Wassermann test and is declared absolutely free from syphilis. For some time past our soldiers have been coming back, and we shall continue to have weekly detachments arriving; and if they do not show outward signs of venereal disease these men will be discharged and absorbed into the civil life of the country-. percentage of soldiers would fail to pass that rough-and-ready test than would civilians. to even venture an opinion on that particular point. No doubt, in the Army, prophylactic tents and other measures have done enormous good in preventing the spread of the disease; but men who, after two to five months in the trenches, are set free for twelve days or so, may not take those precautions and that care of their health which they would under ordinary circumstances. The point I stress is that the Government should see that not one soldier is let free with either gonorrhoea or syphilis. Gonorrhoea always shows signs, and is not a difficult disease to diagnose. is that, in addition to the. ordinary examination, there should be added the Wassermann test? Wassermann test can give a negative reaction while syphilis is present. That occurs in rare cases. Every man should be clean before he is allowed to go again into civil life. At the end of For the current financial year £13,000 is set aside for -subsidizing the States pound for pound in their effort to deal with venereal diseases. Four of the States have passed the necessary legisla.tion on the fines laid down by the Commonwealth Committee in their report on venereal diseases. The other two States have not done so.

A permanent standing committee should be appointed, with Dr. Cumpston, who has made a special study of the subject, as chairman, with, say, two other medical men, prominent syphilologists for preference, who could ibe found in Australia, and one or two honourable memhers of this House or the Senate. money should be placed at their disposal for the establishment of laboratories for research purposes, the manufacture of formula? for the treatment of the disease, and the manufacture of all the necessary material and instruments, with free distribution by the Commonwealth Government of all salvarsan, or neo-salvarsan, or kharsevan, or neo-kharsevan, or whatever remedy it may he determined to manufacture. The Commonwealth Government should act as father to the whole of the 'States in this matter, and give them a lead. We should say to the .States, "" If you' are prepared to administer this matter with the men who are available, we are prepared, not only to supply you wifch all the material necessary, but to subsidize you heavily."" After all, the question is one more of Commonwealth than of State concern, and I am sorry the Commonwealth has not the power'necessary to deal with it. The main point in the recommendations of the Committee is compulsory notification. adopted in four of the States. in Victoria? some unknown factor operating against it in this State. During ten months of the operation of the Act only 7,000 cases were notified, which certainly does not show the total venereal infection in Victoria. It is necessary when a doctor treats a venereaf patient that the person should be kept under proper care and attention. The only way in which that can he done is to register him. About six years ago I had the temerity, at a Political Labour League Conference, to advocate compulsory notification, the abolition of quackery in the treatment of venereal diseases, the heavy subsidizing of hospitals, and the free distribution of the formula? of salvarsan and such like. A couple of the newspapers obtained the opinions of the leading medical men, and the leading men in the political world of New South Wales, and, extraordinary to relate, found, without exception, that they were against compulsory notification. Since that time, however, the peoplehave become fairly rapidly educated on the question, and now most people, no matter how conservative, recognise the absolute necessity of compulLarge sums of sory notification. pulsory notification and a clean bill of health before either party is allowed to marry ? daughter, and when she grows up I should like to know that her husband is clean. Quite a large percentage of syphilis is innocent. It may be contracted by means of contagion, or through hereditary influences, and that heing so, no stigma of sin should rest on the head of the unoffending girl or boy. A young man may grow up suffering with hereditary' syphilis, and showing no signs of it, except, perhaps, a slight eruption. He may marry, and innocently cause a syphilitic child to be brought into the world. It is, known that syphilis will go down three generations, some say even four. When one takes into consideration the fact that a person may have the disease innocently, it is very necessary that a clean bill of health should be produced by both parties. I would make no discrimination, because This has heen the woman is just as liable to innocent infection, by hereditary influences and otherwise, as the man is. For that reason there should be a clean certificate between man and woman before a marriage can take place. quite a number of places now. know of one country in the world where such a law is in operation.

I make no complaint as to the qualifications of the gentlemen occupying seats on the various Boards, Councils, or Committees.

Legislation will also be brought forward to remove certain defects of the existing industrial machinery, and provide more effective methods of dealing with industrial problems. The matter is, in this time of national crisis, of thc highest importance for defence, and it is proposed to deal with it by a Bill framed in reliance upon bhe defence power, and, therefore, free from the complicated constitutional limitations of the Oommonwealth arbitration power. The scope of the measure will be limited to certain industries of national importance, e.g., transport, base metal mining and metallurgy, coal mining, the manufacture of iron and steel, the handling of wlieat, &c, for export, manufacture of munitions, &c.

The position is that, in the Ministerial statement of 10th April, the Government give no indication when the new Department of Labour will be created. So far as Parliament has heen informed, the proposal began and ended with the paragraph I have read. This matter is, perhaps, more serious than the Government seem to imagine. It may be that, because of our closer association with the masses of the workers, we on this side are better acquainted with the true position. If we visit any of our seaport towns today we find that, principally owing to the collapse of oversea shipping and the reduction of the Inter-State sailings, tliere is an enormous number of waterside, workers out of employment. There are also a great many men in the building trade and persons following occupations incidental to some of the bigger industries who are unable to find work. No time should be lost in discovering some system whereby we can link up these men with useful employment. Chanter) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. During the last few days I have had on It is obvious the business-paper questions of great importance in regard to the amalgamation of banking institutions. Owing to the multitudinous duties of the Treasurer, to whom these questions have been addressed, I have not been able so far to secure for them the attention they ought to receive. Finance is most sensitive, and any suspicion in the minds of the people with regard to an alteration of our banking system might be attended with very serious harm to fSie whole community. Once such a suspicion is aroused in the public mind ib is like a fire, in that once started no one can tell where it will end I have a vivid recollection of the trouble and loss occasioned the community in connection with the closing of some Australian banks, and the panic then created was such as should induce us to take steps to prevent any recurrence of it. A movement for the amalgamation of some of the big English banking houses has been going on in the Old Country for some time. Recently eight banking institutions in Great Britain have been amalgamated into four. Parr's Bank and Smith's Bank, for instance, have amalgamated into a joint stock company. Some of the private banking establishments of England were founded early in the last century, and have remained in the hands of the same families ever since. Joint stock banks have also heen in existence for a great many years, and their capital represents many millions of pounds. the amalgamation-to do away with competition? objects in view. I hope I shall be assisted by the honourable member in urging the Government to take care that the amalgamation of banking institutions in this country is in the best interests of their customers and of the public generally. Mr Bonar Law, Chancellor of the Exchequer, has thought this question of sufficient importance to warrant the appointment of a Committee of twelve eminent men to inquire into it.

Board to control the Commonwealth Bank? to show the honourable member that that would not be a wise course to follow. In the House of Commons, in March last, Mr Bonar Law announced that the Committee would consist of Lord Colwyn (chairman), Lord Cunliffe, Mr Keswick, M.P., the Hon. Rupert Beckett, the Hon. Herbert Gibbs, Sir Arthur Haworth, Mr the Government in this case should know E. Manville, MrH . McGovan, Sir John Purcell, Mr John Rae, Sir R. VassarSmith, and Mr Douglas Vickers. went ou to state that the object of the Committee was to consider and report to what extent, if at all, amalgamation between banks might affect prejudicially the interests of the industrial and mercantile community, and whether it was desirable that legislation should be introduced to prohibit such amalgamations, or to provide safeguards under which they might continue to be permitted. Such a commission is wide enough to empower the Committee to inquire into the whole ramifications of the institutions concerned. In the public discussion which followed the announcement it was suggested that Lord Cunliffe was not likely to approve of proposals in the way of amalgamation of private banking institutions, but his selection was said to be justified on the ground that a gentleman who desired to secure the services of a good gamekeeper could not do better than engage for that piixpose a man who was used to poaching. In answer to questions that I have addressed to the Treasurer I find that four Queensland, two Victorian, and two New South Wales banking companies have amalgamated. I was under the impression that no alteration in the business arrangement of any financial or commercial company, even if it did not involve an extension of capital, could be made during war time without due notice to the Treasurer. Mr Wat. I learn, however, from the honourable gentleman's reply that, while six of these institutions have applied to the Government for permission to amalgamate, two of them, who contemplate a like step, have not done so. Those two companies have their head offices in New South Wales, where the banking and company laws are amongst the most rotten in Australia, and are liable to abuse. The Treasurer admits that the whole question is of sufficient importance to warrant inquiry, but it seems to me that unless I had brought this matter forward these amalgamations would have been allowed to go on without any governmental intervention. That is a state of affairs which ought not to be allowed. Any financial arrangement likely to affect the industrial or commercial life of the community should be submitted to the Treasurer for approval, and I hold that what is the object of the proposed amalgamations. I have no desire to cast any He reflection on the gentlemen connected with our banking institutions. I have known many of them for a great many years. I have been personally' friendly with many of them, and have received at their hands every courtesy. That, however, is quite beside the question. When we have to deal with a matter of such magnitude, personal, considerations must be wholly set aside. If a banking institution were to close its doors the whole ramifications of finance would be disturbed. It is because of this that the British Government have considered the matter of so much importance that, notwithstanding the many demands made upon public men in this time of national crisis, they have called upon some of the leading financial authorities of Great Britain to take part in the inquiry. Should not Australians be equally careful ? The Government should see that the interests of the commercial and industrial world, as well as the customers of the banking institutions concerned, are properly conserved. I fail to understand why two of these eight banks did not see fit to consult the Treasurer in regard to the step they contemplated. I have had occasion to make representations to the Treasurer in regard to several proposals to raise fresh capital for Australian enterprises.

Tudor), and many bers opposite, as well as the Age, one of the leading newspapers in Victoria, have repeatedly referred to the fact that the Commission has stated that the number of sheep in the Commonwealth at the present time is greater than in 1913, while the number of cattle is about the same. The Age has had five or six leading articles on this subject, and in every one it has reiterated this statement concerning the flocks and' herds of Australia. As a matter of fact, the Age says that, at the present time, there are 90,000,000 sheep in Australia as compared 85,000,000 in 1913, these figures being based on the Commission's report, which is taken as the groundwork for these criticisms. But Mr Piddington's report contains nothing definite. It is all surmise. He states that the number of cattle in the State of New South Wales is "" about so-and-so"" and that the slieep are ""about"" In regard to Victoria, the figures are also ""about,"" or that he ""believes"" or ""estimates"" have gone to a great deal of trouble to get the exact facts concerning the flocks and herds of Australia. I saw Mr the number of fat sheep this year as comKnibbs, who was able to give me figures so far as New South Wales and Victoria are concerned, and I applied to the Stock Inspectors of the different States for the information contained in the annual reMr Pigott. The empty spaces of turns furnished to them by stock-owners. The figures which I have compiled from these sources are, in some cases, up t i ll the 31st December, 1917, and others up to 31st March, 1918. They may be accepted as accurate. I place the number of sheep at 79,027,000, as compared with 85,057,000 in 1913, the difference being 6,030,000. agree that there was an overstatement attempting as regards both sheep and cattle in the Honourable figures given by the Inter-State Commission. cattle, I find that, in 1913, there were in Australia 11,483,000, and in 1918, 10,500,000, a difference of 983,000 They have eulogized head, or, roughly speaking, about Com1,000,000 head of cattle short of the number in 1913. My figures report states there has are confirmed by Mr Pearse, the of exploiting. editor of the Pastoralists' Beview, in honourable memHe says that the correct figures for the Commonwealth are:-Sheep, 78,958,525; cattle, not including the Territory, 9,969,000. My figures, allowing for the stock in the Northern Territory, will square with those supplied by Mr Pearce. I think I have shown that the figures appearing in the Age, based on the information furnished to Mr Piddington, are not reliable. I want to point out also that, in addition to this discrepancy, tliere is also a greater shortage in the number of fat sheep and cattle. Do honourable members assume that, because with there are so many million sheep and cattle in the country, they are all fat? I can assure them there is a very great difference. On this question of fat stock, I might remark that, up till about four months ago, we have had very good seasons, but suitable only for fattening cattle, and not for sheep. All flock masters know that high, coarse, rank the same number as in 1913. grass is not the best . for fattening sheep, as it is conducive to the appearance of grass seed, worms, them to be ""about.""

With regard to the people of Queensland, because, thanks to their Government, they are able to get cheap meat. number of cattle in the Commonwealth is about 1,000,000 short of the figures for 1913, aud I want also to point out that cattle slaughtered this year are very much lighter than formerly. Honourable members who care to visit the saleyards at Homebush or Flemington, or attend country stock sales, will find that cattle offeris so. If the recommendation of the ing are much younger and lighter than they used to be. I have observed in country districts that for the most part the cattle offering, instead of heing five and six year-old bullocks, are steers nofc more than four years old. is good, but the weight is lacking. In these circumstances, when we have a shortage of 1,000,000 head of cattle, and when the cattle available for slaughtering are from 25 per cent, to 30 per cent, lighter in weight than they used to be, we can well understand how the great deficiency in fche quantity of beef available has been brought about. ply of fat cattle is very short compared with what it was last year. tained from the editor of the Pastoralists' Beview a report received from his Queensland agent in which it is set out that it is estimated that the works in Queensland this year will kill from 260,000 to 300,000, and that Darwin will deal with 25,000. says, will mean a reduction of about 20 per cent, on the number killed last year. He states that the drought of 1914-15 is telling on the supplies of killable cattle, as naturally during that time of stress brandings were very poor, and that there will, therefore, be a poor showing next year. The Southern Queensland works, he goes on to state, have been affected -owing to numbers of cattle having crossed the border, and younger and lighter cattle -steer s of two and three years old-ar e being killed instead of five and six-yearold cattle. The prospects in Queensland, therefore, are not as bright as they were. cattle the position is worse now than it was last year in Queensland. to the position in Victoria. Although Victoria has exported fat sheep and lambs, she has not exported cattle. She has to depend upon New South Wales and Queensland for portion of her supplies of beef. If the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission were carried out stock breeders in other States would have no inducement to send cattle to Victoria. country is being devoted to dairying.

The The condition of the cafctlp Queensland exporters would ship direct from Rockhampton, Townsville, and elsewhere to England, and, unless Government intervention took place, there would be no direct supplies for Victoria.

In connection with the State election for Albert Park, during the last few weeks. statements have heen made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) and other Labour men, that the price of beef has increased to the extent of 100 per cent, since 1913, and that the people of Australia are paying more for their beef and mutton than the people of Great Britain have to do. The Age, on Saturday last, published an article from its special London correspondent, in which the figures as to the actual prices of meat in London and Paris were given as in April, 1918. According to that article, London prices on the 2nd April, 1918, were as follow:-Leg of mutton, Is. 7d. per lb.; rump steak, 2s. 2d. per lb.; fillet of steak, 2s. 2d. per lb.; and pork, Is. 7d. per lb. In Paris fhe prices were-3s . 4d., 4s. 2d., 5s., and 3s. 4cL per lb., respectively. The prices in London averaged Is. 10£d. per lb., and in Paris 3s. 11 1-7d. per lb., as against practically 8|d. per lb. in Australia. show that profiteering is more rampant in the Old World than here. rationing principle is in operation in Great Britain. My sister, who lives in London, tells me that the allowance of beef for a family of two is 3 lbs. per week. The figures I have quoted show that beef is nearly three times dearer in Great Britain than it is here. cheaper in Australia to-day than in any New Zealand for all cuts is Id. per lb. in excess of the Australian price. In San Francisco, where we are told prices are fixed, it is from Is. 4d. to Is. 6d. per lb., while in Canada prices are on the same level. Mr Hoover, the Prices Commissioner leading sheep and cattle men of that country, after it had declared war against Germany, and said, in effect, to them, ""We want you to breed as many sheep and cattle as possible, because a good supply of meat is necessary to help us to win the war."" very well, but as soon as we raise supplies to a certain level, the Government will fix prices at a level tliat will not afford us a reasonable living."" Prices were fixed, as the Age states, but;-and this makes all the difference-the minimum, and not the maximum, prices were determined. guaranteed. of 7-id. per lb. for live weight pork and of Is. per lb. dead weight beef and mutton. The producers of the United States, therefore, are getting 4<L per lb. more than the guaranteed minimum for beef and mutton, while the price of pork there to-day is Is. 6d. per lb., or something like 6d. per lb. in excess of the guaranteed minimum for dressed weight, which works out at about Is. per lb. I wish now to compare the increase in the cost of living in various countries, ""weighted according to the proportions consumed by the working classes "" as from 31st July, 1914, to 31st July, 1917. In the United States the increase in cost of living during this period is 102 per cent.; in Canada, 60 per cent.; Sweden, 75 per cent.; Italy, 64 per cent; and in Vienna, 188 peT cent. In New Zealand there has been an increase of only 27 per cent., and in Australia an increase of 26 per cent.

995,Mr Nicholls,"Sinc e the honorableview of the fact that producers of stock have to pay for everything they use something like 400 per cent, more than they had to pay before the war? If the Labour party will support a corresponding reduction in the price of everything used on the stations and the farms of Australia, the primary producers, no doubt, will be ready to adopt the honourable member's suggestion. But why should they have to pay more for everything produced in the big cities and towns of Australia, and, on the other hand, be called upon to take less for everything they sell to the people of those cities and towns? to secure a fair profit, but I object to the middlemen mopping up the profits. poor as much as cloes any man, but I would remind honourable members that in the awards of Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards provision is always made for any increase in the cost of living. Whenever application is made to the Arbitration Courts, or to the wages tribunals, it is urged on behalf of the workers that the cost of living has gone up; and to meet that plea the Judges and magistrates have increased the rates 'of wages, so that, according to Mr Knibbs, the average weekly rate of wages for adult males has increased from 55s. Id. in 1914 to 64s. 2d. at the end of 1917an increase of over 9s. This increase largely covers the increases in the price of foodstuffs and other commodities. It must be remembered, too, that many of the workers are single men without responsibilities, as many are boys under twenty-one years of age. The recommendation of the Commissioners that prices should be fixed on the hoof might do well enough for Queensland, but would be impracticable in New South Wales and Victoria, where the conditions are different. When in Queensland some time ago, I found that the people round about were paying from $d. to Id. per acre for their land. Some were getting a square mile for a rental of £ 1 . taxation and other things, it is estimated that in Queensland £10 worth of land is needed to fatten a bullock, in New South [215] Wales about £50 worth, and in Victoria about £80 worth. How, then, could the same prices apply in all three States? There are eight or nine cuts to be got out of the carcass of beef, and cattle are marketed at various ages, and in various conditions. There are vealers, steers. well-grown bullocks, spayed cows, and old cows, which differ in value. Coming to sheep, we have lambs, tegs, two-toothed and four-toothed wethers, ewes which have never lambed, ewes which have lambed, old ewes, and so on. These differ, further, in condition and size. The Commissioners recommended tliat sheep and cattle should be sold according to weight, which was to be ascertained by an official appointed for the purpose. Clearly, the recommendation is impracticable. Members of the Opposition are continually complaining of the big men in the pastoral industry, but the figures show that most of those in that industry are small men. There are 46,344 flocks of from 100 to 500 sheep; 8,355 flocks of from 500 to 1,000 sheep; and 5,297 flocks of from 1,000 .to 2,000 sheep; so that there are 59,976 flocks containing not more than 2,000 sheep. owned by three or four persons. small men are the ""profiteers"" against whom honourable members opposite rail. There are only 6,285 flocks of over 2,000 sheep; that is, there are a little over 6,000 big men, as against about 60,000 small men. Coming to the cost of production, it must be remembered that hardly a year passes without the re-appraisement of the Crown leases, the rents of which are much higher now than they were in i913. Then, in New South Wales, the Railway Commissioners have on two occasions imposed increases of freight up to 10 per cent. The railway is largely used there for the conveyance of store stock, and must be used for the conveyance of fat stock to market. Further, the President of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court recently increased the wages of the employees in the pastoral industry by from 97 to 98 per cent. Boundarv riders, for instance, who used to get 25s. a week, are now getting 48s. and their keep. These increases imposed a burden on the",157,Chapman Wha T Was The Stock Producers Replied That Is All

I attended an important saleyard in New South Wales, and sons. I have a report before me which noticed some fine fat .bullocks sold to a appeared in the Age about six weeks ago, butcher from the town in which I reside, under the heading, ""An opulent unionist."" at the rate of 50s. per 100 lbs.

Another reason why prices have gone up so considerably is that there are too many employees in the butchers' shops. That is since the Wages Boards and such institutions have come ahout. In the same town as that to which I have already referred, namely, Blayney, where I reside, I know of the case of a young farmer who left his holding and established himself as a butcher. He was fairly supcessful; but one day the secretary of a union came and asked for his log. Having come from the bush, he said he did not know, anytbinguabout a log, but he. had his butcher's block. The union official remarked, "" I want to see the list of your employees, and the particulars of their wages and hours."" The butcher replied, "" I have only one assistant. I pay him so much, and he is idle half his time."" The official then said, "" You must have four hands in this shop.

Another reason why the price of meat is so high is that the owners of city properties take a big pericentage of a butcher's profits by way of rent.

He statesNo one knows ""how many middlemen there are between the producer and the -consumer in a' city like Hew York.

He statesThe parcel post is a marketing agency widely used for feeding the urban population without the intervention of any dealers or middlemen. Some years ago, in company with a group of American visitors, I attended a private dinner party given by a member of the Reichstag in Berlin. As we entered the dining-room our hostess pointed to the flowers upon the table, and said: "" These fresh flowers were brought this morning by the postman. Not only that, but the vegetables, eggs, butter, poultry, in fact, all of the fresh food for the dinner, came by parcel post. I buy most of my supplies in this way from a farmer .who lives many .miles out in the country. He comes to Berlin three or four times a year; he calls on all of his customers, who give him standing orders, which he fills three or four times a week. The deliveries are made in a few hours by parcel post, almost as fresh aa when they left the garden. If I .want to give a dinner party, I send him a postal card or call him on the telephone. That is the way I do my marketing."" any suggestion as to doing away with the .waste and the high cost through the consumer demanding only the best cuts and joints ? he deals with that phase.; but I havo shown sufficient to emphasize the imporitance of minimizing the Gost between consumer and producer, and of cutting out the heavy profits made by parasites who come in between them.

1020,Mr Pigott,"There has been no1917 tliere were 79,027,000 sheep in Australia. The Commission proposes that the price of these sheep shall be reduced to the extent of 4s. per head-in other words, that there shall be a reduction in their value of £15,800,000. It also recommends a reduction of £ 4 per head upon 10,500,000 cattlea further loss of £42,000,000-and a total loss to the stock-owners of Australia of £57,000,000. That does not represent fair treatment of them. The stock-owners have to submit to all sorts of privations. They are not merely the backbone, but the ballast of the country. We all know that when a ship leaves port) unless she has plenty of ballast on board she is likely to capsize during the first storm that she encounters. But with an abundant supply of ballast she can sail the seas on an even keel. In like manner the more we can encourage production, which in Australia is equivalent to ballast, the better will it be for the country, because it will enhead of cattle, and exported 18,172,575 able the ship of State to be kept upon an even keel. Either the statistics quoted by the honourable member for Calare are absolutely incorrect or the report of the Inter-State Commission is grossly inaccurate. Personally, I am prepared to accept the evidence tendered to that Commission in preference to the figures quoted by the honourable member. Between the two sets of figures there is a difference of 11,000,000 sheep. Now, it is surprising to me that such an enormous blunder should have been passed over without comment by the experts who represented the pastoralists of Australia before that Commission. mission's report, the weight of grown sheep and lambs is calculated at 52 lbs. per head. But any practical man knows, without looking at the figures at all, that even fat sheep do not average 52 lbs. that weight, but lambs do not. I am nofc prepared to say whether fat sheep and Iambs, taken together, average 52 lbs. I am inclined fco think that they do not. But, possibly, the Inter-State Commission looked upon sheep eighteen months or two years old as lambs. Commission's report it is stated that sheep to doing that. In 1916-17 the total cattle and lambs average 52 lbs. That report in Australia numbered 8,995,409, and was made by a man who is not a practical the sheep aggregated 69,371,882. It will man, and it is teeming with inaccuracies. thus be seen that there was approximately teeming with inaccuracies it is strange fchat some of the practical witnesses who appeared before the Commission did not endeavour to have those inaccuracies rectified. fche Commission's report before that report had been published? based on the evidence tendered to the Commission, and if the pastoralists allowed incorrect evidence to be submitted, they have only themselves to blame. I propose to read from the Commission's report a table, the figures of which certainly do not coincide with those quoted by the honourable member for Calare. Personally, I am of opinion that stock in New South Wales to-day is just as numerous as it was in 1913. In that year New South Wales possessed 2,815,113 lbs. of meat. During the same year its sheep numbered 39,701,384. In Victoria, in 1913, there were 1,528,553 cattle, and 12,113,682 sheep; in Queensland, 5,322,033 cattle, and 21,786,600 sheep, and in South Australia there were 352,905 cattle, and 5,073,057 sheep. In 1914-15 there were in New South Wales, 2,472,631 cattle, and 32,874,359 sheep; in Victoria there were 1,362,542 cattle, and 12,051,685 sheep; in Queensland there were 5,455,943 cattle, and 23,129,991 sheep; and in South Australia, fchere were 300,579 cattle, and 4,208,461 sheep. I come now to 1917. The reason urged forfcheincreases which have taken place in the price of beef and mutton is that the drought which occurred in 1914 caused enormous losses of stock. If it could be shown that the number of stock in Australia in 1916-17 is not equal to the number of stock in 1913-14, there would certainly be some excuse for those increases. But the figures conclusively prove that the Commonwealth is not so short of stock as the honourable member for Calare would have us believe. I find that, in 1916-17, there were 2,765,767 cattle in New South Wales. for Australia?",160,Chapman Wha T Was The Stock Producers Replied That Is All

In my judgment, the system of distribution is absolutely wrong. If we take, as an illustration, a town of 5,000 people, we will find that, as a rule, it contains about five retail butchers, whose rental charges 'are probably £2 10s. per week, and who, in addition, have to maintain a fair amount of plant, in the way of horses, carts, &c, and employ a certain number of men. All these charges have to be passed-on to the consumer. If a person orders only 1 lb. of chops, the butcher is called upon to deliver it, though he may have no other orders in that particular street.

Surely settlers 8 or 10 miles away from a township are entitled to some system of telephone comunication ? for themselves? compelled to do so. I have now to refer to a matter which affects the industrial section of my constituents. I urge the Pederal and State Governments to see that better treatment is nieted out to the industrialists of Australia. A t the Recruiting Conference, convened by the Governor General, the promise was made by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) that every union that had been de-registered as the result of the recent strike would be allowed to reregister. A couple of days since I received from the secretary of the Lithgow branch of the New South Wales Railway and Tramway Service Association a letter asking me to approach the Federal Government with the object of securing the re-registration of that body. It is stated in this letter that Mr Beeby had said that in no circumstances would that union be granted re-registration. If it is fair to allow one organization to re-register, it is only reasonable to allow every other organization which was de-registered as a result of the strike to secure restoration to its original status. Why subject one section to a disadvantage, and give to another what is regarded as a concession ? I am not prepared to say whether the Federal Government has power to do anything in this matter; but if they have, they ought certainly to take action. The members of the Railway and Tramway Service Association are just as much entitled to consideration in this respect as are other industrialists throughout Australia. Repeated applications have been made by me to the Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Wise) to reinstate the men who were dismissed some time ago from the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow. each occasion the honourable gentleman has told me that everything possible is being done to relieve distress in that town; but I can show that twenty or t h i r t y men, whose cases I have brought before the Minister, have not been reinstated. Some time ago I stated in this House that I believed there were sixty cases of victimization in connection with these dismissals. I still adhere to that statement. I hope that the Minister w ill take notice of what I have said, and do justice to these men. They did not strike, but, under his instructions, were put off, and have not been permitted to return to work. Some of them have houses for which they have only partly paid, and they are unable to meet the payments coming due, and many are married, with wives and children to support. The (production of rifles is as necessary now as it was two or three years ago, and to produce all the rifles we need these men must be employed. There seems to.be a black list which prevents them fro m getting work, because when some of them tried to get work elsewhere they were told that, although men were wanted, they could not employ those who had been working in the Small Arms Factory. debate on the meat question has. discovered so many experts, without knowledge of their subject, that I rise with diffidence to express opinions which are the result of a lifetime spent in the grazing industry. My objection to the report of the Inter-State Commissioners is that it is the report of other than practical men. During my first speech in the HouseI related an incident connected with the hearing of an arbitration case five or six years ago, in the course of which I was prompting the barrister who appeared for the pastoralists. For several weeks the w it nesses had been speaking of two-tooth, four-tooth, and six-tooth sheep, and so on, and we began to think that the learned Judge and counsel had become conversant with their manner of describing the ages of sheep; but we were astounded one morning to hear them conversing among themselves of ' ' a d u l t sheep"" and "" m i d dle-aged wethers."" The Chairman of the Inter-State Commission is a legal gentleman, whose appointment to the H i g h Court Bench some years ago raised such a howl of indignation that he declined the On position. From want of practical knowledge Be has assumed, in his report, many things contrary to facts. Let me refer briefly to one or two of his statements. On page38 of "" The Further Report on Reinvestigation,"" he saysFrom the point of view of the price which is fair to the producer, the main economic fact in the meat trade of Australia is that the Imperial contract prices pay the grower.",164,Chapman Wha T Was The Stock Producers Replied That Is All

1070,Mr Falkiner (Hume) [5.35],"Th eI am not interested in f a t stock, being a stud sheep breeder, but during the past t h i r t y years I have seen many pastoral families, some holding large and some small areas, fail, and I say that this statement cannot be accepted. What price will pay the grower depends entirely on the season. Then on page 39 we get this bright gemSimilar considerations apply to the objection that bankers and other financiers would not advance to graziers as much, particularly for the future purchase of store stock, if the value of fat stock comes down. The answer is that the requirements in the way of loan will be correspondingly less. Fancy a man spending four or five years at a University to come to that conclusion. Ifc is obvious to a schoolboy that the requirements will be correspondingly less, but the fact is ignored that advances have been made at present prices on the 11,000,000 cattle and 75,000,000 or 76,000,000 sheep which represent our stock. When the price of stock goes down, the dealer suffers a loss of income, but the man who owns breeding flocks and herds loses part of his capital, much of which has been borrowed. worse than the wealth tax. amounts to confiscation. Of course, the Commissioners could not be wrong every time. They say-It has already been pointed out that cattle, once fat, must be sent to market, and it may be added that tliere are reasons, almost amounting to positive demonstration, for the belief that killable sheep in such numbers and of such ages exist in the Commonwealth that "" holding back"" would be imprudent, even if it could be practised generally witb a view to defeating the action of the authorities. Every one with any knowledge of the pastoral industry is aware that the carrying capacity of a holding, especially of a breeding station, is limited, and that when lambs are old enough to wean, stock has to be sold to make room for the increase, less deaths and those killed. It is moonshine to talk about stock agents wiring to owners to hold back stock. The agents are all so anxious for business that if the market is up Is. per head they w ill send a "" spec "" wire advising the forwarding of stock for the next market. I never knew one to advise me to keep back stock. The Commissioners' want of practical knowledge in the dairying industry was adverted to hy the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers). This is what the report saysI t seems strange that representatives of the dairying industry should, in this inquiry, have swung so far away from the argument used with great force-indeed ; the main argument -whe n dealing with dairying, as to advocate a high price for stock so as to retain existing profits from a single "" side line"" of the industry, viz., calves. The high price of dairy stock-bot h cows and bulls-wa s universally advanced in the Farm Products Inquiry as a prime difficulty in the way of the dairyman seeking either to replenish ""his herd after the drought troubles or to maintain it at its ordinary number, in spite of normal reductions or losses. Naturally it is difficult to stock up when stock areat a high price. Dairy cows are, so.to speak, the raw material of the dairying industry, and a fall in their cost to the' dairyman would be a main advantage in the constant replacements which are necessary. The assumption is that the dairyman must always buy his stock, whereas he keeps the heifer calves of his best milkers. It is stated that calves are a side line, but if a dairyman can sell eighty poddies for. £5 each, he makes £400 out of them, the event is while from the mothers he would not make more than £8 per head, or £640. A dairyman would not consider a line F a r worse; it which brought h i m nearly half his income a side line. The report goes on to say that the grazing industry, particularly where mixed farmers and small men are concerned, was never so prosperous before, and that the losses of the drought have been overtaken. I do not think, however, that the man whose only capital is his labour is better off than he used to he, because the high cost of living affects hi m as much as it affects the consumers in the towns. The grazier, with a medium-sized holding, who escapes the very heavy Federal and State taxation, may be doing well enough. Then we get thisFigures are quoted later tending to show that the industry, viewed as a whole, has already recovered the losses of the drought year, and if meat prices are now fixed on the basis of ordinary season conditions, the position might be reviewed in the face of any calamity, such as drought, just as the railway systems frequently carry starving stock free or at reduced rates.

In the days of which I speak the banks were closing down on the pastoralists, but there was no word heard then about giving the grazier a fair price. boom occurred in the early nineties. the collapse of the land boom. It was owing to the prices for primary produce dropping so low. For example, best quality New South Wales wool was not fetching 8d. in the market. The report continuesI t must be borne in mind, too, that many carcass butchers-leadin g buyers both at sales and on stations-ar e also pastoralists. I say, witli some knowledge of the industry, that that statement is absolutely incorrect. It is not only incorrect, it is absolutely untrue. There are few carcass butchers who are also pastoralists. There never have been carcass butchers in any numbers engaged in pastoral pursuits. As regards Mr Tom Field, a carcass butcher who has been referred to, one of his stations-Willandra , in New South Wales-is becoming one of the leading stud-breeding stations in Australia, and his Northern Territory border property, Oban, is a station where they do not fatten. But they have recently taken up new country, improved it , and stocked it , and now he and his partners are finding that the war-time profits tax may wipe them out. The report proceeds with respect to the evidence of Mr R. Griffiths, who, in answering a question by the Chief Commissioner, said: "" Assuming he has got his ewes and cows already on the property, it may pay."" In other words, he says, "" Assuming that he was already stocked at low prices, it might pay."" Mr Field saysThe Imperial contract prices will pay, probusinesses, refuse to take risks. vided seasons are good and store stock can be bought at values which allow a margin for the fattener. Sir Richard Butler states, "" Under ordinary conditions the Imperial contract price is a payable one."" If there is any calling in Australia, however, where ordin a r y conditions cannot be guaranteed it is the pastoral industry. Australia can be divided into three areas as regards rainfall. One-third of the centre of Australia has a rainfall of less than 10 inches, and very often there is none. Another third has a rainfall up to 15 inches, but it is frequently T or 8 inches, as many peopleknow to their cost. Between the barren heart of Australia and the coastal country there .are no natural features to keep the constant drought in Central Australia from ebbing and flowing right through to the coast. We never know what our seasons are going to be, and that is the main reason why prices should not be fixed in the grazing industry. Mr Sidney Kidman, who owns a few million acres of the interior and some hundreds of thousands of cattle, bought in his stations when prices of cattle were low. He had worked for his living in theinterior. He knew the country well, and he put his practical knowledge to his own pecuniary advantage. I know Mr Kidman personally, and have great respect for him. He does not attempt to largely i m prove his stations, but uses them as fattening centres, and concentrates on the priceswhich he is able to obtain for his cattle. Mr Kidman may be able to sell his cattleat the Imperial prices, and find them pay him well; but not so the smaller grazierand freeholder. If there is one thing more than another that has enhanced the price of meat in the Commonwealth, it is the threat towipe out the b i g men-the capitalists. This threat has issued from every platform, from every Labour orator. make any difference? know when those threats, which are the outcome of class prejudice and hatred,, may be carried out as the Tesult of a majority of the electors putting into power the parties who have made thethreats. There are many men who, realizing these menaces against thei r I remember telling the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) one night, when we were walking home together from the House, that I expected to live to see the day when he and his colleagues would be giving to the pastoralists a bonus to go out back and grow their chops for them. When a man is regarded, not as a producer and a benefactor, but as an enemy of the country in which he has been born and reared, then one cannot wonder if he does not care to launch outwith his capital.",166,Chapman Wha T Was The Stock Producers Replied That Is All

1076,Mr Falkiner,"B e c a u s e you neverI will quote now another sweetgem from the report. AndI might say that an ordinary professional man who goes to a university and leads a narrow life does not know how little he really knows. He frequently considers that, having acquired a. certain amount of book-learning, that may he taken fbr brains. In the Letters from a Self-made Merchant to his Son, the old merchant remarks, "" Sending, some fools to college only makes them a different sort of fool from the fool, they would have heen in any case."" I do not wish to be rude to professional men, but one occasionally meets with -those who think, because they have acquired the contents of a text-book, that -that amounts to brain power. And then it is when they are appointed .to, their positions that the practical man has to suffer. On page 42 of the report there is a reference to mutton and lamb averaging 52 lb. per animal. I do not know whence the Commission got its figures, but I have handled enough sheep in. my life to be positively certain that those particulars are absolutely wrong. The average weight, especially of small sheep like those of southern Victoria, is fairly low. Australia owing to the increase of crossbreds, but the average weight is from 48 lbs. to 52 lbs., according to the season. As regards lambs, the average weight is 30 lbs. A cross bred lamb will weigh from 42 to 4o lbs. if it is well on' towards a year old ; but it is a matter of practical knowledge that, the average lamb "" goes "" about 30 lb. Yet this is one of the bases on which the reportand recommendations regarding our profits are calculated. On page 43 the Commission states'But all additional expenditure of raising stock or in salvage is amply covered by the amount of £27,600,000 over and above the incomes earned hy the aggregate flocks and herds in the normal year 1913. The Commissioners regard the expenditure as being confined to hand-feeding or the rent of land. Any man with practical knowledge knows that the land rented to save stock is not the only loss. When a.severe drought occurs, the money spent in keeping sheep alive does not at all represent the whole of the loss. Besides that, there is the death rate and the shrinkage in the wool clip. I remind experts on the other sideof the House that the more wool put on the sheep the more can be starved off. In a drought a heavily-woolled sheep which is ill-fed can easily starve off fully 40 per cent, of its wool, and the wool itself is worth only about 35 per cent, of what it would have been had the sheep been fully fed. Such factors as those, however, are ignored in the report. Here is another illustration, showing where the Commissioner lacks practical knowledge. The report states: "" A well-known breeder of stud sheep found that the demand for rams could cot be supplied."" And then the Commissioner continues with the following little jokfr"" the Iwanoff system of artificial increase of sire-power not being practised in Australia."" To show that he knows what he is talking about, the Commissioner supplies a footnote, as follows :See Davis' Impotency, Sterility, and Artificial Impregnation (1917)-'""Most of those who keep horses and jacks for breeding purposes make use of the impregnator, to permit of the impregnation of a number of females without too great a drain upon a male."" Apparently the Commissioner wishes breeders to run around with an artificial It may be increasing throughout impregnator, chasing a flock of 20,000 or 30,000 stud ewes. It would be abso*lutely ludicrous, if it were not all part of the opinion upon which is based the intention of robbing the graziers of Australia of millions of pounds. I do not know who was the stud-breeder indicated by the Commissioner; but, having controlled the largest ram-breeding station in Australia, and possibly in the world, T, hold that I am in a position to state the reason why the demand for rams could not be supplied. It was entirely due to the maggot-fly trouble. There are many rams bred to-day, perhaps more than ever before in Australia, and there are more breeders. But the shortage, in merino rams particularly, was entirely due to the ravages of the blow-fly in the northern portion of New South Wales and in Queensland. With a view to showing how little the Commissioner assimilated the evidence which was put before him, I may mention that he talks about speculation inflating prices. The position is that in the case of breeding sheep there are dealers. If a man thinks that my necessity compels me to sell store stock at a low price, he w ill buy it from me. But for f a t stock there is no market. The man who owns f a t stock knows exactly what it is worth, and there is thus no margin lef t for the speculator. Under the heading of "" Demand for Stock,"" the Commissioner, upon page 47 of his report, saysBut it is important to remember that "" demand "" for stock in relation to "" supply "" canus that the total number of sheep owned not be limited to demand for meat purposes only. The demand for breeding and stocking up, for fattening, for wool, and for dairying are all factors, the potency of which has been greatly heightened by the special incentives already mentioned. There he is quite right, and in this consheep is usually to be found in the arid nexion I would point out that in 1891-2 districts, and in every case he is a breeder. when we had 102,000,000 sheep in AusI n New South Wales there are only two tralia, low prices ruled because we could stations, at the present time carrying not sell the surplus.

The Commissioner further saysAssuming normal seasonal conditions, thc carrying capacity of the grazing land now occubeing allowed to run about in these dispied in the Commonwealth has been nearly reached. That is utter folly. nearly reached, nor will it be nearly reached for years. If the pastoral Boards of New South Wales will only make the farmers and pastoralists destroy rabbits, I am quite sure thafc Australia will be able to carry 100,000.000 sheep and more, just as she did as far back as 1891. Further, if ii/r. Falkiner. there be no interference with the industry, the prices which are now ruling for stock may tempt some adventurous spirits, like Mr Field, to stock up country in Queensland which hitherto has been unoccupied. The honourable member for Calare quoted statistics relating to the number of flocks of sheep that there are in the Commonwealth. He did not tell by these flock-owners with under 5,000 was 34,000,000. That is to say, these flocks constitute 45 per ^cent. of the sheep of Australia. It is the owners of these small flocks whogo in principally for fattening sheep. The pastoralist who has 100,000M f .

1077,Mr Austin Chapman,"The poor pasin Australia absolutely without profit during a drought merely in order to keep the sheep alive. One witness before the Inter-State Commission affirmed that 34,000,000 sheep to-day cut as much wool as did 60,000,000 sheep a few years ago. That statement is entirely wrong. But the fact that sheep do cut more wool today, and that the wool is of a higher quality, is'entirely due to the intelligence or two in -regard to Papua. Many exercised by the pastoralists themselves. Surely honourable members opposite do not wish to take away from the pastoralists something which they have secured, not out of labour, bnt as th© result of their own ability. sheep up to producing more wool, and wool of a better quality? would remind the Committee that the ordinary wool-grower, whether he be in a large or small way, does consider the consumer iu our cities in that nearly every country constituency returns a Protectionist member to this Parliament. As a result, we pay more for everything that we use than we otherwise would do. In fact, I sometimes think that the only things for which we do not pay are the air that we breathe and the water that we drink. All the wool which is consumed by the city dweller represents an entirely negligible quantity. As a matter of fact, we are solely dependent on Great Britain in the matter of the disposal of our wool clip. Just here, I would like to mention what the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) overlooked when he was speaking the other day, namely, that, the thanks of Australia, and certainly of this Parliament, are due to Great Britain for the generosity she has exhibited, not merely in purchasing our wool, but in purchasing and paying for it in the full knowledge that she cannot obtain delivery of it. to thank her more than anybody else. give my thanks in the proper quarter, as one of those individuals who believe that our wool industry is the principal financial factor in the prosperity of Australia. I think that the Ministry will be ill-advised if they fix the prices of meat. I have already said that their action will not affect me personally, because I am not a grower of fat sheep. I do not know how far the fixing of prices will reduce the capital value of stock, but if it has that effect to. any appreciable extent, there is a possibility that the grazier will be able to give more for live stock than can the fat stock butcher, and thus the consumers in our cities will suffer. Before concluding, I wish to say a word Australian .companies have a large amount of money invested there, and they are confronted with one or two difficulties which, I think, the Minister( Mr Glynn) might be able to help, in a large measure, to overcome. I refer to the labour conditions. Under the Papuan labour ordinance, tlie native boys are paid for the full contract time whether they work or ThenI not, and, though the Administrator has power to deal with them, this does not cultivate the plantations. I think the ordinance might be altered so as to provide that the boys should be paid only for the days upon which they work. I point out, also, that in all tropical countries women are, allowed to work on plantations, and it appears to me quite reasonable that when a native hoy is engaged tapping rubber trees, which is very light occupation, his wife should be allowed to accompany him, and be also allowed to work. the effect tliat they do not care to leave the villages. have is that the boys are taken away from their wives, and, naturally, after they bad been absent for a week or two, they desire to return, and so they clear out. allowed to work, the result will he the breaking up of the communal settlements. to bring this matter under the notice of the Minister, in order that an investigation might be made. into the matter, and, in most cases, the trouble is believed to be due to the'treatment of the men. thing a'bout the matter personally, and. as I said, I was only asked to bring it under the notice of the Minister.

1087,Mr Falkiner,"I do not know anylocal manufacturers, who, if they put their heads together, can pay what they like. reciprocity agreements in order to deal with that matter. I received a de-putation on the subject seven or eight months ago. when the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Wallace) was speaking, he mentioned that in Sydney they were loading single-dumped bales on the ships, and as a member of the Central Wool Committee I know an instruction was issued that, in order to save space and bauds, the' wool was to be double-dumped except for a small percentage which would go into the corners. Since then I have made some inquiries to see whether I or he was right, and, while I do not know for certain whether the bales on the Rajah were double-dumped or. not, it is possible that the honourable member's statement was quite correct. -On a vital matter such as that which has been before the Committee this afternoon ib is essential that if our party, consisting as it does of two groups, is to remain a National party in the truest sense, the consideration of such questions as this should be approached from the consumers' as well as the producers' stand-point. It seems to me that this phase has largely been lost sight of during the debate. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 8 p.m. Falkiner) has given some very valuable information; regarding the pastoral industry, but we cannot get away from the fact that prices have increased enormously in Australia during the last year or two, and, in my judgment, this advance has not been warranted by all the circumstances nf the case. One effect of this policy of price, fixing is that there is a tendency for a gamble in certain commodities in general use nob affected by regulations. I have in mind one or two articles in regard to which a certain substantial amount of gambling is going on at the present time. ber propose to say what they are ? is desirable to make any public statement at the present time, but I shall be prepared to supply the information privately to the Minister.. I do not think that 'there is any desire on the part of the great bulk of the people to do in j u r y to the great pastoral interests of this I have drawn up certain country. I am not going to say, however, that there is not a small section of the industrialists who do not carea "" h a n g "" for the squatters or anybody else, and who would be perfectly willing to ruin the country in order to give effect to their T h is afternoon, mad schemes; but the great majority, of the workers have no desire to injurethe pastoral interests in any way. That l n dubtry, like any. other business, must be prepared to defend itself on the facts of the case. Looking into the future a little, I am inclined to think that this midsummer madness will soon pass aiway. In regard to the question of price-fixing, I maintain that this Government and this Parliament, if they have any selfrespect, must do something. Government. may make w ill be for the purpose of strengthening the hands of the Government, not, however, that I suggest any lack of sincerity on the part of the M i nistry. What are the facts as far as we can gather their. ? The honourable member for Hume has stated the position of those engaged in the stock-raising industry, and I have no doubt that there is a great amount of truth in what he has said. But the position must be looked at 'from more than one angle, if we are to be guided by the whole of the facts -, supplied to usis certainly valuable, but so diffuse that we find it difficult to reach the kernel of it . We have received a number of reports in regard to the question of meat, and I am afraid that we are liable, in the abundance of the information supplied, to lose sight of some of the chief points. In the fourth report of the Inter-State Commission it is stated on page 22 that the retail prices of meat in Sydney before the war and in March, 1917, show the following striking advances in main lines of consumption:Sirloin, 6.75d. to 10.89d -6 1 per cent. I do not think it Leg of mutton, 4.95d'. to 8:35d -6 8 per cent.

1095,Mr Arciiibald,"The informationThe honourable member for Hume( Mr in stock, indulge in dealing. They are Falkiner), and those who share his views, will probably seek to explain away these Very big increases of 61 per cent, and 68 per cent, by referring to the drought. That explanation, however, will not account for the rises. The Inter-State Commission points out on the same page of the report to which I . have just referred that the figures as to loss of stock in the 1914-15 drought show that in New South Wales sheep diminished by 18.144 per cent, and cattle by 14.742 per cent. In Victoria the corresponding figures are 12.944 per cent, and 31.726 per cent The percentage of loss in Victoria in the case of cattle was more than double that in New South Wales. Victoria ia, to begin with, far less self-providing in the matter of beef than New South Wales. It might therefore have been supposed that with a lower proportion 'of beef stock to population, and with a higher rate of loss due to droughty the Mel-, bourne beef price would have risen higher than the Sydney beef price. The figures show the opposite result. MelbourneJuly, 1914Sirloin, 7.20d. March, 19179.90d. SydneyJuly, 1914-C.75d . March, 1.917-10.89d . In other words, Melbourne started the drought id. per lb. in advance of Sydney, suffered greater losses during the drought, and yet, after it was over, obtained beef Id. per lb. cheaper than Sydney. The increases in the prices of beef and mutton in Victoria are somewhat similar to those which have taken place in my own State. How are these increases to be explained? Clearly, as the figures I have just quoted show, the drought will not account for them. It is imperative that we should endeavour to discover the cause. Our friends of the pastoral and grazing industry warn us that we must not attempt to fix the price of meat, since to do so would be to nun that industry. I would ask them whether the industry was ruined when no better prices could be obtained than those which prevailed before these increases took place? must admit that all other prices have gone up in proportion. so much about that; let us look at things as they are. The reports of the InterState Commission show that the graziers, the butchers, and, in fact, all interested all "" jobbing"" on the market. Where we find buyers playing also the part of sellers, where we have all-round speculating, the only result can be the forcing up of the market. There can be no doubt that that sort of thing has been going on. These people may imagine that speculation in time of war is quite justifiable; but I shall say nothing as to that, since we have to take human nature as it is. dealing with fat stock, but mostly with stores. and "" stores "" before these increases took place, but we did not have the market phenomena of to-day.. We know that, of recent years, many stations have changed hands, and that it is possible for stationowners to regulate the market by holding back stock. is. When the grazier, the butcher-the buyer aud the seller-ar e all engaged in dealing, the market must go up. Who is going to pull it down? To whose interest would it be in sueh circumstances to beat down the market? Complaint has been made that some of the butchers are making enormous profits. In the large cities in my own State the number of butchers' shops has decreased since the war. Many butchers have been driven out of the trade; their businesses have ceased to pay. When there is a general forcing up of the price of' any particular commodity, public clamour must naturally take place, and I think it is our duty to look at the effect of these increases upon thc great masses of the community. I think there is a means of solving this problem. The Labour party constantly complain about the War Precautions Act and the regulations framed under it ; but, as I told them recently, six months after the war is over they will be very sorry that we are not still subject to such regulations. war over while profits are to be made out of it. member is not talking common sense. ment to make.",171,Chapman Wha T Was The Stock Producers Replied That Is All

AU classes should strive to understand each other, and to pull together for the public good. The public interest must predominate over private interests, and we must strive to remove elass hatred. If this Parliament is worthy of its salt, it should take action in this matter. We have had placed before us figures as to the increase in the price of meat which cannot be controverted. In fixing prices, I think the Government would be well advised in having regard to the London parity. It certainly pays the Australian pastoralist to sell his beef and mutton to the British Government, and .the basis of the contract made with tlie British Government should supply a good foundation for us to work upon. Regard must be had, of course, to local circumstances. More stock is raised in Victoria than in South Australia, where we depend on Queensland for our supplies of beef, and in fixing prices care must be taken to make it worthwhile for Queensland stock-owners to continue to supply the wants of my State. The usual practice is for stock to be driven to Farina and trucked thence to Adelaide. The additional cost thus incurred must be allowed for in fixing the prices for South Australia. We must not lose sight of the business aspect of these matters. I think that some like provision will have to be made in regard to the prices fixed for Victoria, in order to make it worthwhile for stock-owners in New South Wales and Queensland to send stock down here. The attitude of the wonderful Industrial Workers of the World-alia s Labour -Governmen t of _ Queensland has been responsible, amongst other things, for the position in regard to the meat supply of South Australia. The Queensland Labour Government has shown its want of a truly Federal spirit by prohibiting the sending of stock from that State to South Australia. If that sort of thing represents the high-water mark of such Labour Administrations, then the less we have of them the better. Their a lot of actions may have benefited the citizens of their own State, but they have not benefited the people of Australia at large. I recognise that the Government must fix the retail prices of meat, though there will be difficulty in doing that. It will be necessary to fix two sets of prices. Not to do so would considerably disturb the trade. If certain persons are willing to pay high prices, let them do so; this is a free country; but we must protect those who have no money to throw away. ' No sound principle for the fixing of prices has yet been enunciated. I have always held that in dealing with economic problems you must be guided, not by fine-spun theories, but by facts. The only political economists worth readingI would not waste half-an-hour on the others-ar e Thorold Rogers and Sir Leo Chiozza Money. Rogers' book, The EconomicI n terpretation of History, is a very valuable one, because no one can understand economic problems without an economic interpretation of history. Sir Leo Chiozza Money also deals with facts, not merely with theories. Rogers contends that to arrive at a determination regarding values you must take their variations during a decade. The average price of meat throughout a decade would provide a scientific basis for our price fixing. So with land values. Never was there a country in which the laws of average might so well be applied as in Australia. The troubles of the pastoralists are due chiefly to droughts, yet there are not droughts every year. If there were, there would be an end of the industry. There are good seasons and bad seasons. Many squatters have made princely fortunes. were fools, who did not know when to buy in. The honourable inember for Hume( Mr Falkiner) mentioned one or two gentlemen who would not buy in at the wrong time. In a country like this, where seasonal changes are so great, the law of averages must be invoked to obtain a scientific basis for any economical proposal. HadI the time and material, I would have no difficulty in working out a scientific basis for the prices of meat, and Government officials should be able to do this with a regard for the fact3 which sliould satisfy every one.",172,Chapman Wha T Was The Stock Producers Replied That Is All

""When a -witness is being examined before a Commission, he does not tell all that he knows, and unless the examiners are exceptionally smart, they will not put the right questions to him. Why should he give away all his business knowledge ? Besides, you must take a pinch of salt with a lot of evidence. But you cannot get away from historical facts. We have been told that the fixing of prices will ruin people. No doubt some persons will get a good bump. I do not know that we should consider them. Their speculation has heen forcing the market up in war time. There has been nothing particularly wicked in what they have done. They are merely smart business men who are ""out to make money, and they should have foreseen that the Government might step in to protect the interests of the people during this crisis. From what I heard not many weeks ago, I gathered that the grazing industry desires to compensate itself for the heavy taxation imposed on it in consequence of the war. That the Government should prevent. up the price of meat? what individual graziers have done. All I know is that those who are interested in selling will try to push up the market, just as those who are interested in buying will try to keep it down. People in business are out to make money. I recognise that while Parliament exists for talking, the Government exists for the administration of the public affairs, and when parliamentary talk is interfering with proper administration it should cease. member fix the price of speeches? are not worth any price at ali. The honourable member for Calare( Mr ried, after four, five, or six years. And Pigott), who has exercised his right of speech, wishes me to read the following telegram which he has received from Mr ment to look into the whole matter. It Hall, the Attorney-General of New South WalesYour wire Finlayson's statement that I apintended. We do not want to do any one proached German internees either directly or indirectly absolutely without foundation. Apparently, as is often the case, some old woman of the male sex has made a disclosure, and a rush has been made to fire it off in Parliament, and get it recorded in Hansard, the proper receptacle for such double-distilled trash. A great deal could be said in contradiction of the statements of the Opposition, but, no doubt, other opportunities will be afforded for that. I do not often air grievances in Parliament, because I can generally get them remedied by personal representation to Ministers. I wish, however, to speak of the interpretation that is being put upon a regulation regarding long-service leave. After twenty years, a public servant is entitled to six months' leave of absence on full pay, and Avhen female public' servants leave the Service to get married, they are entitled in lieu of this leave to a certain sum for every year of service. I have always held, and I believe it to be the general opinion of the Service, that after a second period of twenty years the public servant is entitled to a further six months' leave on full pay. But the Government have left the position vague by saying that, on application being made to him, the Public Service Commissioner may advise the Governor General to grant them leave. I do hot know that anybody has ever got it upon those terms. Suppose a man has been in the Public Service for thirty years. His ability to enjoy his furlough depends very largely upon his financial status when it is due. , If he has been handicapped by sickness in his family, as in more than one case that I haye in mind, he is not financially able to enjoy his leave as he would desire, and in many instances public servants decide not to take their furlough. What is the good of their wandering about the place, looking into the shop windows? If we are to admit the principle in the abstract, it should be widely applied. A young woman should be entitled to benefit when she has retired from the Service to be marthe principle should be recognised in the case of a man who has gone beyond his twenty years of service.

I w ill take the opportunity to tell Mr Hall,, with whom I hold a somewhat close personal friendship, the exact quotation from the letter; and I shall give h i m a chance The statement to deny it to the man himself. I desire to preface my remarks at this stage by a brief reference to certain statements which I made this morning w i th respect to the stowing of wool on ships by wharf labourers in Sydney. In the course of my earlier speech to-day the honourable member for Hume( Mr. Falkiner) entered into a controversy with me as to the way in which wool was carried oh board those vessels. I am whose aupleased to hear now that the honorable member has been informed from a reliable authority of source that to a certain extent he was wrong. On my part, I also admit, from another reliable source, that I , too, toW h a t is his name ? some extent, was wrong. The fact is, as an official of the Waterside WorkersUnion stated to me to-day, the Katoomba was the last vessel loaded here with wool. few single bales were taken. On the boatin question, namely, the Bajah, at the explanation is time when the Sydney wharf labourerswere working upon her the bales were all singles; she was taking them in at that stage to finish off her load. The practiceis to carry the wool in double bales, and not cut, so that the wool shall not occupy W ill you give Mr too much space upon the railways at itsdestination. Upon this matter, therefore,, I certainly shall do the honourable member for Hume and myself are both right and both 'wrong. I desire briefly now to refer to the profiteering which is going on in our midst. Honourable members have been discussing beef for the ,past two days. But not only in respect to beef are consumers being exploited. The same holds good with pracD o you mean to say tically every commodity that we eat, and everything we wear, from our head to our feet, besides everything with which we furnish our homes.

1163,Mr Wallace,"I am allowing themto it . In regard to boots, I intend reading an extract from the Sydney Daily Telegraph. Doubtless it will appear in the Inter-State Commission's report, but in view of the large quantity of matter which has been put into Hansardi n connection with profiteering, I think that this extract should also be placed in our official record. The extract readsBOOT BUYING. I x SUBURBS AND CITY. "" It seems from your prices generally that in 1917-18 there is a much bigger gap between the cost price and selling price, and a bigger dington, KC., to Mr Joe Gardiner during the inquiry of the Inter-State Commission yesterday into the question of regulating the prices of footwear. ""How is that?"" he continued. ""Because you get what you can?"" "" Reasonably,"" answered witness. "" To a large extent, prices are controlled by competition."" The Commissioner examined a specific case. A boot in 1916 cost 13s. 9d., and 4s. was added to make the selling price. In 1917 the cost went up Is. 3d., but instead of 4s. being added to make the selling price, 7s. 6d. was added. ""Why was that?"" asked the Commissioner. Witness could give no specific reason for it. A lady's high-grade boot was exhibited. That would be sold at a price about 3s. higher in the city than the suburbs, witness said. The Commissioner -I s the moral "" Shop in the suburbs ""? Witness -Not necessarily. In the city shop expenses are higher. A dilapidated pump sole shoe waa produced by Mr Kleinsmith (representative of People's Food Protection Association). Holes had been worn in tbe sole after nine weeks' use; the heel (top of which was made of pulp) had become detached. In the boot was also a cardboard shank: said that as long as there were three layers of leather on tlie lower portion of the heel of such a shoe, it was all right to have a pulp composition top. ""They might have had only nine weeks' wear,"" witness said, "" but the person who used them might have walked up mountains or through pools."" thing to brand that boot, so as to indicate its composition ? WitnessI see no reason why it should not bo done. I think that in Victoria recently an Act was passed enforcing the mention of the cardboard in a heel. Witness discussed witb the Commissioner his evidence of .previous days. Mr Piddington replied: "" So far as we are concerned, the only shop of yours that has the ' Bostock' announcement very freely spread out in its windows is the Boss Pitt shop."" The Boss Pitt is supposed to be an excelpeople. I regret very much that Parlent boot, equal to the imported article, liament seems determined to go into recess and it is sold at the price of an imported hoot; that is to say, the cost of trans-' port from the other side of the world is added to the cost of manufacture, and the consumer has to pay. This is not playing the game with the community as a whole, in view of the fact that Arbitration Courts have been established to regulate conditions. If price-fixing generally is adopted, it will be necessary, of course, to have more inspectors to see that the regulations are enforced, otherwise they will be evaded. A pair of glace kid boots with good leather in them, costing from 23s. to 2'4s., will give better wear than a pair of Blucher boots at 7s. 6d., because in the latter boot the leather is of inferior quality, and except for very rough usage, will not stand the same wear as the glace kid article. If it is necessary-and this is conceded-that we should wear clothes, it is preferable that we should wear the best obtainable within a reasonable range of prices. An undershirt at oz. 6d. to 4s. 6d. will not give anything like the same wear, or be as comfortable as a similar article at 12s. 6d. or 13s. 6d., and I say that if we are going to control the prices of commodities, we should eliminate the rubbish and fix fair prices for articles of good standard value. That is what is required. I do not believe in shoddy goods, for any person. Because there are certain class distinctions in our social system, I do not believe that the navvy should not wear a pair of decent boots or a tailor-made suit of clothes, though I remember a few years Regarding the composition, witness ago, when three or four of us came ashore from a ship looking quite as respectable as the ofiicers, the latter made comments, and said we were dressing above our means. I suppose some honourable members opposite even to-day think that of the working classes. I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( MT . Archibald) that the present time is an excellent 'opportunity for the Government to do something. They have been in office for about thirteen months, and as far as winning the war is concerned, I do not think they have done very much, so it is up to them to make a name for themselves by taking measures to prevent exploitation of the",177,Lamond A Slander Is Most Of The Bales Were Doubles Only A
1164,"Percentage Gap Than In 1916,"" Said Mr Pid",,178,Margins Between Pkices
1165,Mr Kleinsmith,"Would it not be a fairat a time when all these reports by the several Commissions are about due. The representatives, of the people should have an. opportunity of discussing all the Government proposals in their various aspects-. I think these reports are of more interest to the people even than winning the war, because if the people are hungry and cannot get the necessaries of life they cannot be expected to have much interest in. a war 16,000 miles away. A little while ago the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) seemed to doubt very much the credibility of statements I made with regard to General Smuts, so I refer the honourable member to the files of any of the daily papers of Monday,' 2.0th May, 1918, containing quotations from a speech delivered by General Smuts: The honourable member, I believe; quoted utterances by General Smuts in May of last year, but we must remember that in the course of twelve months the leaders of the Empire, including even Mr Lloyd George, are found thinking along somewhat different, lines. The following paragraph appeared in Stead's Review on 1st June:"" Damnable Nonsense! """" We used to talk a lot of nonsense about defeating the Bosch, but brother Bosch has come, and knocks this kind of damnable nonsense out of us."" The speech in which the above sentence occurred was, in many ways, a most remarkable one. Delivered by the only military member of the Supreme War Cabinet, it carries especial weight. General Smuts went on: "" The enemy will come within an ace of victory, but will not secure it, because their cause is wrong. The situation will be most anxious for many days to come; but, even if the last British soltended to check the onslaught of predatory indier were driven out of France, the Germans would still not have won, because they must win both on sea and land. I do not believe that an out-and-out victory is possible for any group of nations. I consider that we have fought through to a stage when the enemy is now ready to consider and concede terms."" It will be seen that General Smuts has altered his 'opinion somewhat in respect of war conditions; and if I might be par-, doned for saying so, he has come round to our way of thinking. We were laughed at twelve months ago, and the peace proposals which emanated from the New South Wales Conference last year were ridiculed, biit since then similar views have been expounded by Mr Lloyd George, by President Wilson, by Count Mr Wallace. Czernin, and, in fact, by the leaders of thought in the countries of our Allies and enemies alike. The honourable member also alluded to Mr Samuel Gompers, who apparently must be regarded as sacrosanct, because his attitude appeared to be in conformity with views of honourable members opposite. But I remind him that Mr Gompers is not the satisfied individual he is-believed to be. tioned him. ning to get off. the handle a little, and if they do not lookout there will be occurrences in America similar to those experienced in Australia. Let me quote what Mr Gompers said recently in an article : written by him for the American Federationist of 19 th FebruaryAnother aggressive has been begun in. the campaign against protected humanitarian legislation known as labour laws. Profiteers have not changed their methods and purposes because of the war. On the contrary, their greed and consciencelessncss become -more conspicuous as they take advantage of the nation's necessity, and endanger those who are risking their livesin the nation's defence. . . . It devolves upon the labour movements of the various States to carry out this proposed programmewithin their own boundary. Alert, intelligent activity is necessary to guard the interests of the workers in the various States. Already in several States efforts are under way to create the impression that tbere is a need for suspending labour legislation. Several of these efforts have tried to misconstrue the declaration of the Council of National Defence into a statement that suspension of labour laws is necessary in furtherance of national needs. The intention of the Council of National Defence is'diametrically opposite. It was interests and profiteers. Labour everywhere should guard vigilantly against the attack on. labour laws and standards. Everything for our beloved Republic! Nothing for private profiteering! It must be apparent to honourable members that what occurred in Australia is occurring in America. They must admit that, so far as the Labour movement in Australia is concerned, the greatest militarist could not have taken exception to the attitude of the Labour movement at the commencement of this war. Supporters of the Labour party rallied round the flag in their thousands to fight overseas in defence of their ideals.",178,Margins Between Pkices
1166,Mr Hectob Lamond,I never men,179,Margins Between Pkices
1167,Mr Wallace,"Gompers is beginment while it was in power did its best to win the war. are as well aware of that fact as we are. As the war progressed, Labour discovered that the ideals for which it had so long, stood were being undermined, and that, as the result of profiteering, the cost of living was so increased as to have the effect of bringing down wages. No doubt, the same sort of thing is occurring in America. The workers of America doubtless entered the war as we did, but many strikes have since occurred there, and more, no doubt, w ill take place before the termination of the war. If profiteering is continued in the TJnited States, and an endeavour is made, as in other countries, to make fortunes out of the war, the state of affairs that has arisen here will be repeated there. pers will, no doubt, be regarded as a false god. I trust that the Government will reconsider their decision thab the Parliament shall go immediately into recess. If it is necessary that they should have time to prepare their financial measures, t h m let us adjourn, but not for more than a fortnight. I am anxious, like others, to assist the Government in fixing the price of meat, and to take other steps to comv bat the high cost of living. I shall be very dissatisfied if Parliament goes at once into recess, and the control of our industries is carried on by means of regulations under the War Precautions Act. Last February, when we went into recess, Lt was decided by the Government that the price of .meat should be fixed. Nothing, however, has yet been done. Supporters of the Government who are interested in the cattle industry were prepared last February to unload at .any price. Finding, however, that the Government were standing by them in their resistance of the price-fixing proposal, they proceeded to speculate once more, but since they believe that the Government now intend to take action they are anxious to gain time in which to unload. Brother Pigott and others are looking very down in the mouth. for Calare( Mr Pigott) put up a great fight this afternoon. on the fight he put up in defence of the And the Labour Governinterests he represents. I should be well satisfied if I could do as well for fche interests that I represent. I trustT h e people outside that the Government will at once deal with this question of price fixing. Something should be done immediately to curtail the upward tendency of prices. It is impossible for a man to maintain his wife and family on £ 3 per week, having regard to the present high cost of living, and if an attempt is not made to check the soaring of prices, there will be aneffort to increase wages, with the result that we shall have, perhaps, just such another industrial upheaval as we had last year. desire, first of all, to refer to the quotation made by the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Finlayson) from a letter that he produced. letterI find that my name is mentioned twice in it .

Ifc .astated in this letter thatKelly, Orchard, Sinclair were here, hut not' inside. Attorney-General Hall was here thetime of. the strike, to get scabs. . . . That is the portion which the honorable member read in reference fco myself. I desire to deny that I ever visited the concentration camp in company with any of the honourable members named. It is rather unfortunate that the honourable member should have quoted from thisletter. I do not say that I have never visited the camp.

In some quarters we are told that this is a sordid trade war, the intention being, of course, to dishearten the working classes, to lead them to say, "" What have we to do with the bloated capitalist? Why should we fight to keep the war going for his benefit ?"" Some very fine work is being done in that direction.

If we have unity we shall conquer, but divided we shall f a l l . Our enemies know that only too well, and, consequently, they are busily engaged in a propaganda designed to divide us.

To use a sporting phrase, the object is to make our people ' ' sky the towel."" member deny the accuracy of the treaty in question ? ber himself did not prove it . We know that Germany got in some very fine work in Russia. The enemy not only betrayed the. Russian nation, but attempted by the distribution of either concocted or genuine treaties to betray other nations as well. Whether these documents are true or not, this is no time for us to fight amongst ourselves about such matters. We should fight with every ounce of power to down our enemies, after which we shall be able to fight out our own little differences. know the truth? times can be couched in language which, in war time more particularly, it would be better not to employ. Especially is this so in respect of half truths. In regard to this matter, I wish to make a quotation from an article in the Nineteenth Genlwy and After, by George Makgill, Bart This 'brings us finally to the social side of the German preparations for war. Since the notorious Stieber combined in himself the part of Socialist, secret police agent, and Kaiser's spy _ on the police, Germany has undoubtedly utilized the Socialist and similar movements to undermine other nations. . It was Stieber who, as the founder of the German spy system, first devised this method, and under his successors the Socialist machine has been in great measure directed from Germany. Lanoir has shown, too, that the Syndicalist movement in France was originated in France with German secret service money, in order to weaken the Republic. He also has shown that in France candidates of the International Revolutionary party were in the pay of Germany, and he quotes Stieber's Memoirs to prove that a subsidy was granted by Germany ""to every parWhat we want is liamentary candidate in France or elsewhere (my italics) who supports a policy useful to that of tlie Empire."" We all remember the election of Tribitch Lincoln, the spy, to a British constituency! Recent events have proved that the revolutionary movement in Russia has been precipitated by the paid spy, Rasputin. Still more recently, the German agents, Lenin and Trotsky, have brought about the Bolshevik reign of anarchy and terror, which has laid Russia helpless at the feet of Germany. It is known that the dangerous anarchist movement known as the I.W.W. (Independent Workers of the World) is directed and financed from Germany, and both in Australia and the TJnited States its agents have been arrested and the society proclaimed illegal-this by the two most democratic countries in the world. honourable It is noteworthy that during recent years the Socialist, Syndicalist, and Anarchist movements have, with one accord, taken a single ""pacifist"" turn; and if we analyze the ""pacifist "" catchwords and 'policy we find that they have their origin in Germany. As we have seen, "" the freedom of the seas"" appeared as a German demand in the propaganda of the Anglo German Conciliation Committee in 1912. j In 1915 the phrase was used in Casement's rebel pamphlet disseminated in Ireland in September of that year. The appearance of this pamphlet was to have been the signal for tbe rising: but, owing to a miscarriage of plans, the rebellion was postponed until the following Easter. The formula adopted by Lenin and the Bolshevists of Bussia, "" no annexations,"" I find in a leaflet issued by the Labour press in 1915. headed ""An appeal to women-make way for peace."" Underlined are these words: ""No annexation, no humiliating conditions of",180,Margins Between Pkices

Surely these facts should convince those who still assert that the "" pacifist"" movement here has nothing to do with Germany, that the agitators do not always know what hand is directing tlieir efforts, and in whose interests they are really working. * The whole article is worth perusing.

We shall directed to the pric.es of things that are never again see the prices that ruled a produced locally, and the cost of imfew. years ago. Various things are reported commodities has grown almost too sponsible for this, the chief among them heavy to be borne. I am surprised at the being the land taxation measures of my new-born zeal for price-fixing shown by honourable friends opposite, which have our Labour friends. In 19.15, there was burst up the large estates in Victoria and in power a Labour Government with a New South Wales, and in the agricultural solid following. had some of its followers had any sense. have had the whole of the then Opposition just earnings? No. behind it, too, because we were supporting every measure proposed for the prosecution of the war, swallowing principles that we had advocated for years in order that there might be no division between political parties. That Labour Governcheaply you must have large estates. You ment appointed a commission to fix prices, could not afford to employ two or three which did some good work. It fixed the men to look after a few hundred head of price of bread at @id. for the double loaf cattle. The Queensland growers would over the counter, a price which has not been altered. A sectional committee investigated the prices of beef, with a view to making a recommendation, and the Commission advised the Government to at the price then ruling, any increase to be subject to inquiry, and to declare everything a necessary commodity, to allow of the general fixing of prices. That was the shortest cut to take to prevent exploitation. Before the price of any commodity could be fixed, it had to be declared a necessary commodity.

I have been assured by growers that if the people of Melbourne or of amy other part of Australia wished, they would supply beef at that parity, that is,, for about 40s. or 4'2s. per cwt. on the hoof in Queensland. In addition, there would he the cost of droving the cattle to Melbourne, aboiVfc £5 per head, or of sending them by rail, which would be more.

Government of Australia is for the people, whether ifc be a State or Federal authority in question, and, if some arrangement cannot be agreed upon between the State railway authorities and the. Federal Postal Department as to the carriage of mails by rail, there will have to be a change of Government, one way or the other. It is ridiculous to present an answer such as did the Postmaster-General when 1 asked him on the 16th MayWhether the practice of making up small In Queensland for the past ten or eleven parcels of malls for transmission from one railyears, at least, it has been the practice to way station to another has been abandoned, and whether it has been determined that all send small packages of mail matter mails shall be forwarded by train to some merely made up in an envelope, given central clearing office where they are to be reto the guard, and handed out at the distributed over lines along which they have station to which it was addressed. That already travelled. The Minister( Mr Webster) in hi3 Tealong the whole of a line are sent to one ply statedIt is a fact that an effort has been madeto they are sent back along the line to the get rid of the superfluous exchange of mails. individual oflices.. That applies' to the Mr Sinclair. This does not involve any unnecessary inconvenience to the public, since other facilities are provided. It is not tbe rule, nor is it expected, that mails shall be conveyedfrom post-office to post-office by a complete system of exchanges. As a matter of fact, that could not be done. 1 am sorry the Minister was not more frank with me, and that he did not exactly state the reason. To say that ""it could not be done is absurd, because it has been done in my district for years, until quite recently. The Minister was merely trying to parry my question. I placed the matter before the Deputy PostmasterAdverting to your recent representations recomplaints mad'e to you respecting the despatch of mail matter posted at small stae to inform you that the Department's practice generally has been to aibolish only exWhenj all the occasioned by despatching such correspondence amount of mail matter very small. On branch lines where trains do not run daily these exchanges hare not been curtailed; and on themain line, whenever the T.P.O. is not running* the mails between intermediate offices The are exchanged by the next available train. Wherever it is found that curtailment would cause undue inconvenience to the public, e.g., where orders for meat or other perishable necessaries of life have to be obtained from the nearest tradesmen, no alteration bas been made. It is considered, no hardship has. been inflicted by the action taken by the Department, which action, on the other hand, has effected a considerable saving. Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) H. B. TEMP-LETON, Deputy Postmaster-General. has been discontinued, and the mails clearing office; then, often, the next day, whole of the lines throughout m y district, and, I suppose, throughout Australia. source the reason why this is done, and I cannot understand why the Postmaster General did not tell the House why it was necessary to adopt the new method. I have been given to understand on good authority that the'rate for the carriage of mails as between the State and Federal Governments was disputed some time ago. The subject came before the Inter-State Commission. body it was decided that mails should hear the minimum parcel rate, which, in some instances, means that a letter sent from one station to another would cost fche Department 3d. That* decision is wrong. It is nofc in the interests of the people; and if the railway authorities in sist upon their attitude, it is time the public arose in their wrath and said, "" We must have our mails by the nearest and quickest route available."" old arrangement is no longer acceptable fco the railway authorities, let the Postmaster-General hold a conference with the State Governments, and endeavour to secure some better and more satisfactory system. One other item to which I direct attention has reference to mechanics who have enlisted, and who have afterwards applied for admission to the air service. One or two cases have been brought under my notice where men joined the Australian Imperial Porce and secured a transfer to the A i r Branch. They receive a mechanic's wage of 8s. a day; and so much of their allotment money, or separation allowance, as f would make the total exceed 10s. a day is immediately stopped. A single man gets his mechanic's wages, and also, if he has any dependants, a certain amount of allotment pay. In his case it does not exceed 10s. a day. Where a good tradesman gives up a good position, in which he can earn 14s., and even up to 20s., a day, and joins the Australian Imperial Force, and subsequently the A i r Service, he deserves some recognition as a mechanic. Just why his allotment and separation allowance combined is reduced to 10s. a day I cannot understand. Ifc is an injustice to a married man, who may have a family to maintain, that he sh&uld be placed on the same footing as a single man. I have still one other small matter to bring forward. It has to do with dis1 ascertained from another charges given to returned soldiers. Those discharges are printed upon paper which is not of the very best quality. Whil e the men are walking about the streets in uniform, they are expected to exhibit their discharges to the military police. They must present them also to other persons. I , myself, often ask a man to> show me his discharge when he applies for advice or assistance. It would not B y the decision of that mean much move expense if the discharges could be printed upon parchment, and even enclosed in a wallet. They would be something of which the soldiers would be even more proud than they are to-day. As to deferred pay, it has come under my .notice that a. certain lad, who was wounded in October last, and was sent to England, and then 'home on furlough , arrived here iu, March -He was temI f the porarily discharged, b u t was told he could not' draw his deferred pay for another three months. cent, straight way. help; but I do not know whether he availed himself of it .

1188,"Mr Sinclair ,","We l l , I cannot but if it be true, I shall be glad if the Minister will see that the injustice is remedied. I come now to the question of electoral reform. For some considerable time. I have been battling quietly for the adoption of the preferential vote, and for other electoral reforms. I understand that next session a measure of electoral reform will be submitted for our consideration. WhatI wish particularly to impress on the Government is the advisableness of co-ordinating our work with that of the State3 wherever it is possible to do so. Some time ago I had the honour of being Chairman of a Commission, which inquired into electoral matters generally, and, during the course of our investigation, we found that in Tasmania, where a joint roll has been adopted, that roll is more complete than' is the roll in any other part of Australia. Further, the people there are more satisfied with their electoral system than are those of any other part of the Commonwealth. In that State the saving effected in the printoffered £1,000 a year to work for a firm ing of the rolls is a very considerable one, apart altogether from the saving which is effected in their compilation I trust that the Minister for Home and Territories will give this matter his earnest consideration. He should not merely study the finances of the Commonwealth, but also the finances of the States, seeing that we are all one people. If a saving can be'effected by the adoption of a uniform roll for both the Commonwealth and the States, by all means let us effect it. Let us fall into line with those States which are willing to co-operate with.us in this matter. The other States will soon join us. at once. years ago. But the fact remains that we have not gone on yet. I believe that the existing condition of things will continue for four more years, and perhaps for forty years, unless we take a forward step ourselves. Reference has been made to the question of the development of our oil-bearing area3 iti Papua. Some five or six years ago, when a Labour Government were in power, I recollect making representations to the then Minister for External Affair3 ( Mr Thomas) on behalf of a gentleman named Priddle, who had spent the previous thirteen years of his life in prospecting for oil in Papua. He discovered the oil, but as soon as he made an application for a lease to exploit the oil-fields there he was informed that he could not obtain one. Shortly afterwards the Government appointed Mr Wade to test the oil-bearing fields in' Papua. I do not blame Ministers for being very careful to guard against our oil deposits getting into the hands of a monopoly. But surely they can adequately protect the Commonwealth against exploitation. Surely they could insist upon the payment of a royalty and the observance of conditions which would effectually safeguard Commonwealth interests. Had the field been left to private enterprise, I feel sure that we should have had our oil-fields in Papua going to-day. At any rate we should have known whether or not they were capable of producing oil. The gentleman to whom I have referred was in German New Guinea. But he refused to do so. He said: "" I am a Britisher, and I intend to work for the members of my own race."" If the Government are not prepared to exploit these oil-fields themselves, for goodness' sake let private enterprize have a show. Let us press forward in this great empty continent. Let us develop our resources, so that we may become a self-contained community. There would be less talk about the hardships which people have to endure if they would only exhibit a little energy themselves. Progress reported.
