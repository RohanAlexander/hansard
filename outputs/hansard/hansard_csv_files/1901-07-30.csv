20,Mr Piesse,"Taking the first item of.manufacturers of the several States on a just footing in competition with manufacturers outside the States. If this drawback is not allowed it is quite possible, taking confectionery or jams and jellies, which represent a very large item, that manufacturers in the United Kingdom will have an advantage over the manufacturers of Australia, because the latter, unless some such provision is made, will be subject to excise duty or customs duty on sugar, and will also be subject in Western Australia to the Tariff which that State will be able to levy on such goods as are manufactured in the Commonwealth. A duty of 4d. per lb. on confectionery means a considerable difference to manufacturers, if they are not allowed some compensation in the way of drawback as suggested. I have every confidence in asking the committee to favourably consider the proposal to add the new sub-clause. Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney) I thank the honourable member for Tasmania( Mr Piesse) for having suggested this new sub-clause, which, in my opinion, meets the case which we have been discussing for so many hours. going to give us more jam 1 Mr G. B. EDWARDS ing to assist in preventing the trade of the States, in several instances, wandering abroad. The effect of the new sub-clause will be, I believe, to remove tlie objection which several of us have had to the provisions of the Government for regulating drawbacks. Western Australia has been introduced into the matter, because it was felt that she should have power to keep up her revenue during a certain interval of time by taxing certain commodities imported from the other States. Otherwise the revenue would not be sufficient for her needs. While we fire all prepared and willing to accept that provision in the Constitu-tion Act, we do not see any reason why the trade which the other States have done previously with Western Australia should be stamped out on account of a section of the Constitution which has the object of assisting that particular State. I have been twitted in committee, and outside the House, with a reversal of my fiscal opinions in conteuding that we ought to give this measure of protection to the manufacturers of those States which export to AVestern Australia. But there is no reversion of political principle or of fiscal principle. The protection I ask for is protection in the direction of free-trade. If the whole thing were free-if we had absolute free-trade with Western Australia -the point would not arise. What we are contending for is the nearest way to reach free-trade with Western Australia. Unfortunately, tlie circumstances under which we had to adopt the Constitution delayed tlie consummation of free-trade with Western Australia for a period of five years. I have contended all through the debate upon this question that it is certainly in the interests of the Commonwealth that Ministers should consent to this provision, under the operation of which our present trade with Western Australia may be saved from utter destruction. Section 93 of the Constitution providesDuring the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties of customs, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides(1) The duties of customs chargeable on goods imported into a State and afterwards passing into another State for consumption, and the duties of excise paid on goods produced or manufactured in a State and afterwards passing into another State for consumption, the honourable member should be taken to have been collected .not in the former but in the latter I am endeavourState. Some have objected to the proposal which I am seeking to introduce on the ground that, under the operation of that section of the Constitution, if any goods paid duty, say, in the'-Sjate of Victoria, and were exported to Western Australia, tbe duty paid in Victoria would be credited to the State of Western Australia. That is so. But what we are contending for is not at all affected by that provision. We are not asking for a drawback on goods which are to be exported in the same condition as they were when they were imported. We are simply asking that in the case of certain raw materials which, when mixed with other raw materials into a manufacture, are exported to Western Australia, the manufacturers should get drawback upon those materials. I do not think that section 96 of the Constitution Act would give rise to any trouble at all in regard to the financial relations of the Commonwealth with Western Australia. But, on the other hand, the provision proposed would give a measure of relief to a number of manufacturers in the various States, whose industries might otherwise be",16,Lawsand Records Imports Into Western Australia Pome From
21,Mr Page,"Isstamped out. I know that the impression is abroad that I am playing off my own bat, as the saying is. I can assure the committee, however, that I do not export a single case of jam to Western Australia, nor am I likely to do so. But there are very many articles in soft goods manufactured in Victoria, and in leather goods which are manufactured partly out of imported leather, and a number of small items of ironware which are worked up into manufactured articles and exported, which would be injuriously affected by the Bill in its present form. The Bill does not affect jam half so much, probably, as it will affect confectionery. But if it affected jam exclusively, I hold that the principle at issue is so sound that this committee ought, if possible, to get it embodied in the Bill, so that our manufacturers may continue their trade with Western Australia instead of seeing that trade pass away, as it otherwise undoubtedly will, to the United States, Germany, and other countries. When we did finally get relief from the operation of this clause, so much of this trade would have passed away from us that the manufacturers in the other States would never get it back. I hope the Minister will recognise that there is something vital in the principle underlying the provision which we desire to see inserted. I know that the subject has been one of considerable difficulty. But I believe that we have now fairly thrashed the matter out, and I think that unless the Minister can show that there is some insuperable obstacle in the way, he ought to give way and allow of the insertion of the provision proposed, which confers only a fair measure of justice upon manufacturers in these States. Mr ""KINGSTON I want to bring the attention of the committee, if I possibly can, to exactly what is proposed, irrespective of the question of the amount of trade done between the other States and Western Australia. It is a question of principle. It is a question of whether it is right to concede what is asked for or not. What we have provided for already is this : that so far as Western Australia is constituted a foreign country by reason of her special right of taxation of Australian goods, and so far as she exercises that right, then, to prevent double taxation, drawback shall be allowed. But what is proposed here ? So far as I can make out, it is a proposal to give in respect of goods which are transported to Western Australia, whether they pay a special duty or not prevent it . extent and in such manner as may be prescribed."" result would be if the Minister had power to do it . By all means let us give him the power that he ought to have. But if we give him power which he ought not to have, pressure will be brought to bear to make him exercise that power in a way in which he should not. If we pass this clause in the way in which it is proposed, would it not be quite possible for the Minister to allow of drawback in respect of goods transported to Western Australia, irrespective of whether or not they were subject to special taxation in Western Australia? under the Minister's own clause No. 159A. do we want to insert, this provision for, if we have already provided for it ? enough. as clear as it ought to be. We have provided in clause 159A that in respect of goods regarding, which AVestern Australia has a special power of taxation, so far as she exercises that power, there shall be a special power of drawback. But here it is proposed that, irrespective of anything of that sort, there shall be power to allow drawback on the transport of goods from any part of the Commonwealth to Western Australia almost at the sweet will and pleasure of the Minister, subject to the right of prescription. I say that ought not to be so. The test of the right to drawback ought to be, "" Are these goods the subject of special taxation in AVestern Australia"" 1 If they are, well and good. I would put it to the honourable and learned member for Tasmania that if they are, not subject to special taxation in AVestern Australia, it would be just as fair to .provide for a power of drawback upon the transport of goods to Geelong, Hobart, or anywhere else. As I have already said, the test of the right to drawback ought to be the question whether or not the goods are subject to special taxation in AVestern Australia.

29,Mr Kingston,"I have made it justshort of it is that some people see-and rightly enough-that if the Tariff is reduced and they have cleared goods at tlie higher duty, they will not be in such a good position to compete with others as if they had imported at the lower duty. But how are we to meet that? meet it as they do in some places, where it is of Western Australia. AVe have declared simply a question of giving time for the clearance of old stocks. We want Inter-State free-trade at the earliest possible moment. AVhat we are giving to those who have goods in the Commonwealth at the time of the imposition of uniform duties is the right to transport from one part of the Commonwealth to another without the payment of duty. That is where the right to drawback conies in. There is another instance in which the right comes in where goods are made subject to special taxation in AVestern Australia, and we have provided by clause 159A that where the3 are made r subject to special taxation they shall have a special right to drawback. provides that drawbacks of import duty may be allowed on exportation in respect to goods other than those specified to such amount, and in such a manner as may be prescribed. Under a provision of that sort the drawback officers are entitled, when goods are composed of various ingredients, to look tion of their composition and see as regards those ingredients that have paid duty that drawback is allowed. That clause gives the fullest power to do what is fair and right under the circumstances. The drawback may be .allowed on sugar in jam, which is generally about one-half the quantity ; or if it were a question of goods imported from abroad and re-exported, we would allow the drawback of the duty on the raw material imported. blocked by clause 159A I am using the term generally; the refers to goods ""not originally imported."" , the general power under which we can act in respect of these goods. It is not "" on the goods"" but "" in respect to goods"" that drawback may be allowed to such amount and in such manner as may be prescribed. It will therefore be seen that the power is not blocked by this clause. The trouble so far as clause 159 is concerned is that "" transport"" to AVestern Australia would not be export within the ordinary meaning of the term, because it is simply a transfer of the goods from one part of the Commonwealth to another. It was at the suggestion of the Treasurer that I provided a clause of this We cannot description in order to meet the special case that as regards these goods-and they must be Australian goods, because AVestern Australia has a special power of taxation only in regard to Australian goods-so far as she exercises her power in respect of them and taxes them, then such goods, when sent to AVestern Australia, shall be deemed to be exported, and drawback may be allowed.

Where she does, in regard to Australian goods, there we give the right to drawback.

The question may be asked"" Why not"" 1 The answer is because there is no special reason for it . There is no special power of taxation, as regards any part of the Commonwealth in relation to imported goods generally. There would be just as big a case made out for allowing drawback of duty paid on transport from Melbourne to Geelong as there would be in relation to Perth, because imported goods travel free. No doubt we can sympathize with those 'wh""o have cleared at higher rates, but they have the additional advantage of larger markets. I think that, in the circumstances, honourable members will come to the conclusion that we have made sufficient provision already. Any further provision would lead to the embarrassment of the Ministeri n administering the measure. afraid the Minister-and I have been following him with every intention of ascertaining what would be tbe exact effect of clause 159A-ha s not made it clear to the committee that the new sub-elaiuse will accomplish what he appears to desire, and what, if he does desire, will be something iu keeping with what is sought by the a,mendmenfc proposed by the honourable member for Tasmania. We have had a considerable discussion upon the sub-clause. Clause 159A providesIf the Parliament of the State of Western Australia, in exercise oE the power conferred by the Constitution, imposes duties of customs on goods passing into that Shite, and not originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealthand these are the only goods on which she has power to impose special taxationthen, whilst such duties are so imposed, drawback may be allowed in the State in which import duty has been paid and on any such goods as if exported. Now, it was asked in the previous discussion "" H o w can these goods be goods which are not originally imported when it is specifically stated that an import duty has been paid ""'? The explanation given and that was one reason for this sub-clause--wa s a perfectly valid one. It was explained that goods may have been imported from one State to another before federation. For instance, duty might have been paid to the State in which they were imported and then this clause would allow them the drawback if after the establishment of the uniform Tariff the goods were imported to Western Australia and made subject to the special duty. of the imposition of the uniform duties t made after the imposition of tlie uniform Tariff from materials imported prior to the imposition of that Tariff. interpretation of tlie Treasurer tlie manugoods sent from Melbourne to facturers would have to obtain the material before the imposition of the uniform Tariff. cases desired to be covered by the clause ? was claimed that tlie clause covered, and I do not see how more can be claimed. That, I think, is the f u l l limit of the claim that Can be sustained. The honourable member for South Sydney and the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Piesse, desire to go further than that. They desire to have a drawback of atany rate that portion of the duty which has been paid on the ingredients used in the manufacture. this clause. and learned gentleman claim that this clause goes further than was argued during the previous debate on the subject ? goods imported from abroad. tralia charge on them ? This will not affect Western Australia at all. But here is the difference. She gets f u l l credit for the duty on everything that enters and is consumed within her borders. If Western Australia recognises goods as imported goods-w e will take jams for instance -althoug h they are manufactured within the Commonweath, then she has no right to charge duty upon them; but if she does not recognise them as imported goods-that is, if she ceases to regard the sugar that forms the principal ingredient in jams as an imported article, but says that it is an Australian article-sh e has power to impose a special duty. duties, drawback; no special duties, no drawback. and learned gentleman admits that the clause does not cover the case.",19,Lawsand Records Imports Into Western Australia Pome From

In tbe case of boots, for instance, she would not say-""Here leather in these boots; we are not going to charge duty on that American leather."" What she would say would be-"" Were these boots manufactured in the Commonwealth or outside of it ? We will charge duty if they were manufactured within the Commonwealth."" The contention of the Right Honourable the Treasurer is that AVestern Australia would not charge a duty if any of the ingredients of the manufactured article had been imported, but I am sure the committee cannot accept that interpretation. debating this point the other evening, it was said that the clause would apply to certain cases of imported goods, but not goods imported into one of the States of tbe Commonwealth, before the imposition of the uniform Tariff, from another State of the Commonwealth. illustration, because no doubt it will be dutiable, and the duty upon it may bear a considerable proportion to the price of the manufactured article in the case of jams and confectionery; and it is therefore a good illustration. ported, and is here made into jam, Western Australia will recognise that jam as a Commonwealth manufacture, and it seems to me that there is no provision made, and that the Right Honourable tbe Treasurer has failed to show it, to get a drawback on that article when it is delivered to AVestern ports. The request which has been made is a reasonable one, and one with which the Minister ought to comply. An opportunity to obtain a drawback ought to be given, and it ought to be put in some way that will make the right clear and evident, and not the reverse, as this clause makes it, by saying that it refers only to goods not originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, and then afterwards saying that a drawback may be allowed in the State in which import duty has been paid.

Sir AVILLIAMM c MILLAN does not seem to me a fair way of dealing with this question as a whole.

MrA . M c LEAN I am satisfied that the Minister's clause does not go the whole way. Ib goes bo the extent of goods manufactured within the limibs of bhe Commonwealth of Commonwealbh material. No doubt bhe clause will cover those cases; bub suppose goods are manufactured within any State in the Commonwealbh, parbly of local producbs, and partly of imported products, which have paid duby, Western Australia would not discriminate between bhese, bub would charge a duty on bhe whole as being bhe manufacture of another Sbabe, and therefore to the extent B u b ib bhat a portion of bhe materials had paid duby the local importer would have to pay double duty; thab is quibe clear.

I should like to know how these fines and penalties would appear in the public accounts. If tlie money is to be distributed according to the sweet will of tlie Minister, how are the appropriations to. come under public notice in the public accounts. It is a good thing to lay down the rule that the whole of tlie fines shall be paid into the consolidated revenue.

152,Sir Philip Eysh (Tasmania),"Iand leave the discussion of the various details to the committee stage of our deliberations. I think we may congratulate the Commonwealth that the Postmaster-General has taken over an up-to-date department. The various developments which have taken place in Australia followed all those which have existed and grown elsewhere. We have the advantages of the money order system, of the postal card system, and also of newspapers and various periodicals passing through the Post-office for the convenience of the public. . These things I believe have heretofore given to the various States, and will give to the Commonwealth hereafter, all the advantages which may be expected from this department. In taking over tbe department it is very satisfactory to find that its statistical information covers the extent of the trade and commerce of the Commonwealth generally. We do not need to refer specially to the statistics of the Postal department for information as to the importance of the commerce of the Commonwealth ; but still, as these statistics do give some information which may be useful to honourable members, I propose hurriedly to glance over that portion of them which affects this particular department. In the Postal and Telegraphic departments nearly 7,000 officers are engaged. There is a capital sum of .£6,000,000 invested in the construction of telegraphs, and from £1,000,000 ito £2,000,000 more in tlie construction of the various post-offices which will be taken over. This £8,000,000 represents something like four-fifths of the proportion of the assets of the various States, which ab the time of the Federal Convention, ib was presumed, would be taken over by the Commonwealth. 50,000 miles of telegraphs actively employed. These are carrying aboub 10,000,000 messages annually. this portion of bhe work, ib may be satisfactory bo honourable members bo have . bheir minds refreshed wibh the facb bhab Australia stands first throughout theworkl wibh respecb bo bhe volume of ibs business over ibs mileage of belegraphs -eve n before tbe Unibed Kingdom. The messages carried by the department in bhe United Kingdom are far in excess of the number carried by any other Stabe or country in bhe world. In regard bo posboffices there are also isbabistics worthy of attention. 400,000,000 mail parcels, letters, postal parcels, and newspapers are carried annually bhroughout Australia, representing 54 per head of bhe population of bhe Commonwealth, or 67 per head of bhe population of bhe United Kingdom. Again, the Commonwealth department carries a very much larger number of lebbers and mail parcels in proportion to the population than is carried in any other country. This is done at an annual expenditure of about £2,500,000. I shall nob brouble honourable members wibh the exa'cb figures. I shall occupy far less time by giving honourable members bhe approximate amounts. Ib answers my purpose, and I think ib will answer bhe purpose of mosb honourable members bo know thab bhe bobal revenue of the Posbal'department of bhe Commonwealth ab the present moment is about £2,500,000 per annum. One cannob speak very accurabely in regard to this matter, owing to the fact thab the bookkeeping systems of bhe various States, and theirrespectivecharges, are somewhat varied in character. Sometimes ib is found bhab bhe cosb of additions bo a posboffice, or a new jaostoffice, or certain expenses in conuexion wibh the telegraph sysbem, are charged by a Sbabe bo ibs annual expenditure.

In submitting Bill, the Minister has been actuated by a desire to establish the department* on something like business lines. We shall find, therefore, that his purpose is to reduce the annual deficiency of £200,000, and the honourable gentleman was able to state in another House that, as the result of tlie arrangements that he was about perfecting under this Bill, we might roughly estimate the department's loss for the first year of the Commonwealth This reduction can be accomplished only by certain concessions all round. The public must concede something; the department must concede something; and it is to be hoped that Members of Parliament themselves will concede something. find in the business clauses of the Bill that special provision hag been made for dealing with the system of franks, which has so important a bearing upon the question of loss, whether associated witb the various departments or Parliament itself, and also for dealing with the carriage of newspapers.

It is proposed that whatever business is conducted by the departat about £120,000. ment for other branches of the State should be fairly paid for in some method or other ; just as with respect to honourable members' railway passes, the railways get the benefit of the estimated revenue from such passes. If frank stamps are used in this House, for They will instance, the parliamentary expenses account will be debited with the cost of those franks. In this way we shall learn more ijarfcicularly what the system costs us, and possibly, by some such supervision, we shall be able to keep the cost down to the minor sum which it ought to exhibit rather than to the maximum which at present it reaches. So far as the carriage of newspapers is concerned in some of the States, and so far as the franked provision telegrams and postal matter are conwhich cerned in the States generally, the cost at the present time is about £80,000. charges. I have read lately that in Queensland there is an expenditure of £12,000 a year in connection with franks under the telegraph system.

161,Sir Philip Fysh,"There are frankedreferred may be materially reduced. I think honourable members will agree with me that in taking the complete monopoly of all the postal and telegraph systems in Australia we have to justify the advisability of that monopoly to the public. The various States have given to their people advantages which* could not have accrued to the individuals in those States except through the instrumentality of such a monopoly. There will therefore be found in this Bill such clauses with regard to tbe telegraphs and post-offices as will fully maintain thab monopoly.

The number of cables bhat are now being erecbed, whether for lighting or tramway purposes, has made elecbricity a menace to properby and life by reason of bhe fusion of wires, and if special regulations are not adopbed bhe results are likely bo be dangerous. I am referring now to the fusion which has often taken place in consequence of a great electric power running along cables and coming in contact wibh a wire carrying a minor power, such as is conveyed along our telegraph lines ; the consequence being frequently bhab damage has been clone bo property, whilst in many instances, as we have read, injury has been clone bo life. Moreover, fives have been originated in this way. lb will be seen by honourable members, if they braverse bhis Bil l carefully, bhab there is very good reason for bhose provisions which give bhe Posbmaster-General ful l control over the enormous power of electricity, which possibly is only in ibs birbh amongst us at the present moment; and bhat therefore, when we ask bhat bhese powers shall be given bo bhe Posbmasber-General in his capaciby of controller of electric works, we are asking only for thab which is necessary in bhe inberesbs of bhe people, and for whab is absolubely essential to the Postal department I believe ib will be found bhab privabe rights have been well respected in this Bill. Amendments have been made elsewhere with bhab objecb in view. Honourable members will recollecb that the Bill has come to us afber a most brying ordeal of about six weeks in another place; and I jiresume thab bhe abtenbion which has been given to ib elsewhere' will have beeu beneficial as which Ministers have in view. When we come to consider the B ill in committee with bhese amendments in ib, we may be able to agree with mosb of bhem ; bub even bhough occasionally we may find amendmenbs which, bo the minds of some honourable members may appear bo be somewhab crude, yeb wibh a little attention I am sure we shall be able to make them workable. I remember one clause which relabes to wages and management and bo local arrangements connecbed wibh various constructive works, find to that clause I hope honourable members will give bheir special abbention, in order bhat wecertain special clauses are may make it workable, which perhaps it may not be at bhe presenb time. The desire of bhe framers of bhab clause is a good one, bub ibmay be bhat in making bheir amendment they have not quibe accomplished whab is inbended. The provision is clause 93, paragraph (q). Ib is a matter we shall be able to thrash out in committee, and to. which I would particularly ask the attention .of honourable members, as Minisbers desire bo give all the assisbance they can in connection with what this clause provides. Therearenecessarily many technicalities concerned in a Bill wibh respect to electric power. Personally, I do nob feel equal to bhe various technicalities conbained in bhe measure. There are some specially difficult clauses in ib; one, I remember, in which provision is made as to two lines crossing at righb angles, and which is the nearest poinb of contact. That is a clause the precise meaning of which possibly we may be able to discover in commibbee. Wibh respecb bo nearly all these clauses, I may say bhab they have been framed under bhe superinbendence of a committee of the heads of bhe deparbmenb, assisbed by bhe departmental electricians, who have also had bhe advantage of utilizing bhe provisions of the Elecbric Light and Power Acb of Great Britain, which has been in existence for some time, and in which Act we shall doubtless be able bo find much that may be necessary so far as concerns bhe consideration of bhe powers asked for in bhe Bill.

Theni t will be time, also, for us to think of what I hope is more than criticism. a sentiment-the establishment of a uniform postage stamp. I remember, very many years ago, when speaking at a postal conferenceI am not sure whether my honorMinisters do not ask able friend from Parramatta was presentexpressing a hope that at no far distant date we should have a penny stamp that Tlie Governwould travel throughout Australia, upon any letter on which we might wish to use it, in much the same way that His Majesty's sovereign is circulated. the honourable member invited us out to Tattersall's 1 Sir PHILIPFYSH I am not speaking of Tattersall's at the present moment. I was saying that the uniform penny postage will be something more than a sentiment. I know one of 0 ust as we have imbibed the principles of the o federal spirit which has brought us together, largely by means of our social intercourse for years and years past, and If we were to 'impose a uniform very largely through the instrumentality of the letters which are posted from one that State would lose family and from one State to another, so I While the think we shall, when we have established the whole object and purpose which our Commonwealth has in view, find a uniform penny postage stamp will be an effective means of holding together those who have bound themselves under this Constitution. I may find it necessaiy when we get into committee to talk more seriously about the clause to We have talked which my honourable friend has just referred, and which is known as "" the Tattersall clause."" I cannot pass it by now, because it Most is one of those clauses to which tlie attention of honourable members should be particularly that many have not given between now and when we come to consider the Bil l in committee. Whyi t is ultimately a called "" the Tattersall clause"" distinctively, 1 do not know, because I find that the same clause exists in New South Wales, though in a modified for m; it is the clause absolutely as it is in existence in Queensland; it is nearly the same as the clause in existence in Victoria, and also in Western Australia, where we have, and have had for some years, the power given established, we to the Postmaster-General to stop letters which he believed were being sent",31,Second Reading

I hear, for example, of a petition bearing the names of 100,000 persons coming from New South Wales, and I have no doubt petitions will come from people immediately surrounding this Chamber. They are being signed in the streets for a purpose,, of which I informed myself by asking a man for the heading of the petition, which, I may add, I did not sign. I found it was .an invitation to people to petition against the invasion of their State rights, or rather, I should put it, tbe invasion of their private right to send a letter through the Post-office-that it should be absolutely inviolable. to sign a petition on that, ground, but he said he was not taking any. these petitions will be better understood when they reach the House. They are intended to inform the Commonwealth Parliament that the people who sign them strongly object to having their letters in any way tampered with by the Post office. I presume that, on the principle of a man's home being his castle, they wish to say that a letter which passes from him to his friends shall be absolutely inviolable. Well, I am not the keepei* of the conscience of my honourable colleagues in the Ministry. I do not know what their conscience is in the matter, but I am the interpreter of their object in introducing this Bill to the House, and I deem it my duty to say that Ministers desire to establish the principle that there shall be no variation in this respect in tlie States of the Commonwealth. Four of the States have legislated against the passing of a certain class of letters through the PostofficeI allude to the class of letters which encourage gambling, and which encourage sweepstakes-and that being so, it was a serious consideration for Ministers whether they should establish a uniform system throughout the Commonwealth, or whether ifc would be at all practicable to' make a separate arrangement in respect to any one State which deemed it expedient in the exercise of its rights-to establish its own gaming laws. In this connection, as I had something to do with the passing of the Gaming Law of Tasmania, 1 should like to. supplement what has been so well said elsewhere by saying that so far as Tasmania is concerned, whether I go into Tattersall's office, or whether I pass along the streets and observe the absence of tote shops, or 1\ go out to the race-course and see how well the races are conducted, with the absence of "" bookies,"" and with tlie absolute abolition of all tote shops, and with a due recognition of the system* which is conducted by Tattersall's, I find -a n object lesson to all tlie other States. So far as Tattersall's sweeps are concerned, they have been conducted in a manner that reflects credit upon the conductor. The legislation proposed is not specially directed against this one State. The clause is not aimed at putting down a particular error, if we choose to call it so, in -one State; but it is merely in perpetuation of that legislation which four out of the six States have considered it advisable to enact. They have enacted a similar clause for a purpose which I . at once admit is a proper purpose. I had occasion, as PostmasterGenerali n years gone by, to veto the passing of certain letters through the Post office. I have in mind the case of a man in theneighbouring State of Tasmania, receiving letters, evidently carrying money, in respect of some future event, in connection with a system which we believed was being conducted in a very improper manner.' I had occasion to stop the passage of that man's letters, and I know that, in the other States we shall find instances where the Postmasters General have, under certain sections or regulations, found it necessary to stop letters. If I give one instance, I think it will suffice to show honourable members that there is an absolute necessitv for some legislation of this kind. Mr O'MALLEY -Was not tlie honourable gentleman's action wrong ? Sir PHILJPFYSH I think not. I acted under regulations framed under a special Act giving me that power.

First, let me remind honourable members that there will be regulations as to what shall be deemed newspapers under the Act.

A good liberal interpretation has been placed on the word ""newspaper.""

The newspapers and periodicals are largely responsible for this. are largely responsible by reason of the supplements which we often find inside -supplement s which have no reference to local information, except that which Brown, Jones, or Robinson want to convey .to people with respect to his cheap tea or cheap wares.

The newspapers in some States have been carried on at a profit possibly at the cost of the Post-office, but as I have explained, the purpose of the Postmaster General in this Bill is to endeavour as nearly as possible to approximate the revenue to the expenditure. Any one who has had to do with mail contracts and the letting of them knows that year by year the amount claimed by various mailmen is considerably enlarged by reason of the enormously increasing bulk of the mail matter carried. This opens up another point with respect to the business purposes of the Bill. Within my own knowledge, as indeed it is within the knowledge of any man who has had anything to do with postal matter and post-otfice contracts, man)' of the contracts in the States are let not only for the purpose of carrying out the work which is the legitimate work of the Postal department, but for the purpose of providing carriage accommodation for outlying districts, sometimes let for the purpose, I think I am right in saying, in Tasmania, in Western Australia, and in Queensland particularly, with respect to outlying developments, and the amount -of money paid for contracts by steamers is altogether disproportionate to the value of the work which they do for the Post-office. There is a provision in the Bill that when the Postmaster-General finds it desirable to cut down the cost of these contracts, and when the localities themselves may deem ifc very desirable to-have a better service than he has provided for, they can supplement that service. That, I take it , would apply not only to locally supplementing the cost of a mail service by a steamer. I know one instance where £15,000 a year is paid for the carriage of mails, when the amount should be about £ 5 0 0 a year for the actual work done for the Posfc-office, and I have read, also, that often the necessity, in some outlying districts, exists for the subsidizing of a steamer, not so much to carry mails as to carry passengers and food to the people. These are local developments, and tbe Postmaster-General is desirous that local development shall be of local concern, that if it be necessary to subsidize so largely some of these services 'in interests which are not purely local, such services shall have an auxiliary But the Government are of revenue outside the Posfc-office. That is only one of the methods by which the cost of the service can be kept down, and the revenue made to more closely approach the outlay than has hitherto been the case. I think I have now dealt with the principal matter this Bill contains, apart from the numerous subsidiary clauses. Whetheri t be in respect to the post office or telegraph work, there are a great number of clauses which relate to the principles to which I have referred, and I might occupy tlie time of honourable members in going through these clauses in detail now, but it has not been my practice on the second reading of a Bill to do more than outline the special purposes that Bill is designed to accomplish, and to indicate three or four of the important clauses to which honourable members need give special attention.

177,Mr Kingston (South A US T R A L I A,"affecting customs and excise. Beer is not altogether a very interesting subject, but there are matters of interest in connection with the beer excise to which honourable members might like me to refer. I do not propose to disclose what the Government policy is on the subject of the excise on beer, but I think it is well to generally acquaint honourable members with what is the present position in the various States on this subject. There is a beer excise in force in every one of the federated Statessome have adopted it earlier and some later. I find that Victoria and Tasmania were among the earliest of the States to adopt the beer excise, in 1880-2 1 years ago-and the last was South Australia, m y native State, where I had the honour of recommending it in 1894. The duty ranges from 2d. per gallon in Western Australia and South Australia, to 4d. per gallon in Tasmaniaj 2d. is also the rate prescribed as regards beer which is made from malt and hops solely in Victoria, while on other beer 3d. pei gallon is charged. Beer in which malt and hops only are used does not seem to be quite such a favourite article of consumption among the good people of Victoria as is beer which contains other ingredients, for the malt and hop beer which paid duty last year in Victoria was under 500,000 gallons, whilst tlie thirst of Victorians was otherwise quenched by beer differently produced to the extent of nearly 14,000,000 gallons. The total quantity of beer which paid excise duty throughout the States during last year was 41,338,533 gallons, and honourable members will form a fair idea of the importance of this question of the excise duty on beer when I tell them that the net result to the revenue was £491,823. different rates and circumstances, yielded different results. Tasmania, which has the highest duty, consumed only 7'33 gallons per bead of the population during the year, and the revenue returned was £24,726. Mr O'MALLEY people. States have various tastes, and I am not concerned in analyzing Mr Coghlan's statistics except so far as they relate to the consumption of beer. It is, however, very strange to note how some States affect spirits', and some the humbler colonial article. The consumption in South Aust r a l ia was S'95 gallons per head, aud the revenue £26,373. New South Wales was third on the list, so far as the average consumption was concerned, with 9 5S gallons per head, the revenue derived amounting to £165,934. Queensland consumed 11 ""58 gallons per head, and the revenue amounted to £66,344. In Victoria the consumption was 11-76 gallons per head, and the revenue derived was £176,787. As regards the consumption of beer, the accomplishments of the residents of tlie ' different States that I have mentioned, fade into actual insignificance as compared with the prowess of the people of Western Australia. Whilst Victoria is next on the' list, witb an average consumption of 11'76 gallons per head, I find that in Western Australia the consumption is 23'84 gallons per head-man , woman, and childa source of revenue, which, no doubt, the Treasurer appreciates. money to pay for it . the people of Western Australia do hard work, and require at the same time good substantial refreshment, aud further, that they patronize the local article to a degree that is not to be found in any other State. I hope honourable members will, from the figures to which I have referred, get a genera] idea of how the matter stands in the different States, and of the importance of the question. The Bill which we are submitting for the consideration of honourable members is intended, not to fix the excise, but to provide for the collection of the excise when imposed by Federal Act. Of course, as soonas a FederalA ct comes into operation, the State Acts in relation' to the excise on beer will cease to operate, this The different States, having Bill having special and sole reference to the excise imposed by Federal Act. To protect the revenue the scheme is simple. AVe require the licensing of the brewer and the brewery so that no beer can be made except in a brewery. The excise officer has a right They are a sober at all times to see what is going on, and the obligation is imposed on the brewer to pay the duty before the beer leaves the brewery. The duty is paid by affixing to the vessel containing the beer a stamp equivalent to the amount of the duty, and by cancelling the stamp on the vessel before the beer is removed. These are broadly the provisions of the Bill. The brewer bas to keep books and to render accounts, and every means, it ' seems to us, is taken for the purpose of",35,Excise On Beer Bill Second Reading

Clause7 lets in a number of the provisions in the Customs Acts in reference to procedure. there is provision for a licence fee, which is made the same in all cases. Security is taken from the brewer for his compliance with the provisions of the law. It is also declared how transfer of licences can be made, and under what circumstances they shall be cancelled, and the brewer is restrained from, among other things, making beer at any place other than in his brewery. Part3 declares tlie full power, of supervision which is intended to be vested in the excise officer. Clauses 27 and 2S specify the mode of payment of the excise duty, and what is to be clone in the way of stomping and cancelling stamps. Part5 contains all the restrictions proper in connection with ' removal of beer. Part6 relates to the power of officers; and Part 7, dealing with miscellaneous matters, provides, amongst other things, for the forfeiture of beer which is not made by a licensed brewer, or which is removed from the brewery contrary to the provisions of the Bill. excise as well ? Distillation Bill, no doubt. The idea of the Government is that in addition to the excise on beer, which in nearly every case, is properly dealt with in a separate Act, there shall be a General Excise Bill and a Distillation Bill. All these Bills are practically completed in their preparation, and will be introduced one after the other as soon as honorable members are good enough to dispose of those measures, which, for the moment, occupy our attention. I have stated the general provisions of. the Bill. I believe our purpose will be found to be plainly expressed, but we shall be very pleased if the House shall assist the Government in getting the Bill through as fast as possible, because, the sooner we get rid of the machinery Bills the better, in order that we may direct our'attention to the subject which so much occupies in perspective the minds of honourable members-the Federal Tariff. worth) -Afte r the very brilliant speech of my right honourable friend on this very elevating topic, I think we can all agree to go into committee without any very formal or long debate on the second reading. The Minister has referred to the Tariff, and I am sure ifc will befchedesire of this side of the Clause8 requires licences, and House, if not of the other side, that Bills of this kind should be got through as soon as possible. We have a feeling that the time bas arrived when the real issue between both sides of the House should be brought into relief. I am sure that all of us are heartily sick of these machinery Bills, necessary as they may be; and I can assure the Ministry that there will be no delay so far as we are concerned. I do not know anything aboutfchebusinessof brewing, nor do I know whefcherthere are anyexpertsin the House at the present time, but I think that, whether there are or not, this is essentially a Bill for committee. It seems to me to be entirely regulative, in order to protect the revenue, and I am sure we all desire to do that, so long as there is no unnecessary harshness or espionage ; therefore, I shall say nothing further on the subject.

I will look the matter up more closely before the Bill passes from this House. As regards the question as to large or small, I may say that of course this is not a licence-fee in respect of the output. Each brewer pays in accordance with his output by virtue of the excise. This is more in fche nature of a registration fee. not think that the brewers pay any licence fee in AVestern Australia, but if so, it would be a very small one, because licences are issued for fche consumption of all colonial wines and beers for £ 5 per annum. I do not think fche brewers would pay anything. Clause agreed to. Clauses 12 to 19 agreed to. Clause 20Ifo brewer shall(a) Make beer at any place other than his licensed brewery.

Under this particular clause an unfortunate person who procures that beer, although he has paid for it , is liable to a penalty of £ 5 0 , notwithstanding that the brewer is himself tlie proper person to see that the barrel is stamped. the penalty of £ 1 0 0 to which tbe brewer is liable, is an extremely mild one compared with that proposed to be inflicted on a person who may innocently do this thing.

There might be some declaration, I think, as a safeguard. Supposing an officer really attempted to go beyond his particular duty, there might be something in this Bill of a declaratory character, that would give the brewer a legal position in dissenting from any unnecessary interference. and this is the general effect of the various provisions. I have here some of the returns which have to be sent in in Victoria. The officers have, for instance, from day to day, to make entries in their books, showing the quantity bf beer in gallons produced, and distinguishing between the beer made from malt and hops, and the beer made from sugar, and other ingredients. They have to specify the exact quantities of sugar, malt, and hops received into the brewery from day to day, and the exact quantities used in fche brewery from day to day.

I hope that tlie actual power to send tlie forces beyond tlie limits of the Commonwealth will be retained in the Bill. There has been great alarm in regard to what may be called the conscription clauses. But there does not seem to be anything to be alarmed about. The clauses simply put in writing a power that a Government ought to possess, namely, the power of calling out the manhood of the country for the defence of the country. British Government do not take. whether the British Government do or not, but it is a power which the Government -ought to have. Sometimes our more radical friends are very proud when they can say that in certain legislation the mother land lags behind Australia. On this occasion I would say that the motherland is behind us, if she is not prepared to call out her men when necessary. more need for conscription than we have. but I am not now speaking of what it is requisite for the old country to do, though there are some very strong advocates of -conscription, even in the old land. The -clauses in tlie Bill are really taken from the Canadian Act, and in the Defence Acts of -several of the States there is also the power to call out the men of the country in -case of necessity. .nothing unprecedented in the proposals in the Bill. serious objections which have. been taken ; But there is another objection with which I agree, namely, the objection to the power of appointing officers being left entirely to the Governor in Council. It is very difficult to find the true solution of tins question. If the power be left entirely in the hands of the commandant there will be favouritism. If the power be left entirely in tlie hands of the Governori n Council there will be favouritism, and there certainly will be political pressure. I would like to see use made of such a council as we have in Victoria, called the Council of Defence. That council was not given power to appoint officers, but was given power to direct and organize the forces generally. supposed and believed that when this council was formed almost every question of any importance whatever would come before it . It occurred to me that the difficulty might be got over by allowing the Commandant to recommend appointments through a Council of Defence. If the .Council of Defence approved of tbe appointments, then the Governor General in Council might give his assent to them. member of the Council of Defence1 case in Victoria. is a power the show. In Victoria the Minister is a member of fche council, also tlie Commandant and two or three other officers. One of fche objections which have been urged against the Victorian system is that some ot the members of tlie board are junior to the Commandant. Therefore, the}' would be put in a very difficult position if they had to vote against any appointment recommended by the Commandant But the actual question of appointments is not left to the Council of Defencei n Victoria. If we adopted that principle, and established a Council of Defence, giving that body.the power of passing or not passing on the recoiimiendafcions of the Commandant, it might be a good thing. But there might be on tbe council officers junior to the Commandant, and they would be placed in the position of having to vote against the Commandant or Commander-inThere is, therefore, Chief. However, I think that in committee we ought to endeavour to devise some These are the only two means by which the danger of favouritism on the part of either the Commandant or tbe Ministeri n charge of the department can be avoided. Another objection which I have to this B ill is its comparative silence in regard to naval questions. No naval expert was summoned to the recent conference of commandants. I am aware that some time ago there was a meeting of experts upon naval matters, and they reported upon this subject, but not to the Commonwealth Government. I think that it would have been well if there had been present at the recent conference of military experts one or more naval experts, so that we could have learned if there was anything that we could undertake in the way of naval defence It was -othe r than harbour defence-and , if so,",45,Defence Bill Second Reading

Surely we ought to be prepared to do more than we are doing for the defence of Australia, and indirectly, therefore, of the Empire. Before concluding my remarks I should like to refer to the rifle clubs, which I intended speaking of earlier. I have long felt-and I spoke to this effect upon the platform-that it would be well if everybody could learn, fche use of periods the ritie. But there are two objections to rejoin his battalion for training should keep himthe adoption of this course-first , the very self in practice with his weapon, and should what great expense that Australia would be we call shoot his musketry course.

But during the periods he is afc home he does this at his village, a condition being that he must be a member of the local rifle club. Thus, unless he fails'to fulfil the prescribed conditions, is he saved the trouble and expense of leaving home, and attending at military headquarters. As showing the expense involved in this work, ' I may mention that in 1898 the Government of Switzerland contributed -£110,000 towards the cost of ammunition, in addition to a sum of £250,000, which was supplied from private sources for the same object.

It is a compulsory system. -devote a certain number of days to military duties. -a compulsory system. I am devoting my attention to rifle shooting. AVe are proposing to help that movement here, and 1 am quite of opinion that every encouragement possible should be given to it. If a man only knows how to use the rifle ifc is something, but drill instruction is also desirable. Another point, about which there is an absolute silence in this Bill, and which might very well have been mentioned, is the desir-abiliby of establishing a military college .such as there is at Kingston in Canada, and at West Point in the United States of America. I am af raid we are somewhat prone to think 'that volunteers and militia are sufficient. The experience gained by tlie United States of America during the civil war went to show how that tlie lessons taught at the celebrated academy at West Point were invaluable to both sides during that disastrous war. Mr O'MALLEY -Quite true. orable the leader of the Opposition, whose speech, I am sure, every one who heard it must have welcomed as a splendid contribution to this question, and worthy of the . quarter from which it came, said the other night that he wished we could have such men as Sherman, Grant, and Lincoln. I do not know about Sherman, but I do know that Grant was educated at West 'Point MrO ' MALLEY And so was Sherman Jackson and Lee were also trained at West Point for four years. The United States of America hoped that if ever the time came when they should need trained men to officer their volunteers, they would be able to obtain them as the result of tlie work done at West Point. In glancing through the life of Stonewall Jackson yesterday, I came across a quotation which, although ifc is lengthy, I should like to read, as ifc shows from actual experience how desirable ifc is that we should establish here a college in which men may learn to take charge of regiments and small armies. Some of us have heard of mistakes made in South Africa. Although many of our British officers have made mistakes, I think it will be found, when the history of this war is written, that they are not fche only officers who have committed errors, but that many blundsrs have been the result of men with . very little military knowledge and experience being placed in charge. In the weekly edition of the Times recently, a letter from Pretoria was published, in which the writer referred favourably to British officers, and said that many of the blunders were made by volunteer officers practically in charge of colonial corps. He also said that a great many of these disasters had been concealed. In the very same number of the.Times there also appeared a letter from a Cape Colony officer, complaining offcheBritish officer, so that it is very difficult for us to get at the truth of the matter. This is whatfchewriter of the life of Stonewall Jackson saysIn the wars with England the militia of the different States had furnished the means both of resistance and aggression, but their grave shortcomings, owinjr principally to this lack of competent officers, had been .paiiifidly conspicuous. After 18.14, the principle that the militia was the first line of defence was still adhered to, and the standing army was merely maintained as a school for generals and a frontier guard. It was expected, however, that in case of war, the West Point graduates would supply the national forces with a large number of officers, who, despite their civil avocations, would at least be familiar with drill and discipline. This fact is to be borne in mind in view of the civil war. The demands of the enormous armies then put in the field were entirely unprecedented, and the supply of West Pointers inadequate to meet them; but the influence of the Military",47,Defence Bill Second Reading

Tn Victoria the cost of the militia is £ 1 1 14s. 8d. per man ; and in Queensland £ 1 3 19s., or in round figures, £ 1 4 per man.

The point I able either; but taking the figures merely upon the basis I have mentioned, honourable members will see that the cost is comparatively large. I heard some honourable member interject to-night that the cost of the service in Switzerland amounted to only £ 7 per man, inclusive of everything. Here, exclusive of ammunition and allowances, the cost runs to £ 1 6 per man.

The New South Wales Volunteer Forces, inclusive of ammunition, cost some £ 8 10s. per man. Going to New Zealand, I find that they have there an enrolment-apar t from the permanent militia, as they term them, a small engineering ancl artillery force-a n enrolment of 11,500 men under the volunteer system. The various companies of these men get for them, in respect of uniforms and other expenditure fchafc may be gone to on behalf of tbe men, a capitation fee of £ 3 10s. per annum for mounted men, and £ 2 10s. for dismounted men.

The total cost in New Zealand is £ 6 5s. 9d. per head of the men enrolled. teers in New South Wales. volunteers cost in New South Wales. In New Zealand, with the exception I have stated, they have no militia at all. Their mounted and dismounted troops, and their garrison and field artillery, are all volunteers, paid in the manner I have indicated. The most the men can earn in the course of a year is 2s. 6d. per day for the six daylight wish to make is, that it seems to me to be the duty of this Federal Parliament to get the greatest degree of efficiency compatible with a reasonable expenditure of money. Ifc has always seemed to me that ifc is impossible to work the militia and volunteer system side by side. Most people will admit that if we have one set of men, who are certainly citizens in the sense that they are not regular soldiers, and if we have those men receiving pay, even though it is not more than £ 1 1 or £ 1 2 per annum, as in New South Wales, it must still necessarily breed a certain sense of injustice in the minds of the men who are giving up practically an equal amount of time to the service of the countiy, and are doing nearly as much to qualify themselves for the defence of the country in the case of necessity. Above that I find that while we have two distinct sets of individuals, as we have in New South Wales, there is a continual pressure on the part of officers, particularly of the establishment that is, the instructors and .partially paid officersagainst the idea of volunteers altogether.

337,Mr Higgins,"They have no specialsoiue years, and who has followed very closely the volunteer movement in New Zealand and New .South Wales, I believe we are more likely to get an efficient force, considered from all points of view, by the volunteer system than by any other. I may here refer to bhe*inberjecbion which was made by the honourable member for Gwydir a few moments ago with reference bo the Australian Horse. Lb -Col. Mackay gob bogebher bhe Australian Horsei n New South Wales as a bush volunteer regimenb, and considering all the circumstances, 1 believe it was one of bhe besb horse regiments in bhab Sbabe. He was firsb allowed, J think, an establishment of 400. Applications for permission bo form troops came flowing in bo such an extent thab after a great deal of trouble he gob an extension of his number to 600, and still was unable to comply wibh the desire of those who wished to parbicipabe in bhe movement. I would like tbe honourable member for Wannon to remember bhab bhis occurred before bhe war fever came on. We can quite understand bhab, under the 'circumstances which have exisbed during bhe -pasb eighteen months or two years, there would be a nabural desire to form rifle clubs and corps generally. Bub before bhat bhe Australian Horse was organized, and considerably over 1,000 applications were senb in during bhe firsb bhree months of bhe movement. In my own disbricb bhere were ab least bwo troops which were refused permission bo form, because of bhe establishnienb nobpermibbing of ib-bha b is, bhey were already enrolled up to their ful l strength. This regiment went on for, I think, bwo years as a purely volunteer one. Then whab occurred? Without any initiative coming from bhe men concernedI mean the rank and file, I will nob say as bo the officers, because I was not in their confidence-bh e regimenb into a partially paid or militia force. The attendances were all thab could be desired ab drills and half-day parades. For, as honourable members are doubbless aware, in bhe counbry bhey can easily arrange for half-day parades on Saburday afternoons and so on. The regiment was .going on swimmingly, and yefc while Colonel Maokay himself was in Soubh Africa, ib was transformed inbo a partially-paid force at an addibional cosb* of £6,000 or £7,000 per annum to New South Wales. There was an insbance where the men were perfectly -satisfied bo go on. some of the officers asked for :it. I could nob undersband ib when I saw bhe item on our own Estimates. An Honorable MHMBER -Did the men objecb ? objecb. Of course, I do nob say bhab bhese men are any differenb from bhe resb of us-w e are all prone bo seize the opportunity to get a little more money when it occurs ; bub I do say bhere was no demand for the change on the part of bhe men. They were quite prepared to go on as volunteers, and, therefore, I think bhab bhab insbance is another argument in favour of bhe idea bhab we can get volunteers if we ask for them, and if we are prepared bo give some reasonable encouragement. Whab .1 would propose in regard bo volunteers would be this: Thab we should give each regimenb sufficienb capibabion money for each efficienb member bo cover tlie cost of the uniforms and also supply bhe men with rifles and insbrucbion. In regard bo ammunition, I should say thab ib should be supplied on a liberal scale, bo be fired off, say, half of it under conditions imposed by bhe commandanb, and the other half as bhe individual, himself may prefer. I am satisfied bhab in bhab way we should .get quibe as efficienb a force together as is necessary, and ab comparatively small expense. Now, in regard bo bhe naval forces, or rather bhe clauses of bhe B ill dealing wibh bhe possibiliby of' appointing a naval commandanb, and providing in obher ways in regard bobhe naval forces, I mighb say thab ib has always seemed to me to be absolutely foolish to talk of naval forces, ab any rate in New South Wales, under the circumstances bhat have exisbed bhere for was suddenly transformed some years pasb.

I 'am one of those who think that a navy would be a material advantage in connection with the defence of Australia. service ? belonging to tlie merchant service would be of much value in opposing a fleet of modern warships. They have proved useful as auxiliaries ancl as tenders, ancl probably if war occurred tlie Commonwealth Government would take possession of such of these merchant vessels as were necessary for its purposes; but to allude to such ships as forming a fleet, or as being in any sense a naval force, is wrong. I would point out to honourable members that as far as a navy is concerned there must be first of all a large initial expenditure, because a modern battleship costs at least £1,000,000, and those that are being laid down under the new programme of tbe British Admiralty are to cost a million and a-third. more than has been spent on battleships in the past. Ifc is not-only the initial expense that will have to be incurred, ancl which would involve some £30,000 or £40,000 a year for the payment of interest, but a large amount of money would have to be paid for fche manning of the fleet, especially in Australia, where you could not expect to get men afc Is. a day, iu fche same way as they can be obtained in England. AVe should have to maintain, practically, a full crew for each vessel, because to-day a mancompany, have to be imported from overof-war is such an intricate piece of machinery that experts are required in every department. AVe cannot nowadays go into the street of such a port as Hull, or similar ports in England, and impress'men for the navy, who, even though they have not beeu to sea, can do as good work in boarding an opponent as men who have been to sea for many years. In fche old days of Nelson, when fche fighting was on, it was not so much a matter of manningfcheship, as get ting men who could fight, as long as a large proportion of the men were seamen. Today, however, every man must be an expert. AVhen HMS. Orlando first arrived in Sydney, ancl I visited her, I was very much struck with fche fact that one could hardly move, even in the Admiral's cabin, for the machinery which was jammed into one's side everywhere. The whole vessel was, in fact, packed with cogwheels and infernal machines. All this emphasizes the fact that we cannot have anything like an Australian navy without incurring an I do not think vessels expenditure that we dare not face, and it is, therefore, of no use for us to discuss a question of this kind afc the present stage. I am quite prepared to admit that as far as outside defence and the protection of our commerce is concerned, we ought to be prepared to make some contribution towards the maintenance of something like an efficient British fleet. AVe make a contribution now, but I am afraid that the vessels that are here under the auxiliary squadron agreement are fast becoming obsolete, ancl that even tbe guns with which they are armed are not of sufficiently new design to be effective on active service. Years behind the times. she was more behind than that. There is another aspect of this matter to which I would like to advert, and that is fche establishment of a small arms factory, and also an ammunition factory' in conjunction with ifc, or at any rate, if not in conjunction with it, afc least under Government control. I notice that recently some plea has been put forward thatfcheColonial Ammunition Company should be quite sufficient to serve the purposes of the Commonwealth, and yet I am informed, on what seems to be very reI should hope not. liable authority, that the cartridge cases and most of the component parts of fche cartridges which are put together here by that sea under present conditions, and consequently if we relied only onfchafccompany, we should practically be in just as parlous a condition in the event of a general war as if we had no factory here at all. company. company.

349,Mr Crouch,It is purely a packing,54,Defence Bill Second Reading
350,Mr Watson,"Ifc is purely a packingnot only of ammunition, but of arms. Of course, they have to rely in times of emergency on outside firms as well, but they have been continually increasing their own establishments, with a view of being quite satisfied as to the class of work that is turned out. We know what the recent experience was with eighteen or. twenty batteries of guns which came from Germany only a little while ago during the South African war, and in many other respects the experience of the British Government has been the reverse of satisfactory. Contract work in a matter of, we might say, life and death, is very likely indeed to turn out anything but that which is desired. I remember reading an account of the battle Of Yalu between the Japanese and Chinese. An English officer, who had been engaged to instruct the Chinese in tlie running of the warships during that battle, went below with a view of getting something in the way of ammunition, and, though the vessel was supposed to be manned and ready for action, he found that all the ammunition on board was a number of practice shells supplied by a contractor, and filled with a charge of powder of about onehundredth part of what fche shells were supposed to contain, the balance being made up of sand. sufficient to burst the shell. There were a great number of instances of this sort; and I think that even if ifc does mean some preliminary expense to establish a factory, such a step would, in the long run, be a great advantage. If such a factory were established merely for the supply of ammunition necessary for proper practice wibh the various arms of fche service, the Government could not possibly lose anything, while the} would have a reserve in 7 times of emergency. Coming to the Bill itself, I must say thab 1 am nob very much impressed wibh bhe general idea of ib. I have heard one or two honourable members compliment bhe Governmenb on bhe shape in which bhe Bill has been introduced, but ifc seems to me to be a most slavish imitation of the existing order of things. and, apparently, in the other States also. insbance, bhab we should have had from bhe Whatever is, apparently in the eyes of Minisber some indication of whab he was the Government, is right. I had hoped going bo do wibh bhe obsolebe arms of bhe fchafc we were going to get something better service. There are bhe Lancers of New than what had gone before. I always believed Soubh Wales. bhab as one result of federation we oughb nob only bo geb a larger fighting force for bhe same money, bub that each individual unit should be of greater efficiency, because of the centralized control we should be able to exercise. But the Bill has gone on bhe same old lines in the way of having a small permanent force-wit h which we all agree-and bhen bhe militia, fche volunteers, fche riflemen, and even the cadets.

They always look well, ancl I believe they are efficient with their arm. But if-we are to judge by what has gone on in South Africa-if we are to judge by the opinions of.those who are qualiclass of men who have been appointed, in a fied to speak on the subject such weapons as the lance are obsolete. It is ' time we gave our men arms likely to be used in actual warfare, and insisted on their becoming effective. I contend that the day of the lance has gone, and that opinion is apparently held by the heads of the army in England where, as I saw recently, Lord Roberts has abolished exercises with the lance, the bayonet, and the sword. There is another' point on which I wish to word ""emergency"" as defined in the Bill. In this matter I absolutely agree with the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that it would never do to place in the hands of the Governor General the power to call out the military forces of the Commonwealth for other than actual or apprehended invasion. As that honourable and learned member rightly pointed out, not only are the permanent men, but the citizen soldiers, involved in any such action on the part of the Government. Another interpretation of the same word "" emergency"" allows the district commandant to call out the men under his control Under the Bill as it stands, it would be open to any hysterical madman who happened to be in charge of a district in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, or elsewhere, when the shadow of an approaching warship was reported as having been seen, to call out the whole of the forces under his command, without consulting any one, without putting, the responsibility for the act upon the shoulders of those who can be brought to account. When the Governor General calls out the forces, it is with the advice of his responsible Ministers, who are, of course, answerable to Parliament. I quite agree with the suggestion that the power of fche Governor General or of the district commandant to call out the forces in case of emergency should only be exercised in cases of actual or apprehended invasion. Another matter which I should like fco see definitely fixed in the B ill has reference to fche appointment of officers. Most of us who take an interest in military matters have had a very disappointing experience so far as theappointment of officers is concerned. One of the things which has tendedfcobring the volunteer force into disrepute in New South Wales has been fche large number of cases, as officers of the various regiments. Without any desire to throw contumely upon politicians, I must say, that some of the political officers have been amongstfcheworst offenders. pointment is rotten to the core. indeed rotten.

Onfe was -a lieutenant and the other a captain. Of course, it is not one uniform that costs this sum. These officers have a regular variety of uniforms.

363,Mr Watson,"Yes, there is nothing inaltogether. If w e are to have a citizen soldiery, the uniform should be of the simplest description, and .every officer should have his uniform found by the Government. There would then be no obstacle in tbe way of a man who might have all the points necessary to constitute a good officer, but who might be a struggling professional man. A young man who is just endeavouring to make his way in Ms profession cannot afford to spend. £ 8 0 or £ 1 0 0 in uniforms. Tbe present system does not offer that degree of encouragement which men who give their time to tbe service of the State are entitled to expect at the hands of the Government. I should like to see a clause inserted to insure that no person shall be appointed as an officer until he is over 21 years of age, and has served some time at least in the ranks either as a private or a non-commissioned officer. tion, but it is just tlie reverse now. that we shall not think of passing the Bill unless an examination be insisted upon. But apart from the mere technical examination, a man before being appointed as an officer should have had some little experience in the ranks. An officer is usually appointed to the lower grades first, but before he is so appointed I think he should have served a reasonable time either as a non-commissioned officer or as a private. In the German army-and although I do not agree with a good deal of what we hear in regard to tlie German army, about the necessity for a man being elected by the officers of the mess before he can join the regiment-the y have a very good rule, which provides that every officer, before he can be appointed, must serve a certain time in tbe ranks. here. A man from the ranks cannot possibly become an officer in our regulars. that occurred in my own State, where a man of good attainments and education, and with a splendid knowledge of drill, was proposed to be appointed as adjutant to a certain corps. He had been the sergeant major and drill-instructor for years in the New South Wales forces. It was proposed to appoint him adjutant to a newly-formed corps, which appointment carried with it the rank of lieutenant. When the proposal was made it was met with the fiercest opposition. Not only the head of the force, but every officer superior in rank, seemed to take a special interest in endeavouring to keep this man out of the position. It was only the firmness, of the commanding officer which pulled him through. judice. in question was of superior education, and a smart and efficient officer. I dare say that the honourable member for Dalley remembers the incident. I do not know that there is much else that I need weary the House with. I have attempted to give some of the reasons why, in my view, a citizen force should consist of those who are willing to serve the Commonwealth without any monetary consideration. AlthoughI am essentially a man who believes in peace, and who would suffer a great deal rather than bring tlie calamity of war and all that follows in its train upon the people, yet I r e I take it for granted cognise that there is no duty under modern conditions that ought so to impress itself upon us as that of being prepared to defend our country in case of peril. It is no use any one saying that because some of us have no property therefore we-have nothing to defend. AlthoughI have no property, I feel I have a liberty fco defend that is worth a great deal. I think that any man, no matter what his condition in life may be, is interested in the defence of the Commonwealth of Australia, and ought to be prepared to gi ve even liberally out of the time at his disposal in order to qualify himself to take an efficient part in that defence whenever circumstances render it necessary. -The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has found in this B i ll It is just the opposite an insidious attempt to introduce a spirit of militarism amongst us.

Necessarily it is the desire of all of us to live at peace. But how shall we best secure peace but by being prepared for war; prepared for invasion, prepared to defend ourselves, having as our motto, not anything that can be construed into aggression, but "" defence, not defiance.""

But a nation in arms-suc h as we have seen in that little country Switzerland, from time to time, where militarism does prevaila people united for their own defence"" defence not defiance "" their motto-is surely an 'admirable spectacle! construed into militarism as much as anything that can be found in this Bill. find citizens giving a certain time to soldiery. we are all of one mind in deprecating any idea of unnecessarily entering into war. We must all deplore .the fearful waste, the unprofitable waste of much treasure, which is the result of war, and we must still more deplore the loss of precious lives which must inevitably occur in any war. But we have obligations as a people, obligations to fulfil to ourselves primarily, and secondly to the Empire, and I hope those obligations we shall always be prepared to carry out in the future as we have done in-the past. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne says there are two vital questions arising out of this Bill. The first is what he calls "" the conscription,"" the other that of our' military serving abroad in the defence of the Commonwealth. Now, tbe conscription as we find it in the Bill, is merely what exists at present practically in every one of the States, I believe, and what exists in every country in Europe, and even in England, where there is the only speaking of the actual necessity for latent power of conscription,, only put in sending our men there. abeyance from year to year by an Act passed annually by the Parliament of the country. conscription in England.

Sir EDWARDBRADDO N If the honourable and learned member will consult the statutes and the -various authorities on the subject, I think he will find that there is' a latent power which, practically amounts to a conscription, which, as I have said, is only kept in abeyance by an Act annually passed by Parliament. to get the power of conscription in GreatI t may be Britain now. honourable and learned member has said that one of tbe vital questions raised by this Bill is whether our military are to serve abroad in defence of tbe Commonwealth. He has I am sure given some illustrations which no doubt have had the effect of throwing some amount of ridicule on the idea. He suggests that in the event of Bathurst being in danger we might send our troops to Afghanistan in order to defend Bathurst. I do not think that is ever going to occur; but will the honourable and learned member not see the most complete justification for our troops going to the assistance of the Empirei n the defence of South Africa. Every man voluntarily gave his consent to. it. But this proposal is to compel our men by their oath to do it, whether they like it or not. that the honourable and learned member will admit that we were amply justified in sending our men to assist the mother country in the defence of her territory in South Africa. ability of doing ifc. abilit}'. frame of mind, because the defence of South being torn away from the Empire, was as Australia as to any part offcheEmpire.",57,Defence Bill Second Reading

388,Edward Braddon,"There Sir EDWARD BRADDON -Then I doinvolves our most important trade. anosfc important point to which I am coming. It has been said truly that Great Britain -could afford to lose any one of her colonies, .rather than South Africa. South Africa is the great high road to these colonies, the .great high road to India. What would the Empire be if shorn of that which is the -main road to her various oversea territories ? -went there by his free consent. to keep to that position; we do not want to -compel men to go abroad against their will, the honourable and learned member will -allow me to pursue my own line of argument. I am trying to show how absolutely necessary it was that we who are vitally interested in the retention of South Africa -as part of the British Empire, should assist in defending it from attack. I do not think any one will cavil at that. Surely if that be so, if it be admitted that there was justification for sending our troops to South Africa for the defence of British territory, -there is justification for our arming ourselves with the power of doing the same on some future occasion. An honourable member has pointed out how insufficient, to his mind, this Bill is, in that it does not -extend any sort of attention to the great question of naval defence. On this point the Navy League of England, which has -done considerable work for the navy by keeping tbe Imperial authorities up to the mark in regard to that defence, writes as -follows :The League has been founded to educate public opinion, and by this instrumentality to impress upon the Imperial Government and upon the whole electorate of all parts of the Empire, the paramount necessity of the command of the sea for the honour and safety, and, indeed, the very existence of that Empire. The League further desires to urge its conviction that the navy is at present inadequate to secure this vital teer force without any militia, we shall need. 'This league asked of the pepple of all British possessions that they should aid them in seeing that our defence by sea is such as we -desire. I quite agree with those honourable members who point out the impossibility of -our having a fleet. A single first-class iron-clad costs, as has been said, from a million to a million and a half sterling, and it is hopeless to attempt to do what is absolutely impossible. Nor do I think we can do [203] what the honourable member for Bendigo suggested, if I understand him aright, namely, establish naval stations or bases at different points. I do not think we can do that. But we certainly might make some arrangement for having along our seaboard naval reserves, training our maritime population so that they might be of use in time of war, and also training them on board ships, which might be easily procured for that purpose. The youths and men thus trained would not only be educated for a We want seaman's life, but for other careers possibly more useful than that of a seaman. I believe if this B ill were-to make some provision of that character which would establish among us a naval reserve, to be drawn upon when occasion required, we should have done good work in that direction. The honourable member who preceded me spoke of the necessity of our having an arms and ammunition factory. The Government should take that matter into their serious consideration and see that such a factory is established afc the earliest opportunity. Ifc is an undoubted fact that is within my own experience, as Premier of one of the States, that at times ifc is exceedingly difficult to get ammunition as ifc may be required supplied by fche British authorities, or supplied by anybody else; and it would be beyond anything that one can conceive in the way of a misfortune that we should find ourselves in a time of stress and trouble without sufficient armaments and sufficient ammunitiona difficulty that might very well be avoided by the establishment of such a factory as that suggested. I am entirely with those honourable members who desire to see our army limited in its character as to its divisions. I think if we have a permanent force-as we must have a small permanent forcefcolook after our artillery and do the regular work connected with our small garrisons, such as they are-and in addition to that a volunhave done well. There is no doubt that in Tasmania, at any rate, the establishment of a militia-of a partly paid, not sufficiently paid-force , did away to a great extent with the finer spirit of volunteerism. Do not let us fall into the error at the outset of throwing cold water on the spirit of our people.

Let the volunteer regiments be officered by men who have served their time as privates in the regiments. I can speak on this subject with some amount of confidence, inasmuch as I at any rate saw that this was done in Tasmania, where privates who have served in the rank are promoted to the position of officers. Ifc was pointed out to me by my military advisers that possibly these officers being so promoted would find some littlesocial difficulty by reason purposes of war that are likely to arise as. of their earlier training, and so forth. But I waived that aside. To me the object was to see that the man who did his work well as a private in the ranks attained promotion, and was raised in the service' to which he belonged, and on which he shed lustre by the services he had rendered. think there is any particular reason why we should fall into tlie weakness and vanity of any particular frippery for our officers that will involve difficulty in regard to findBut improvements have been suggested by ing their uniforms. The best uniform is that seen in tbe field during the course of service; and as simple for the officers as for the men. Mr O'MALLEY -The only differencea brass button on tbe shoulder ! perience in the field, especially against tlie Boers, bas proved the desirability of there being no brass button that shall distinguish the officer from the private, because where there were such distinctions the enemy had occasionally a bad habit of picking out the officer and shooting him in preference to shooting thei private. While1 think we ought to regard the appointment of officers to the permanent forces as more particularly belonging to the Commandant or tbe Commander-in-Chief, the appointment of tlie other officers in the volunteer regiments should be left to some council or board of advice, upon whose recommendation the Governori n Council should make the appointments. should be dealt with in all cases very much as the civil service is to be dealt with under fche Public ServiceB ill ; that is to say, some responsible officer or body, such as a council, should make the recommendation, fche Governor General should confirm that recommendation, and Parliament should have in its possession a report from time to time, showing whether these appointments had been made in accordance with the recommendations or whether they had been disregarded, and the appointments not made.. As to the matter of drill of the volunteers, we have, I think, learnt a good deal by our experiences in South Africa. What we have to do primarily is to teach fche men toshoot, and whether they belong fco thevolunteer forces or to rifle clubs, let them have the best equipment possible, and the* best instruction. If we make good riders and good shots of them we will have for all our local purposes, or for any good material as can be put into the field. No doubt when the Bill gets into committee ifc will undergo considerable amendment. I do not myself complain that the Bill is based very much 011 fche DefenceActs of the various States. The GovernI do not ment no doubt thought they would be more secure with regard fco this measure if"" they founded ifc upon that which most of us. have had some considerable experience of. various honourable members from time to time, and no doubt these improvements will, after consideration, in many cases beadopted. For myself, I necessarily supporta B ill which has for its object the placing of fche Commonwealth of Australia in theExposition of independence in fche matter of defencewhich we ought fco occupy. We have assumed the responsibilities of nationhood ; we have vindicated our right to be called a self-governing people by omaefcion in South Africa.

I trust that the Government will give careful consideration to that aspect of the question, that they will not neglect any natural advantage which we may possess. It appears to me that that is the greatest safeguard that we have at the present time. I do not wish to labour this or any other point-and details, because that is more a matter for committee-with because I recognise that we must be prepared for any emergency. reasonably adequate naval defence it would still be possible for an army to be landed on our shores. pared against any such contingency, and I thoroughly agree with those who in that respect advocate reliance on our citizen soldiers. I believe it is in that way we can get the greatest possible amount of efficiency at a minimum cost. It is quite true that it will be necessary for us to keep a few thoroughly trained men in charge of our guns and forts. small skeleton army, which could be built up and recruited when occasion requires. But our chief attention towards fitting our young men for the defence of their country. somewhat disappointed when I heard the worthy and genial Minister for Defence deprecate the expense of rifle clubs. I have yet to learn of, and I certainly cannot find that his speech or the Rill indicates, any cheaper mode of defence. During the short time my Government were in office that branch of the service did not escape our attention. the number of members of rifle clubs in Victoria was considerably less than 3,000, but within less than a year we had increased the number to over 20,000. rifle clubs depends on the amount of practice which they have in the year. If we teach a young man to become an expert shot with a rifle he will carry the skill with him all through life, and one expert shot is very much more dangerous to an enemy than a dozen indifferent shots. I do not believe that we could incur a moderate expenditure in any way which would more conduce towards beneficial results than in teaching our young men how to become expert marksmen. ore composed of young countrymen who are already good horsemen. It is not'necessary for the State to teach them to ride, because almost every boy in the country practises horsemanship from his youth upwards. If we teach them to shoot we shall have at a minimum cost a body of men who will be good marksmen and good horsemen, and a very little drill indeed will make them very formidable opponents if we are ever required to call them. I am not going into up in defence of the country. I am thoroughly with those honourable members regard to our land forces, who have deprecated any great expense in costly uniforms. I have heard it said that Even with a if we take away the glittering uniform we take away all the inducements and attractions of military life. In our slender forces We should be prewe can very well spare those young swells who are only attracted to tbe army by the sheen and shimmer of gold lace, and as an honourable member here says-""bras s buttons."" AVe can find sufficient men for our purpose who will be attracted to. the force by their loyalty and a patriotic desire to serve their countiy in its hour of need, and these are AVe should also have a the men who will do the best work when they are called upon. I do not like the compulsory provisions of this Bill. It is a should be directed reflection on the loyalty of the people to introduce that principle, and I am perfectly I confess that I was sure that it is unnecessary and superflous. I am quite sure that if ever the defence of our own shores, and for that matter if the defence of the Empire should require it, the Australians will not be found cowering under the sheltering folds of the Union Jack, while others hold it aloft. If it should ever become necessary to rally to the defence of the Empire, there will be no portion of When we came into office the King's subjects who will do so more readily and more willingly than the Australians. And they have shown, I think, that the military ardour which distinguishes The cost of tlie great race from which they have sprung has not lost any of its fire or force under these southern suns. AAe need have no r fear in that respect, and it is not necessary to put any compulsory provision in the Bill. The more this is left to the free will of our people the more ready will they be to rally to the call of duty whenever they are required. I hope that the Government will carefully consider the matter. I only rose to draw attention to tlie one point, namely, that I Most of these rifle clubs fear that the Bill as it stands relies too much on our land forces, "" ancl that it",60,Defence Bill Second Reading
394,Mr A. Mclean.,"contemplates driving out the enemy after they have gained a footing rather than preventing them from landing on our shores. tend to detain the House at any length this evening. There are a number of matters in this Bill to which I should desire to address myself, but they are rather matters of detail in connection with its provisions than matters of principle, and what I have to say upon these points 1 will mention in committee. There are, however, a number of clauses in the B ill involving general principles to which I think it right to address myself now instead of waiting t ill a later stage. In the first place, I would like to refer to the point that has been so forcibly put by the honourable member for Gippsland. and that is the comparative value to us of our military and naval defences in the Commonwealth of Australia. There is no doubt of course that in a continent like ours, isolated from the rest of the world by many thousands of miles of ocean, there is an initial difficulty for any intending foe to overcome in bringing forces to our shores and landing them. But I would remind honourable members that there are many thousands of miles of coast line in our continent, and scores, if not hundreds, of landing places for an enemy, and while we have more acres than men as many square miles as men-it will be quite impossible for us to contemplate sufficient naval defences to enable us for one moment to neglect to provide completer land defences than are required in such a place as Great Britain. The Channel fleet and the fleet in the North sea can guard practically the whole of the British coast, but here no fleet except one of such enormous dimensions that neither' could Australia for a moment contemplate maintaining it nor the Empire contemplate supplying it , would be sufficient to secure our shores against raids. MrA . McLEAN -We always know from which direction the difficulty is to be apprehended. what source danger is to be feared, but we may not be able tell what particular roundabout route the danger may take to reach us, nor can we tell at what particular point of debarkation the danger will reach our shores. getting away that the enemy fears. MrM c CAY I am not desirous of posing as a definite authority on this matter, or of entering into an irregular discussion with other honourable members, but I do adhere to the general statement, which I think, at any rate, is correct, that the extent of our coast line renders our reliance on naval defence less satisfactory than if our coast line were smaller and our population larger, and that it is more necessary in our case than it . would be in tlie case of a country with a larger population and a smaller coast line to defend, to pay attention to fche land forces that stand behind the naval forces, which latter undoubtedly form our first line of defence. Consequently, although I agree with those honourable members who have expressed disappointment that the Minister and the Bill alike say practically nothing aboutournaval defence, nevertheless we must notforget the great importance of thesubjects that are dealt with in the Bill. I agree with the honourable member for Gippsland that it would probably be money well spent if we were to increase our contribution towards the maintenance of fche Australian squadron, and I agree with him that we must feel sure always, not only that Britain will help us, but that Britain recognises that we are prepared to take a reasonable share of the cost of the defences that are so necessary to us. However, I am a landsman, and know very little about seafaring matters, and I do not, therefore, desire to dwell on that matter any longer; but I do wish to say a little about the land forces under the system proposed in this Bill. Unfortunately, in this case, as in many others, we are possessed of a knowledge of how much we could do if we had the money and of how little money we have to do it with. I quite agree with those honourable members who have said -and I believe the feeling is general-that beyond the garrisons necessary to man our forts, and, perhaps, a small, instructional staff, the Commonwealth does not desire any permanent forces. There have been movements from time to time to have permanent infantry forces as a sort of standard and example for tlie other forces to attain to. I have had a certain amount of experience in these mattersI have been a member of the militia for fifteen years, and have always taken a keen interest in my work as far as I have had time to do it and I am satisfied that the advantages to be gained from having permanent forces other",62,Defence Bill Second Reading

397,Mr Higgins,"It is tbe difficulty ofthan the skilled mechanics, for that is really what they are, who are required to man our forts, and who would assist our non-garrison forces and help them to work according to proper lines, the expense of maintaining permanent forces would be greater than any corresponding advantages we could hope for. Therefore, on citizen forces of some kind or other Australia will have to rely, and intends to rely. If there were no other reason for our doing this, we could not afford the cost that would be involved in adopting any other system. I do not agree witb the honourable member for Bland that a militia force is not desirable. I quite admit that, as he has said, it will cost more than a purely volunteer force; but if the honourable member will look at his figures he will see tically the difference in cost between the volunteer ancl military forces is only the difference caused by the amount of pay that is given to tbe partially-paid men. That is practically the difference, although there may be a few shillings spent in other directions. doubles the cost. MrM c CAY in some cases-in New South Wales, for instance, where the forces seem to be tbe most expensive, according to the figures quoted by the honourable member. I feel that in the first place we should have voluntary enlistment, and I do not think there is any necessity for anything approaching conscription clauses, because I am satisfied that Australia will always furnish as many men as are required for any proper purposes connected either with the defences of our shores or with the larger matter of the defences of the Empire. I think in the first place that the labourer is worthy of his hire, ancl if we are going to appeal to what is called the patriotic spirit of the citizen to induce him to prepare himself in time of peace for fche work he will have to do in time of war, to undergofchenecessary training and keep it up, he is as much entitled to payment-and it cannot be very large because the circumstances of fche community will not permit it to be otherwise-as is any other man who prepares himself as a skilled workman for any occupation in which he may engage. Ifc seems to me that to appeal to a man's patriotismfcoprepare himself to defend us in time of danger is a variety of sweating. If the duties of defence were to' fall on all shoulders equally there would be no objection, but that will not be the case. Those who are prepared, and who do prepare themselves by training to defend us will be our first line of defence; they will be the men who will first go to the front, and it is a species of sweatingfcocall on the patriotic spirit of such men to induce them to do what others ought to do as well as they-wha t the men who are not; trained ought to do as well as the men who are trained.

And the more It about doubles tlie cost drills they get the better trained they will be. will get. member is quite wrong. In all fche forces I am acquainted with, there is a maximum amount of pay, and to the credit of the men, a very large number of them put in extra drills for which they do not get paid, thus showing that ifc is not fche mere money that attracts therii. In deed, ifc is obvious that the pay is not. the sole attraction.

Moreover, if we had to send a force on the inarch we have not the transport for them. We have not fche equipment for the men to cany. In Victoria we have not waggons for our field guns, and we have not field guns which are anything to boast about. Neither have we any reserve of ammunition. In fact, we have scarcely anything that we ought to -have, except the men. Doubtless, the same conditions prevail in the other States. I am afraid that the Commonwealth Government will have to face the fact that during past years some of the States have been cutting down their defence votes, with the result that the equipment of the forces has suffered. We are told that we have 60,000 men in the Australian forces, including the rifle clubs. I venture to say that we have not proper equipment for half of them. This is a point which we shall have to face. Whatever sized force we have, we must have the equipment available for that force.

Ifc will not be a recurring expenditure. Ifc will, however, be a large sum afcfchestart, and will amount to hundreds of thousands of pounds. £250,000 at least. MrM c CAY I am afraid that that amount will not cover it, but we shall be living in a fool's paradise if we have a large force of citizen soldiers, without having them to bike properly equipped for service.

The reason why I am glad to see the cadet force embodied in this Bill is that if we had to choose between drill and rifle shooting we should prefer that our men should be trained in rifle shooting. If we get-as many as possible of our boys trained in rifle shooting at school, or shortly after leaving school, when fchey become grown men they will be ready to go straight on with the field training.

Of course, we cannot have a senior cadet corps for 20 or 30 or 40 youths. That is the difficulty. we have only one senior cadet battalion, and that is in Melbourne. The Government should provide means by which the boys -could belong to the senior cadet corps as an auxiliary force, doing their work with the adult forces, and controlled by the officers of the citizen troops, so that from first to last they could be kept in touch with our system of defence. In this way the difficulty would be overcome.

I will admit that in Victoria, as I dare say in other States, we have prejudice coming up in connection the appointment of officers. I will say, however, that so far as my observation goes .in Victoria that feeling has been dying out very rapidly during the last few years. In the bafcvalion to which I belong, and taking the names of fche officers as fchey occur fco me, I find that out of fourteen, seven are engaged in professional or semi-professional work, and seven are engaged as employees in places of business or afc artisans, so that there is'nofc much sign of class prejudice there. I have only .instanced this case as relating to a corps that 1 know best. I believe, however, that this change is taking place in connection with most of our corps, and properly so, because I could never see fche connection between social position ancl rank in corps in a country like ours. We are supposed to give equality to all. Of course, one may find cases of ifc here and there, but on tlie whole it is dying out. Further than that, in my experience of the last fifteen years, I have found throughout the forces that there is a tendency to diminish the cost which officers The result incur in joining. As I said the other day, and as I said truly, although I was pulled up about ifc, an officer on joining fche forces In order to get is able to get his necessaiy outfit for about £1.5, which is not an unreasonable amount. Of course, I was referring at the time to fche bulk of our officers. I was not In Victoria alluding to the officers of the permanent forces.

I can point to dozens of officers who have been for years in fche forces, and who have not spent more than £ 1 5 or £ 2 0 on their preliminary kits.

We have here in Victoria 20,000 I members of rifle clubs according bo returns I however highly trained in drill and other manoeuvres they may be. I venture to say further, that man for man, the 20,000 are better marksmen than the 700 of the permanent force. mistaken there. men in the permanent force we will find that the crack shots amongst them are members of the rifle clubs as well, and men who have largely got their shooting practice as members of ride clubs, and not as members of tlie militia or permanent forces. If we look at the results of the rifle association meetings in this and in the other States we will find that members of rifle clubs are generally at the top in all competitions. In Queensland tbe rifle club movement has not taken the same hold on the people as ifc has done here, but that is not due to any want of enthusiasm there, and when we consider the conditions under ""which members of rifle clubs work there, -we will find that the force is as efficient ancl as competent to take fche field to-morrow as a good many of those who are enrolled and attend their drills regularly, but who when they get a rifle in their hands hardly know how to use ifc, except to shoulder ifc or present arms with ifc. In Queensland the members of the rifle clubsand I am speaking of something of which I have some little knowledge, as for thirteen or fourteen years I have been a member of a rifle club -ar e expected to provide their own uniform ; they are expected to attend a certain , number of squad drills, ancl to undergo a certain course of musketry instruction. They certainly get their ammunition at a little below cost price. They pay fid. per packet of ten rounds for ifc, but I do not know exactly whatfcheState pays for ifc. services what do they get 1 They get lian shores.

But the 60 rounds of that, should afc any time an attempt be ammunition and the capitation grant do not made to effect a landing in Australia, there go to tbe individual.

So there is worth their while. I have every faith in uo personal gain to members of the club the patriotism of tbe Australian citizen. I except in so far as they can qualify thembelieve that whether he is trained or not, if selves to win some prizes offered by the club I he is living in a country such as I have or by citizens who desire to encourage rifle shooting. WhatI want to say is that, in connection with this particular department, which has been taken over by the Commonwealth, I believe economy can be studied more, perhaps, than in connection with any other. The expenditure in the State from which I come has run up enormously of late, and I believe we can have a very much larger and more efficient force than we have in that State for far less money than we have been paying-me n who will be able to give a good account of themselves should the need ever arise, and men who will give their services willingly. I believe also that every man, whether he be in the volunteer force or fche permanent force, should have an opportunity of rising from fche ranks to the highest office in fche defence force. 1 hold the opinion that the leaders of men are not made, but that they are born, and that we are just as apt to find them in the ranks as amongst the commissioned officers. Men who have qualifications of fchafc kind, and who have risen in that way, will be followed far more readily than some jackin-office, who is most ignorant of what it is most essential he should know. If we had some such force as this, with some skilled men fco train them, I believe Australia would be found by outside nations of tbe world to possess a defence force ready to rise and repel any invader, and of sufficient strength and sufficient power to preclude any attempt being made to raid her shores. Ifc may be said unless we have a navy, our centres of population, being near the coast, will be liable to suffer incalculable damage, because we will not be able to protect them. Buti f we had a navy such as we would be able to institute afc the present time, we would be still liable to that, even though we were protected by such a force of the British navy as the Imperin1 Government could In return for their affordfcosend for the protection of Austra-",69,Defence Bill Second Reading

If we did, then we might go in for mercenary troops.

There is also a further statement made, and that is that these extra payments are to be continued up to the time of the establisheinent of the federal capital. If that is so it appears to me to be a very long time during which these extra payments will be made. It is also stated that it is the intention of all the Ministers, with the exception of the Attorney-General and the Treasurer, to remove themselves and their staff's to Sydney when Parliament goes into recess. I should like to know whether, if that is to be done, nil those transferred officers will get the same allowance according to grade, as is now it is said being paid. If all the staffs which are engaged in tbe different departments are transferred in that way, a very large amount of money indeed will be paid in allowances to officers receiving high salaries. There is also a further statement made, which appears to me to call for attention at the hands of the Cabinet, and that is in connection with the purchase of a large number of Inter-State tickets for conveying by railway under-secretaries, secretaries, and other officials, between tbe different States, from Friday to Tuesday morning. I was under the impression that these gentlemen were suffering from overwork. Friday to Tuesday morning, and it has been necessary to purchase these Inter-State tickets for their convenience, they cannot be as much overworked as we were led to believe. I should be very glad to have from the Prime Minister an answer in regard to the various matters which I have brought forward. rather surprised to see the statements that appeared in the newspaper this morningi t was the first I saw of it, anyhow-as to the allowances which have been made to a number of officers in Melbourne. I understood that the salary to be paid to each officer was to be the total amount which he was to receive. I for one object to the expense of tbe civil service being loaded in the way which the paragraph referred to would appear to indicate. It will be, I presume, for the Prime Minister to say what the real state of affairs is, but I should hope, anyhow, that some misinformation has got abroad so far as these allowances are concerned. It would seem from the paragraph that these allowances are to be continued even in the event of the officers going back'to Sydney. of that part of the paragraph there is a vast deal in it that is incorrect. I have not read it. members will agree that where a man receives a fair salary he ought to be prepared to bring his family, if he has one, down to the place where Parliament is sitting, because it is certain that we shall be here untilChristmasat the earliest. Theexpense of removal should not amount to a very great deal. The salaries are fairly liberal on the whole, so far as I can see, and there should not be any objection to a man bringing hisfamily here or coming here himself for tlie whole term of the session.

There is sonic truth and some inaccuracy in this paragraph ; but it is a fact that in certain cases living allowances extending as. high in one instance as £ 2 per week, and coming down as low as 10s. per week, were made by me on the officials leaving Sydney. That is to say, the allowances are not quite equivalent to 6s. per day in the highest case, and something like Is. 6d. per day in the lowest. That is the extent of what has been done, and that was only arranged as a temporary measure. The Treasurer and I have been in consultation with regard to the whole of this question, and it will engage the attention of tlie Cabinet, with a view to equalizing the remuneration and including everything in the salary. As to the other part of the matter, it has not been settled yet whether Ministers and their staffs wilt remove to Sydney at the termination of the session.

I may mention that yesterday, before I left SydneyI was engaged in public business for the whole day, until I left off to take my dinner and go to the train. . I think that that is a fair day's work for any man, and honourable members will understand that I cannot conduct such business without having a responsible officer with me. As to the remainder of this paragraph, the comparison of salaries of which I have heard is based upon an utterly flimsy foundation. It is enough, in order to show that, to take one illustration. The case of the President of the Senate is mentioned, and it is stated that in South Australia the President of the Senate received as President of the small Legislative Council there-smal l in respect of the population it represents-the sum of £600 a year, whereas he now receives £1,500 ayear here, including his member's allowance. Now, the course which has been taken with regard to the President of the Senate has been taken by this House in regard to the Speaker, and I think by a considerable majority, and the attack therefore is upon this House. I venture to say that if any one will look at this matter with the smallest sense of fairness, he will say that the comparison here should not be between what was received by the President of the Senate in South Australia or by any other officer in his ow.n State, but between tlie salary attached to the position in the Commonwealth and that attached to similar positions in the principal States. In adopting a fair basis of comparison in these matters open railwoy passes, while the principal we have to consider what the office is worth, and in that connection we cannot eliminate from consideration what is being paid to the occupants of offices of similar grade in the principal States. MrV . L . SOLOMON -The point is why were we not taken into the confidence of the Government and fully informed as to the salaries and allowances that were being paid? with that portion of the paragraph. I hive already disposed of that, and I am now referring to the comparison of salaries paid. Mr ""V. L . SOLOMON -That is not what was complained of. member's pardon. 1 know what was [204] complained of, because the representatives of the press have drawn my attention to the matter. I think that I have the right to say that the true basis of comparison for officers who have entered the Commonwealth services, is what is being paid for similar services in the States, assuming that in the States the salaries paid are not excessive. I . venture to say this, that if honourable members will take the salaries they have voted for the Commonwealth officers, and compare them with salaries, attached to similar positions in New South Wales and Victoria, they will see that the amount, voted, in nearly every case, for the Commonwealth offices, has been less than the amounts voted in the States mentioned.. That is of itself a sufficient answer to the charge that we ore paying extravagantly high salaries. I can assure honourable members that, although they may find ' r isolated instances which go the other way, and which are inevitable in organizing a new service, the merest comparison between the rates paid in Victoria and New South Wales-the two principal States-and in . the Commonwealth, which includes the whole of the States, will show that the Commonwealth is more reasonable in the allotment of salaries, that is in the. way of., economy, than the principal States of the Commonwealth. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -What is the good' of economy when other allowances aremode ? also that in the way of railway privileges the principal officers of those States have officers of the Commonwealth have not.. That is a strong fact to be taken into consideration when anybody wishes to form an , opinion as to whether Commonwealth-, officers on occasion should be allowed,, especially in attendance on a Minister, to. travel when a Minister finds himself obliged to travel. I hope honourable members, now will suspend their consideration of this -.' matter until the questions which they have raised have been considered by tlie Govern-. ment, I can assure them that there is no,, tendency to extravagance on the part of' the Government.
