Friday, 10 June, 19#>. took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. Minister whether representatives of the Australian Government met representatives of Australian . oil companies yesterday to discuss trade control of the distribution of petrol in this country? If such a conference vas held, will the right honourable gentleman inform the House of the decision that was reached? Is any form of control to be. instituted by the oil companies? ference was held between representatives of the Australian Government, including myself, and representatives of the oil companies at which the question of petrol supplies was discussed at considerable length. After the position had been fully explained, all representatives of the oil companies offered to co-operate with the Government in the various ways that were suggested to them. I do not know what the honourable gentleman means by "" trade control"". I do not think that there is any dispute regarding the powers in relation to the import of petrol into Australia that are conferred upon the Australian Government by the Constitution. The representatives of the oil companies were informed of the Government's intentions in regard to petrol imports. I shall not go into technical details of that matter at this stage. The oil companies have agreed to co-operate with the Government, as far as it is possible for them to dp so in the absence of appropriate legislation, by not encouraging the consumption of petrol and by arranging for the equitable distribution of available supplies. The Oil Industry Advisory Committee will meet at a later date to discuss one or two other points, but they are not very relevant to the main issue. Apparently the honourable gentleman reads the newspapers very carefully each morning. carefully as does the right honourable gentleman. honoraible member reads them mucb more carefully than I do. If it were not for the morning press,' I am quite sure that honourable gentlemen opposite would not ask nearly as many questions at question time as they do now. Is the days when the newspapers did not arrive in Canberra until the afternoon, question time was much easier than it is now. I have the Premier of New South Wales', who) as the senior Premier, would be chairman of any conference of State Premiere that .was convened to discuss this matter, intimating that he has received communications from' all the other State Premiers. Those communications show that the State Premiers consider that a conference should be held to discuss the problem that has arisen in regard to petrol. Some of the State Premiers hav* .suggested that a conference of Premiers should be held, and others have expressed the view that State representatives should confer with representatives of the Commonwealth. I have Bent telegrams to all of tbe Premiers intimating that, if tihe date is convenient to them, a conference will be held next Friday. I have not yet seen the replies and do not know whether the arrangement is suitable. If tbe conference is held, all of the facts will be placed before tbe Premiers or their representatives. I can say nothing further about the matter in the meantime, because that conference will have to decide whether some form of properly organized distribution of the petrol available to Australia is to be continued. be given to this Housei f they are to be given to the Premiers? member mean details? arrange for the details to be made available to honourable members in due course.

The power is not in the Constitution. plaint about the High Court's decision. What has happened in relation to the liquid fuel regulations is precisely what the Government said could happen overnight in relation to the prices control regulations, but which legal gentlemen on the Opposition benches said could not happen provided that this House was in agreement about the continuation of controls. of petrol is difTerent from prices control? done what the Government has long anticipated that it might do in connection with some of the National Security regulations. As a result, this Parliament has ao power over the distribution of petrol within Australia. Therefore, the subject can be discussed only with the people who have that power. As I have already indicated to the Leader of the Opposition, [ shall make available at the appropriate time such information as I am able to release. I shall supply the confidential information that is in my possession to the Premiers. Minister seen the reports of a statement made in London a few days ago, which were published very widely in the Australian metropolitan press, that petrol supplies in the sterling area are 4,000,000 tons short of requirements, and that additional supplies of petrol from the -sterling area can be made available to the Australian public only at the expense of petrol users in the United Kingdom, who are much more severely rationed than are Australian petrol consumers? If so, does uot the right honourable gentleman think that the recent statements made by the Leader of the Australian Country party uoncerning the alleged availability of petrol in the sterling area were definitely misleading, and that he should retract those statements! Information was good enough, at a late ing from Argentina essential food to hour a few nights ago, to show me a copy of, I think, the Melbourne Herald, which featured in very large black print the matters mentioned by the honourable member for Newcastle, and which rather surprised me. LaterI asked my press secretary to ascertain whether the Sydney Morning IIerald and other newspapers had been fair enough to publish the report, which came to them through the overseas press service; but, as I anticipated, the report did not receive very wide publicity. It is not usual for politicians who get into a mess to make retractions. They generally make a new false statement in order to distract attention from the earlier one. I am not hoping that the Leader of the Australian Country party will follow that practice. I am prepared to believe that the right honourable gentleman was misled by certain vested interests. ter aware that, according to cabled reports, the British Government, has offered 5,700,000 tons of petrol to the Argentine Government, whereas the quantity required to remove restrictions in this country is only one-third of 1,000,000 tons! Further, is the right honourable gentleman aware that the Government of the United Kingdom is supplying increasing quantities of petrol to Italy and that, owing to the repair of the Haifa pipeline, an additional 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 tons of petrol a year has become available? the meat ration available to the citizen? of the United Kingdom has been reduced to a very small quantity weekly, and thp British Government has to pay a price, which I consider even now is very high, for its purchases of meat from Argentina. The United Kingdom has entered into trade agreement with Argentina for the supply of meat, and, in return, will supply to Argentina certain products and commodities, including some oil products I understand that representatives of the United States of America have voiced some complaint about the agreement However, the Leader of the Australian Country party should remember that the",10,Petrol

I inform him that Italy does not receive auy refined petrol from British sources. it ble gentleman will allow me to proceed, [ shall tell him the truth as I know it. Italy receives a quantity of crude oils, »nd refines them. in Italy. the Opposition appear to be able to answer the questions that the Leader of the Australian Country party has asked. They should hold a session among them, Iv«M for the purpose of supplying the e information that the right honourable gentleman seeks. I am merely giving him the facts. For the purposes of clarity, [ shall restate tbe position. The United Kingdom, in order to obtain the minimum quantity of meat required to sus-ain its own people, has entered into a rrade arrangement with Argentina. Under that agreement, the United Kingdom will supply certain commodities, including some oil products, to Argentina in return for meat. I have not seen the details of the agreement between the two -sountries, and I am not aware whether rhe United Kingdom will supply crude or refined oil. However, I am aware of che position regarding Italy, because I cook thc opportunity a month ago to ascertain the situation. Italy does not obtain any refined petrol from any British sources, but it does receive --.rude oil, which it refines. The other -juestions that the right honourable gentleman has asked me are merely tire-tome repetition of a number of inaccuracies that have been given to him by interested oil companies, which apparently do not know what is happening between exchange control and the companies that own those subsidiaries. I have taken the opportunity to tell some of them that we have a full knowledge .vf the position. phones installed in Australia has recently been discussed in the press and elsewhere Can the Minister representing the Postmaster-General inform me of the total number of telephone installations made throughout Australia in 1938-39 and in-. 1948-49 respectively? been canvassed recently, and it was mentioned in this chamber as recently as yesterday in the course of a. debate. In 1938-39, 661,996 telephones were installed in Australia. In 1948-49, after eight years of good Labour government, 1,005,596 telephones were installed. After ten years,, during seven of which we were engaged in a war, the rate of installation hatincreased by 343,600 annually, or morethan 50 per cent. for the Army whether it is a fact that at Keswick Barracks, Adelaide, there is an: ordnance staff of 120 officers and men on weekly pay ranging from £8 10s. for privates to £20 for higher ranks? Are these men paid on a seven-day week basiceven though the depot is closed at weekends? Is it a fact that they are only doing work that was done by a staff of seventeen before the war, and that they are only busy for about two or three months of the year in making preparations for Commonwealth Military Force* camps? If those statements are correct will the Minister have investigation* made with a view to effecting economies? Keswick Barracks would be no different than that at any other ordnance store. ] am naturally unable to answer, at a moment's notice, the questions asked by the honourable member, but I shall secure the information that he desires and let him have it.

The amounts approved for that purpose were estimated to be sufficient to cover all the work that fche department would be physically able to carry out during the ensuing three years. I do not know how soon the new Brisbane post office building can be completed. That depends entirely on the Availability of labour and materials. plans, also. member mentioned that matter to me personally the other day, I discussed it with the Postmaster-General, and he said chat an endeavour would be made to push -m. with the plans.

For a considerable time there has been a lag of from twelve to fifteen months in the sup* ply of that range of products, and, if our supplies of sheet steel are to be cut by 40 per cent., as the figure of 25,000 tons would imply, the supply of materials for housing needs, which is already inadequate, will be almost halved, and the delivery dates, I am informed, w i l ! be considerably delayed.

It seems absurd that, at a time when we are' proposing to send out of Australia 25,000 tons of steel billets to be fabricated into tinplate, we are importing thousands of tons of steel. A plate in Australia ? could hot do so with the equipment thai ts available. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether at the present time tinplate should take priority of steel products which are used in the housing programme.

72,Mr Holt,"Tinplat e can now be usedformerly it could not be used? In view of the improved tinplate position, it may be possible to reduce the quantity of steel billets that it is proposed to export. Perhaps the Governmeut has already decided to do so. I understand that the tomato and fruit harvests this year are expected to be smaller than those of last year. The explanation that has been given of the fact that tinplate can now be made available for purposes for which formerly it was not permissible to use it is that the quantity required for the canning of the tomato crop and the fruit crops will be less than was expected. It seems that the demand for tinplate now is not so great as it was when the arrangement to export steel billets was made. I hope that the Minister will clarify the points that I have raised. Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [11.80] -In return for the steel billets that are being exported to the United Kingdom we are to get, and are getting, tinplate. The honorablo member for Pawkner( Mr Holt) has suggested that because the demand for tinplate now is not so great as it was previously, some of the steel billets that ,are destined for export should be used for the fabrication of products that are needed to implement the housing programme. Every honourable member has his own view of the priority that should be given to certain needs. I doubt if the honourable member for Indi( Mr exported. McEwen) would accept the proposition that has been advanced by the honourable member for Fawkner. bring me .into the argument. honourable gentleman into it deliberately, because it is always good to have a man on your side if you can pull him in. The honourable member for Indi would have had something to say if supplies of tinplate had not been available in Australia when fruits were ripening in the Goulburn Valley. At one period we scoured the world in order to obtain tinplate for our canning industries. The honourable member for Fawkner has said that the Commonwealth Canning and Tinplate Board is now making tinplate freely available for purposes for whioh ordinarily it has not been made availablo fn recent times. freely available. I did not say that it is freely available. tion for that. It is not an explanation that I like to give, and it may be that I ought not to give it, but I shall accept the risk of doing so. Of the tinplate obtained from the United Kingdom, a greater proportion than is normally the case wae found to be of inferior quality. Some of it was of such a quality that it was not possible to use it for ordinary canning purposes. In those circumstances, the board had on its hands a quantity of tinplate that could not be used unless it was made available for purposes for which ordinarily it is not used. The honourable gentleman has suggested that, because the demand for tinplate is not now so great, as it was previously, the Government should re-examine the position to see whether it is possible to reduce the volume of exports of steel billets. I hope that the explanation that I have given has clarified the position. that I am not attacking the original decision to send steel billets overseas. I am asking whether, in view of the changed circumstances, the Government intends to reconsider the quantity that should be the honourable gentleman why tinplate seems to be more freely available. The reason is the inferior quality of a part oi the product that has been supplied to ue by the United Kingdom. That defeet will be remedied in due course. When it is rectified the anomaly will not exist. The honourable gentleman has also pointed out that we are importing steel products from France and other countries and exporting steel billets to the United Kingdom. It is not easy to arrange three-cornered deals. With regard to the United Kingdom, tinplate is a fabricated product and is, therefore, much morevaluable to it than the basic material, steel, that we are sending to it.

79,Mr Dedman,"I have explained to to the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom sending tinplate to Australia, and France sending steel rails to Australia, the United Kingdom benents from using its manufacturing industry to give an added value to a particular product and thus it is being assisted to balance it3 payments. It may seem wrong that this three-cornered exchange should continue, but the Australian Government can do aot hing about that. We are helping the United Kingdom by allowing it to use its manufacturing resources to produce « valuable product that we need. Because that involves us iu sending c.ertain basic products to the United Kingof demand and that many American oil iom, it is again to our advantage that we thould permit the importation of steel rails from France or any other, country from which we can get them. [11.36] -Honorabl e members are aware that I have frequently expressed interest in. the development of Australia's petroleum resources and an anxiety to iecure for Australia a degree of independence of the big world oil companies on srhich we are now totally dependent. I have urged the Government to acquire -iii rights as near as possible to Australia activities by governments and private in lands that are known or thought likely io contain oil deposits. The TEM FOE ARY ( Mr Sheehan) -Order! The committee is dealing with the Department of Supply ind Development. The honourable member will be able to discuss matters connected with the Department of Shipping and Fuel later. considering the subject from the point of new of development. I believe, first, in the development of our own resources in Australia and Australian territories. A »reat deal of research has been carried out here, and I am still hopeful that we ihall obtain good results. However, we should not neglect sources of supply in other countries near Australia, and I again urge the Government to turn its attention to this matter. Only yesterday the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) told me that it was impossible for the Government to do very much about securing an interest in possible oil-bearing areas in other countries because the governments of those countries were jealous of their , assets and were not anxiouB to grant oil rights. I have here the Oil and Petroleum Year-Book for 1947, which describes the expansion of foreign activities in oil-bearing countries. Tremendous development has occurred in recent years in those countries close to Australia including particularly Indonesia, Borneo and the Middle East countries. The book to which I have referred states that the expansion of crude oil supplies outside the United States of America is proceeding rapidly to meet the actual and prospective increase companies are entering foreign fields. That, being so, surely there can be no good reason why Australia should not secure interests in those fields. The potentialities of the Middle East are enormous. According to the information in this book, the development of those areas will in due course relieve external pressure upon production in the United States. Output from Persia increased from 16,S00,000 tons in 1943 to 22.695,000 tons in 1946. Production has increased on a comparable scale in other parts of the world as the result of companies. Production figures in the Near East are mounting steadily. Saudi and Irak 33,500,000 barrels annually. Bahrein Island provides 8,000,000 barrels a year, and the output of other areas is increasing as pipelines are extended. The fact is that the governments of certain oil-bearing countries are allowing foreign organizations to extend their activities. That discounts the Prime Minister's assertion that they are reluctant to grant oil rights. There is no satisfactory reason why this Government should not seek to gain concessions for Australia. The Oil and Petroleum Year-book shows that the Royal Dutch and Shell combines have controlling interests in oil ventures in Venezuela, Ecuador, Trinidad, the Netherlands West Indies, Colombia, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Cuba, Irak, Egypt, the Netherlands East Indies, Borneo and Roumania. If they can secure such wide interests, surely Australia can gain entry somewhere in those fields. Many new oil",20,Depaktaient Of Sttpttv And Development

81,Mr Bernard Corser,"I amcompanies have been formed. I do not pose as an authority on the operation of Oil companies, because 1 know that it is most difficult to ascertain the relationship of various companies and their true production figures. Nevertheless, I have been able to refer to some interesting information which shows that interests that Could have been gained by Australia have been taken over by either foreign governments, or foreign interests. The AngloIranian Oil Company Limited was originally granted concessions over an area of 100,000 square miles. Why could not Australia obtain concessions in Persia? Since 1940, that company's concessions have been extended over areas to include 56,000 square miles, 40,000 square mile, 100,000 square miles and 80.000 square miles in various localities near the Persian Gulf. The Arabian-American Oil Company holds long-term concessions from the Government of Saudi-Arabia covering approximately 430,000 square miles and has preferential rights over additional areas totalling 177,000 square miles. Yet the Prime Minister says that foreign 'governments are reluctant to allow outside interests to secure oil concessions! The production of oil from the ArabianAmerican Oil Company's leases increased from 7.800.000 barrels in 1944 to ! 60,0 00.000 barrels in 1946. While this , ""expansion is going on, the Australian Government sits back and does nothing except ration supplies. The Shell combine, through its interest in the Astra Bomana Societe Anonyme, operates in no fewer than ten different oil-fields in foreign countries. roleum Oompany Limited, of Canada, has 'shown us what we could do if we tried. In 1939 it had rights covering 100;000 acres of Bahrein Island in the Bahrein Gulf. away from those oil-fields than is Australia. Furthermore, its need is not so urgent as is ours, because tliere are great oil-fields in 'Canada and nearby in the United 'States of America. 'Canadian company has now secured Concessions covering not only the 'area that it held in 1939 but also the 'remainder pf the island and all other latads, islands, -shoals,reefs, waters, and submerged ruled hy the Sheikh of Bahrein.. Mr Bernard Corser. The island, which lies ahout halfway up the Persian Gulf towards the Arabian coast, is approximately 32 miles long and 9£ miles wide. In 1946, which is the latest year for which figures are available, these Canadian interests produced 8,000,000 barrels of oil and since then have increased production every month. Other companies that I shall mention are the British-Borneo Petroleum Syndicate Limited and the British Petroleum Company Limited. The latter company is interested in properties in Burma, Trinidad and South Africa where it holds its own rights, and through the Rangoon Oil Company Limited, in which it has 98 per cent, of the issued capital, it holds 450 oil-field and oil-well sites. There are also the British Consolidated Oil-fields Limited established in Canada in 1918 which holds concessions in South American countries, including Venezuela; Burmah Oil Company Limited, which through subsidiary companies owns oilbearing lands in every great oilfield in the east; and the Canadian Eagle Oil Company Limited, which has rights in countries in South America, and also in Cuba. Australia does not need to go as far as that to obtain oil-bearing territory. There are also the Carribean Petroleum Company as well as the Ceram Oil Syndicate Limited, which holds licences to search for oil in the island of Ceram, Netherlands East Indies, and now receives royalties on production from the Royal Dutch-Shell interests. While these companies have heen in operation snapping up oil-bearing lands Australia has The Bahrein Pet'been standing idly by and has done nothing, -even in the Netherlands East Indies, which lies so cios© to it. We are told that the nations which own oiibearing lands are reluctant to give conCanada is considerably farther 'cessions to other countries, yet we have the Iraq Petroleum Company Limited, with the sole right for 75 years to exploit -certain oil-fields, east of the River Tigris, covering an -area of 32,O0O square miles. : That So we could go on through the list of foreign companies that have gained concessions in many parts of the world. Yet, in the time of the Curtin Administration in the early part of the last war, I asked the then Prime lands in the territory Minister to Beei f it ""was possible nn any peace settlement to ensure that Australia acquired some rights to oil-bearing territory in the Indonesian area. So far, unfortunately, we have done nothing to secure for ourselves within our own country the oil that we so badly require. The importance of oil power to Australia is emphasized more and more every day, particularly since the New South Wales coal-miners have fallen down on their responsibility. It is essential that we seek resources other than coal to provide the power necessary for the country's industries. Petroleum must replace the use of coal to a great degree, as must also hydroelectricity. I hope that the Government will try to acquire some rights in the Middle Eastern countries such as Iraq and Persia where there are such rich oilbearing lands, or acquire some rights in Dutch New Guinea. We must make ourselves independent of world oil companies which this year made £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 profit from the increased prices of petrol. We shall have only ourselves to blame if we allow those great combines to rule the destinies of our country by increasing the costs of production in Australia through the ever increasing prices that they force us to pay for petrol. Instead of doing something to ensure that we shall have supplies of petrol under our own control, this Government is concentrating on socializing successful industries belonging to people who have worked hard and invested much money over a long period of years so as to make the industries which employ so many people successful. We should also have an eye to our future defence in connection with the desirability of having our own sources of petrol supply. We should make it clear that we do not intend to be battened upon by rich foreign petrol combines. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Sheehan) -Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired. I wish to discuss the matter of tinplate that has been raised by the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Holt), f hope that the Minister, when giving consideration to that honourable member's remarks about tinplate, will keep in mind the effect that a reduction of supplies of tinplate fpr canning purposes would have on the activities of many primary producers. RecentlyI asked a question in this House regarding thedesirability of increasing the supplies of tinplate. I emphasized then the great need of tinplate for the canning of celery. The celery-growing industry is one whose product has to be used very quickly. If not canned or preserved, it must be placed on the market for sale very soon after it is picked. For a long period celery-canning was not included among the list of industries for which the use of tinplate was permitted. It was placed on the list recently. I am referring to this matter at the request of primary producers and not of canning factories. Tinplate is also required by the orange-growing industry in the irrigation areas of South Australia, where a great part of that State's orange crop is grown. After the new electoral boundaries come into force, those areas will not be represented by the honourable members who now represent them. The representation of that district in the next Parliament will be entirely new, and that is why I mention this matter at the present time. South Australian orange-growers are mainly ex-servicemen, most of whom served in World WarI . l f we are to consider properly the question of whether housing is of more importance than the importation of tinplate we must go much further into the matter than the bare question of whether one is more important than the other. It cannot be denied that it is important to Australia that those primary producers should obtain reasonable prices for their produce on a ready market. Consideration must be given to the maintenance of adequate supplies of tinplate, because food supplies generally are involved. As honourable members know the works of Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited are located at Osborne in my electorate.. Large quantities of the soda ash and other commodities produced there are used in the manufacture of glass containers. If sufficient tinplate is not available for the making of cans for foodstuffs greater use will have to be made of glass jars for that purpose. It must be remembered, however, that considerably greater expense",21,Chairman Arabia Now Produces 60 000 000 Barrels
82,Mr Thompson (Hindmarsh) [11.50].,"will be involved if foodstuffs are to be sent for long distances in glass jars. As extra shipping space would be required, consideration must be given to the matter of deciding whether steel should be provided for the making of tinplate in preference to steel for housing fixtures. It is difficult to deal with these two aspects of the matter separately because they are interlocked. I am quite sure that the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) did not mean to prejudice the primary producers in any way by his reference to this matter. I sincerely hope that the Minister will take steps to ensure that the greatest possible quantity of tinplate shall be made available for the manufacture of cans for food. There has been a tendency in South Australia to lay much stress on ultimate food value rather than the economic value to the producers. Many letters have been published in the South Australian newspapers about the practice that has developed of growers sending currants and sultanas to the distilleries instead of drying them for food. It has been stated that those fruits are not being used to the best advantage. The grower eannot be blamed for sending his produce to the distilleries if by so doing he receives household requirements. Many buildings an additional £5 a ton. It is but human nature for the growers to secure the best prices for their produce. If the food processors are not supplied with sufficient tinplate for cans I doubt whether they will be prepared to use costly substitutes. If the most satisfactory containers for food cannot be supplied to the manufacturers it 'may be that in time food now obtainable will disappear from the market. Although many honourable members regard the electorate of Hindmarsh as a secondary industry district only, the majority of glass-house tomatoes grown in South Australia are cultivated in that electorate. The bulk of the tomato-growing districts in my present electorate will not be in the new electorate of Port Adelaide that I hope to represent after the next general election. It is therefore incumbent on me to impress upon honourable members that the people in those areas desire that the existing means of marketing their products shall be preserved. I therefore ask the Minister to bear in mind the needs and just rights of those primary product rs when considering Mr Thompson. this matter, particularly if the tinplate is of first quality which could be used for purposes other than the making of containers. I point out that most of the men who are growing oranges, celery, and tomatoes are only .in a small way of business. Their interests should be protected to thc greatest possible degree. Like the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) I have received a protest from the Builders and Allied Trades Association in Melbourne with relation to the export of large quantities of steel from Australia. If tinplate was not badly needed in Australia there would be ne criticism of this export. But, as th* honourable member has said, there is a scarcity of that commodity to-day. Certainly we have to look after the canning industry, which is one of our greatest export industries, but let us consider what is happening. In answer to a question the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) admitted recently that £2,500,000 worth of steel products had heen exported from Australia, in recent times. Those products included piping, lighting fixtures, galvanized iron and all kinds of are being held up because of shortages of materials. In some instances only small articles are involved. As mentioned by the honourable memher for Flinders( Mr ""Ryan) there is an acute shortage of nails. Although, wire factories are unable te obtain wire, if the Government wants it supplies are made available. Screws, also, are almost unobtainable. I know from my own experience that it is impossible to obtain galvanized guttering unles* the order is placed a year in advance. We have in Australia a steel mill equal in efficiency to any mill in any part of the world. It is making steel as cheaply as that commodity can be produced in any other country, except India. That mill is capable of producing over 1,000,000 tons of pig iron a year. At present, because of coal troubles, output is down. The mill is running at only 75 per cent, or 80 per cent, of capacity. Every strike on the coal-fields means less eteel because it takes two tons of coal to make a ton of steel. A state of chaos is rapidly developing because the Government has permitted the export of housing fixtures to New",23,Chairman Arabia Now Produces 60 000 000 Barrels
83,Mr White (Balaclava) [12.1],"Zealand and other places in the Pacific without first providing for the requirements of this country. Last week I asked the Prime Minister whether a report that the Australian Government had authorized the New South Wales Government to import a large quantity of steel from Japan was correct. astonishment the right honourable gentleman admitted that the report was correct. C had hoped that the report was wrong. That is an outstanding example of the crazy control being administered by the Government. We are exporting 25,000 tons of steel to Great Britain and importing from Japan large quantities of steel with which to make dog spikes for use in railway construction. It is obvious that the community suffers whenever the Government meddles in commerce. The Minister should give the House an assurance that Australia's requirements of steel, galvanized iron, and wire netting will be fully met before any more permits to export those commodities are issued. Yesterday, the necessity for the provision of a new automatic telephone exchange in Melbourne was debated in this House. One need only ask any telephone subscriber connected to the Windsor manual exchange his opinion of the present service to be convinced of the urgent necessity for a new automatic telephone exchange in Melbourne. When reinforcing rods are used in government buildings, as in the additions to Parliament House, and other buildings in Canberra, while ordinary citizens cannot get houses to live in, it is clear that there is something wrong with Government policy. I am glad that the honourable member for Fawkner raised this matter because it emphasizes the pass to which this Government's policy has brought us. disagree with the honourable member for control of all major imports, is in the Balaclava ( Mr White), who said that hands of the Government, the Governthe more the Government tried to assist ment cannot plead that private industry industry the worse the position became. is responsible for fche anomaly. Only last week the Government, in response to representations by me, granted assistance to the refrigeration industry in does not want us to get tinplate for the South Australia, enabling it to develop, primary producers. and to provide employment for more people. During the war, a South AusPost-war Eeconstruction ( Mr Dedman) tralian company, at the request of the Government, embarked upon the manufacture of fork-lift trucks because, at that time, it was impossible to get such trucks from Great Britain. The fact that the company was able to supply the trucks was of great assistance to the To my Government, and contributed materially towards relieving the shortage of labour. The Government helped the industry in every possible way. Honourable members will realize that to establish an industry of that kind from the ground up is a big undertaking, as I know from my own experience. Fork-lift trucks are now being imported from England, and I do not complain of that. My policy has always been, Australian goods first, and after that, British goods. However, I have been informed that fork-lift trucks are being brought to Australia from the islands. They were bought up by speculators, not for immediate use, but to be held in stock. I should like the Minister to tell me whether dollars were used for the purchase of the trucks, or whethei they were bought through the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. The matter is important, because the trucks a e coming into competition with Ausv tralian and British trucks, and the Australian industry provides employment for a considerable number of persons. the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt)' mentioned tinplate and the export of steel billets, I am sure that it was not in his mind to propose anything to the detriment of the primary industries by opposing the importation of steel. He was pointing to the extraordinary anomaly, which the Government has not yet explained, of Australia exporting steel billets and importing steel rods. How the Government can justify such behaviour in a so-called planned economy I cannot say.",24,Chairman Arabia Now Produces 60 000 000 Barrels

87,Mr Mcewen,"The Minister forwell knows that that is a fatuous interjection. He knows that there is no member of Parliament more personally concerned than I am with getting tinplate for primary industries. It is well known that the great canning industry of Australia is concentrated in my electorate, and that the greatest canning factory in the British Empire is in the principal town which I represent. I do not claim to be more interested than others in the primary producers, hut I will not admit that I am any less interested, a fact which my speeches in this House fully demonstrate, and I am certainly eager to ensure that enough tinplate is obtained for the canning industry. I believe that the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction British industry an injustice when he said that the surplus supply of tinplate in Australia was due to the unfortunate fact, that a considerable amount of British tinplate that had been imported into Australia was of inferior quality. The Minister said that perhaps he should not mention that fact, but then he went on to do so. As a matter of fact, British tinplate in Australia is not of inferior quality, but it is of a different type from that which modern, fast-running, automatic American can-making machinery is able to use. The older kind of can-making machinery was designed to use hot-rolled tinplate. American manufacturers, who lead the world in canning and machinery, have devised a thinner type cf tinplate, which is known as ""cold rolled "", but, unfortunately, much of the British tinplate cannot be used in that machinery. inferior to American tinplate, and I should hate to think that any such stigma attaches to British industry. of the unsuitability of the American machines to process British tinplate, the United Kingdom has had to allocate American dollars to import cold strip. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited has already announced that it proposes to expend considerably more than £1,000,000 in the establishment of a cold strip mill at Port Kembla, which will be operated by Australian Iron and Steel Limited, which is a subsidiary of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited. We all hope, I am sure, that that undertaking will be able to provide all Australia's requirements of tinplate. Because of the efficiency of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, I think that we may look forward to Australia eventually becoming an exporter of tinplate. Since we are discussing the proposed vote for the Department of Supply and Development, I desire to express a general, but important, viewpoint. As its title implies, the department is concerned with matters relating to supply and development. In the present postwar era I cannot imagine anything that should engage our attention more than planning for the development of this unwittingly did country, which also involves consideration of our capacity to absorb more population. Indeed, our continued possession of this continent depends on the development of Australia and on our capacity to populate it. I believe that the preparation and implementation of great and far-sighted plans for the development of Australia should rank as the highest responsibility of any administration. Instead of the Department of Supply and Development having but minor rank in the priority of Commonwealth departments, and instead of its functions being diffused through a number of other departments, its functions should be enlarged to cover an infinitely wider field. That department should exercise fast automatic can-making more direct control over those aspects of the national economy that are connected with the nation's development. The time has come for the establishment of a special ministry of state to deal with British tinplate is not matters relating to the development of the vast potentialities of this country. It is inevitable that certain national services Because such as the railways should be initiated and administered by the Government. That statement may, of course, be .regarded as supporting socialism, but I emphasize that the undertakings I have in mind serve the whole community. In anv event, we all know that we have attained our present stature and strength as a British community because of the industry and initiative displayed by private enterprise. I suggest that the Department of Supply and Development",25,Chairman Arabia Now Produces 60 000 000 Barrels
88,Mr Mcewen.,"should concern itself with all those matters that are admittedly the function of the State. To-day we desperately need developmental railways, and if ever railway gauges in this country are to be standardized that can come about only under the leadership of the National Government. many directions in which private enterprise could be assisted by a powerful and mental organization. At the present time we are considering a vast scheme for the development of the rich potential resources of the Snowy Eiver. Instead of that project being the concern of the Department of Supply and Development, it is placed under the Eiver Murray Waters Commission, whose primary function is the supply of water for irrigation purposes, and which functions under the direction of the Department of Works and Housing. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization, which has an important influence on the development of this country, is placed under the supervision of the Prime Minister's Department for matters connected with finance, and under the Department of Post-war Eeconstruction for general administration. Although the Commonwealth Eailways are under the administration of the Department of the Interior, the project for the standardithe only member of the Government from zation of railway gauges is the concern of the Department of Transport. Every member of the House, irrespective of his political allegiance, is, I am sure, desperately eager to provide meat for the people of the United Kingdom, who are so badly in need of it. We all know that, although there are scores of thousands of fat cattle in northern Australia, the hungry people of Great Britain cannot receive an ounce of meat from them because of the lack of a developmental railway. If we had a railway to serve that area those scores of thousands of beasts could be transformed into meat, which would appear on the breakfast tables of the British people within three months. As it is, we know that no meat from northern Australia will reach England before at least eighteen months. Instead of prime fat cattle being trucked from the Barkly Tableland or Victoria River Downs to a seaport fpr shipment abroad, they have to be walked a distance of 1,000 miles, by whioh time they are reduced to skeletons and have to be refattened. My colleague, the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain), has been tireless in advocating the construction of a developmental railway Nevertheless there are through the Northern Territory. far-sighted developfor the Interior before the war. Why did he not construct a railway? the Interior before the war, and the planswhich I presented to the Parliament to provide for the development of 'theNorthern Territory are on record. nothing more! bers opposite, would cease chatteringj amongst themselves the honourable member to complain about the lack of a railway now able to continue my remarks free of interruption from the Minister from Western Australia.

97,Mr Eyan (Flinders) [12.26],"IWales and in the Australian Capital Territory it is possible to obtain nails in large quantities, in Victoria it is imposuntil a more suitable time. Two questions sible to obtain nails for either love or money. When Victorians need nails they have to obtain them from New South Wales and pay a freight charge of £12 10s. a ton. manufactured ? The heavy freight charge involved greatly increases the retail price of nails general building purposes and for the and adds to the cost of home-building and other activities in which nails are used. the honourable member cover sea or rail freight? fot motor transport. RecentlyI asked the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) what authority is exercised by the Government to control the distribution of nails. The honourable gentleman confirmed what I already thought to be the case when he stated that the Government had no direct power to deal with the matter. All that it does is to approach the manufacturers of nails and other steel products and endeavour to arrange a gentlemen's agreement under which distribution is made throughout Australia on a reasonable basis. I have made some inquiries to ascertain what lies at the bottom of the maldistribution of this essential commodity. In Victoria there are some four plants for occasions in this chamber that, through the manufacture of nails. One is working part time; one is working almost to full capacity, but the remaining two, I believe, are not working at all. The low production of nails in Victoria is due to the fact that steel wire, which is the raw material from which nails are made, cannot be obtained from New South Wales. The output of the only Victorian factory now working almost at full capacity is, I understand, entirely already written to the State Premiers absorbed by the Australian Government. That factory is able to remain in production only because the Government provides the steel wire. Its output is used by the Government on all sorts of Commonwealth enterprises in Victoria, some of which are necessary, such as war Berviee homes, but others, consisting of expensive and completely unnecessary government offices, could well be deferred need to be answered by the Government. The first is: How does the Government, which states that it has no authority to control the production and distribution of steel wire, manage to obtain the rav. material to enable one Victorian factory to meet the Government's needs? The second question is: If the Government can obtain steel wire for its own purposes, why can it not also obtain wire for general public in Victoria? These questions must be answered. Steps should he taken by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction to call a conference of manufacturers of steel wire and of nails with a view to ascertaining whether arrangements can be made for Victorian nail manufacturers to obtain larger quantities of steel wire than they are now able to get. At present many activities are held up because of the shortage of nails. Unless a Victorian knows somebody with influence in the industry he is unable to obtain nails at all. I trust that the Minister will be good enough to look into this matter so that this unsatisfactory state of affairs may be remedied. Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [12.32] I rise solely to deal briefly with tbe remarks made by the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan). I have explained on several the Division of Industrial Development of my department, an endeavour is made to obtain a fair allocation of steel products to all States. Earlier that was done by national security regulations under the defence power. The recent decision of the High Court, however, has demonstrated that the defence power can no longer be relied upon for such purposes. The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has stating that the Commonwealth is no longer prepared to control the allocation of steel and other products because it no longer has constitutional power to do so and suggesting that the States should reach some agreement to assume control over these matters. Replies have been received from some of the Premiers but",27,Chairman Arabia Now Produces 60 000 000 Barrels

102,Mr Dedman (Corio,"Minister forao decision has yet been made that the States should exercise such control. I desire to make it perfectly clear that, because of the recent judgment of the High Court, and of views which we had reached prior to the announcement of that judgment, the Government is not able to control the distribution of steel or other products between the respective States. It is the responsibility of the State governments to make such arrangements as they can to obtain their requirements of such products. The honourable member for Flinders referred to what he called the mal-distribution of nails throughout the Commonwealth. The honourable member rightly related the maldistribution td supplies of steel wire from which nails are manufactured. I can give him one of the strongest reasons why there is at present a shortage of nails in Yictoria. That shortage exists because the responsible Victorian Minister has refused a manufacturing permit to a company which desires to engage in the manufacture of steel wire. That is the sole reason why Victorians are unable ro obtain their requirements. Works and Housing) [12.34] I want to deal with one or two of the points that were raised by the honourable member for member waxed eloquent in his story about how Australian beef could have been placed on the tables of the people of Great Britain but for the inactivity of the Government. ber said that because of the lack of of the Northern Territory. For instance, development of the Northern Territory provision has been made whereby the cost Australia cannot supply much urgently of needed beef to the British people. either. WhatI said was that, had developmental railways been constructed in the Northern Territory, it would have been possible for us to send larger quantities of beef to Great Britain. complaint about lack of development, I do not know what could be so described. that the Minister does not know. member for Indi was Minister for the Interior, although there were ample materials and man-power available, all that he could do was to produce plans. In the Northern Territory to-day, there is not one mark of his administration. There was no development of the territory during his term of office. Had more attention been devoted to the territory in those days, there would be much more Australian beef available for the British people to-day. During the regime of anti-Labour administrations, the only meat works in the Northern Territory were closed down. The Government does not claim credit for the war-time construction of roads in the Northern Territory, because they were built primarily for war purposes. Bitumen roads were built from Alice Springs to Darwin and from Tennant Creek to Mount Isa for military purposes. However, had an anti-Labour administration not permitted the closing down of the meat works those war-time roads would have been of great value to-day to the cattle industry in the Northern Territory.

Now, plentiful water supplies are to be found every 8 or 10 miW along the routes which Northern Territory cattle follow to the north of Qneen=land and ultimately to the tableland and coastal areas. Turning to the other side of the Northern Terr'tory, we have arranged with the Government of Western Australia for the construction of a road running south from the Ord River. The Commonwealth has provided £1.500,000 for that pnrnose. The road will run very close io the border of Western Australia and the Northern Territory, but 95 per cent, of it will be in Western Australia. It will provide access to the Gordon Downs and Inverway areas which are at the end of the good stock country in the Northern Territory. In addition, money has been allocated for the bridging of the Ord River. Hitherto, the lack of a bridge has meant a delay of from six to eight weeks in the killing of stock from the Victoria River, WaveH ill and Rosewood ireas. When the bridge has been completed the killing season will be extended tbe by from six to eight weeks, and many thousands more cattle will reach the slaughterhouses for despatch to the TJnited Kingdom. The policy for the I development of the Northern Territory bas been laid down by the Department of the Interior. The physical work is carried out by the Department of Work* and Housing. A road is to be built from a point just south of the Ord River crossing, running due east to the Victoria River Downs country. That, too, will facilitate the movement of stock. Three hundred or more miles further -'upplies. Anybody who knows the south, another drive is to be made east to tap the country around Wave Hill, Inverway and Gordon Downs.
