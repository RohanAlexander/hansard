5,Sir John Quick.,"Apparentl y nonethink that he is to be congratulated upon the onerous, difficult, and thankless job he is undertaking. Let rae draw attention to the prospects of the bank, its functions and responsibilities, and the burdens it will impose upon Australia. Many honourable members approved of the establishment of a national bank to carry on the banking business of the Commonwealth, to undertake, conduct, arid Supervise the flotation of loans if necessary, and to provide for the possible consolidation of the debts of fhe States Those would have been proper functions fbr a Commonwealth Bank. But the bank which has been established, instead of being confined to such business, seems to have been giver! a charter to undertake every kind of banking business, great, smalt, and indifferent, at fhe discretion and in accordance With the idiosyncracies of its management. business of the Commonwealth .is not a serious thing to the associated banks. A return laid on the table last session showed that the value of the exchanges and other transactions was not more than a few thousand pounds a year. ciated banks so anxious to get the Commonwealth business? shown any great anxiety, though no doubt they like the prestige of being the Government bankers. While the establishment of a Government bank to do Government banking business can be understood, it is a more serious thing to create a Government bank to undertake ordinary private banking business. Indeed, there are grave reasons for doubting the wisdom and expediency of competing with the ordinary banks in this way. In any such competition the Commonwealth Bank is bound to lose. Notwithstanding its prestige and credit, it has a capital of only j£i,ooo,ooo, whereas, according to the latest quarterly returns, the private banks of the Commonwealth hold in gold , £ 2 8 , 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 . hold also nearly .£6,000,000 in Australian than you could administer it . If you will notes, making their total cash reserves 'leave it in the hands of the States it will meet nearly ,£34,750,000. The Commonwealth the Bank has not even a distant prospect of couldhaying such a sum at its command. What the security of the land, we can be more libera) then will remain for this bank to do? Apin making advances on our own land, because parently it has been started to compete with ' we can go to the extent of the whole of the the Savings Banks of the States, and chiefly improvements. ter that purpose. The Governor from the beginning has. been engaged in the herculean task of making arrangements to fight the banking institutions of the Governments of the States. He has been in communication with those who control the institutions which ito doubt he desires to absorb, to ascertain how their business is Conducted. He has applied to them for copies of their rules and regulations, and for models of their books of account,, a very cool proposition under the circumstances. This official has had to approach the State Savings Bank for his ammunition-for the information necessary to enable him to engage in business competition with them. I think that' these institutions have treated him with very great courtesy indeed. I understand that the Government of New South Wales, which at first hesitated to place him in possession of the knowledge which he sought, has at last acceded to his request to be allowed to copy the forms of the The loss of the banking books of the Savings Banks of that State. I cite the attempts made by the Commonwealth Government to compete with the State Savings Banks, and all the expense which is necessarily involved in the duplication of machinery and offices as a conspicuous ' example of Commonwealth extravagance and prodigality. I submit that there was no public demand for the creation of this institution. It shows the straits to which the promoters of the scheme are driven, when, instead of conducting business of a national character, they have to stoop to an endeavour fo grab business from the State Savings Banks. I am very glad to notice that the whole of the State Governments, with the exception of that of Western Australia, have refused to acquiesce in this little plan for the destruction of the State Savings Banks. In this connection, I would like to quote the views which were put before the Conference of Premiers which was held in Victhe Premier of New South Wales. These views are reported in the press on the 10th April, and will be found in the records of his remarks to the Prime Minister, saidYou want to launch this bank but you have not yet the necessary machinery.

11,"The Conference. Mr Mcgowen, Addressing","That the Conference is unable to agree to the proposal laid before it by the Prime Minister, but makes the following offer in lieu thereof :1. That, in consideration of the Commonwealth Bank refraining from entering into Savings Bank business, the I Commonwealth Bank, on terms to be arranged, a monthly amount equal to 25 per cent, of the increase in the excess of deposits over withdrawals in the States Savings Banks. 2. That such arrangement commence on the ist day of January, 1913, and continue for a period of five years from that date. That was the proposal which was submitted to the Commonwealth by the whole of the States, with the exception of Western Australia. ous one. generous proposal indeed. They did not want to monopolize the whole of their funds, but offered to grant to the Commonwealth Government for the purposes of investment 25 per cent, of the excess of deposits over withdrawals. An alternative proposition was that some arrangement should be made for the Commonwealth and State Governments forming a kind of financial partnership in respect of the State Savings Bank scheme. But even that was rejected by the Commonwealth, thereby showing that it was a case of grabbing all or nothing. What has been the result? The result, has been that several of the States, anticipating this miserable cut-throat competition, have had to launch upon expenditure for the purpose of providing themselves with new buildings and accommodation in which to carry on their savings bank business. The Governments of Victoria and Queensland were quite justified in refusing to wait until they got notice from the Commonwealth to quit the post-offices, and in proceeding to take steps to provide accommodation for themselves. I say that this proposal to allow the Commonwealth Bank the right to undertake savings bank business is an illustration, not merely of Federal extravagance, but of the unfortunate tendency which is observable in some quarters to promote a system of Federal encroachment upon the domain of State rights, State functions, and State duties. that the Government of Australia should appoint as Governor, of the Commonwealth Bank a gentleman at a salary °f £4>°°° a year, and with £ 3 3s. per day travelling expenses, merely for the purpose of engaging in this comparatively simple type of savings bank business? Yet that is all he has to do at the present time. There is no immediate prospect of the bank being able, even at a remote period, to States agree to provide on loan to the undertake Government business. For that the Commonwealth will still have to be dependent upon the associated banks, and it will only be in the central districts of Australia that this bank will be able to undertake Government business. That the institution will be intrusted with the conversion and consolidation of the State debts, seems a very dim aiid distant prospect indeed. In the meantime, it will be paying large salaries, because other ofiicers will require to be appointed, and I presume that their salaries will be fairly high. Upon a low estimate I believe that the cost of the institution will be .£50,000 a year, and all this expenditure is to be incurred merely for the purpose of enabling it to engage in State savings bank business. The Australian Labour party ought to be heartily ashamed of itself for having .incurred such great obligations for the purpose of doing so little work. NowI wish to refer to a somewhat cognate question, namely, the Commonwealth note issue. We are told, in the Governor General's Speech, that the Australian Notes Act is working satisfactorily; and, in the course of his address, the Prime Minister indicated that we were now in receipt of interest to the amount, I think he said, of £183,000 a year. But the Prime Minister did not seem to indicate in detail what were the losses involved to the various Governments of Australia by the adoption of this Australian bank notes issue. I am aware that there are several honourable members, even on this side of the House, who have felt disposed to support this scheme; but I , for one, have, from the very inception, assumed a critical attitude; and I think that, at the present time, with the experience we have had of the note issue, the results financially are not such as to give rise to much congratulation or praise. Let me remind honourable members of the present position of the note issue as indicated by the latest figures obtained from the Treasury. The notes issued up to the 31st Dees it not seem unjustifiable May were £9,609,000; the gold held in reserve in the Treasury at that time was £4,304,215; there was invested on loan from the note issue fund £5,285,000, and",15,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

14,Sir John Quick,"It was a veryno doubt this is the investment from which the £183,000 mentioned by the Prime Minister is received. In regard to the notes in circulation, I find that up to the present time the whole of the original Associated Bank notes have not been withdrawn from circulation by a considerable number. Thus, there is £60,000 in Queensland Treasury notes and £658,777 in Associated Bank notes still in circulation. The Commonwealth notes held by the public amount to about £4,204,639, and the total notes in circulation at present represent £4.959»4 , or nearly .£5,000,000, l8 the rest being in the hands of the banks and used by them as till money.

25,Sir John Quick,"I have alreadyout any mortgage or burden or other obligation, would have been a better financial transaction than a Commonwealth note issue, involving a loan of over £9,600,000 sterling for a net profit of merely £1,3,000 a year. the Opposition repeal that Act, in the event of their coming into office? tunately, launched upon this scheme, and money has been borrowed by the Commonwealth. We could not pay that money off if we wanted to do so. The burden hangs upon the neck of the Commonwealth, and will do so until some extraordinary diversion occurs which will enable the Government to pay off the amount. So much for the note issue as a financial proposition considered on a profit and loss basis. I should now like to refer to an impending danger which overhangs the whole scheme. Many honourable members on this side of o the House supported the scheme guardedly and provisionally, subject to the understanding that it was to be protected by a gold reserve of at least 25 per cent, up to an issue of £7,000,000, with a sovereign held in reserve for every note issued in excess of that sum. That was a safeguard which recommended itself to the House, and even helped to reconcile honourable members to the scheme. There was a -certain amount of security against undue inflation occasioned by the development of events, or by a reckless policy. But now that safeguarding -condition has been abolished by legislation. The only condition now is that there is to be a 25 per cent, gold reserve, without any limitation. The £7,000,000 limitation has been abolished, and we are resting .merely upon the word of the Prime Minister that he will not bring the new Act into force until after a certain time. Tal election. whether the promise was that the Act would not be brought into force until the end of this session or until after the general elecobligations have been'launched in view of tion. .Certainly the promise gives' the House and the people of the country ""breathing time in which to review the position, and to consider the dangerous situa-tion into which we may drift. I ought to -remind the House of a warning addressed .to the Government, prior to the introduction of this Bill, by the representative of the associated banks in Victoria. He wrote to the Prime MinisterYou will remember that before the present Act became law, the question was f u l l y discussed by yourself with representatives of the banks, and, as the outcome of that discussion, you decided to propose to Parliament that all issues in excess of .£7,000,000 should be protected by a reserve of £ 1 for £ i . The effect of this proposal has not yet been fully ascertained. From the published returns it would appear that a total issue of ^9,718,000 was in existence on 25th October last. Of this sum it is estimated that notes amounting to about £3,662,000 are in the hands of the public, the banks holding upwards of ^6,000,000. The purpose of the Government in holding a reserve of £ 1 for £ 1 beyond £7,000,000, was understood to be the protection of note holders by insuring payment in f u l l in coin of all notes presented. If , however, the present fixed proportion is altered, as now suggested, and the banks for any reason found it necessary to materially reduce the amount of their. Commonwealth notes, it would seem that the reduced gold reserves would not suffice to repay in f u l l the notes held by the banks. In illustration of the effect of the abolition of the £7,000,000 limit, I need only'point out that, instead of there being a gold reserve of £4,305,000 as at present, that reserve will be reduced to about £2,250,000 at the very outside, even dn the basis bf an issue of £10,000,000 of notes. There we have a sword of Damocles, so to speak, hanging over the career of this note issue. That is a source of danger which certainly ought to be impressed on the House and the people of the country at every possible opportunity, and there is none better than the present occasion. I wish now to refer to another matter mentioned in the Governor General's Speech with reference to the Federal land tax. It is said that the revenue from land value taxation, as well as from Customs and Excise, has exceeded the Budget estimate. The revenue is certainly an enormous amount to be derived from a limited number of persons. The question is how long it can be sustained by them. It must inevitably result in a confiscation of property. However, we are not here to discuss the question of absolutely repealing the tax, because it seems that so many Federal this source of revenue that its absolute repeal would be out of the question. But I should like to take this opportunitv of draw ng attention to provisions which : certainly appear lo me' to be beginning to press with great hardship upon a certain class of land taxpayers.

29,Sir John Quick,"I was not surereference to joint owners, and the other with reference to nnancial investment companies beyond the seas, which are called absentees. E'ealing first with the absentee provisions, there can be no doubt that a differentiating tax might reasonably be imposed upon persons who are really arid truly absentees from Australia. By absentees from Australia. I mean persons whose property and whose homes are here, whose families and fanuly relationships are here, who derive their income arid means of living from Australia, but who live abroad. That may be a fair definition of absentees, and as regards such persons it may be justifiable to impose a greater burden of land or income tax than -is imposed upon those who live in the country. BiitI contend that there is a great difference between such a person and a financial investment company whose central office may be in London, New York, or Berlin. tinction between such a technical absentee as. an. investment company which sends money for investment in Australia, and whose shareholders may be scattered all over the world, and a real absentee coming within the .definition that I have just laid down. Within the limited period of the operation of the Federal land tax the result has been to cause a large number of financial companies whose domicile is abroad tb withdraw their capital from Australia, because they found that it would not pay them to invest here. The land tax has been operating so oppressively and so harshly that they have alleged that their investments were being gradually confiscated and destroyed; and they have had to sell out in order to escape complete eventual confiscation. I should like, in support of my contention,, to quote a statement made by Mr of gold from Australia within theAlfred Studholme at the annual meeting of the Van Diemen's Land Company, which appeared in the Argus of 25th ultimo. Mr Studholme saidIt was about twelve months since he returned from visiting the company's property in Tasmania. He went out at the request of the Board, who saw the heavy taxation that was eoming along and that it would have the result of completely taking"" away their income. In a letter written by Mr Mullens, who is a partner in the firm of Messrs. Mullens, Marshall, and Daniell, that gentleman, writing, said with regard to the underwriting of the Australian FreeholdsIn every Australian colony in which I have invested, my property has been depreciated by the confiscatory action of their Governments, Sir John Quick. and I am only thankful to withdraw what isi left. I should certainly not put money into, any of them again. The comment made by Mr Studholme on this statement was^lens writing to that effect they would understand that people would not go into the company. Complaint may be made against some of these foreign investment companies having money invested in large areas of land. If there were reasonable grounds for complaint if they were monopolizing the land, failing to put it to proper use, or not throwing it open for.closer settlement--the fair and honest way of dealing with them! would be for the States to pass laws for the compulsory purchase and resumption of the land rather than to impose a land tax to -destroy land values; To say nothing of public honesty; I can hardly regard such a It is justifiable to draw a disproposition as fair. It seems quite plain, from the quotations I have made, s that many investment companies are gradually but deliberately withdrawing their money from Australia for the purpose of escaping the land tax. They may withdraw their money and sell their properties to others without the result necessarily being the subdivision of their estates.. I therefore think that the best way of dealing with exceptional cases such as that would be to honestly and fairly buy them out, according to the public laws of the State. I say this without prejudice to the proposition that I have already affirmed, that personal absentees from the Commonwealth, as distinguished from investment companies, might be fairly differentiated against. Attention has been drawn to an extraordinary increase in the withdrawal last twelve months. There can be no doubt that there has been an unfortunate,, deplorable, ancl startling tendency in that direction. One explanation which has beengiven is that there has been an excess of imports over exports, with the result that gold has had to be sent away in payment of the balance of exchange. That may be one explanation, but another operating factor may be the withdrawal of invested' money by a large number of persons in all' parts of the world in order to escape the pains and penalties of Federal taxation. I was informed that two steamers recently left Australia within a month carrying between them no less than £1,500,000 in sovereigns.

41,Mr Scullin,"If the partnership is anow stating his case differently. He said at first that the partnership in existence was only for the purpose of working the property more satisfactorily. father distributed the property among himself and his sons so as to give them a direct interest in it. This interpretation of the land tax, I contend, shows that the effect of its operation is not to encourage the breaking up of estates amongst, say, the members of a family, and conveying the portions to the names of its different members. If the giving of separate exemptions be the result, why should not these persons have the benefit of the result if they become absolute owners of the land? Honourable members on the other side want to break up estates. They want to enable the father of a family to divide his estate among his children, or they want to make the owner of an estate divide it and sell it. If a man divides his estate or sells it, and conveys it to different owners, then those persons ought to be allowed the benefit of that act of conveyance. I admit that if there is proof, or reasonable ground for believing, that a transfer is not bond fide, but is made for the purpose of evading the tax or getting an additional exemption, it might be open to examination. bond fide transfer, and the lands of, say, A, B, and C are simply worked together, and there is a division of the profits in proportion to the respective interests, they ought not to be regarded as one owner, but as separate owners. generous some of these parents became just when the tax was imposed. object of the tax to break up large estates, and if the effect ot its operation le in that direction, why do my honourable friends want to stop it? Why should they not encourage it ? Why should the owners not have the benefit of the immunity from liability if estates are divided and transferred? The mere working of the estates together ought not of itself to be regarded as evidence of collusion or conspiracy or fraud. gether does not make a liability. held that if persons have a common interest in the division of property it does. in the land. terest in the land or a common interest in the profits. I shall wait for an authoritative exposition of this matter from the Attorney-General. There has certainly been, according to the interjections, some modification of what I read in the papers as an indication of policy. If that is being done, I am glad to hear of it. I think it ought to be well known. I would certainly like to know whether the case which' has been specifically brought under my attention has been dealt with by the Department, because I think it would be a most disastrous thing if , instead of having a land tax, we had, in effect, a tax on partnerships. Let us have a real land tax, but do not make use of a land tax to impose a tax on partnerships merely because the lands of, say, half-a-dozen persons are used for partnership purposes. Do not let us have a tax on partnerships, but a real tax on the registered legal owners-no t merely on the partners, as distinguished from the owners of the land. I must hurry on to refer to another branch of this Speech. Paragraph n states that proceedings under the Australian Industries Preservation Act have been instituted against a shipping and coal combine, that a decision But where there is a has been given in favour of the Government, and that penalties have been imposed upon the defendants. The next paragraph shows that it is the intention and scheme of the Government to introduce an alteration of the Constitution to enable the Parliament to legislate effectively with regard to corporations, trusts, combinations, and monopolies in relation to trade, manufacture, or production, and to extend its powers in regard to industrial matters and navigation. The occurrence of these two paragraphs one after the other is certainly most interesting. It enables me to ask the House, to use a quotation from "" Hamlet,"" to "" look here, upon this picture, and on this ""-to look on paragraph n and then on paragraph 12. In the former we have the announcement of the victory of the Federal Constitution and Federal legislation over trusts and combines, and in the latter we have a declaration of intention to proceed for an amendment of the Constitution, because the Federal power over trusts and combines is apparently considered to be inadequate. How is it possible to harmonize the two pictures ? The paragraph relating to the decision in the Coal Vend case gives me an opportunity",20,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

49,Sir John Quick,"A common inof drawing the attention of honourable members to the real meaning and significance of that case. I do not think that its importance and transcendent significance are altogether quite realized. I have therefore looked through the judgment of Mr Justice Isaacs, and made brief extracts for the purpose of placing them on record. It appears to me to be one of the most brilliant judgments even given by a Judge in Australia. It is comprehensive, masterly, and most learned, involving apparently stupendous work, unlimited industry, and the greatest amount of care and caution in its preparation. I think it is a matter for the greatest amount of praise that we have on the High Court bench a gentleman of such great ability and such great powers as to be able to give first seventy-five days to the hearing of the case, and afterwards to analyze its various minute points, and draw up a judgment, the delivery of which occupied upwards of three days' reading from his own manuscript. It was a wonderful, most masterly performance. I have sketched a few points from the judgment. Shortly stated, it was an action by the Attorney General against forty defendants, of whom sixteen were individuals, twentytwo were ordinary corporations, and two the Industries Preservation The action was brought for several alleged violations of the Statute between 24th September, 1906, and 4th June, 1910. Tbe defendants consisted of two main groups, the colliery defendants and the shipping defendants. The first comprised all the proprietors of coal mines in the Newcastle and Maitland districts of New South Wales. The second comprised the InterState shipping companies. tions against the defendants were that after the Act came into operation they entered into an express contract in relation to Inter-State trade and commerce, with intent to restrain that trade and commerce to the detriment of the public. His Honor said that it was alleged that the defendants monopolized, or attempted to monopolize; that they combined and conspired to monopolize the trade and commerce in Maitland and Newcastle coal, with intent to control, to the detriment of the public, the supply and price of coal to persons engaged in the Inter-State trade. He said that the alleged detriment to the public consisted in the practical abolition of competition in the sale of coal on land and sea; the excessive arbitrary and capricious prices charged to consumers; the restriction of their opportunities of choice; difficulties in obtaining particular classes or grades of coal they desired; and delays in obtaining deliveries of coal. The defence was, in effect, a denial of all that was alleged against the defendants. In the course of his judgment, His Honor said that he found, as a matter of fact, that coal under the Vend agreement could only be supplied by colliery proprietors to Inter-State consumers through the intervention of the Shipping Companies; that by the agreement the supply of coal was limited, and the price of coal was enhanced, ancl the public had to pay excessive prices, through which the defendants realized unreasonable profits. In very nearly every charge in that indictment against the defendants, His Honor found against them, and convicted them of the several offences proved. He said that the contract and combine between the defendants were in restraint of Inter-State trade, interfered with its freedom, and tended to its monopoly. He defined monopoly thusI f not content with serving the public to the best of his ability and letting the consequences take care of themselves he so acts as to concentrate in himself the existing means of pubwere commercial trusts within lic satisfaction, in such a way and to such an meaning of the Australian extent as, in the circumstances, to prevent or Act 1906-9. destroy all reasonably effective competition he does within the meaning of the Statute monopolize or attempt to monopolize trade. Comp:tition itself connotes attraction of trade, and so long as it remains legitimate the law, as I read it, does not reprove it simply because it attains its necessary object. In my opinion the prevention or destruction of all reasonab'e and effective competition-the natural safeguard of the public-is at the root of the conception of monopoly within the meaning of the Statute. That is a definition of monopoly from The allegawhich, I think, very few will differ upon examination of it. In the result of this gigantic action thirty-seven of the defendants were fined £500 each, aggregating £18,500, and they were further ordered to pay the costs of the action. It is estimated that the costs of the Crown alone will exceed £10,000, and the costs of the defendants cannot be much less. That action, so briefly referred to in paragraph 11 of the Governor General's Speech, is, in my opinion, a triumphant vindication of the Federal Constitution and Federal legislation. It shows that under the present constitutional provision relating to and dealing with trade and commerce between States and with other countries, and under the present Commonwealth law, the Federal power is strong enough, and that that power has been already exercised in an effective manner. First of all, the Constitution has been brilliantly vindicated; and, secondly, the effectiveness and competency of Commonwealth legislation has been demonstrated by this tremendous litigation. existence; in effect, at any rate. impossible, because the law has been interpreted, and the action has resulted in these offenders being declared guilty of restraint of trade to the detriment of the public, and the Act provides that they shall be liable to continuing penalties, which may go on accumulating from day to day. It is not a case of a conviction for one defence, and the offender then defying the law. each liable to this penalty of .£500 for every day on which the offence is continued, and a corporation is liable to a penalty of £1,000. drastic enough, and the result of this legislation shows that the Act is effective enough. The Attorney-General, in referring to this case, said that, notwithstanding the decision, the Trust is going on just as merrily as before. The accuracy of that statement is open to question. It cannot possibly continue its operations merrily for long at that rate. It might continue pending the appeal-pendin g finality. There might be some reason in suggesting that the Trust would not obey the injunction of the Court pending the appeal. But I beg to differ even on that, because I understand the injunction was made operative from the pronouncement of the decree. I doubt the accuracy of the statement made by the Attorney-General that the Trust is operating in defiance of the decision of the Court, because if it were the defendants in the case could be attached for contempt of Court. There is a way of bringing an offender against the law of any country to account.. If it be ""true, as alleged, that these defendants are defying the judgment of the Court, it is the duty of the Attorney General to ascertain whether its injunction cannot be enforced. We have here the Executive of the Commonwealth in control of the machinery of the law, and if , pending the appeal, the injunction of the Court is being defied, I ask why steps are not taken to enforce it? The law officers of the Crown are surely strong enough to intervene. In the circumstances, it is reasonable to doubt the accuracy of the Attorney General's statement, because we find that since it was made, at any rate, an announcement has been' made publicly in the newspapers that the members of the Coal Vend are abandoning the appeal, and giving up the combine, so far, at any rate, as it relates to Inter-State trade. ping companies ? ing; but, even so, they could be attached for contempt of Courti f they are defying the injunction of the Court. The Attorney-General seemed to doubt the efficacy of Federal legislation on its present basis. In the experience of mankind through all ages of history it has been found that the only effective way known to all Legislatures has been to prohibit wrong-doing, and if jt be Under the law the defendants are persisted in to punish the wrong-doers. If , notwithstanding the prohibition, wrong is done, the wrong-doer should be punished. Punishment is the necessary consequence of That is surely every infraction of the law, from the command, ""Thou shalt not steal,"" right through the Decalogue. The only way to prevent wrong-doing is to punish the wrong-doer. What more could any act of legislation do than is done by what is known as the Anti-trust Act? Its declaration is: ""Thou shalt not monopolize; thou shalt not combine in restraint of trade "" ; and it makes the penalty for the disregard of this prohibition £^500 a day for a private individual, and £1,000 a day for a corporation; and, if necessary, imprisonment may be imposed. I attribute attempts to discredit or minimize the effect of that Act to the desire to suggest or support some new-fangled remedy, such as Nationalization or Socialism. This Parliament has now no power to adopt such remedies; and it may be that the minimizing of the value of Mr Justice Isaacs' judgment is done to bolster up the demand for an amendment of the Constitution. But so long as this case stands on record, it will demonstrate the efficacy of the law. The Act deals, not only with trusts and combines, but with monopolies, too. It has been objected that trusts, combines, and monopolies operating wholly within any one State are not interfered with, and a list of such combinations has been read. My reply is that the laws of the several States must deal with them. prevent the operation of the Brick Combine?",21,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

I am not. defending combines; what I say is that tbe State Legislatures are competent to deal with all combinations in restraint of trade operating wholly within any one State. However, I shall deal with this subject at greater length when a proposal for the amendment of the Constitution is made. We are told that it is to be proposed to extend the powers of the Commonwealth in regard to industrial matters and navigation. A proposal that was included in the last referenda seems to have been omitted; I do not find any intention to propose an amendment giving this Parliament control over what has been termed the internal or domestic trade and commerce of the States. If that proposal is not to be made, I congratulate the Government upon having abandoned its attempt to interfere with the rights of the States in this matter. The inclusion of the proposal in the last referenda was one of the strongest grounds for attacking it, and had much to do with its defeat. would have opposed the referenda on any ground. propose an amendment of the Constitution in favour of the nationalization of monopolies. We have been told that the Constitution is to be amended to enable this Parliament to legislate effectively with regard to trusts, combines, and monopolies in relation to trade; but the inference may be drawn that Ministers have abandoned the proposal for the nationalization of monopolies, or that it is to be made later. I will conclude my observations under this heading by a reference to the paragraph No Upper House contained in the no-confidence motion in relation to industrial unrest. There can be no doubt that within the last two or three years there has been an alarming, amount of industrial unrest in Australia, and particularly since the accession tooffice of the Labour Government. I findi that from the advent of the Fisher Ministry, in April, 1910, t i ll the end of May of I cannot credit the present year, there have been 230 strikes in Australia. In 1910 there were forty strikes; in 1911 there were fully 10O'; and during the current year there have been nearly ninety. These figures certainly disclose an alarming amount of industrial unrest during the period that the reins of government have been in the hands of the Labour party, and the latter have been in command of majorities in both Houses of the Legislature. That party have also had all the prestige which attaches to the moral force of government. I know that at the last elections many persons voted for the Labour party in the belief that if they came into office they would exercise their moral and political influence to minimize the effect of strikes and industrial disturbances. They thought that people would be more happy and contented under a political regime in which the Labour members were supreme than they would be under any other form of government. But what has been the result? Instead of there having; been less industrial unrest, there has been a steady acceleration and growth of it. It seems to me that a great deal of responsibility for this increase of industrial unrest is due to the fact that many of the heads of the Labour party, instead of discouraging strikes, have, by their extreme utterances, done quite the reverse. able member quote some of them?",23,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

62,Mr Scullin,"Why does not the honorSit JOHN QUICK I wish, also, to point out that among these industrial disturbances no less than twenty have been strikes, not on questions of wages, but in regard to the employment of non-union or union labour. There have been thirty strikes upon wages matters, and' ten against industrial awards and agreements, and pending arbitration proceedings. Five strikes have actually occurred against State Governments or Government Departments, or in connection with Government contracts. There have been two strikes in reference to the hours of labour and a similar number in reference to piece work. The remainder have been for various causes more or less significant. I think it is very interesting and important that we should review some of these strikes and industrial disturbances, sumed. with a view to seeing how far the proposed amendment of the Constitution would be effective in dealing with them. Take some the strikes against industrial awards. What is the use of amending the Constitution to provide for arbitration if it be proved by actual experience that those on whose behalf arbitration is sought, and in whose interests arbitration awards are granted, will not obey those awards, but will endeavour to repudiate them? It is impossible to 'secure the settlement of industrial disputes unless obedience to the law is demanded and encouraged.

Yet we find, in respect of some of the awards by State Arbitration Courts, that there has been a distinct repudiation of them. There has also been repudiation of agreements by workers. One of the most barefaced repudiations of an arbitration award was that in connection with the Perth tramway strike in July, 1910. point to any Federal awards which have food becoming scarce, prices were raised been broken? more Federal agreements made than awards mated at £100,000 per day.

Address-in-Reply. Broken Hill Proprietary mine. of an agreement is, to my mind, more reprehensible than is the repud'ation of an award by a Court. The reason alleged for the repudiation of the arbitration award made in connection with the Perth tramway strike was the refusal of the London directors to grant a larger increase of pay to the men than the Court had awarded. The Court had granted an eight hours' day and an increase of wages of 50 per cent., thus augmenting the wages list by £10,000 per annum. Upon appeal the Court refused to alter the award. The strike lasted till the 7th September, when work was reAgain, on the 6th September, 1911, a strike of glass bevellers took place in Melbourne which lasted fourteen weeks.

The worse illustration of a strike against the Government has occurred in Victoria in connection with the Wonthaggi coal mine. I wish to place on record a few facts in connection with that occurrence to show the spirit of unrest which is abroad. A long standing dispute between the miners and the management of the State coal mine lasted between March 27th and Mayn t h . The miners then appear to have discovered that nowhere else in any occupation could they earn so much money at the average of 14s. i j d . per shift per man as they had actually received for the six months preceding the abandonment of their work.

It would take too long to give further particulars, but I have selected a few as typiministration, on the part of Ministers, withcal. The remainder relate mainly to the employment of union and non-union labour. All these facts go to show that there is ununionists was authorized by Parliament. It doubtedly great reason to be alarmed at the amount of industrial unrest prevailing, and at the extension of strikes that have -occurred since the present Federal Ministry have been in office. The members of the Government might have done much by precept and example to discourage these occurrences. Instead of that, however, they threaten to launch another campaign for the amendment of the Constitution, and for tlie extension of the area of Federal jurisdiction. stead of these disputes being dealt with within the limits of the States, and under State laws, they would ""be dealt with under Federal jurisdiction. A great deal of this industrial unrest has also been brought about by systematic and determined efforts to introduce what is -called preference to unionists. That has been the great bone of contention. Instead of men being assisted in any reasonable effort to get better wages or working, conditions, they have been advised to go in for this ""will-o'-the-wisp"" known as preference to unionists, and no one has done more to lead them in that direction than has the Federal Government. ence to unionists? that lately made by the Minister of Home Affairs. Instead of relying upon Federal legislation authorizing him to do so, he took it upon himself to issue a mandate to the effect that in future none but unionists were to be employed in the Department presided over by him, and that those who were not members of a trade union should receive notice of dismissal. That assisted to foment many of the disputes, in reference to preference to unionists, which I have enumerated this afternoon. I think that the .Postmaster-General has also to' shoulder his share of the responsibility because of the promise he gave in connection with the Brisbane strike, to the effect that he would grant preference to strikers in the distribution of any work that might be available in the Postal Department. case of the kind, and neither was authorized by law. Each was an act of adout the authority of Parliament. That previously done in reference to preference to was placed on the statute-book by the vote of Parliament, and was surrounded by certain conditions and safeguards, which prevented an abuse of the privilege. There is a great difference between the preference to unionists authorized by the present Minister of Home Affairs and that authorized by the original Conciliation and Arbitration Act. That granted under the Act was a preference to unionists clearly restricted to members of what are known as industrial That would mean that intrade unions. What was objected to, and what was prohibited by that law, was the granting of preference to unionists who were members of political organizations. of allowing that law to remain on the statute-book,. the present Ministry, as soon as they came into office, amended it, and repealed the qualifications and safeguards to which I have referred. They might as well have allowed those safeguards to stand, but they were determined to show their desire to give complete and unqualified preference, not merely to bond fide industrial",27,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

100,Sir John Quick,"It is not. Insteadtrade unionists, but to political supporters. That is what their action amounts to, because under the amended law unionists who are to receive preference are not members of bond fide workers' unions formed for the purpose of protecting the interests and rights of the workers, but members of political organizations, inasmuch as there is nothing to prevent the funds of those so called trade unions being used at the next Federal election to support Labour candidates. That differentiates completely the system of preference to unionists under the old law, which was arrived at as a compromise when the Watson Government were displaced by another Ministry, and when a modified scheme of preference to unionists subject to judicial discretion was conceded. I wish now to allude to one other matter mentioned in the Governor General's Speech, and that is a proposition which certainly has in it the charm of novelty. I refer to the proposed maternity allowance, or, as it is called, the bonus for babies. history of the Labour party, and comes upon the House and the country as a startling and almost dramatic surprise. It is strange that such a proposal did not find favour at the last or any preceding Labour Conference. I 'find that the whole question was discussed very fully at the Labour Conference held in Hobart last January, and that no proposal of this kind was adopted. Wales, proposed, ""That compulsory insurance and national control thereof be a plank in the next Federal Labour platform."" mitted an amendment in favour of a scheme of compulsory and contributory insurance against sickness, old age, and motherhood, with a discrimination in favour of parents of large families. mania, advocated the encouragement of population by raising the exemption under the Income Tax Act in the case of people with large families. During the course of the discussion, I find, reference was made to the scheme now in operation in New Zealand; and it seems strange that even the modified scheme recommended by the delegates from New South Wales did not find acceptance at the Conference. It may be interesting here to quote the provisions of the New Zealand scheme for a maternity grant. They are to be found in the National Provident Fund Act, No. 41, passed in 1910. The Act provides an optional system of inSir John Quick. surance by individuals coupled with a Government subsidy. Insurance may be obtained upon the payment of a small contribution beginning with 9d. a week at the age of seventeen years, and going up to is. 8d. per week at the age of thirty years, 2s. 3d. a week at the age of thirty-five years, 3s. 2d. a week at the age of forty years, and 4s. n d . a week at the age of forty-five years. The contributions go into a general fund, and at the end of twelve months the contributors are entitled to certain privileges and certain relief during any period of incapacity. It is also provided in section 16 that I f and so long as at any time during any such period of incapacity the contributor is the parent of any child or children under the age of fourteen years, the contributor shall be entitled to receive from the fund during the period of his incapacity (subject, however, to the conditions and limitations hereinafter expressed) an allowance in accordance with the provisions of the second schedule hereto. The second schedule gives an allowance of It is a new proposition in the 7s. 6d. a week for each child during the period of incapacity. The important provision relating to the maternity proposition is contained in section 18', which reads as follows :1. If the wife of any contributor, or if any contributor (being a married woman) gives birtli in New Zealand to a child or children, and the joint income of that contributor and his wife or her husband (as the case may be) during the period of twelve months immediately Mr Bryant, of New South preceding the date of such birth does not exceed Two hundred pounds, such contributor, if he has contributed to the fund for a period of not less than twelve months, shall be entitled to receive from the fund the sum of Six pounds, The Tasmanian delegates subor such less sum as the Board, in pursuance of sub-section three hereof, directs. 2. Applications for payment of any such sum shall be accompanied by a statutory declaration by the contributor (which shall be exempt from stamp duty) that the joint income as aforesaid during the said period of twelve months did Mr Giblin, of Tasnot exceed Two hundred pounds. 3. The Board may reduce the said sum of Six pounds to the amount of the expenses actually incurred by the contributor, or by the wife or husband of the contributor, in respect of -=>medical attendance. 4. "" Medical attendance"" for the purposes of this section means the services of a registered medical practitioner, or of a registered midwife, and of a nurse at the birth of the child, and at any subsequent times within a period of three weeks during which such services may be required. That legislation was referred to during the course of the Federal Labour Conference in Hobart, and strange to say, no proposal for a maternity bonus of any kind was adopted there, and it remained for this Government and the party opposite on the eve of an election to come forward and propound this scheme of a maternity bonus. WhilstI , and I dare say most honourable members of the House, would be disposed to regard with favour any proposal founded on humanitarian motives and considerations, at the same time, I thinkand I believe that the most reflecting minds would be disposed to arrive at the same conclusion-that a vote of this kind ought to be surrounded with reasonable safeguards and proper conditions to see that the money reaches any of those who are reasonably in want of it. The scheme as put before the country up to the present time is very crude, and very incomplete, and therefore one is at a disadvantage in criticising what has not been completely formulated. At the same time, it is only right and fair to anticipate, as far as one can do, the proposal when it comes before the House. WhilstI am disposed to favourI speak only for myself-an y scheme founded on humane considerations and motives, for the saving of life and relief of distress, there ought to be safeguards and precautions to prevent an abuse of the scheme, and certainly to prevent men of means, and people who do not want the bonus, being able to claim it, and thereby unfairly and improperly place a burden upon the community. One of the matters referred to in the amendment is "" reckless irresponsibility in the financial affairs of the Commonwealth."" heard nothing. drawn attention to the reckless expenditure involved in connection with the Commonwealth Bank. That undoubtedly will mean an extraordinary waste of public funds for years to come. does not expect any one to believe that, does be ? yet on tbe bank. spent, and the bank will probably involve an annual expenditure of £40,000 or £50,000 for years to come. of extravagance? to anticipate what may be said by the regulations and inspection. In June, last financial experts on this side, but I ceryear, for instance, there was the case of tainly wish to draw attention to one Department in which there has been a great expansion of expenditure since it was taken over by the Federation, and that is the Quarantine Department. The expenditure has increased by leaps and bounds, and threatens to rival the expenditure in many other directions. When the Department was taken over in 1909-10, the total expenses in connection with the service did not amount to more than £23,182. In 1910-11 the expenses had jumped up to £25,753, and in addition to that, £^2,206 vvas spent on works. In 1911-12 the expenditure increased by nearly £30,000, and there has been an outlay of £33,208 on works. So that in three years there has been a jump of ,£39,400 in the expenditure of the Department, and now we are threatened with a further enormous expansion in that respect. A new scheme of expenditure and enlargement has recently been brought forward by the Director' of Quarantine. Of Dr. NorrisI wish to speak only in terms of the highest respect and admiration. He is a very clever doctor and a reliable medical adviser of the Department, but he has certainly high-flown notions about Federal works expansion. I find that he has brought forward a scheme of expansion in connection with the quarantine institutions of the Com-' monwealth estimated to cost £187,000, of which it is proposed that ,£80,000 shall be spent during this year. According to the newspapers the Minister very promptly, and, it is said, almost gleefully adopted this report in globo, and is going to bring down an estimate of £80,000 for one year. It remains to be seen what arguments are to be presented in favour of this huge inflation of expenditure, because a number of the represenatives of the Department in the States have already offered adverse criticism of the proposal, and the general view is that it would be far better to spend money in exercising closer supervision over the arrival of persons across the sea, say at Fremantle station, on the one hand, and Thursday Island, in the north of Australia, on the other. It would be far better to keep out disease than to make provision for its reception, and its incubation and treatment in Australia. Why should we make provision for the absolute introduction of these cases, instead of fighting the disease at the ports? There have been notorious",28,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

110,Sir John Quick,"I am not going cases of steamers evading the quarantinethe RMS. Mooltan, which arrived in the port of Adelaide. Persons were allowed 4:o land at Adelaide and to proceed freely to fhe eastern States without any notification to the health authorities. What is the use of having an expensive quarantine establishment if the system of inspection at the ports is to be loosely interpreted, instead of being rigidly enforced? The system of inspection is certainly very lax and absolutely inadequate. I speak from knowledge gained recently on my return voyage to Australia. Certainly passengers were made to march in procession before the medical officer of the ship. That, forsooth, was considered and regarded as a sufficient opportunity to decide whether there was any disease on board. If necessary, instead of spending money on public works to accommodate passengers for whom tbere is already accommodation, I would be quite prepared to vote money to pay for the services of a medical officer to board inward-bound steamers at Colombo, and accompany them to Australia, so as to get in touch with That would be a much more effective way of guarding against the introduction of disease than the formal procession of passengers before a medical officer. should we require to give effect to that proposal? traffic would be in connection with the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient lines of steamers, and the necessary staff would not be so expensive as the buildings and establishments proposed on the shores of Australia are likely to be. I am afraid that I have already taken up too much time, and I shall, therefore, bring my remarks to a close by saying that, in my opinion, sufficient ground for criticism has already been made out to justify a vote of want of confidence. [4.12] -As you, sir, and some of the suffering public have already listened to those who can juggle with figures, and have heard the speeches of Ministers and ex-Ministers who are orators, you will not mind listening for a time to a ""bread-and-butter"" politician like myself. I listened carefully to what has been said by honourable members opposite, except when tiiey became abusive. As you, sir, are always very severe on those who return abuse, I had to leave the chamber on' those occasions. I have heard honourable members opposite denounce as planks of the Labour platform almost every proposal other than those which we ourselves advocate. I have heard nothing from them which would warrant a vote of want of confidence in. the administration of the present Government. Like their supporters outside, the Conservatives in this House abuse those opposed to them, and object to their policy, but will submit no policy of their own. We have heard of nothing from the other side which fhey would substitute for the policy of the present Government. They have not had the courage to say that they are prepared, should they get into power, to repeal any legislation we have passed, or reverse any action taken by the Government, with the exception of the action taken to abolish the fiat rate for telephones, and the legislation abolishing voting by post. These are the only great national affairs they intend to alter .should they be returned to power. These represent the only policy they would have to submit in preference to that advocated by the present'Government and their all the passengers. followers. I have been listening to honourable members opposite for days, and they evidently propose to base their principal criticism .of the Labour party on the Brisbane strike and the existence of industrial unrest. But since the honourable member for Brisbane addressed this House on Thursday, we find that newspapers supporting the Conservatives apparently think it would be just as"" well to drop those questions. The honourable member's explanation of the .course of events in Brisbane was so lucid, and he so clearly proved that the trouble there was caused by the other side, and not by our side, that the criticism based on the Brisbane strike has fallen through. From tbe moment the Leader of the Opposition threw this bomb in the shape of a motion of want of confidence on the table of die House, honourable members opposite made industrial unrest and the Brisbane strike the chief grounds of their indictment against the Government. I have said that the Brisbane strike argument has failed, but to-day we have had from the honourable member for Bendigo a tabulated statement of all tlie strikes that have recently occurred. I have also received a copy of that statement. crowd.",30,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

But I am particularly keen to know what the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition is. All we have been told is, that if he gets into power, we are to have a Tariff Board. I have been trying to ascertain how the Board is to be composed, how long it will take about its work, and what is going to be done by Parliament when it has reported. Does the Leader of the Opposition, if he gets into power, expect to obtain the same support from the Labour side as he did last time? into power. the moment that he will. Does he expect that, after his Board has reported-and , I suppose, it will take a year or two to prepare a report-Parliamen t will bend the knee and bow the bead to it ?

The Leader of the Opposition will have to give the Victorian Protectionists stronger evidence of his desire and his ability to bring into existence a satisfactory Tariff than we have at present, before he will be able to induce them to transfer their votes from our side to his.

July contains the following article, headed "" Difficulty with casual arrivals "" : A number of new arrivals who landed in the morning from the steamer Otway put in their appearance at the Immigration Bureau yesterday, and stated that they had just come from England and wanted employment. I might mention here the case of stituents who bought a ragged went to different places, said that immigrants, and got work which, they could not have obtained. The bureau is called upon to find situations for many such casual arrivals, as almost every steamer from England brings persons who have paid or worked their passage out to the State, and intend to settle here. While it is felt to be desirable to encourage such settlers within reasonable bounds, as tbe number includes a fair proportion of satisfactory workmen, the bureau is faced with one very obvious difficulty. Its supply of applications for farm labour varies according to the season of the year, and the stream of new settlers now comes steadily. The bureau regards itself as in duty bound to find employment for its assisted immigrants, and the casual newcomers constitute a drain upon the number of situations offering. The end desired by the selection in London is that only a satisfactory class of farm labourer should be allowed to come out. The casuals include the larger proportion of incompetent men. finding employment for the incompetent, the bureau is not only prejudicing farmers against immigrants, but is reducing the prospect of finding positions for the assisted men when they arrive. At present the indications are lhat farm labour is not required to a very large ex'ent. Although all the assisted newcomers have been placed in employment, the response to the last issue of circulars has not been considerable. As many ns 36,000 circulars have been sent out of late, but thc number,of applications coming into the immigration office from day to day has remained very small. In the meantime it is not proposed by the Government to withdraw ward farm labourers. casuals work their way out to Victoria may be judged from the fact that fifty-three were discharged on the arrival of the steamer Belgic, and the majority of these sought employment If the right honorthrough the bureau. If the bureau is to find employment for all the casual labourers, the prohibition .on the London office is likely to be extended over a longer time. If the inquiry in London into the credentials of assisted pasI shall have to again say that I sengers is to be of any value whatever, it should be to send out the class of agricultural labourer required for this State. The bureau can have little or no assurance that the casuals whom it is sending into the country are really competent We men. The nominations of passengers now come under the direct attention of the Minister in charge of immigration, and greater care is being exercised before the nominations are accepted. not The fact is one of the indications that in the future wiser caution is to be exercised in all the selection of immigrants for assisted passage to Victoria. The Age of 2nd That is all we ask-that care should be taken in the selection of the poor unfortunates who are induced to come here; because a man who is I wil l not .say a derelict in the Old Countrya casual worker, and not physically strong at that, is not likely to find his position much improved' here.

I ask honourable members to from the Old Country to displace our own listen to the following report, which apmen for the benefit of private employers, peared in the Age of 27th June: MR. WHITEHEAD'S SELECTION. Preference on Railway Work. An arrangement which has the effect of giving yearspreference lo a number of immigrants has been arrived at between the Railway Department and the Immigration Bureau. As stated in yesterday's issue of the Age, the Railway Commissioners asked on 15th June, 1911, that Mr until a scarcity of applications for labour from Whitehead should engage 146 artisans for them. They have the barefaced, brazen effrontery to admit that they are giving preference to immigrants against our own peopleThey were recently requested to put on a number of the men of the particular class, but declined to do so, on the ground that their instructions from the State Government were that they should obtain all workmen through the Labour Bureau, regardless of whether they were immigrants or not. At present there are about 1,100 labourers and artisans on the books of the Labour Bureau, the majority of whom are regarded as competent men, but were put off in many instances through the recent decline in the implement making trade, while operations in the country were slack during the dry weather. Yesterday it was announced that, as a result of the negotiations between the immigration authorities and the Commissioners, preference was to be shown to the artisans engaged by Mr Whitehead specially for the Department. Mr Hagelthorn stated in explanation that the Department had consented to give preference to Mr Whitehead's selection, but only in regard to these particular artisans. All other immigrants who were unable to find employment must take their chance by registering at the Labour Bureau. Up to the present tlie Commissioners have engaged thirteen of the artisans selected by Mr Whitehead. The twelve who were left on the hands of Mr Ashby, the secretary of the Chamber of Manufactures, it is understood, are being put on immediately. The manufacturers asked for hundreds, if not thousands, of artisans, and, though only a few dozens were brought out, Mr Ashby has twelve on his hands for whom he cannot find employment. It is then understood that these men are to be put on immediately. shops. Men who were brought out at the request of the Chamber of Manufactures, in order that they might compete withmen already here, and force them to take lower wages and accept worse conditions, are now being provided vvith work by the Victorian Government. In spite of this fact, taunts have been hurled at the Postmaster-General because he proposed to find employment for unfortunate unionists who were starving in e and when these are unable to find work for them the Victorian Government give them preference over men who have been ratepayers and citizens in this country for In the case of all others offering from the number of artisans now coming out to Victoria on Mr Whitehead's selection, preference is to be shown, until the total of 146 is reached. At the same time, it is to be observed that, private firms arose, the necessity of bringing pressure to bear on the Commissioners to carry out their undertaking was not felt by the Immigration Bureau. The programme of locomotive construction to be carried out at the Newport workshops and by private firms is expected to absorb much additional labour, quite apart from the relief which is likely to result, when the eifect of the rainfalls is reflected in various trades. Then we get an explanation from the PremierThe Premier yesterday discussed with the Chairman of the Railways Commissioners the question of imported artisans.. Mr Watt said afterwards that in order to provide against possible contingencies he had gone into the matter at great length with the Chamber of Manufactures and the Trades Hall Council before any action was decided on. At this point, I wish to say that when the members of the Chamber of Manufactures were howling for more workers, and said they could not get artisans enough, the Trades Hall Council denied their statement. This was only twelve months ago, but the Chamber of Manufactures repeated their statements, whilst the press helped them in tbe matter. The Trades Hall representatives made a mistake-and I believe they are themselves of the same opinion now-in acceptingfiguressubmitted by the manufacturers. Events have shown tliat they were false; but, on those figures, the Trades Hall representatives were induced to concede that a certain number of men was necessary. They were brought out, and now we have several on the hands of Mr Ashby, the Secretary to thc Chamber of ManufacturesWhen Mr Whitehead left lor England he took a list of men required by the Railway Department. Since then private employment had not been so brisk, and some of the workers wanted by the Department had been available in the local labour market. This evidence, which is taken from a newspaper that is not a Labour newspaper, goes to show that a greater number of artisans have been brought to Victoria than were required.

253,Mr Mathews,"A t the railway workVictoria. I am not fully seized of the facts in connection with the other States, though I believe that the same remarks apply to the immigration to those States. The men who were brought to Victoria were told that when they arrived here the bosses would be waiting for them on the wharf, and would receive them with open arms. Many of them have since said that when they arrived they saw no bosses, arid some have been unable to secure a job since their arrival. Not only did the Victorian Government bring out more men than there was employment for, but they were not careful in the selection of those they did bring out. I can prove this by another quotation from a newspaper that is not a Labour journal. day's Age. newspaper. it to prove anything. Under the headings, "" New Settlers,."" "" Unsuitable Immigrants Arriving,"" Needed,"" I find the followingWhile (he Immigration Bureau has found employment for practically aU the new settlers who arrived by the Miltiades, Kaikoura and other steamers over a week ago, it is still called on to deal with a number of immigrants of the casual c'as, for whom it experiences a difficulty in obtaining; engagements. A certain amount of caution has to be exercised by the immigration officers in sending the newoomeTs into the country districts as farm labourers. Still the main difficulty of the bureau in satisfying all the immigrants is not with the selected passengers but the casuals. Almost every steamer, it is stated, brings a number of men who have worked their passage out to Victoria, in the belief that the prospects are golden. One butcher's employee informed the bureau that he was led to believe, by what he had heard in London, that when he arrived in Melbourne he would find employers waiting on the wharfs to secure his services, and that he would be able to obtain practically what wage he asked. Other immigrants have informed the officers of the bureau that such glowing accounts have been given by lecturers that men out of employment or dissatisfied with conditions in England went about the docks in the hope of finding the opportunity of working their way out to Victoria. Certainly the stream of casual immigrants is increasing, and while many promising settlers are said to be included, there is a risk of their failing to find satisfactory employment through the bureau, which is compelled to give preference to the farm workers who have received the approval of the immigration officers in London. Sitting impended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 f-m. to state the attitude of the workers to immigration. We admit the desirability of having a larger population in Australia, but we think that immigration with Government assistance has been overdone, and that the Chamber of Manufactures and the farmers have been making unnecessary complaints about the shortage of labour. . It has been proved that the farm labourers in our midst cannot all find employment, and there has been the same experience in regard to our artisans. The facts to which I have referred have related chiefly to Victoria, but I may add that when the Ballarat recently brought four engineers and fitters, one of them a brass-fitter, to Sydney, three of I quote from yesterthem, although competent workmen, found that they could not get employment at their trade at remunerative wages, and, together with the fourth, who was not in good health, left again on the return voyage of the steamer. It is not the Labour party, but the Opposition press, by which the statement is made, that too many farm labourers are being imported. I wish now to say a few words' about preference to "" More Careful Selection unionists. I do not like to charge the Op-, position with cant in taking the part of the non-unionists, because they may be sincere, but their love for the non-unionist is due to the fact that the non-unionist can be used as a weapon against the unionists. It is by organization that the wage-earners of the world have improved their position; that is universally admitted. The need for organization was recognised early last century; but those who formed unions were first imprisoned, and then hunted from pillar to post, and now, although unionism is established in almost every civilized country, there are employers who, if they dared, would sack their union workmen. will admit that the unionists have shown a spice of tyranny. necessary for self-defence, and the workers have endeavoured to make the principle as strong as possible. The non-unionist takes all the benefits that have been gained by the efforts of the unionist, but will not contribute 6d. or so a week to the support of the movement which has so greatly improved his position. No wonder, then, that there is antipathy against the non-unionist in the breast of the unionist. In whatever walk of life one may be, he feels strongly against his fellows who do anything opposed to the interests of his section. The unionists are",40,Imported Artisans

Could it be charged against the unionists that they prevent men from joining their unions, I would say that they act unfairly. every man. Why do not the non-unionists join unions ? that is the cause in most cases. Many men do not join unions because they say that they wish to be free. which they enjoy has been won by unionism. I interjected the other day that the non-unionists connected with the Brisbane strike were toadies, and I was right. The Brisbane tramway employees who would not join the unionists are like the non-union employees of the Melbourne Tramway Company, in thinking that by ""smoodging "" and toadying to the bosses they will be given preference over the unionists who are fighting for the whole body of workers. Yet the non-unionists are spoken of as loyalists, as strong-minded men who have the courage of their opinions. fight to improve the conditions of the whole body of workers, the non-unionists take the benefits that are won for them without doing anything to assist their fellows. sometimes asked, "" What has unionism done for the workers ?"" My reply is that it has raised their wages. We are told that in doing this it has increased the cost of the necessaries of life, so that the increase in the rates of wages is comparatively useless. Many of the workers say the same thing, but, when asked if they would accept lower wages in the hope of buying commodities at lower prices, they say that they would prefer to retain the wages they have, and look for the reduction of prices by other methods. know them, and the Opposition knows them. bines which have raised the price of commodities.

A [14] Protectionist should take that stand in order to prove that Protection does not unnecessarily increase the price of commodities. A Protectionist who will not do so is merely playing into the hands of Free Traders, who endeavour to make it appear But they open their doors to that a Protective policy will result in the raising of the prices of commodities, although we know from experience that it does not raise them very considerably a little bit, then? the honourable member must understand that in Australia we expect to maintain a higher state of civilization than obtains in any other country. We are told by« the Opposition to-day that .the raising of wages has resulted in an increase in the price of commodities. We deny fhat.

But is there a man in this House who will deny the assertion that Parliament dealt with those particular proposals without full and complete information ? We were dependent upon ex parte statements, and were not in a position to do justice either to ourselves or to the interests involved. the practice in other countries ? In Canada we find that the universal practice is to have full and complete investigation made before Tariff Bills are introduced. Going as far back as 1893, I find that in that year Sir John Thompson conducted the necessary investigation precedent to the introduction of a Tariff Bill. In 1897-8 three Cabinet Ministers constituted themselves a Commission for the same purpose. In 1907 the same course was resorted to; and at the beginning of the present year a Tariff Board was proposed and sanctioned by the Lower Chamber, with the design and object of making a full and complete inquiry. PerhapsI may be permitted to read a few Lines to indicate the directions which this inquiry was intended to pursue. The Board was to investigate and report to Parliament, amongst otlier matters, upon(a) The"" price and cost of raw materials in Canada and elsewhere, and the cost of transportation thereof from the place of production to the place of consumption or use.

Can this Parliament be effectively equipped to deal with Tariff matters, and do justice all round, without having such a complete investigation as is provided for in the statement that I have just read? and Customs has been sending similar questions to manufacturers in this country, and they have refused to answer them. I think, that the next Parliament will have to deal with Tariff matters. Properly speaking, fhey should be dealt with in the present session, but, at all events, they must be dealt with next year. Would it not be of immense importance and value to honourable members to have a preliminary investigation made between now and the What has been introduction of a Tariff Amending Bill, to enable them to deal properly with the subject? The honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who was so disturbed on this question, wanted to know what would be the constitution as to membership of such a Board as would be proposed by this side of the House; and, following out the excellent precedents of those who dealt with the same idea in the Hobart Conference, he said that nothing would satisfy him but to have two out of three Labour Protectionists on the Board. Of course, if the matter were dealt with in ""that particular way the nature of the results would be very largely assured beforehand.

The tax has been an estate-breaker, I admit; but so far its effect has practically been only to bring about subdivisions amongst families, amongst partners, and amongst syndicates, and so forth. In that way, there has undoubtedly been a substantial subdivision of estates since the passing of the Act; but there has not been up to the present any substantial degree of increased permanent settlement, and that is the point I wish to emphasize. that there has been an increase. Prime Minister said, that something like £18,000,000 worth of land has been dealt with; but that has largely been the result of subdivisions within the cities themselves, honourable friends endeavouring to increase or of subdivisions of the character to which I have already referred.

At Hobart we also had the exhibition of my the taxation from land. These are elements which I am sure will be remembered hereafter. The subject of finance has been mentioned, and I intend to deal shortly with it in passing. I propose to quote a few figures for the purpose of illustrating at the outset the difference between Liberal less extravagance. The estimated expenditure for 1909-10 was £7,867,62.1, and the actual expenditure was £7>497,866, As a matter of fact, the land tax, winch meant a saving of £369,755 by the Deakin-Cook Government then in power. Let us look at the management of the finances by the present Labour Government. The estimated expenditure for 1910-11 was ,£.11,122,000, and the actual expenditure was ,£13,156,000, showing a difference of £2,033,868. The estimated expenditure for 1911-12 was £15,451,429, and the actual expenditure was £18,682,866, showing a difference of £3,231,437. So that, the last three months being calculated, the Labour Government spent in these years, without parliamentary authority, a sum of no less than £5,264,437, against the saving of ,£369,755 by the DeakinCook Government.

This year the incomes of the people will be curtailed. My honourable friends on the other side have been fortunate in holding office in prosperous times. During the last nine years, Australia has enj05ed un; paralleled prosperity, and it has not been necessary for us to resort to London for the purpose of securing financial assistance. Of course, these local borrowings have resulted in the absorption of a certain amount of capital which otherwise would have been expended in industrial enterprises. But the fact remains that during this period we have been independent, so far as our loans Ate concerned. But the result of the Government basing its expenditure on revenue obtained at the high-water mark of prosperity has injured our credit abroad. It is not so good now as we would wish it to be. it been tested abroad ? time, there is a feeling of insecurity in consequence of industrial unrest and financial extravagance, which affects oiir credit ancl reputation. MT. ROBERTS -This is good enough for a turn at the Opera House. best advice, the abnormal .expenditure to which I have referred, together with the Socialistic proposals df the Government, has been productive of a feeling of insecurity. We are not justified in financing on the basis of the highwater mark of prosperity. We must realize that it will be our duty, in perhaps not the very remote future, to go to London for additional capital. At the beginning of this yeat, possibly, Australia had reached its most prosperous period, but when a drought was shortly after threatened the effect was simply electrical. Money was drawn in from all kinds of sources; and the money market became tight very rapidly. This goes to show that in the event of a drought befalling us we may fully expect to suffer in financial matters. With the knowledge that we will have to go to the Old Country, in perhaps not the remote future, and with the. hope and anxiety of introducing fresh capital, our duty should be to most cautiously conserve our credit. As a result of the imposition of the land tax, and for similar reasons, a very considerable amount of money is being withdrawn from Australia. land tax? the unfair and cruel incidence of the land tax. I am pointing out that, in the case of many companies, the effect of it has been-ever y one can see that for himself by an inspection of the balance-sheets-to bring about to a degree a withdrawal of capital. This ominous condition of affairs exists. During the last ten months the withdrawals of gold from Australia have amounted to no less than £7,000,000 more than the withdrawals for the corresponding period of last year. If we feel that we can always be independent, that we are justified in bringing about these withdrawals, and in any way discouraging the introduction of capital into this country, our policy is a very short-sighted one, and one from which we must ultimately suffer. statistics show that there is more money invested in Australia now than there ever was before ?",47,Imported Artisans

329,Mr Chanter,"I s it not a fact thatshould seek to encourage the investment of money in Australia. But I am pointing out that some of the money which was so freely invested in this country is being withdrawn. I come now to another important matter: The honourable member for Melbourne Ports complained that there were only two serious indictments lodged against the Government-on e was on the ground of industrial unrest, and the other was in connection with the Brisbane strike. man spoke of excessive expenditure, and before he leaves the question of finance, perhaps he will indicate on what lines he thinks the expenditure should be cut down. that there has been a vast increase in expenditure during the past two or three years, and I say that the effect has been disastrous to our reputation and credit abroad. perhaps the honourable gentleman will indicate which line of expenditure should be indulged in and which should be cut down. sent. An opportunity will be afforded later on for doing that. The figures speak very eloquently for themselves. The charge has been made from this side of the House that the term of office of the present Government has been disastrous in respect of the prevalence of industrial unrest. No period in Australia has been so prolific of industrial unrest. This can be accounted for by special reasons, which I shall give; but in the meantime I venture to suggest that sentiments expressed by leaders of the party opposite, and such as the Attorney General made use of in the course of his speech the other day, will not tend to the settlement of industrial matters. Leader of the Opposition had been dealing with the question of co-operation and profitcerity and the insincerity of the party so sharing, and had mentioned the fact that great success has attended that particular mode of dealing as between employers and employees. The principle of profit-sharing has been resorted to with advantage in the Old Country, and several instances in point could readily be given. It has meant the voluntary coming together upon satisfactory terms of employers and employees. It has not tended to the embittering of relations between them, or to create a prejudicial feeling of class against class. It has provided a modus vivendi between the two classes by which a satisfactory basis of mutual cooperation can be secured in the working of industrial concerns. The Attorney-General informed us that the working man's idea of profit-sharing is syndicalism. He went onto point out that he insists on fundamental alterations of our existing conditions, and"" that by the regulation of profits and prices alone can we get a solution of these problems. That, of course, means nationalization. He further said that it-is by a process of evolution that the Labour party must come to their own. The point I wish toemphasize is that the honourable gentleman claims that there must be a fundamental alteration of existing conditions, and that the working man's idea of profit-sharing is syndicalism. I think that in saying so he has done the party opposite, as a whole, an injustice. I realize, and admit at once, that syndicalism is the policy of a very substantial section of those opposite. They have never hesitated to avow it. Syndicalism in its bare and brutal aspect means confiscation, theft, and robbery. By a more technical description it may be said to mean the total destruction of the existing system of industrial organization, and it has been still more technically defined as the transfer of the means of production from the present possessors, the wage-payers, to the wage receivers by means of a general strike. If I am to understand from the Attorney General, who, I know, is largely supported by the Socialist section of his party, that syndicalism means this system of confiscation and robbery, then it is not to be wondered at that we should hear so much of industrial unrest. In my opinion, this industrial unrest, which has been so identified with the existence of-a Labour Government, has arisen from two main causes-firs t the lax ideas and administration, as to The law and order, of the present Government ; and, secondly, their utter insinfar as arbitration is concerned. Their lax ideas and administration in respect of law and 'Order are proved to the hilt by the occurrences connected with the Brisbane strike.

He goes on to say But I could that "" Employers and respectable citizens had to arm themselves to be even able to get the necessaries of life. The cafes were surrounded by the mob; persons were not allowed to go in and get meals, and the cooks and waiters and girls were terrorized into leaving. In the hotel where I stayed cooks, barmen, waitresses, and housemaids left without notice. This also happened at other places. The landlord of my hotel, to get bread, had to be escorted by a couple of policemen and two private individuals the honourable armed with revolvers. The secretary of the Railwaymen's Association, because he protested against the men going out (as, I understand, did the rest of the executive) was mobbed at his home, and had to escape by a back way, and had his life openly threatened twice. Every class of business the honourable was brought to a standstill. The theatres were mobbed, so that people had also their recreation stopped. A convent, that has a children's hospital attached, asked permission to get ice, and was refused by the Trades Hall, but obtained it by application to the police, who sent a van with an escort. Window smashing, assaults on individuals, stoning motor cars, and general blackguardism were ordinary matters. And Mr Fisher is pleased ! Now, to a more serious view still.

It is all very well for the Prime Minister and his friends to ingeniously try to cover up this disorder, so that they may find an excuse for refraining from assuring the Government of Queensland that law and order would be preserved in accordance with the obligations of the Constitution.

I quote from page 251 of our Hansard reportThe sub-inspector fired a shot at the ground, evidently with the intention of awing the crowd, and it was that shot which ricocheted, and, it is said, narrowly missed Sub-Inspector Carroll. A few weeks later I received a letter from a lady who holds an important position in Brisbane, but whom I did not know, in which she said, "" I am so disgusted with the statements in the papers regarding the strike that I write to tell you what I know. The shot was not fired by any of the men. It was fired by a police officer."" I had another letter from Brisbane two days ago.

For electioneering purposes, various interjections have been* made by my honourable friends. Amongst other things, they have endeavoured to fasten upon honourable members on this side of the chamber charges against certain individuals of having attempted .to use dynamite in connection with the Brisbane strike. But a careful perusal of the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition will conclusively show that no attempt has ever been made to fasten on to respectable unionists such violent criminal acts as that of laying dynamite on the tram lines. forward ? remains that dynamite was laid upon the tram lines. It is true that criminal acts by desperadoes are incidental to strikes, and I particularly wish to point out how desirable it is that such attempts should be put down ruthlessly, because, in America, dynamite is a recognised weapon =0 far as strikes are concerned. with that. it is the duty of honourable members opposite to exercise every power they possessmoral and otherwise-for the purpose of suppressing strikes.

A staggering blow has been dealt to the Labour cause throughout America by the . investigations in connection with the dynamiting conspiracy.

It is all very well for my honourable friends to say that they do not approve of strikes, whilst at the same time they en-courage them. That is not the way to suppress them. There is a very large section -of the party opposite-particularl y do I refer to the Socialist section-whos e policy is -deliberate brute force, violence, coercion, and intimidation. They will not brook restraint, as was well illustrated by what took place at Hobart. Here is a resolution which was carried at the Labour Confer-ence in that cityThat the Defence Act should be so amended AS to clearly set forth that the object of creattion of law and order of the present Going a Citizen Defence Force, based upon uni-yersal compulsory military training and service, is for the purpose of defending the Commonwealth against possible foreign aggression, and -therefore, under no circumstance, should any person so enrolled be compelled to bear arms .against any fellow Australian citizen, notwithstanding anything contained in the oath of -allegiance.

One of these Watson opposed this on the ground that law and order must be maintained. They -evidently thought it was not at all necessary; for, despite his protest, the motion was carried. Now, I wish to point out what a defiance such a resolution is of the law as it is set forth in the Constitution. Sectioni t g of our Constitution readsThe Commonwealth shall protect every State .against invasion, and, on the application of the Executive Government of a State, against -domestic violence. -the law to express an opinion which is contrary to it. stance, an attempt was made to have a law passed lo prevent the Citizen Forces being »ealled out to preserve order. .abusing words. protest which was carried at the Hobart Conference against anything of the kind. Then, again, in a meek and mild manner, -the New South VVales Government atiempted to maintain law and order at Lithgow, and with what result? Here is the protest which was carried by the Amalgamated Miners Association, on the 3rd September, 1911That this Association is appalled and disgusted with the action of the New South Wales Ministry in sanctioning the transference of a large body of paid assassins to Lithgow for the purpose of bludgeoning the workers into submission to the cause of capitalism. The ""paid assassins"" against whose presence they protested were the police, who were sent to Lithgow to preserve law and order. leader applied a similar term to me the other day. this industrial unrest is assignable 10 two causes-first , the lax ideas and administravernment;, and secondly, the insincerity of my honourable friends opposite upon the question of arbitration. Our whole experience of arbitration during the last two years of unprecedented industrial unrest has been one of vacillation on the part of the present Government. These elements have largely contributed to the non-success of arbitration. It was essentially a policy of the Liberal Government who introduced the present arbitration laws, with, amongst was to secure harmonious relationships between capital and labour, it being realized that on this depends the progress of the country. In spite of the teaching and preaching of a certain agitator, particularly in connection with the agricultural strike, who expressed the hope that rhe time would never come when contentment would prevail as between employer and employed Sir ROBERT B liST -Smith, I think his name was. The idea of establishing an Arbitration Court was to secure economic justice as between employer and employee^ and, above all, to put down strife and the barbarous system of strikes. A great experiment such as arbitration, and particularly compulsory arbitration, required the full and hearty co-operation of all parties in order to make it a success. The conduct of militant unionists and .the weak and vacillating policy of the Government are responsible for its non-success; and in this connection I shall briefly emphasize three or 'four points. First, according to the Constitution, this Parliament is authorized to make laws for peace, order, and good government iu connection with conciliation",51,Imported Artisans

The idea was that these laws should be .made applicable to any great Australian industry, such as shipping or shearing. They were also intended to apply where a strike occurred in any one State and by a natural process extended into an adjoining State. That was the beneficent design of this secnow subject to some correction as to thetion of the Constitution. But what has been the procedure under this section ? The section has been made a means of creating artificial disputes. No sooner does a dispute occur in a State than emissaries are sent to other States where contentment prevails; disputes are deliberately worked up, and thus disputes extending beyond the limits of a State are generated. ber give one illustration? case before the Federal Arbitration Court, the dispute has been artificially manufactured in the way referred to or by a strike process. has had to hold there was such a dispute before he could go on. point I am making; I say that in nearly every case, though I shall not say in all, submitted to the Federal Arbitration Court, the dispute has, after a long and expensive process, been artificially manufactured into an Inter-State industrial dispute-it could not come before the Federal Arbitration Court unless it was an Inter-State dispute. the present Act. of the kindt When a dispute has occurred in a State, instead of those concerned resorting to a local tribunal constituted for the purpose, the great aim and effort has been to reach the Federal Arbitration Court. State tribunal was not good enough for them, and discontent had to be deliberately created for the purpose of reaching the Federal Court. I say that that is a wicked distortion of the object and intention of the Constitution Act itself. Court in Tasmania which could have settled the Mount Lyell dispute. was none to settle the tramways strike. the Brisbane tramways, a strike was madein defiance of the law, although, as a matter of fact, they had an opportunity to go before the Federal Court. Ultimately, the dispute was taken before the Federal Court, and the point as to the badge wasdealt with. To show the extent to which this sort of thing is carried-thoug h I speak factsI may refer to the woodworkers' case. A dispute arose in the hardwood milling industry in Western Australia, and those concerned set t'o work and created an. industrial dispute amongst the lightwood. workers of Queensland and the sawmillers of Tasmania, Vict&ria, and New South Wales, a class of workers between whom there was no nexus or commoninterest. Thus, instead of a small strike that could have been settled locally, we had a dispute spread throughout thelength and breadth of the Commonwealthby an artificial process; and, by that means,, the case ultimately reached the Federal. Arbitration Court. It is said that all the Federal arbitration awards have been accepted by the workers, but that is an ephemeral condition of things, and arises from one sole fact. It has been the good' fortune of the workers to have secured' satisfactory awards before the present Federal Arbitration Court. alone, arbitration is popular, and is theideal of honourable members opposite. Experience, both here and elsewhere, showswhat a small circumstance will turn the whole wave of popular ideas from one direction to another. My first point is that the Constitution has been grossly and improperly abused, and the spirit and intention of the Act thwarted. My second point is that arbitration cannot possibly succeed unless it is loyally accepted by both sides. appealing ? the hands of honourable members opposite has been a sham, a delusion, and a snare;. it has meant, ""Heads, I win; tails, you lose."" When an award suits, the militant unionists it is accepted, and arbitration is held up as everything that can be claimed for it ; but if the award is against them, they refuse to obey it.",52,Imported Artisans

That was not carried, but it was seriously proposed and debated. Another proposal made at the Hobart Conference as to the best means of putting the High Court upon a proper basis wasThat two additional Judges be immediately appointed to the High Court in order to ensure verdicts in accord with the spirit of present Federal industrial and other legislation. That was a remarkable proposition : If we could only manage to pack our Bench and jury we should have no difficulty in gauging what the verdict would be. This proposition was not carried. The third feature that I wish to emphasize is the right to strike, which is persisted in by a large section of the supporters of the Labour party.

Even a substantial number of my honourable friends opposite insist upon the right to strike being retained. number of them do. Sir nounce strikes. point. whole, opposed to them? denounce them. I wish to show that the right to strike is part of the policy of a very large section, and particularly of the .Socialist wing, of the Labour party. This policy even has its source at the other side of the globe. Mr Ramsay Macdonald, the Leader of the Labour party in the House of Commons, was present at a Labour Conference in Birmingham, at which, according to a cablegram published in January last, resolutions were passed favouring the right to strike, condemning the employment ot the military in connection with industrial disputes, and advising all trade unions to defy the law until the Qsborne judgment is reversed. That is a fairly large orderinsistence on the right to strike, refusal of the maintenance of law and order, and defiance of law, until the Osborne judgment is reversed. sponsible for all that Mr Ramsay Macdonald has said? party in England are saying at the present time. told my honourable friend that he must have heard a number of his own supporters insisting on the right to strike. If my honourable friends opposite do not like to hear what Mr Ramsay Macdonald has said, let me come nearer home. In this House, on 6th September, 1911, the honourable member for Maranoa. as reported in Hansard, Vol. I.X., p. 116, saidThe right to strike is the only weapon the workman has, and we are not going to give that up. Then, again, Senator Rae, speaking in the Senate on 14th September last, said, as reported in Hansard, Vol. LX . , p.. 431I hold that, whether it is in big political issues or in industrial issues, force still holds sway, and that striking produces better results than any other method yet found out. SenatorS i . LBDGER -D o you think that workmen will ever give up the right to strike? Senator RAE I hope not; that is, until they get a mucli more perfect form of arbitration. real freedom of the Labour man. observed any sign of it. Carson been saying? asked to confine my attention to statements made within the Commonwealth, and I am trying to do so. I come now to the sugar strike, in connection with which Messrs. Charles Collins ancl George Ryland, then Queensland Labour membersI think I have heard the name "" Ryland"" beforesaidThe men were more than justified in their action. They only wondered that the men had not struck against their ill conditions years ago. Then, again, in the Brisbane Courier of 10th July, 1911, there is a report of speeches made at Cairns on the 8th of that month by Senators Rae, Blakey, and Russell, and Messrs. Howe, Ozanne, and Finlayson. The report states thatEach speaker urged the workers to be strong, and said that if they kept together they would win the day. Mr Howe said he was a revolutionist to the heart's core. They had to view the facts as they were, and to look on the industrial world as it was. He had every sympathy with the men, and hoped they would be victorious in the struggle. Honourable members are aware of the resolutions passeel in Sydney in favour of preserving the right to strike, and here is a statement made by Mr Coyne, as reported in the Argus of 9th February lastThe strike leader ( Mr Coyne) this morning told the usual assembly of some 3,000 strikers, that the Strike Committee held the key to thesituation. It was no use, he said, for Mr Justice Higgins to call a compulsory conference in regard to the tramway matter. Therewas a far greater issue to be fought now. If all the tramway men went back to-morrow it would not settle the trouble. No matter what the compulsory conference might decide, thestrikers need take no notice of it.

431,Sir Robert Best,"I have beento hear it ; if so, I stand corrected. I gave my authority, and will be amazed if the statement has been denied, because it was reported, not in one paper only, but in several papers to the same effect. The point I am making is that a strike is open defiance of arbitration, and that it is absolutely impossible for arbitration to succeed unless the power of striking is abandoned. WhereI hold Ministers and a number of my honourable friends blamable is that they take no opportunity of denouncing strikes; on tbe contrary, they show their sympathy with the strikers. A strong, responsible attitude on their part would mean the discouragement of strikes. In so far as strikes are discouraged will arbitration be encouraged. Moreover, the action of the Prime Minister, other Ministers, and certain honourable members present in sympathizing with various strikes has a moral effect, and exerts a great influence on the masses. If my honourable friends would use their power and influence in the denunciation of strikes, then the effect would be the discouragement of them, and I should hope their ultimate extinction. Arbitration, I repeat, cannot possibly succeed unless Ministers and the members of the Labour party are prepared to take up a strong and firm attitude in the denunciation of strikes. Only in such circumstances can arbitration have a. possible chance of success. complained that men were forcing themselves into the Arbitration Court. another body called the Federation of Labour, who avow themselves as particularly opposed to arbitration and directly in favour of syndicalism. the 13th June reports that at a meeting of the New South Wales Trades Union Congress, the following motion was submitted :That we demand the repeal of all industrial legislation that takes away the right of combination and the right to strike The motion was strongly supported by many members, and this amendment was movedThat, pending the establishment of Federation of Labour, the present industrial legislation be allowed to stand. The Federation of Labour has for its object the abolition of arbitration. In the first division on the amendment the voting was even, and in the second division the amendment was carried by 35 votes to 28. I have stated a few ominous factors in connection with the matter. Unless my honourable friends on the other side take up a different attitude, it is utterly impossible that arbitration can succeed. I speak as one who is earnestly desirous that this peaceful means of settling industrial disputes should pass from a mere experiment to a successful scheme. nounce employers who lock out their men? would. word of denunciation of Badger, who locked out the Queensland tramway men. able member has heard me a word. member has heard my denunciation of the defiance of the law.

453,Sir Robert Best,"I for one wouldbroke the law was Mr Badger, the manager of the Tramway Company. The Judge said that. Sir ROBE RT BEST -On the subject of immigration the honourable member for Melbourne Ports quoted one or two instances to indicate why there should not be immigration. he avowed that tion to people coming to our shores, but he sought to show .every reason in his power why they should not do so. He gave two solitary instances, I believe, where men had come out here, but things had not turned out to their expectation, and therefore they had returned. As regards the case of the Wonthaggi miners, it is a deplorable fact that the Wonthaggi mine has been brought to the verge of failure by reason of the unfortunate industrial disputes which have occurred there. In these circumstances I can quite understand a miner from the Old Country going there and being unable to secure the terms of employment which he had reason to expect. While I am prepared to say that there are avowals by some of my honourable friends of their not being opposed to immigration, the general tenor of their attitude is towards the discouragement rather than towards the encouragement of immigration. Mr W. H . IRVINE -They want immigration in the abstract. migration in the abstract, but not in the reality. a sort of "" gelatinous "" thing. Sir ROBE RT BEST orable friends credit for endeavouring to develop and carry out the defence policy of the late Government, as laid down in the Bills introduced by the honourable member for Parramatta. good work in connection with that defence policy and its development. But valuable as that contribution towards defence is, there is something infinitely more important than that. We, as a matter of fact, are unable to keep up that measure of defence which would grant us immunity and complete security. achieved by the peopling of our waste spaces. Hitherto, we have enjoyed some protection by reason of two circumstancesisolation, but mainly and chiefly the strong arm of the British Navy. As regards our isolation, that is being steadily reduced as conditions in the Pacific are radically changing. There we find the rise of Japan, the rise of China, and the opening of the Panama Canal. These things, are completely altering the conditions of the Pacific, and reducing that protection from isolation which we have hitherto enjoyed. Japan is now the strongest navaL It is true that Power in the Pacific. , only a first-class Power, but the strongest naval Power in the Pacific. We know that a peaceful revolution is taking place in China, which nation will, in possibly the early future, become a rival of Japan. We are aware of the internal development which is proceeding in China. The Panama Canal, when it is opened, will bring Asia, America, and Australasia into closer contact, particularly having regard to the mammoth steamers which are being constructed, and minimize those difficulties' of transport which previously were all im-' portant obstacles. On the other hand, we have the fact that the conditions in regard to the British Navy are altering seriously. European navies are being gradually increased, with the result that Great Britain has had to concentrate her naval force in European waters for the protection of her immediate self, and generally in the interests of the Empire. It will be seen that the protection which we have hitherto, enjoyed is to some extent diminishing so far as the Pacific is concerned, and that the Mother Country will not be. able in future, certainly not to the same extent as in the past, to send fighting fleets to Australia in our defence. These are I give my honserious elements, and the subject of grave comment at times-the y make our position more and more perilous every year, and accentuate more and more the actual necessity for a volume of immigration tq They have done some these shores, rather than a complaint against the driblet that is coming in.

In view of tlie experience of Canada and America, which is absolutely to the contrary, it is very short-sighted to suggest that we should be afraid that die immigration of white people will have the effect of reducing our standard of living. Our percentage of increase by immigration is not improving as it should be. From 1881 to 1891, that increase represented some 40 per cent. If that percentage had been maintained, our population at the present time would be something like 6,250,000. The fact is that, for the last twenty years, the increase has been only something like 18 per cent., with the result that at present we have only 4,500,000. personstoroccupy these vast areas.

It is impossible for the present Government to put forward the drawbacks from whicb they suffer, by reason of the attitude of their supporters, outside this House particularly. Even when the States made proposals for cooperation, the Federal Government could not see their way to join in the co-operation proposed.

Navvies not wanted, too many here. In the circumstances, we cannot expect from the present Government any active, energetic forward immigration policy such as is essential to the best interests of this community. I had intended to speak of two or three other matters; but I shall close my remarks by a word or two on the Tariff. I have already dealt witb the Tariff Board, but I wish to show, in a few and concise words, the attitude I take, and the regrets' I have to express in connection with what the Government have done. They appear to me to have betrayed the hopes and expectations of the Protectionist section of this community, in view of the circumstances under which they came into office. In 1909, our imports were valued at £51,000,000, £59,250,006. In 1911 our imports had risen to nearly £66,000,000, and our exports were £79,500,000. The returns for tbe first quarter of 1.912 show an increase in the value of imports over the corresponding .period of 19.11 of £3,500,000. Our present imports represent something like ,£r6 per head of the population. What is more, although I do not attach too much importance to it, the balance of trade has .gone against _ Australia so far as the first quarter of this year is concerned, the value -of our imports being in excess of the value of our exports for that period. If this were .to .go on much longer, it would mean an .increased exportation of gold. The position I wish shortly to .put to honorahle members is this.: It is acknowledged that wages have gone .up during the last few years from .30 to 50 per cent. Mr ""-PODOH -NO . -been nothing like 'that. [iS]2 able gentleman and I totally disagree. My information is that wages have increased:' from 30 to 50 per cent.

Tasmania have recently had their wages substantially increased; a fact on which I congratulate my honourable friend. fits increased? industries profits have not increased to a degree corresponding with the increase in wages. Therefore, the intention of Parliament in regard to the protection of these industries has not been carried out, and they are entitled to an increase of duties. the honourable member say that wages have increased 50 per cent. ? quently read statements to that effect. The statement is made in an article in the Age, in which the writer saysWe have frequently pointed out that the and our exports at Minister, in his everlasting declaration of "" protection for employee as well as for employer"" ignores the fact that by the general rise in wages, ranging during the last few years from 30. to 50 per cent., the workman has received substantial advantage, while the manufacturer, as far as the Tariff is concerned, is .no better off than he was five years ago. is making statements which, as a. lawyer, he knows would not influence a Judge. dence brought forward in this House wererequired to be of the nature demanded by a Court of "" law, most of the statements: made by honourable members -would have to be eliminated.
