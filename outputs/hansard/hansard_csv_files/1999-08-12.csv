Thursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 8695 Thursday, 12 August 1999 that we are having difficulty with the clock for timing speeches. I might give you a gong when you have got one minute left until we get it fixed. Telstra: 000 Service Tasmania is just about to lose it. According to Telstra, it is a commercial decision. Apparently the new technology that tracks the locations of calls is supposed to be fail-proof and we are supposed to get this before the centre is moved. It is a small retrieval on what has been said recently but it does not reassure me or give me any feeling of safety for my constituents. My small town of Longford in northern Tasmania has already run foul of this emergency system when we had a robbery in the local bank on 30 December last year. One of my constituents, a man in his 70s, became the local hero when he tried to foil the bandit. It could have turned into a very serious situation, because the call centre got it wrong: it rang the wrong town. It rang Longford in Victoria. So without the local knowledge which would have normally dispatched a police officer to Longford in Tasmania it got it wrong and sent the person to Longford in Victoria. It was three-quarters of an hour before the Victorian police had picked up on the fact that there was no Trust Bank in their town, and they had to ring back and say that it was the wrong place. This could really have gone wrong and, of course, the robber was long gone by the time the police got there. Our 70-plus hero, who was all for stopping the bandit by tripping him up when he came out of the bank and who had tried to persuade others to assist him, was fmally persuaded to come next door and take the number of the car and memorise the incident, and this did eventually lead to the conviction of the felon. This is the sort of local knowledge which is needed for it to be possible to dispatch services as a result of the 000 service. I believe the service should be located in the local area, state or region where the calls come in. How they do that can be a commercial decision. I believe that things will still go wrong right around Australia when there are people taking these calls in places other than the regions where incidents are occurring. What is the future? Is the future Calcutta? Is the future somewhere else in the world because that is where you can book your airline ticket these days? This is a major concern to constituents of Tasmania.

Running off to deal with a bank robbery in the wrong state reminds me of the product of the recent meeting of the ministers for health where they considered the issue of cadmium in peanuts.

It has no redeeming health qualities. There is nothing about it that is good. I cannot see any circumstance in which a health minister would be able to hold their head up high in advocating an increase of cadmium in somebody's diet. The old levels in Australia used to be 0.05. In New Zealand, to their everlasting shame, the level was I-not 0.1, but 1. That is 20 times the acceptable Australian level. The New Zealand level was set through a misguided process. The New Zealanders were conscious of the fact that they had to drastically reduce that level because, not surprisingly, they had high levels of cadmium in a whole range of foods and people were suffering kidney diseases in great numbers. The level had to be reduced and we had to reach a standardised position between Australia and New Zealand, but New Zealand was the place where the reductions had to be made. In Australia we had a level of 0.05, which was an appropriate level for peanuts. The only countries in the world that cannot make the 0.05 level for peanuts are the US and China. This is because the US has a lot of fallout from brown coal power stations and China uses nightsoil for fertiliser. Credit for the efforts to overcome this crazy increase to 0.1 must go to Senator Ron Boswell, Bob Hanson of Peanut Company of Australia and the Prime Minister, who made considerable efforts to ensure that the Commonwealth position was correct. The government did take a very strong stance in support of the peanut growers. (Time expired) Australian Capital Territory: Hospice Ms ELLIS (Canberra)-I want to talk very briefly this morning about the position facing the ACT hospice. It is currently located on Acton Peninsula, but unfortunately it has to move. Members may recall some comments I made previously on this subject when we were attempting to bring some pressure to bear on the government to ensure that the hospice remained where it was on Acton Peninsula. Unfortunately, we lost that battle and the debate has now moved on. All of our efforts are now being put into ensuring that a location is found on the basis of the needs and the ideals of the hospice community, and not purely on an economic judgment. Seven sites are currently under consideration, of which five are located at, near or within Calvary Hospital. One of the sites is at Lake Ginninderra and another is at Yarralumla Bay-the latter site having been put into contention for consideration by the hospice society. Unfortunately, some advice came out of Senator Reid's office on 26 July stating that the ACT government already had a preferred option for the relocation of the hospice. Their preference was to consider a Calvary Hospital site. The Hospice and Palliative Care Society put out a press release on 30 July with the heading: 'Appalled with the process of re-siting",151,Representatives Main Commitiee

They expressed their very strong objection to the processes where, on the one hand, an investigatory process is under way while, at the same time, a so-called 'preferred site' is being made known to them through government sources. It is fair to say that Senator Reid's advice was strongly refuted by the ACT government and some clarity has now been put on that particular situation. One cannot really blame those who are supporting the hospice people when we know that the consultants for the hospice relocation process also happen to be carrying out the feasibility study for the refurbishment of Calvary Hospital. So whilst we are not in any sense accusing anyone of any untoward action there, one cannot be blamed for suspecting some decisions have already been made. What we do know is that we now have a situation where the processes are under question: do we have a process where we are going to have a new location determined on the true needs and ideals of that ACT hospice community or is it going to be skewed unfairly by looking more strongly at the economic costs? The Yarralumla Bay site, in my opinion and in the opinion of the hospice community, is all ideal site; but what we would like to see is an honest and open appraisal of that site-the one suggested by the hospice society and its community-and hopefully it will be located there. (Time expired) Student Citizenship Awards Australian Youth Parliament for the Environment Administration)-I rise to praise the noteworthy contributions to our community of three young people on the Sunshine Coast. These are people for whom we can have the highest regard. These young people have gained the respect of their peers and community leaders. They have participated actively in community organisations. I would like to mention in particular Jarrod Bleijie from the Caloundra State High School, John Nielsen from the Nambour Christian College and Haimee-Jane Roberts from the Sunshine Coast Christian Outreach College. In July 1999, the Order of Australia Association in Queensland set up Student Citizenship Awards. Both Jarrod and Haimee-Jane were given this outstanding award by His Excellency the Governor of Queensland, Major General Peter Amison. I am particularly proud that these two young people were nominated. They were considered by their peers, by the general community and by the Order of Australia Association to be people who were worthy of this particular recognition. It is an outstanding achievement for the Sunshine Coast, and in particular for the electorate of Fisher, to have two of the 12 inaugural recipients of the Order of Australia Student Citizenship Awards. In addition, Jarrod, along with John Nielsen from the Nambour Christian College, have both been selected to represent the electorate of Fisher at the Australian Youth Parliament for the Environment to be held in Old Parliament House at the end of this month. Everyone in Australia knows that the current Howard government is the greenest government in Australia's history. Mr Ronaldson interjectingmember for Ballarat, who is present in the chamber, so strongly supports the government's initiatives in this area.

We in our society see so much criticism of young people. When we have three fine young people such as Jarrod, John and Haimee-Jane, we can know that our society in the future will be in safe hands. We know that they are role models for other young people. I have the highest regard for them. They have made a wonderful contribution not only to the electorate of Fisher and to the Sunshine Coast but to our wider Australian community. I salute them; I congratulate them. I look forward to hosting the participants in the Australian Youth Parliament for the Environment when that parliament is convened. I dare say that colleagues from both sides of the chamber will join me in congratulating these three outstanding young people from the Sunshine Coast. I know that they will be a continuing example to their peers. Aged Care: Services ambitious task, I suppose, in the three minutes available to me, of attempting to read a large chunk of a very important letter that was sent to me and which I passed on to Minister Bishop, the Minister for Aged Care, in respect of aged care hostel funding. I was unable to complete it, but circumstances now enable me to make a few remarks on that issue. I was referring to the outstanding service provided to the community in my electorate by the Holloway Hostel. I also referred to the great honour that particular hostel has given my family by naming the facility after my grandmother and recognising her work in aged care in Victoria. It is an outstanding service and one which has got strong local community support and is very well supported by the local community. However, it has serious problems, along with many similar organisations, because of liquidity problems brought about by changes in government policy. This government has ceased to provide capital funding for frail aged hostels and, consequently, any expansion in service needs to be financed from residents' funds held in trust. The difficulty with that process is that when those funds are invested they earn interest and provide important revenue for hostels. This 40-bed hostel has some considerable problems in terms of liquidity because, in order to expand so that it can get economies of scale in its operation, it would need to draw down residents' funds rather than continue to invest them to support its revenue. A 40-bed hostel, no matter how well managed, would appear to have considerable difficulties at that level in sustaining its operations in a way which enables it to repay longer term debt. This is a practical example of many community based hostels in this country that are suffering because of the government's policy in relation to capital funding. Liquidity problems are also contributed to by decisions the government has taken with respect to requiring hostels to repay residents' funds held in trust within seven days, I understand, of the resident departing. That needs to be compared with the six months that an incoming resident has to meet that contribution, so there is obviously a very significant financing gap because of that, which exacerbates the more fundamental problems brought about by the government's parsimonious approach to capital funding for these important community services. I take this opportunity, unexpected as it is, to emphasise that in an ageing community this is a matter that the government needs to attend to. (Time expired)",153,Representatives Main Commitiee

In the very short time available to me, I want to talk about the Centre for Advancement of Men's Health, which is based in Daylesford in my electorate and very ably run by Mr Bernard Denner, who started the Men's Awareness Network quite some time ago. I was very fortunate to be able to launch the Good Medicine for Men handbook in February 1998, and this has really grown into something that is getting up a head of steam and is now being used all over Australia. The Men's Awareness Network is about convincing us mere mortals that our own health is our responsibility and not somebody else's. As a result of Mr Denner's work, the South Australian health minister will launch a South Australian version of the Good Medicine for Men handbook on 26 August. Mr Denner has just returned from the Blair Athol coal project in Claremont, Central Queensland. He addressed 178 men, as well as the occupational health and safety people and the mine doctor. The response from the miners to the mine management's facilitation of this project was overwhelmingly welcomed by 96 per cent of the miners. Mr Denner was rated 4.24 out of five. Ninety-one per cent of the miners wanted more sessions and they thought more highly of their employer. The aim of the exercise is to get men to see their GP, and, apparently, they have been knocking the local doctor's door down to get in. The work of the MAN network-the Centre for Advancement of Men's Health-is spreading not only throughout Victoria but also in Canberra itself. The ACT Legislative Assembly's Standing Committee on Health and Community Care invited Mr Denner and his group to Canberra. One of the recommendations of the report they recently released was that a similar community awareness program to encourage men to access health services be developed in the ACT, and specific reference was made to the Men's Awareness Network-the MAN model-from Victoria, which utilises a partnership approach between men, general practitioners and health workers. They were very complimentary and will indeed, I think, be basing a program in the ACT on this MAN model developed out of Daylesford. Men's health is our responsibility, and I congratulate the Centre for Advancement of Men's Health and Mr Bernard Denner. (Time expired) time for members' statements has concluded.

230,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"---Order! In accordance with standing order 275A, the8700 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 and Lost Members) Bill 1999 and the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Consequential and Transitional Bill 1999 give effect to a not previously announced proposal to consolidate and improve the provisions concerning unclaimed and lost superannuation moneys by doing a number of things. First, they extend the use of tax file numbers for superannuation purposes to the Commonwealth lost members register and the state or territory unclaimed money registers. Second, they improve the definition of unclaimed money to better target cases. Third, they allow the Commissioner of Taxation to publish details relating to unclaimed money, as currently permitted for unclaimed bank money, subject to privacy safeguards. Fourth, they improve cooperation between Commonwealth and state or territory unclaimed money registers. Fifth, they include public sector superannuation funds into the lost member and unclaimed money schemes. Sixth, they consolidate existing provisions which are currently spread over four separate items of legislation. Finally, they ensure consistent taxation treatment between Commonwealth and state or territory unclaimed money registers. To ensure that the bill is prospective, transitional provisions are contained in the second bill which allow up to two years for the states or territories to pass appropriate changes to their unclaimed moneys legislation. In some cases, existing state or territory legislation may already satisfy the provisions of this bill. A small unquantifiable increase in Commonwealth revenue is expected due to the superannuation moneys paid from these state and territory money registers being taxed in the same manner as superannuation moneys which are currently paid into the Commonwealth's unclaimed money register. The compliance costs are said by the government to be minimal. The bill will not significantly change the existing structures of the Commonwealth and the state or territory registers. The Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Consequential and Transitional Bill 1999 also makes a technical amendment to section 202 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and sections 8WA and 8WB of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to rectify a drafting error which occurred as a result of the insertion of two paragraphs (k) in section 202 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. With the introduction of the superannuation guarantee in 1992, superannuation coverage has steadily increased to its current level of over 90 per cent of workers. In anticipation of this problem-of more workers losing track of their superannuation entitlements-Labor announced the Commonwealth unclaimed money and lost members register in October 1992 in a policy statement 'Strengthening Superannuation Security'. The Commonwealth unclaimed money register has, in fact, only been operational since 1 July 1997 and is administered by the Commissioner of Taxation. Approximately $80,000 is currently held as unclaimed moneys by the Commonwealth and a total of $17 million by the states and territories. Some states or territories have unclaimed money register legislation which is consistent with the Commonwealth legislation. In these states or territories, superannuation or retirement savings account providers are required to report unclaimed moneys to the state or territory registers rather than to the Commonwealth register. However, there is a significant difference between moneys which are unclaimed and moneys which are lost. Due to preservation arrangements, superannuation money may only be classified as unclaimed when a member has reached eligibility age, which is 60 or above, or has died. In some state or territory jurisdictions, this creates a long lag time before a member can be reunited with their superannuation entitlements. In contrast, the Commonwealth lost members register only requires superannuation providers to report information rather than pay money",155,Representatives Main Commitiee
231,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (9.59 A.m.),"The Superannuation (Unclaimed MoneyThursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 8701 and tries to reunite members with their moneys before it is deemed to be unclaimed. It is, therefore, more efficient and less cumbersome to declare superannuation lost rather than unclaimed, in many cases. This bill will formally allow the Commissioner of Taxation to keep a register of details relating to unclaimed and lost moneys so that the money can be more easily claimed by those workers who are entitled to it. It also allows for the matching and safekeeping of lost and unclaimed moneys and for the coordination of matching and collection of unclaimed moneys between the Commonwealth and the states or territories. We consider this to be a positive initiative. We note that there is a possible privacy issue and that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills may wish to ensure that the privacy provisions relating to the use of the tax file numbers are in order. I have been provided by the government with some correspondence from the Office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner. I thank the government for providing this information to the opposition. The letter from the Deputy Privacy Commissioner to the tax office says that the Deputy Commissioner is making a note concerning the regulations which might be made pursuant to section 50 of the main bill, that there are privacy issues connected with providing access to lost member and unclaimed money registers, and that the Privacy Commissioner would welcome consultation on regulations which deal with that aspect of maintaining the registers. The Privacy Commissioner would like to see the regulations when they are drafted. Naturally, we would also be interested in seeing those regulations when they are drafted and having the opportunity to comment on them if there are any privacy concerns that arise from that. As I have indicated, the purpose of the bill is to consolidate the existing provisions relating to notification and payment of unclaimed superannuation money, and the notification of lost members of superannuation entities; to reduce from two to one the number of Commonwealth entities involved in unclaimed money and lost members' entitlements; and to provide that, for state and territory authorities to be able to collect unclaimed money, they have to operate under the laws that meet similar requirements to those applicable to the proposed single Commonwealth entity involved in the area. In short, it is to ensure that all superannuation moneys paid to workers are received by workers, and that is a very admirable aim. While the government is working to look after these unclaimed superannuation contributions, however, it is, regrettably, not showing the same endeavour in helping many workers who are not being paid their superannuation guarantee levy by their employer. I want to bring to the House the case of a resident of Bulleen, Mr Michael, whose employer had not been paying his superannuation guarantee as required under the law. Mr Michael contacted the Australian Taxation Office, seeking its assistance in getting his superannuation contributions. Instead of the rather more efficient service that you receive from the tax office if you owe it money, Mr Michael was told that he should contact the department of workplace relations because the tax office only collects figures on non-compliance for statistical purposes. Mr Michael also received a letter from the tax office in response to his letters about non-compliance. This letter, which I found somewhat disturbing, said in part: Complaint fonns continue to be the ATO's most valuable source of infonnation and are input into a database which includes additional sources of infonnation. Analysis of this database guides the ATO as to the best and most efficient way to channel its audit and compliance action. For example a number of complaints from the same industry in the same region may lead to a project on all employers in that industry or region. 8702 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 Does that mean that, if you want your superannuation looked into, you are best advised to get your mates to put in claims as well? I would rather have thought not. Another example I have received is from Rebecca Pattison, of Boronia Heights, who made a complaint in 1998. She received a letter from the tax office on 16 September 1998, thanking her for providing all the necessary information. It is now August 1999 and in a letter to her local member, she has said: I then contacted the ATO, for them to look into it. It has now been a year, and I still haven't heard anything about it. The reason, I dare say, that Ms Pattison has not heard anything is that the ATO has simply entered her information into a database. Ms Pattison indeed found out herself, with one phone call, that her superannuation was not being paid, whereas the tax office had not done anything in the course of 12 months. That sends out all the wrong messages about compliance and education. Sending out the right messages about the superannuation guarantee is a critical thing if you expect compliance. The right messages have got to be sent out to the community, and the tax office has not been doing it. It also says that employees who are members of very small workplaces have to live in fear of recalcitrant employers who choose not to pay their superannuation guarantee, because the tax office is only going to follow up the larger cases. When I wrote to the tax office seeking redress on behalf of Mr Michael, I was sent a letter which said in part: To date, the Employee Notification of Insufficient Employer Contributions (EN) forms lodged by individuals who believed their employer was not providing superannuation support have been the sole determinant of audit activity. The ATO's analysis of the finalised 'form cases' has shown that the individual actioning of these cases has only met with limited success in meeting its goal of superannuation for all employees. In addition, the analysis has also revealed that in excess of 50% of the complainants actually had superannuation contributions made for them but did not know. In short, cases based on complaints were receiving the majority of the ATO's resources, often without justification and at the expense of employees who had not lodged complaints. You can imagine my surprise when I received a press release from the tax office at about the same time titled 'Tax office comes to town for annual superannuation survey'. Part of that press release stated: Employers will receive the 8099 diskette with instructions and contact details for more information. It would be appreciated if employers comply with the request for information at their earliest convenience. To what end, we have to ask, is this being done? So that the information can be loaded into a database? Indeed, beyond that, in the Financial Review of 6 July this year it was reported: But the ATO has abandoned its policy of following up aU complaints from workers about employer's superannuation contributions, relying instead on individual employees to make inquiries. Mr Bator of the Australian Taxation Office was quoted as saying: We used to chase down every one of them but in more than 50% of cases the employer was doing the right thing. Now we ask the employees to make inquiries themselves. This is exactly what Rebecca Pattison, for example, had done. But she has never heard back. The information must simply have been entered into a database and forgotten about. So this 'campaign' from the tax office was something less than fair dinkum. There is no point in gathering figures on compliance if they are not going to require employers to pay their workers' superannuation guallalltee contributions. Thursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 8703 In my view, the superannuation guarantee needs to be policed by the tax office. Nonpayment of the superannuation guarantee means that employee retirement incomes are diminished and that the country-the rest of us as a nation-pays for that loss. Effective compliance relies upon action by the tax office. Employers have a legal responsibility to pay workers' superannuation guarantee contributions, and workers are entitled to the assurance that the tax office will act on complaints and not simply file them. Since this occurred, I have received other similar complaints from workers and are being dudded by their employer and are most concerned that the tax office only seems interested in catching the whales while thousands of minnows get away. I agree with them. I wrote letters to the editor, sent out a press release and alerted radio news to this, and this did prompt some action from the tax office. They endeavoured to get across the idea that they were following up every claim. They even sent me a new letter about superannuation guarantee compliance. In this new letter, however, they could not bring themselves to say that they would follow up each and every complaint individually. Instead, they said: Every complaint is followed up through a reminder strategy which involves ovet 11 ,000 letters issuing to employers about whom we have received a complaint or who have paid the SG Charge in a previous year. So, yes, we now have the tax office going back to sending letters to all employers telling them of their obligations under the act, but it is obvious that many employers already ignore their ·obligations. Therefore, I do not hold up a whole lot of hope that this strategy will necessarily prove to be effective. Ms Pattison's employer would have received this letter, and it certainly has not helped her. The tax office went on to say: Our new outbound call centre in Burnie also rings all employers about whom we have a complaint to 'remind' them of their obligations ... Once again, we presume that Ms Pattison's employer has received this call, although it certainly has not helped her yet. I am concerned that this is not good enough. I have had a briefing as a result of raising this issue with the tax office, and I appreciated that opportunity. I hope this leads to an improvement and, indeed, to the tax office now following up those individual complaints. I want to see the government applying the same directed effort to superannuation guarantee compliance that they are now evidently applying to lost and unclaimed superannuation through this bill. I want a guarantee from the government that tells every Australian employee that, if they make a complaint, they will have their case followed up individually, not by a call from a call centre or from someone with a script but by an officer from the tax office who is actually investigating the suspect company. Australians expect nothing less from the tax office. If you have an individual complaint to raise with any other department such as health, social security or housing, an electricity authority or your council, you do not necessarily have the right to have that complaint upheld-it may well not be upheld-but you do have the right to have your individual circumstances checked out and to receive a response which takes into account your particular circumstances. Mr Deputy Speaker, as I said earlier on, the opposition is supporting the legislation before the House. Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Bi111999, speak about two categories of money: unclaimed and lost superannuation money. Those are the two categories that are referred to, but I believe that there is a third category, and that is superannuation money",156,Representatives Main Committee
232,Mr Cameron Thompson (Blair) (10.15 A.m.),"The member for Wills, and the8704 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 generated under false circumstances. I will explain what I mean by that as part of the account I will give here. The discussions I am raising centre around the itinerant labour industry across Australia. I am referring to people who are engaged in pursuits like pruning vines and trees, picking fruit and vegies, and cotton chipping. It is a large industry across Australia. In fact, I am privileged to be a member of a group that is currently studying the needs of the harvest industries across Australia. The group is called the National Harvest Trail Working Group and it focuses on those industries. It was formed by the Minister for Employment Services and is chaired by the member for Hindmarsh. Hopefully, it will report very early in the new year on its findings. We are investigating the problems of harvest labourers and their employers across Australia. Members may recall that, years ago-before mechanised cane harvesting-there was a very strong perception of there being a national harvest trail where canecutters, as portrayed in the famous Australian play The Summer of the Seventeenth Doll, would pack their kitbag, and off they would go and get involved in the cane harvesting. In fact years ago, when I worked out west, I would hear how, in times gone by in the history of the sheep shearing industry, sheep shearers used to ride around on pushbikes covering up to 500 kilometres to move from one shearing shed to another in the outback of Queensland and New South Wales to engage, in effect, in the pursuit of bringing in the harvest. The members of this national harvest trail group include representatives of industry, people who are growers and people who have also tried to set up harvest labour combines to serve various aspects of this industry. I am raising the needs of the harvest labour industry because superannuation and the provision of superannuation entitlements are massive issues for growers and pickers. There is a massive turnover of workers in this industry. Some people go out picking and stay for a day; other people go out and might stay for two hours. They might stay for a week. But for many participants, it is not the kind of work that goes on to become a lifelong pursuit. For some people it is. But for many who try it, it can be a very daunting task. It is up to us to encourage people to consider taking part in this industry because it is a very strong economic driver for rural industries across Australia. So far, the National Harvest Trail Working Group has visited an area in South Australia from Adelaide to Mildura, and we have also visited Queensland. We are still to visit other areas across Australia to meet people engaged in harvest labour, to meet their employers and to discuss issues that are of concern to them. The people who have attended the meetings we have conducted include growers, Job Network members and pickers, as well as mayors and people representing these communities. If you have got a massive harvest on the vine or on the tree ready to go and you cannot get harvest labour, it is an absolute economic disaster for these communities. We have run across places where thousands of acres and millions of dollars worth of crops have just gone straight back into the ground because of the incapacity of the grower at the time to access the labour needed to do the job. It really is a big issue. People engaged in the harvest industry represent a wide range of people. In fact, it has been exposed in recent times that illegal immigrants often resort to the harvest trail to find a way of keeping the wolf from the door. For them to get a start in this industry, someone is contributing to their superannuation. They do not walk out there and say, 'I am an illegal immigrant; give me a job.' They tum up and there are processes to be gone through whereby Thursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 8705 often there will be a false tax file number or a false name stated. There can be all kinds of falsehoods as part of the process, but they wind up out there picking and earning money. At the same time the superannuation meter is starting to tick over. At the end of the day, assuming they go about their business, that money winds up in this great mass of money set aside that is regarded as lost or unclaimed. That is a case of an illegal immigrant generating money into the system under false pretences-I cannot think of any other way to describe it. It is not just illegal immigrants, of course-they play a very small part in this whole exercise. We also have unemployed Australians using the harvest industry as a backstop, and I really encourage them to do so. University students and even high school students use the harvest industry, as do an increasing number of backpackers--or we should refer to them more correctly as working holiday makers. There are even retirees, people who might have retired early, who want to--as they say on that radio program, Australia All Over-be out on the wallaby. They might pack up their caravans and decide to turn a little bit of money along the way. They are going to help pick cherries or go cotton chipping. In any case, the harvest trail working group has discovered that people out doing this, if they are effective-and they do not even need to have been in it for very long if they have a natural flair for the type of work that they are doing---can earn very good money. The other day, for example, we found people cutting Chinese cabbage and earning over $1,000 a week clear. That is pretty good money if you can do it. You can say that it is skilled work because it does involve a certain level of dexterity that not all of us have, but it is work that you can get into fairly readily, and we should encourage people to engage in that sort of work. Unfortunately, while there is that kind of money, the work is very sporadic; the coordination of opportunities in harvest industries is very minimal, and people can find themselves engaging in this harvest trail and operating hand to mouth. You can wind up with an underclass of people who drive around in unregistered cars, use false names and all kinds of false declarations, merely to maximise the cash in hand that they receive at the end of the day. They have got the dollars and they really do not live for tomorrow; they live for today. We need to be aware, when we are looking at legislation such as this, that there is a whole group of people generating income and superannuation under those circumstances. I have got to warn members, the parliamentary secretary, the minister and the others considering these issues, that there really is an explosion of work in harvest industries coming on-stream. From what I have seen in the weeks that I have been travelling around with the harvest trail working group, we have seen whole areas, hundreds of thousands of acres of wine producing grape vineslargest area was around Mildura. There are vast amounts of new young vines in that area, and people are going to be needed to harvest those crops. For example, Kingaroy is an area where in the past there has not been a tremendous amount of itinerant labour, but vast quantities of olives have been put in there and will need to be harvested. There is a mechanised process to harvest olives, but only once the trees have reached a certain level of maturity. In the years until that has occurred, those crops are going to have to be harvested by hand. We are going to have to meet the demand in these areas to ensure that we do not wind up with a disaster, with crops having to be ploughed into the ground. Imagine this kind of problem happening",159,Representatives Main Committee
233,Mr Slipper,We have seen it in South Burnett.,161,Representatives Main Committee
234,Mr Cameron Thompson,"We have seen them in the South Burnett. Probably the8706 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 in a country concerned about unemployment! We get this huge injustice: crops go bad because we cannot get labour at the time it is needed. We really must do something about this. As I said, there will be many opportunities. Immense problems and difficulties emerge from the various components engaged in this harvest labour. For example, there are working holiday-makers, colloquially known as backpackers, and there are locals who would like this kind of work. I mentioned the fellow who harvested cabbages, who made $1,000 a week. Anyone would like that kind of income if it could be regular and, of course, locals in these communities would like to see themselves in that position. There are difficulties that arise for people on the dole if they just leap into this sort of industry. In particular, people might find that they are not necessarily suited to be gun pickers, not because of any lack of enthusiasm but because they do not have that level of dexterity. The fact that they are human and have turned up for work may not be enough: some people fall into it naturally; other people do not. We have to ensure that we have answers to the current difficulties that face locals who want to get into this kind of industry. For example, if you are on the dole and take up one of these temporary jobs but you find you are unsuitable, that you are really having trouble just physically doing the work, or something like that, it can mean that, if you quit, you have to go through a period of waiting for your unemployment benefits to be re-established. Of course, that is a disincentive to people. Another more psychological disincentive is the fact that the majority of young people are educated to year 12 level. A consequence of that education is that people do not think they are really suited to manual labour and they aspire to go beyond that. This is a bit of a worry when we are going to be relying so much on these manual workers in the future to generate this kind of economic activity, when there are opportunities to make a good living out there. Those are problems that face the locals. Backpackers, working holiday-makers as they are more properly known, need the money. They do not have the safety net of unemployment benefits and they get directly involved in this activity because if they do not, they are going to be feeling very hungry. Their demand and drive for this work has resulted in whole chains of backpacker hostels and caravan parks that not only provide accommodation but also provide work. They are providing fleets of buses to take these people out to the farms. If you are a working holiday-maker, you can travel right around Australia: you can get carried out to farms; you can get provided with accommodation. It is a very good holiday opportunity for them. Unfortunately, this process leaves locals a little bit wrong-footed. The locals are often not aware that the bus services are available, and the backpackers certainly are not pitching their bus capabilities to them. I raise all those points, and you can say that they are not directly involved with this bill. But I say that they are, because those problems do mean that, through the bureaucratic processes, we have a lack of incentive for people to take up harvest work. The impact of superannuation requirements on this industry means that there is a lot of bureaucratic paperwork. If you are a grower and you are employing people for this kind of activity, particularly if they tum up for a day and then disappear and then another bloke turns up for a day and a woman turns up for a day, you can imagine the number of superannuation contributions, with minuscule amounts, that you are generating. Imagine all that, and then that half the people who tum up might be giving you a false name or a false tax file number. They might have their tax file number but they might change a digit in it because, frankly, they Thursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 8707 might want to operate outside the system-and there are a lot of people who are doing that. Also on your books you have got dozens of different superannuation funds. So there is massive bureaucratic paperwork that applies. These bills are a good start because they are starting to reduce that level of bureaucratic paperwork, but they still focus on mainstream employment in Australia. We are talking here about the average worker-that is the level at which these bills and our superannuation industry, as it stands, are focused. We should be going beyond that. We need superannuation that is flexible enough to accommodate all needs-and that includes the needs of the fruitpickers, the cotton chippers and all those sorts of people. When I say fruit picking is good, it can be backbreaking work. So if superannuation is to provide for you in retirement, people who engage in that industry deserve extra consideration because they are prepared to get out there in the hot sun, they are prepared to pick in the rain, they are prepared to put up with all the field conditions such as lack of toilets and all kinds of difficulties that a lot of other workers would probably turn up their noses at. Picking is a good backstop. It is something that provides a way of life. As I say, there is an opportunity even for retirees to get out into that industry, to take their caravans and discover Australia in a way that is different. Many of these people are very strong and healthy and have the desire to do it; they have the work ethic; they have the interest. So it would be good to see that some of these bureaucratic impediments could be reduced. It would be good to see the government look very closely at the findings of the National Harvest Trail Working Group not merely from the angles of where we find the labour, whether we encourage more working holiday-makers, whether we encourage more locals, and how we encourage more locals but from the angle of what the heck are we going to do about the superannuation issue. There are others issues that apply in this area too--things like workers compensation-that can be extremely hard to administer when you have got a work force that changes like the tide. It is not really fair to the growers and to the people engaged in this industry to drop on their head the level of paperwork that we currently are. We have got to find ways to administer these things that are fair to the employees but that encourage people to engage in it, because if we can do that we will really boost the productivity of this country. There are many areas in the country that really are suffering because we are not getting the maximum benefit out of itinerant labour. I commend the Minister for Employment Services for looking into these issues. I commend the member for Hindmarsh, who is the chair of the working group, and the other members of the group for the effort that they are putting in. I look forward to the outcome of that particular study. I urge the minister and everybody else engaged in the process of providing good superannuation and good access to superannuation in Australia to have a look at the needs of itinerant workers and take them very closely into account, and to ensure that in the future we have a superannuation system that is more flexible and more appropriate to the needs of Australians from all walks of life. on the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Bill 1999 and the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Consequential and Transitional Bill 1999. In recent years the extension of compulsory superannuation to all in the work force has been progressive and has been done very largely on a bipartisan basis. The concept and principle",161,Representatives Main Committee
235,Mrs Deanne Kelly (Dawson) (10.34 A.m.},"I wish to participate in this cognate debate8708 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 of retirement now being funded jointly by the worker's employer or employers and by the worker is universally accepted. Superannuation has provided the nation with a vast and ever growing investment fund. It is progressively providing a far higher standard of retirement living for hundreds of thousands of people, and it is saving the taxpayer many millions, and ultimately billions of dollars, in old age pensions. Superannuation is a relatively new form of savings and benefit and, as such, the legislation governing it requires close and ongoing attention to ensure it functions smoothly and provides the intended benefits. This legislation is the result of that attention and finetuning. Increasingly, the work force is becoming more and more mobile. Certainly, in my electorate of Dawson, there is a large, seasonal, itinerant work force in the horticulture, sugar and tourism industries. All workers, even casual and itinerant ones with broken and irregular work patterns, pay superannuation, as do their employers. During the tomato picking season in Bowen, hundreds of pickers come into Bowen, as they do into Ayr and Home Hill to pick fruit and vegetables. On the islands there are some thousands of workers. Some stay for a matter of three to six months; some stay longer. But certainly in the areas of horticulture, sugar and tourism, there is a large group of employees who simply, I guess, migrate. Perhaps they start fruit picking down in Victoria and migrate up the Queensland coast, and then they go back down to Victoria for the season as it starts again. Often these workers become so-called 'lost members' in the sense that they have lost the paperwork associated with their account, were never given the paperwork because they terminated employment before their superannuation guarantee contributions were made, or lost contact with their fund in other circumstances. At present, unclaimed money in superannuation funds must be paid by the trustees to the Australian Taxation Office, or to the state and territory unclaimed money agencies where state and territory laws require trustees to do so. While accurate statistics are not readily available due to the complexity and multiplicity of agencies involved, the ATO estimates that as at May 1999 there were approximately 2.5 million lost members and $2 billion of unclaimed money. In anyone's estimation, that is not an insignificant amount. While we accept that a person may be a member of more than one fund and, therefore, possibly count as more than one lost member, I think we would all agree that these are quite significant numbers of people who ultimately will not receive the benefit of their superannuation. It is a great sum of money that is unclaimed. Plainly, the onus is on legislators to devise a better way of ensuring this money and the lawful owners are connected by the existing legislation. Current roadblocks in existing legislation include the restriction on the use of tax file numbers; the taxation provisions applying to superannuation payments not applying to superannuation payments from state and territory unclaimed money registers; the inability to publish the names of lost members who have unclaimed money, as opposed to those who have lost bank accounts; no sharing of information between Commonwealth, state and territory registers; the exemption of public sector superannuation schemes from the existing arrangements; and a weak definition of unclaimed money which, for example, excludes cases where a member has received a cheque but has not cashed or banked it. Thursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 8709 Demonstrably, there need to be changes. This bill formally transfers the administration of the unclaimed money register to the Commissioner of Taxation and overcomes those other identified deficiencies. The improved process which will be provided under this bill follows extensive cooperation work between the ATO, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and state and territory agencies since 1997. It has been an outstanding example of federal, state and territory cooperation for the benefit of a disadvantaged group who are more likely to be low paid, or often infrequently paid, or occasionally paid. I have to say, coming from an electorate where there is a huge number of seasonal employees, that while employers understand the difficult and transient nature of their employees' lifestyle they rightfully begrudge the fact that the superannuation moneys that are paid are never going to be received by the employees. Despite that, they are paid out by the employer. This is going to bring reassurance, I think, and confidence in the superannuation system both to employers in my electorate and also to those deserving and rightful owners of the superannuation moneys, the seasonal workers. I am very pleased that the minister has taken note of such a group, who have been very vulnerable because of their lifestyle and their work patterns, and of employers in my electorate who rightly would like to see a just and fair superannuation system. I commend the bill and I am very pleased today to be able to support it. Administration) (10.40 a.m.)-in reply-Thank you very much for the opportunity to sum up. At the outset, I would like to thank the members for Wills, Blair and Dawson for their contributions. The coalition is committed to improving the living standards of older Australians through an effective retirement incomes policy. The coalition is also determined to give all Australians greater choice in superannuation and we are committed to expanding opportunities for Australians to contribute to superannuation. The coalition will encourage Australians to save for the future and enjoy higher living standards in retirement. Superannuation contributions and assets have grown very strongly under the coalition government. The bills before the chamber establish a scheme for ensuring that superannuation members who have lost contact with their funds have a comprehensive register to check where their superannuation is held. The bills will overcome deficiencies in existing provisions relating to unclaimed money and lost members. It will particularly benefit employees who have changed jobs regularly, who have moved interstate or overseas and who have multiple superannuation accounts. It is interesting that the bill enjoys the support of both sides of the chamber and indeed, the member for Wills conceded the benefits and welcomed the positive initiative in this particular bill. The member for Wills did, however, traverse matters beyond the technical terms of this bill and used the broad title of the bill to be able to talk about other matters in relation to superannuation. In particular he referred to allegations that the Australian Taxation Office is not following up every superannuation guarantee complaint. As the member for Wills himself conceded, he has been briefed by the Australian Taxation Office on the new superannuation guarantee compliance strategy. The tax office has a more targeted approach which makes best use of resources. When a complaint is received, the employer who is the subject of the complaint is indeed followed up by the Burnie call centre. So the government and the tax",163,Representatives Main Committee
236,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and8710 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 office are absolutely resolute in ensuring that when complaints are made those complaints are fully investigated with a view to achieving an appropriate outcome. The member for Wills also referred to certain privacy considerations and he pointed out that he has indeed been largely convinced that the privacy problems that he thought were there are in fact not there. On behalf of the government, I just want to assure the chamber that there has been extensive consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, and the Privacy Commissioner has in fact cleared these bills. The Privacy Commissioner will want to be consulted on regulations, and it is the government's intention to do so. In fact, the Privacy Commissioner has written confirming that there are no privacy concerns in relation to the bills currently before the chamber. The honourable member for Blair, my good friend who now represents many parts of southeast Queensland previously in the electorate of Fisher and to whom the whole nation owes a debt because he won the seat of Blair under very difficult and trying circumstances, referred to the National Harvest Trail Working Group and to some of the problems which occur with respect to harvesting and itinerant workers. It is government policy for low income earners to be able to opt out of the superannuation guarantee; that is, if they are paid between $450 and $900 a month. It is our intention to reduce paperwork and it is our intention to ensure that we do not have lots of small amounts of superannuation contributions in a multiplicity of funds which essentially are beyond the reach, control and benefit of the particular employees. People have asked how much unclaimed superannuation money there is, and it would surprise many to know that there is $18 million in unclaimed superannuation money held across Commonwealth, state and territory unclaimed money authorities. There is approximately $3 billion held by superannuation funds and retirement savings providers for lost members who have not yet reached retirement money age. The bills address deficiencies in the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993, in particular for the purpose of reducing the $3 billion figure for lost members before the amounts become unclaimed money and are required to be paid to Commonwealth, state or territory authorities. The bills will also establish a central register, to be administered by the Commissioner for Taxation, to hold information of unclaimed superannuation money in Commonwealth, state and territory unclaimed superannuation money registers. People will be able to apply to the central register for the purpose of ascertaining whether they have any superannuation money held by a registrar in Australia. It is very interesting, and ought to be noted, that the total amount of superannuation money in the superannuation system in Australia is currently some $400 billion. These bills enjoy the support of both sides of the parliament. They are very positive initiatives. They are initiatives of which we are very proud and I commend them to the chamber.

We accept the reasons for the increased appropriation and regard it as essentially a housekeeping item. I cannot, however, resist the opportunity that the bill presents to draw attention to the hypocrisy displayed by the government speakers on the last occasion we debated an amendment to the same legislation. That was in May 1996, shortly after the change of government. At the time, the amount appropriated for ministerial salaries was increased from $1.615 million to $1.64 million. The then Minister for Administrative Services, the late lamented Mr Jull, pointed out that this increase was required to meet increases in salaries for ministers granted under the previous Labor government. The Howard government, on the other hand, was going to reduce both the size of the ministry and the sum required in future years. This would go down to $1.6 million as from the 1996-97 financial year. But what happened? John Howard was no sooner re-elected for a second tenn last year when he increased the size of the ministry to 30 and increased the size of cabinet to 17. He is now increasing the appropriation for the salaries. Is it any wonder that we greeted his promises of frugality, probity and higher standards of conduct in government with a certain degree of scepticism? Our scepticism, unfortunately, has been validated absolutely. So, while we are prepared to assist in giving the bill passage, I suggest to the government speakers in this debate that they spare us any more of t-e hypocritical posturing that we have had to suffer so far.

Had the Labor Party remained in office, the amount which would have been spent on ministerial salaries would have been $1.78 million per year. This government is firmly committed to restraint in government spending. The sum of $1.622 million is less than that set for 1995-96, which was $1.64 million, which was to cater for salary increases during the last year of the previous Labor government. This government is very careful to ensure that we are very sensible about government spending, whereas the previous government adopted a spend, spend, spend mentality. The previous government passed on to us a $10.3 billion deficit. We have had to make some very sensible and difficult decisions to make sure that the country could be frrewalled against the crisis which occurred in South-East Asia with respect to the economies in that region. This bill arises from a constitutional provision, section 66, that the total salaries of ministers of state be provided by the parliament. It is a simple machinery measure and the increase which is covered by this legislation is a modest figure of $22,000. The bill is straightforward and what we are seeking to do is appropriate.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 23 June, on motion by Miss Jackie Kelly: That the bill be now read a second time. behind the Australian Tourist Commission Amendment Bill 1999 which is before the chamber. It seeks to amend the Australian Tourist Commission's third statutory objective, which currently states: (c) to ensure that Australia is protected from adverse environmental and social impacts of international tourism. While that objective is more than admirable, it is quite clear that the Tourist Commission does not have the legislative empowerment to meet that objective. The bill before the committee seeks to replace the current words in part 2, section 6, with the following words: (c) in meeting those objects, to work with other agencies (as appropriate) and to have regard to the principles of ecologically sustainable development set out in subsection 21(3) of the Natural Heritage Trust Act 1997 and the social impacts of international tourism in Australia. I foreshadow, for the benefit of the chamber, my intention to move an amendment at the consideration in detail stage simply to correct what I think is a drafting error. Members will note that the word 'Australia' is not used in the description of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Act. I foreshadow my intention to correct that drafting error at the consideration in",167,Representatives Main Committee
239,Mr Fitzgm80n (Hunter) (10.52 A.m.),"The opposition supports the general principlesThursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMI1TEE 8713 detail stage. I expect to have the government's support, unless I am advised that my assessment of that error is incorrect. The original objective which we are dealing with today came about as a result of an amendment moved by the Australian Democrats back in 1987. At that time, I suppose, it was an attempt to appease the environmental movement with respect to their concerns that tourism development must always involve a responsible assessment of the potential environmental results. While I do not doubt that the ATC is committed to assessing the environmental and social impacts of these developments, it has been concerned for some time that it simply does not have the legislative empowerment to meet that objective. The matter came to a head late in 1987, when the ANAO conducted an audit into the commission and found that it was not meeting its objective as set out in paragraph 6(c). Subsequently, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit recommended that the Australian Tourist Commission should propose to its minister that this statutory object should be amended to clarify the commission's role. So the amendment is worthy of the opposition's support, and I am pleased to recommit the opposition to a bipartisan approach to tourism matters wherever that is possible. I never miss the opportunity to remind the House that we do not have that bipartisan approach to the GST. It is quite clear that the tourism sector is basically a services sector and, of course, services in this country have been hitherto untaxed. We maintain our view that the goods and services tax would have a negative impact on the industry and will cost the industry jobs. It would impact, in particular, on wine tourism-and that I have raised in the House on a number of occasions previously. There is no doubt that the combined effect of the GST and the government's proposed wine equalisation tax will hurt that very important growth industry-one that serves regional Australia, in particular, very well. It is quite clear on the calculations that the combined effect of the GST and the wine equalisation tax will reap an additional $147 million annually from the industry. To put it another way, it will result in an increase in wine of around eight per cent-to use the Treasurer's own calculations. There can be no doubt at all that that is going to have a devastating impact on the wine tourism sector. These are very important issues. The importance of tourism to the Australian economy can never be underestimated or understated. Yet tourism, unfortunately, seems to get nowhere near the recognition and the attention of government that it deserves. I think it is fair to say that if you walked down the street in any CBD in this country and surveyed people and asked them what they believed to be Australia's largest export earner, they would nominate one of our mineral exports, such as coal or iron ore, or probably one of our agricultural products. Whereas, of course, tourism, earning around $16.5 billion in foreign exchange, is our largest export industry, and it is the Australian Tourist Commission's job to ensure that that very strong growth continues. Certainly we have had strong growth. Since 1985, international visitor numbers to Australia have more than doubled. Over the past year, spending by tourists has provided employment for over one million Australians and has contributed almost $60 billion to Australia's gross domestic product. Once upon a time, tourism was not even counted as an economic sector. Now it has become the world's largest export, ranked ahead of petrol, motor vehicles and, indeed, electronic equipment. In 1993 there were half a billion tourists worldwide, and international tourism receipts reached $US304 billion. In 1993, Australia ranked 12th in the world in absolute numbers of international tourist arrivals, having been ranked only 19th in 1985. Between 1998 and 2007, international visitor 8714 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 arrivals are expected to increase at an average annual rate of 5.9 per cent, reaching 7.7 million, hopefully, in the year 2007. Of course, the excitement of all this has now been enhanced by our anticipation of the Olympics to be held in Sydney in the year 2000. As I said, the Australian Tourist Commission does playa central role in all of this. I would like to put on record my support of John Morse, Don Morris and their team. They are doing an excellent job. SinceI entered this portfolio only some 10 months ago, they have taken every opportunity to brief me on the issues I need to be across and have been very cooperative with the opposition generally. I know that they enjoy the support of the government, as well. I recently had the very good fortune of attending a tourist expo in Darling Harbour organised by John Morse and his team. It really was a privilege to be there to see Australia's tourism industry and parts of it on show to the rest of the world. Australia's growing ecotourism industry was on show. Its appeal now is very strong, and consistent data is now available for all nature based activities. Aboriginal tourism, of course, is a high growth industry and it is another project John Morse at the commission has been very supportive of and is driving very strongly. At the outset, I indicated that the opposition will, at every opportunity wherever possible, take a bipartisan approach to tourism matters and I qualified that with my statements on the GST. I have already indicated that I will be moving a minor amendment in the committee stage. I indicate to the Main Committee that there is some concern among those who are strong advocates for the environment that the wording we are adopting today might be too light. I suppose they would say, 'It lets the Australia Tourist Commission off too lightly' in terms of how much it should have regard to the environmental and social impacts of tourism. While I do not intend to move any amendment to the second reading motion--certainly, I would not do that in this place; it is a chamber for a bipartisan approach-I foreshadow that, when this bill arrives in the Senate, it is possible that the opposition might be seeking a subtle word change to part C of the Tourist Commission's statutory objectives. I admit that I have not come to any conclusion on the words to be used. There is a view that the words 'to have regard to', in the paragraph 'in meeting those objects, to work with other agencies (as appropriate) and to have regard to the principles of ecologically sustainable development' might be a bit too soft, too light and unclear. I do not have a fixed view on the matter. I am happy to talk to the government, the Democrats and the Greens. Possibly there could be a very subtle word change--for instance, 'to work with other agencies to uphold the principles of ecologically sustainable development set out in subsection 21 (3).' I certainly do not want to see any debate over this issue in the Senate. I do not think that is healthy for the industry. I do not think the word change is of sufficient importance to trigger a debate on what should really be a bipartisan approach to this issue. What we want to do is to ensure that the Tourist Commission can meet its objectives and get on with doing what it does best, and that is growing international tourism in Australia. I foreshadow that for the benefit of the Main Committee. I repeat that I would be happy to talk to the government on that issue. I close by reminding the Main Committee that I intend in the committee stage to move an amendment which has been circulated in my name which simply inserts the word 'Australia' in the bill, because I believe that in the description of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Act the word 'Australia' has been omitted. I assume that is only a drafting error, but I would be happy to hear from the government if there is another view. Thursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 8715 Amendment Bill 1999. It is a logical step in recognising an aspect of the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 which requires the commission 'to ensure that Australia is protected from adverse environmental and social impacts of international tourism' by substituting the words: in meeting those objects, to work with other agencies (as appropriate) and to have regard to the principles of ecologically sustainable development set out in subsection 21(3) of the Natural Heritage Trust Act 1997 and the social impacts of international tourism in Australia. This seems entirely appropriate, as you, Madam Deputy Speaker Gash, in terms of your role in tourism, would know the outstanding work that is carried out by the Australian Tourist Commission. It is inappropriate to saddle them, as an agency, with the full responsibility to ensure that Australia is protected from adverse environmental impacts of tourism. While they should have due regard to it, they are not the principal agency. Their job is to promote Australia offshore, and they have certainly done an excellent job in that. In terms of the protection aspect of the environment, other agencies are more equipped, having specialised personnel who are able to provide expert advice on sensitive areas around Australia that can maintain only a limited amount of tourism. So to say to them, who are specifically geared up with marketing, advertising and promotional skills, 'You'll also be environmental experts; you'll also be ecotourism experts,' I think is a little unfair. By all means there should be a group within the ATC with a brief to look at the environmental aspects, but that should not be their principal concern. When you have other departments and other agencies that have people with their own background training, university training and postgraduate training in these areas, it is appropriate to use them to have interface with the Australian Tourist Commission and to chart a course which is in Australia's long-term interest. I am sure that there are many members, some of whom are in the chamber today, who have a strong interest in tourism. We want to see it grow and develop within Australia, but we do not want tourism at any price. You have only to go to Spain to see tourism which in many ways pays little regard to the impact on the environment. Some of the developments there, that I have personally seen, are just appalling in terms of environmental impact. I think that developments such as some of those in the States, which have a direct impact on the environment, are not the types of developments we would want to see here, especially in those sensitive areas-wetland areas and others-where the numbers of people who can enter the areas must be limited. To do that on a scientific basis is important. In my previous role at Tourism Council Australia, I was part of the environment group which was made up of experts including ecotourism experts and people from the department of tourism. It was chaired by a fellow with a particularly good name, Dr Doug Baird, who is the adviser to Quicksilver in the Great Barrier Reef on the impact on the environment of tourists visiting the reef and the protection that needs to be in place to ensure that the reef is protected adequately. In that committee, we considered various aspects of the guidelines that should be established, and a number of reports were produced during that time. Expert as that committee might be, I still believe that the agenda for most people in the tourism industry is to get people into the country. They are happy to live within the guidelines, realising that it is in Australia's long term tourism interest to provide those guidelines and preserve those sensitive areas for the long-term future. It is inappropriate that the peak tourism body-the Australian Tourism",168,Representatives Main Committee
240,Mr Baird (Cook) (11.03 A.m.},"I rise in support of the Australian Tourist Commission8716 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 Commission-should have that as a prime responsibility, so I am glad to see the bipartisan approach. I should in passing comment on the GST, in which I have had a passing interest. I think that it is important to emphasise that the attitude of the tourism industry has been considerably modified on the basis that the bed tax in New South Wales will be withdrawn as a result of the GST. As 67 per cent of all international visitors come to Sydney, it does have an impact. It has meant that tourists have spent longer in Queensland than in Sydney as a result of it. If you speak to any of the hoteliers there, they will say that it has had a direct impact on them. The removal of the bed tax has certainly modified the approach, and it also has meant that no bed tax can be imposed anywhere else in Australia. So the taking away of that threat was significant in seeing a different approach from the tourism industry. And, of course, a number of the major players in the tourism industry recognised that they would experience a lesser cost factor with wholesale sales taxes taken off. So it is a mixed view within the industry. It may have been the case before the final package was brought down that there was only one clear view within the industry, but I do not believe that it is the case that there is a consistent view within the tourism industry now, especially given the removal of the bed tax, which has meant that it is a great attraction for the industry. I say that in passing, as it was raised by the shadow minister. But it is a bipartisan day, and I join with him in congratulating John Morse and the great team at the Australian Tourist Commission. The Australian Tourist Commission is one of the most highly regarded government funded tourism promotion bodies around the world It is generously supported, as it has been, by both sides of the House. This has meant that we have led the way-as you, Madam Deputy Speaker Gash, would know-especially with the Australian Tourist Exchange, which is a great first around the world. It brings people from around the world to see the Australian product. What has been the result? The result has been outstanding. The fact that a country of this size has had 4.3 million international visitors over the past four months is very impressive. There has been a six per cent increase on the figures year-to-year date for the past 12 months. The preliminary June figures indicate that 120,000 more international visitors visited Australia in the first six months of 1999. A 13 per cent increase in visitor arrivals from South-East Asia was recorded for the first six months of 1999--a 48 per cent increase in visitor arrivals from Thailand and a 30 per cent increase from Malaysia. Some of the traditional markets were up significantly. The UK was up by seven per cent and the USA was up by 10 per cent. These are high-yield markets, so that is particularly encouraging. On the other side, we.have seen a drop in the number of Japanese visitors. There have been 25,000 fewer Japanese tourists so far this year, equivalent to $106 million in lost revenue. I think that highlights why the Australian Tourist Commission should not be saddled with the additional responsibility of concern for the environment-important as it is, as highlighted yesterday in the preamble to the Constitution outlined by the Prime Minister-but should be allowed to focus on issues such as the drop in the number of Japanese tourists coming here. Japan is our largest source of international tourists, and the number of visitors coming here continues to drop. That is a concern. I notice now that, where they were overwhelmingly No. 1, they are actually equal figures so far this year with New Zealand It is great to see the Kiwis coming over. We need another Bledisloe Cup-as we are about to have-to again boost the figures. I was interested in the figures that showed that more New Zealand men left New Thursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 8717 Zealand to see the Bledisloe Cup when it was held in Melbourne than left New Zealand in World War II. It is good to see the numbers from New Zealand up, but we also need considerable emphasis in the future on Japan. We congratulate the minister on bringing this amendment forward. It is not an earthshattering amendment, but it is important that we make these changes so that concentration is on the main game. The Australian Tourist Commission continues to do an excellent job under the leadership of John Morse, and long may it continue to have the lead around the world in international tourism. I know that my colleagues in the chamber today are strong supporters of the tourism industry, and this is just a small step in continuing our dominance. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin) (11.13 a.m.}--Of all the isms that will be of influence in Australia in the next few years, tourism and environmentalism will have a high level of significance, particularly in the lead-up to the Olympic Games and beyond. Tourism is one of Australia's fastest growing industries. It is expected to contribute to significant increases in employment opportunities in the period leading up to the year 2003. It currently generates over $16 billion in export earnings, a figure which is forecast to increase to $23.2 billion by the year 2000---the year of the Olympic Games. Our share of world tourism is relatively small, but Australia is one of the fastest growing tourist destinations in the world. Visitor numbers have increased by 11 or 12 per cent annually for the last three years. It is worth noting that in 1998 alone there were an estimated 3.859 million international visitors aged 15 years and over, and international visitor expenditure was estimated at $8.5 billion in Australia in 1998. The domestic market is still our strong point in tourism. Of the 694,000 people employed directly in tourism in 1996, over 522,000 were employed in the domestic sector. That leaves over 170,000 people employed directly in the international visitor sector. Australia welcomes the rapid growth of inbound tourism. In fact, the Australian Tourist Commission, the statutory authority which is charged with the prime task of promoting Australia overseas as an international tourist destination, has as its principal objectives: first, to increase the number of visitors to Australia from overseas; second, to maximise the benefits to Australia from overseas visitors; and, third, to ensure that Australia is protected from adverse environmental and social impacts of international tourism. It is with regard to the last objective that we are conscious that there is a price to pay for increased numbers in tourism in terms of the potential impact on our environment, as well as any adverse social impacts. The inclusion of this objective in the Australian Tourist Commission Act is consistent with the broad policy goal of ecologically sustainable development. This goal aims to balance economic, environmental and social considerations in decision making in the long-term interest of our whole society. The concept of 'ecologically sustainable development' was brought to the fore following growing concern throughout the seventies and eighties about the current and future environmental impact of economic growth and development. It is an international concept. A commonly used definition of sustainable development emerged in 1987 when the World Commission on Environment and Development, known as the Brundtland Commission, articulated that sustainable development is 'development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'. Internationally, policies addressing sustainability in this way have become widespread. The World Bank recently found that over 100 countries had national strategies for sustainable development in place. 8718 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 In Australia, governments have adopted the tenn 'ecologically sustainable development' to address these considerations. The major relevant policy initiative in Australia is the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development. ESD, as it is called, is often only equated with the environment, but the national strategy recognises that it is about short-tenn and longtenn economic, social and environmental impacts. That is a far broader policy agenda. So it is with the ESD, the national policy, in mind that we look at the Australian Tourist Commission Act and the inclusion of its objectives-the third objective particularly-to ensure Australia is protected from adverse environmental and social impacts from international tourism. The amendment proposed by this bill has come about because of the Australian National Audit Office's audit of the commission in 1997 which concluded, amongst other things, that the commission 'is currently unable to demonstrate that it is fully meeting all of its statutory objectives'. It went on to say that this applied particularly to the third objective. The Audit Office acknowledged that the commission had no regulatory powers or authority to ensure the protection of the environment and of society from the impact of tourism, but pointed out that there was a statutory responsibility which it could perfonn and that that would be to closely monitor and report the effects of international tourism on Australia's natural environment and society. I think it is fair to say that what the Audit Office was concerned with was the fact that the Australian Tourist Commission had not fully addressed in its corporate operational or business plans what was meant by the third objective. Like a number of government agencies, it had a separate environmental strategy which articulated its environmental vision, but the Audit Office thought that this vision did not contribute to a common, measurable understanding of what was meant by the objectives and how they were to be translated into a framework of strategies and plans. The Audit Office noted that the environment strategy contained reference to some key perfonnance indicators but, otherwise, the commission's corporate plan or its annual operational plan had no indicators identified to measure the commission's perfonnance in relation to that third objective. Again, it is fair to say that in this regard the Australian Tourist Commission has not been alone. Evidence suggests that the extent to which departments and agencies have fully implemented programs and policies with an explicit ESD focus, as well as the extent to which ESD principles and objectives have been considered and applied in general policy development, varies to some extent across Commonwealth departments and agencies. Perhaps it is a case that the ESD policy is still rhetoric rather than practice in some areas. But, in general, a number of impediments or constraints can influence the rate of implementation of ESD policies by departments and agencies and can include, as the Tourist Commission found, a lack of clarity or understanding as to what constitutes ecologically sustainable development related policies. There are complex issues associated with the implementation of ESD, the infonnation and data requirements and trying to adopt good policy making practices, and there are some deficiencies in intraand intergovernmental coordination in policy making. We need greater attention to longer tenn sustainable development issues. The amendment we are considering in this legislation takes away the requirement that the commission ensure that Australia is protected from adverse environmental and social impacts of international tourism, but then replaces that requirement with one that will ensure that the Thursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 8719 commission maintains its involvement in the social and environmental issues, but at a level appropriate to its powers. In other words, in meeting its objectives it will now be required to work with other agencies as appropriate and to have regard to the principles for ecologically sustainable development, as set out in the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Act, and the social impacts of international tourism in Australia. In effect, the proposed amendment allows the commission to meet its statutory objectives without removing its social and environmental responsibilities. When the Auditor-General's report for 1997-98, including Audit Report No. 10 on the Tourist Commission, was reviewed by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, it was apparent that the Tourist Commission had already taken action to address a number of the issues raised by the Audit Office. In particular, it had already prepared operational definitions of its statutory objectives, their related corporate objectives, and key performance indicators. This was said to demonstrate quite clearly the relationship between the corporate objectives, the commission's strategic plan and the objectives as defined in the act. The commission was keen to point out to the joint committee that the commission was already focused on environmental concerns and, in fact, believed that the natural environment is one of Australia's greatest assets, if not the greatest asset in terms of tourism. It is apparent that the Australian environment generally is one of the key reasons why Australia is chosen as a tourist destination. The commission also pointed out that a number of specific initiatives had been undertaken to help it achieve its third statutory objective relating to the protection of Australia from adverse environmental and social impacts. These included a study into the social attitudes of the environmental impact of tourism; in conjunction with the Office of National Tourism, developing environmental messages published in agency literature and on airlines flying into Australia; and developing partnerships with other organisations in undertaking environmental best practice. They also produced an annual portfolio of ecotourism and were developing an even broader environmental strategy. It was a recommendation of the joint committee that the Australian Tourist Commission enter into an extensive dialogue with relevant authorities in order to develop a cohesive strategy to ensure that Australia is protected from potential adverse environmental and social impacts of overseas tourism. Of course, it was the joint committee that recommended that the act be amended to clarify the commission's role in relation to its objectives. The joint committee has highlighted a more widespread problem with implementing ESD policy, and that is a necessity for intraand intergovernmental coordination. It could be argued that there is not currently a sufficiently effective Commonwealth-state coordinating mechanism for ESD. Of course, such coordination is not costless, but the benefits of enhanced coordination are likely to outweigh the costs, and a failure in such coordination or in the level of coordination in that regard could create more problems subsequently"" In Australia, natural resource management and environment protection responsibilities are shared between the states and the Commonwealth. This in some instances can contribute to vertical coordination failure. A whole of government approach is needed to overcome intervention failures in implementing ESD--due to perhaps a failure of government coordination. This government is keen to ensure that Commonwealth departments and agencies show leadership in the processes by which the economic, social and environmental goals are integrated. I am sure we will see the Australian Tourist Commission taking the lead in. this regard. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. 8720 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 the honourable member for Curtin and, before her, the honourable member for Cook on what is really a very minor amendment to the Australian Tourist Commission Amendment Bill 1999. I have no objection to the bill and I think it is an eminently sensible amendment to make. But I think it is quite significant that we are debating these particular amendments and putting the correct focus on the environmental watch of the Australian Tourist Commission on the days when the news wires are running hot with developments that have happened in Thailand. There have been a number of accusations about the tourist industry in Thailand. The present government of Thailand, for which I have quite a deal of regard and which is taking the tourist industry very seriously, all of a sudden has woken up to the fact that it has some huge environmental problems. I suppose two of the greatest destinations that Thailand offers, Pattaya Beach and Phuket, are prime examples of what happens when you do not keep an eye on things. Phuket, for example, is a relative newcomer to the international tourist market and handles-I think I am correct in saying-something like 8Y2 million international tourists a year. There has been unbridled development in a number of sections of that particular island and all of a sudden the results of it are coming home to roost, in that the coral reefs, which were such an attraction 10 years ago, are starting to fall to pieces. The development that has happened along the beachfront has been an ecological disaster, and the new Thai government is now trying to do something about that. In Pattaya, which is an older development and which handles unbelievable numbers of international tourists and always has, the infrastructure of the place virtually collapsed. It has cost millions upon millions of dollars for them to get some semblance of environmental protection in what is left of Pattaya. I guess that, while the Thais have probably done very well in terms of their international earnings and the employment generated in those two resorts, it is a very good example, I think, to Australia of what happens if you do not keep an eye on things. Obviously the Australian Tourist Commission has got an obligation to do that as part of these amendments. I thought one of the more interesting parts of the bill that was circulated to us was the explanatory memorandum which specifically spelt out the fact that, to a very great extent, the prime purpose of the Australian Tourist Commission was the promotion of international visitation to Australia. Of course it is. In that respect, can I say that I also have a very high regard for the work that they do. It is quite significant because we are really in the 20th year of the development of phase 2 of Australian tourism. The Australian Tourist Commission in various guises has been in existence since about 1927, but it was 20 years ago under the leadership of the then minister, the late Phillip Lynch, that Australia started to become quite serious about the tourism business. I believe, from my recollection, that in 1979 there was a major increase of allocations to the Australian Tourist Commission by the government and I think they were granted something like $8Y2 million for international promotion. This was a major advance. Australia set about getting into the international tourism business-and I suppose, to a very great extent, the rest is history. I think we have done well, and that is not to say that we cannot do better, but if we think that we are a major player in the international scene obviously we are wrong. We still do not get one per cent of international tourism coming to this country. But we have done reasonably well and we have done reasonably well in those targeted markets. If there is a commendation",171,Representatives Main Committee
241,Mr Jull (Fadden) (11.25 A.m.),"May I commend the incisive nature of the speeches ofThursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 8721 for the Australian Tourist Commission, I think it has been for their capacity to be able to pick out these markets and to go and develop them. I think we have learned a few lessons along the way. Obviously we had a very close concentration on Asia and, while Japan was the initial market and we put a great deal of concentration on Japan as the market that we wanted to build-it certainly worked early in the piece--as the member for Cook said today, that is now flattening. We put a great deal of concentration on specific markets, such as Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and even Thailand. With the Asian economic downturn, those people in the industry who had not really spread their product into different areas found themselves in a great deal of trouble. There were great examples of that on the Gold Coast, where hoteliers who had concentrated on the Korean market all of a sudden found their properties were empty and they had a difficult time. I guess that this is all part of the learning process of what tourism is about, and I would commend the Australian Tourist Commission, especially in light of what happened with the Asian economic downturn, for what it did. It certainly had the flexibility and the capacity to switch its markets, to switch its emphasis, to go in pretty hard in Europe, to go in pretty hard in North America. Obviously, that has been paying off, and we are seeing evidence of that with the improvement in figures coming out of the UK and Europe and out of the North American market. It is absolutely mind-blowing to contemplate the size of that American market and the impact that you can have. The Australian Tourist Commission has been in there plugging away and, despite reasonably small budgets, it has made an impact to such an extent that, in all the major surveys out of North America now, Australia is the preferred destination, and the Condor Naste travel group, which has the biggest selling travel magazine in North America, once again this year names Australia as the No.1 destination. But the biggest problem that we have got in terms of promoting Australia and in terms of landing those international visitors here is, as it was 20 years ago, firstly, the distance from the major markets and, secondly, the cost of the air fares. I would like to spend just a couple of minutes on what is happening in terms of international civil aviation. In recent years, what we have seen is a coming together of airline alliances. There are now five around the world, two of which operate to a very great extent in Australia: the One World group, which includes Qantas and British Airways, and the Star Alliance, which has carriers like United Airlines, Air New Zealand and Lufthansa tied up together. What has happened, particularly in Europe, is something that we must be concerned about and must keep an eye on. There was a very good speech delivered in London in recent days by the President of Trans World Airlines, a United States carrier, a major carrier into Europe, but an airline that is not allied with anyone. He gave examples of what happens when you virtually create duopolies in markets and, to a great extent, I think that we have got a situation where, if we are not careful, we could redevelop these duopolies. Trans World Airlines has been forced out of the Rome market. They have been forced out of the French market, they have been forced out of the German market and they are looking very closely at their operations into London. But he also cited some examples of what happens to air fares when a duopoly gets on a particular route. What happens now is that the air fares out of some 55 ports in the United States to London are some hundreds of dollars more expensive than fares to fly from various ports in the United States into places like Paris, Frankfurt or Rome. It is the old two-airline agreement story that we suffered in Australia for 8722 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 so long: once you get a duopolistic situation on a route, you have got to be careful. We have not reached that yet in Australia, but it is something that should be monitored, along with the policy of the Australian air carriers. All of us, I think, have a very high regard for Qantas and all of us acknowledge that Qantas has made a contribution in terms of developing the international tourist market. Its alliance with British Airways obviously now is a very close one, in terms both of the One World arrangement and of the ownership. But what is happening with British Airways-and in recent press reports in Australia the same story is being raised-is that it is concerned with the back of the bus. Obviously, it has a bottom line to meet. British Airways now is completely restructuring its routes out of London, and physically restructuring its airline fleets and its airline configurations. It is going for the high yield market. That is fine; that is a matter of its commercial judgment. But, at the end of the day, the number of seats that will be specifically allocated to the tourist traffic is going to be lowered because there is not the money to be made from those cheaper fares. Interestingly, in North America, United Airlines is now doing exactly the same thing. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.34 a.m. to 12.08 p.m. being made by some of the world's major carriers which may directly affect the cost of air fares to and from Australia. I mentioned the situation of British Airways, with the redesign of its cabins and its pricing structures, along with how Qantas was looking at the same thing and also a similar situation in the United States with United Airlines. We should flag that and keep a watching brief, because in the case of Australia, which is a long haul destination and a fairly high cost destination, if we allow the air fare components to get out of control we can be in real trouble. In that respect, I was pleased to see that in recent days there was at least some loosening-up by the government on the international air rights agreements. We have not yet got to a stage where we have total freedom of access-that does not necessarily mean completely open skies, but we have not got total access-to all the major gateways in Australia. I hope we would move toward that. In light of that, while there has been some very heavy criticism of the government's decision to give Emirates Airlines almost unfettered rights into Australia, we have to be cognisant of what I was talking about before. The criticism that has been made is that Emirates are going to undercut traffic. They will be looking at freedom of traffic out of Australia to Europe and from Europe to Australia, and there will not be much out of the Gulf. That is yet to be proved. I have got no doubt that Emirates will be marketing very heavily in Europe and Australia to get that traffic to go through the long haul destinations. At the end of the day, there are a lot of advantages to be gained from opening up new markets like the Gulf countries. During my term with the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation, we sent a representative into the Gulf early in the 1980s to ply that particular market, because potentially it was one of the most lucrative in the world. When we talk about visitors from the Middle East, we are not necessarily talking about backpackers. In fact, some of the leading members of those communities are coming to the Gold Coast now. More will probably come as a result of these direct flights. They bring an entourage of wives and support staff and they have the capacity to book out whole floors of hotels-and it is all first class, big dollar stuff.",176,Representatives Main Commitiee
242,Mr Jull,"Prior to the suspension, I was talking about some of the recent developmentsThursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 8723 Before we start making general criticisms, we have to weigh up the situation. As I say, if we get carriers like Emirates and Royal Brunei and some which bring that low fare market, because of what is happening with the major carriers, I would be the last to criticise them. I have probably spoken longer than I should have and I have probably gone a bit wider than the bill, but it is not often that we have the opportunity to speak about the tourist industry. This is now one of our greatest export earners and our greatest employers. In fact, it is the biggest private sector employer. It is an industry that attracts a lot of international attention and it has a lot of investment by some major international concerns. At the end of the day, about 92 per cent of the tourist industry in Australia comes from mums and dads. It comes from small business. In terms of the contribution to the small business sector, we often undersell the contribution that tourism makes. My final point is that we are all very excited about what is happening with the Sydney Olympics. Potentially, that is going to be the greatest boost to Australian tourism. If the Australian Tourist Commission plays it right, if governments play it right in the future, the investment that we have made will keep us in good stead for decades to come. If you look at what has happened overseas, the reality is that you get that boost during the period of the Olympics and the period leading up to the Olympics and it is what you plough in afterwards that is really the return on your investment. If people go to Munich and take an organised tour, they will be amazed that the Olympic stadium is still the No.1 priority. The Games were in 1972 and the people are still cashing in on it. In Spain, they are still feeding off the Olympics. Quite frankly, I think we have probably got a lot more to offer than Spain. The populace and the industry have to realise the exposure we will get from organisations such as the NBC Network telecasting from all points around Australia for weeks on end. That is publicity you cannot buy. We have to make sure that we have got the infrastructure, commitment and money to cash in for years to come. We have to do that because the reality is, as much as we might talk about it, that one of the very few industries we have in Australia that has the capacity to provide really big numbers of jobs is the tourist industry. We should never forget those figures that came out of the Bureau of Industry Economics years ago, which indicated that we have the capacity to employ up to a million people in the tourism and hospitality industry without too much problem at all. There is nothing wrong with that because this is an exciting industry. It is an industry that is attractive, particularly to young people, and it does have the capacity to be able to provide those jobs, particularly in regional Australia. Fadden. I always enjoy listening to his overview of the tourism industry. He came to my electorate-it would be about five years ago now-and was a great hit; they loved him. It is always good to listen to what you have to say, David. I would like to address the Australian Tourist Commission Amendment Bill 1999 and the amendments first, and then talk about tourism generally and in the area that I represent-the Whitsundays. WitR regard to the bill, I think the minister has been very sound and has acted with common sense in bringing it before us. The Australian Tourist Commission was established by the Hawke Labor government in 1987. Undeniably, it was one of that government's few achievements and, sadly and predictably, the act was flawed. This bill before us honestly and realistically addresses that major flaw.",178,Representatives Main Committee
243,Mrs Deanne Kelly (Dawson) (12.14 P.m.),"It is a pleasure to follow the member for8724 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 The ATC has done some magnificent work over the past 12 years. It has had major successes bringing international tourists to Australia and its role in the lead-up to the Sydney 2000 Olympics is obviously critical. Under the existing act, the ATC has three major objectives: to increase the number of visitors to Australia from overseas, to maximise benefits to Australia from overseas visitors and-the last one-to ensure that Australia is protected from adverse environmental and social impacts of international tourism. This last measure was obviously a clear pandering to the extremist environmental lobby in 1987, and the then ALP government included it as the third objective. It was truly a bizarre requirement, especially given the fact that the ATC was never given any power or capability to meet that third principle. What was obviously a political sop in 1987, and allowed the government to gain political points with the green movement, has become a reporting, accountability and responsibility nightmare for the ATC. The inability to meet this statutory objective presents the commission with reporting and accountability problems and has resulted in criticism from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit and the Australian National Audit Office. Both the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit and the Australian National Audit Office have acknowledged that the commission does not have the power to meet statutory object 6(c)-the one I have just referred to. The joint committee has recommended the commission propose to its minister that this statutory object should be amended to clarify the commission's role. This bill proposes an amendment of this unworkable third principle and will allow the ATC to actually work cooperatively with other government agencies to meet the generally accepted nature of the existing third principle. It is important to understand that the government's amendment to that existing paragraph of the act does not in any way, shape or form weaken the powers of the ATC in relation to the impact of tourism on social and environment issues. Simply, it could not do so, as the ATC never had any real powers in this regard. The government's amendment will allow the ATC to meet its statutory objects within its powers and, importantly, to have regard to the ecologically sustainable development set out in subsection 21(3) of the Natural Heritage Trust Act 1997 and to the social impacts of international tourism. In an effort to meet its obligations under subsection 6(c), the commission has put in place strategies that involve publicising the value of Australia's environment, conducting research into attitudes to the environmental impacts of tourism and implementing best practice environmental standards within the commission. This goes some way to addressing the issue, but does not 'ensure' environmental protection, as required under subsection 6(c). This was highlighted in the Australian National Audit Office's 1997-98 review Aspects of corporate governance: The Australian Tourism Commission and subsequently addressed by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. It is appropriate in the context of this bill to discuss the current state of the tourism industry in the holiday jewel of Australia, the magnificent Whitsundays, in my electorate of Dawson. Firstly, there is another body overseeing tourism along the Queensland coast, and that is the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. This was really a matter of appropriating responsibility to an organisation that did not have the power and authority to undertake it, when there was already another federal agency charged with this very responsibility. I would like to talk about the Whitsundays and the success that they have had in terms of tourism. In 1998, according to Tourism Whitsundays, which compiles relevant local statistics, Thursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 8725 there were 442,000 visitors to the region-an impressive 22.7 per cent more than the 380,000 in 1997. That is a very good result, bearing in mind that we have had the Asian downturn and many other difficult circumstances that have impacted on tourism. Credit for that would have to go to the Whitsunday Visitors and Conventions Bureau, which has now been renamed Tourism Whitsundays, and to their Chief Executive Officer, Rodger Powell. Rodger has had some very innovative marketing programs to attract both international and domestic tourists, the most current one being the Whitsunday out of the Blue program, which you would have seen advertised in many national newspapers and on television. One of the interesting things that came out of the Whitsunday out of the Blue marketing program was the fact that decision making in tourism is so very short. When the marketing program was put together, it was believed that there would be a lead time of some three months. It was thought that people would see the program, plan their holiday in three or four months time and then hopefully come to the Whitsundays. But we found that people made their minds up within a week. They would see it on television and say, 'Gee, we need to get away for three days because work is wearing us out,' and would make a booking. So the immediacy of tourism decisions became apparent to us-the short time span of deciding a destination, booking it and going and having the holiday. I think that certainly changed the perspective of people planning marketing in our areas. While we have had this very pleasing increase in numbers-and I give full credit to Tourism Whitsundays-regrettably, the number of visitor nights has fallen by 5.4 per cent, from 1,623,000 to 1,536,000. In 1998, the average visitor spent $189, up 7.4 per cent from $176 in 1997. As a result of shorter visitor nights and greater amounts spent per visitor per day, the total tourism revenue in our area in fact rose by 1.7 per cent, from $286 million to $291 million. The reason for the very modest increase in total revenue compared with the impressive lift in tourism visitors was, as I have said, the fact that the average stay fell from 4.5 days to 3.5 days. I think perhaps this reflects that spur of the moment decision on tourist destination, booking and undertaking the holiday. I would have liked Tourism Whitsundays to provide me with a statistical breakdown of the origin of numbers, but that has not been possible at this point in time. But it would be fair to say that the South-East Asian crisis has impacted on our visitors from Asia. I know ATC has been very forthright in attracting North American and European visitors to Australia. In the Whitsundays now we certainly see a lot of German, Scandinavian and North American visitors. That has really helped to boost numbers and has been a very welcome addition to what was a fairly difficult time with the downturn in Asia. I would like to talk very briefly, too, about Hamilton Island. Obviously, there are 76 islands in the Whitsunday Passage. Hamilton Island has really gone ahead in the last few years, and full credit has to be given to the Chief Executive Officer, Wayne Kirkpatrick. Now that both airlines operate out of the international airport on Hamilton Island, we have had a great boost in visitors to the area, and the upgrading of facilities and conference rooms has been a tremendous boost for the area too. Restaurants on Hamilton Island have all served to make it as they advertise it: the island that is spoiling Australia. There are other islands in the Whitsunday Passage: Hayman Island, Daydream Island, Brampton Island out of Mackay, South Molle Island and many others, all of which are working very hard to attract both domestic and international tourists. 8726 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 The ATC, as I said, has played, and is continuing to play, a vital role. I commend it for its work over the 12 years, especially for its contribution to the tourist industry in my own electorate. However, as the member for Fadden said, one of the greatest difficulties we face in Australia is cost and the fact that we are a long haul destination. We are never going to be able to bring our client base closer to Australia. That long haul and the fact that you can now on the Net call up another destination-perhaps a couple of hours closer; certainly a couple of hundred dollars cheaper-is always, I guess, going to be a road bump on the way to success for us. I will briefly mention the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority because, as I said, it is the authority in our area that has the responsibility for managing the care of the reef. The member for Fadden mentioned the difficulties in Thailand. He is absolutely right: seeing a degraded coral reef is not a pleasant sight. While I support GBRMPA and think that a sensible, well managed approach is very important to the reef, I think balance is the key to this. There needs to be a very strong coordinated effort between the tourism and the environment industries, represented through GBRMPA, to ensure that the balance is right. We had an instance recently where the plan of management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority allowed only one cruise ship per day to anchor in the Whitsundays. As anybody in tourism will tell you, cruise ships are booked some 18 to 12 months ahead, and once you have a major cruise ship or liner out on the ocean you cannot turn it around. It was very awkward to have two cruise ships in the area at the one time until that plan of management could be changed. I do want to thank GBRMPA for working hard with the industry to ensure that that difficulty has been overcome. Cruise ships are again able to come to the Whitsundays profitably and safely so that people can enjoy a great holiday. Whale watching was a recent example as well of a very uncooperative approach, I felt, by the Beattie state Labor government to what is one of the low impact, great experiences you can go on. I think whale watching is one of those things where you have an opportunity to really see the marine environment first-hand. The state government said that they would issue no further licences; their plan overlaid the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's plan and whale watching was stopped in the Whitsundays-fortunately, for only 10 days. These are some of the difficulties. As I said, there needs to be a sensitive balance between the needs of the environment, which we recognise, and the needs of a burgeoning tourism industry. I commend the minister on this sensible move. There are other authorities to take charge of environmental issues concerned with tourism. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is certainly one in our area. This amendment allows the ATC to do what they do so well, which is to boost our tourism numbers. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay-Minister for Sport and Tourism and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (12.27 p.m.}-In summing up, I would like to congratulate all the speakers here today, especially the mighty member for Dawson-one of our regional members-who talked about the importance of international tourism to regional Australia. She especially mentioned the area of particular concern to her-the Whitsundays, the issues she has raised with GBRMP A and the need to have a balance between tourism and the environment. Tourism, after all, is a non-extractive industry and contributes greatly to the employment in the region. Thursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 8727 The member for Fadden talked about the ATC's promotion. His comments on air fares and international airline access now to Australia all contributed to a mighty debate. The situation with the Arab Emirates has the potential to lead to an increase in flights right around Australia and greater competition in international air fares. Tourism is one of our great export industries, as the member for Fadden said, and we are set to benefit enormously from the Olympics. The member for Curtin spoke on ecologically sustainable tourism, very much part of our broad policy objective. The member for Cook, who has extraordinary experience in tourism with his background on the TCA and in managing that organisation through the Asian crisis, made interventionist comments on bed tax and the importance of international tourism as a $16 billion industry and one of the greatest private sector employers. We heard from the member for Hunter. I believe he has foreshadowed an amendment to which we do not object. It is a very welcome amendment. There is a terrific interest in this parliament in tourism. Tourism is growing every day. It isa great industry, and there is bipartisan support for it to flourish and to create continued employment of Australians. Question resolved in the affirmative.

Health: Dental Services Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (12.30 p.m.)-I rise today to speak on an issue that affects thousands of Australians every day-the poor state of public dental services in this country. It is now 2 Y2 years since the Commonwealth Dental Health Program was abolished. The program's charter was to improve access to dental services for those on lower incomes, and from all accounts it had delivered on its charter by significantly reducing waiting lists. The ruthless decision to cut the program has had far reaching consequences for some of the most vulnerable people in the community-those on low incomes, children and the elderly. As most members would be aware, last week was Dental Health Week, and like many Labor members. I took the opportunity to investigate the issue of accessibility and affordability of services in my electorate. Sadly, my inquiries confirmed all the anecdotal evidence we had been hearing on a regular basis. In the city of Monash, waiting lists have grown to two years and are still on the way up, with over 6,000 people on the waiting list at the Monash Dental Link Service. In the city of Whitehorse there were 2,406 people on a four-year waiting list. It is difficult to underestimate the frustration and discomfort this causes people on those lists.",179,Representatives Main Commitiee
244,Mr Deputy Speaker (Hon. D.h. Adams),"Order! It being 12.30 p.m., I propose the8728 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 In May 1998, a Senate inquiry was established to inquire into the effects of these cuts on users of the system. The findings of the committee confirmed the success of the program in delivering dental care to the disadvantaged by reducing waiting lists for treatment, and they highlighted the adverse effects of the abolition of the program. The committee heard evidence that since the cessation of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program there had been a shift in the care provided by the public dental services back towards emergency care: that the state and territory governments had been unable to make up the shortfall resulting from the withdrawal of Commonwealth funding; and that there were now certain sections of the community who were suffering a particular disadvantage due to the withdrawal of funding. These groups were low income earners; the elderly, particularly those who were housebound; pre-schoolers; those in rural and remote areas; indigenous Australians; young people; and those from a non-English-speaking background. Precisely the sorts of people whom the program was set up to cater for are now the people who are suffering the most. I have had countless numbers of people through my door relating horror stories about their inability to track down affordable dental care. We have heard from people living in considerable pain whilst languishing on a waiting list, and from young people with oral diseases that cause them social embarrassment and make things like attending a job interview, or applying for a bank loan, a soul destroying experience. Just three weeks ago, a lady on the pension in her 80s, suffering serious tooth decay and unable to chew her food correctly, came to my office looking for a way to move up the waiting list. To my dismay, the only thing we could do for her was to recommend a range of affordable dentists in the area, if there is such a thing. WhatI really would have liked to have said was that there is an efficient and targeted program for those in need with dental problems. Alas, due to the government's policies, we had to send the woman away without relief and in extreme discomfort. Only a few weeks prior to that, two pensioners in my electorate dropped off their bill to my colleague Simon Crean for inspection. They found it bizarre that they would have to pay a $20 fee, even though they were on the pension. This is the other cruel element in the axing of the system. The dental program raised the public's expectation about dental services, only to find that the system has now been gutted. Probably the most damming indictment of the government's policy came from a doctor who gave evidence at the inquiry. She said: Australia is now a country where you can pick the poor by their teeth. The committee's recommendations included the Commonwealth government taking a leadership role in promoting oral health throughout the country; the appointment of a senior officer for oral health in the Department of Health and Aged Care; and pilot programs for disadvantaged groups. These recommendations have been on the table since 28 May last year. The government's response, nine months later, was at best lacklustre and at worse highly negligent. On all the major recommendations, such as targeting disadvantaged groups and the establishment of a national oral health policy, the federal government squibbed it. They.appeared to be determined to vacate the field and put all the responsibilities at the feet of the state and territory governments. This is despite the fact that the Senate inquiry found that the Commonwealth is empowered by the Constitution to legislate in the area of dental services. Unfortunately, this is the sort of imbalance in the government's priorities we are used to witnessing. Thursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 8729 Despite the fact that we have a huge budget surplus that was raided to pay for its tax deal with the Democrats, and despite the fact that the latest private health insurance rescue plan is costed at $1.7 billion a year, the 1999-2000 budget provided no joy for those suffering from a lack of access to dental care, with the government refusing to commit the money that is so desperately needed. There is a need to restore dental services to those on low incomes. Rising waiting lists and the disturbing move from preventive care to last minute treatment begs a proper response from this government. It is time for the government to restore some of the $4 million it ripped out of this area and direct it to the many Australians suffering needlessly due to this government's miserable and mean-spirited inaction. Health: Dental Services member who has just made a statement to the committee. Having spent seven years in the cabinet in New South Wales, I am surprised that a Labor member from Victoria would be getting up and supporting Jeff Kennett. I am quite amazed, in fact, because this is a state program. It always was a state program. I was in the cabinet in New South Wales. I know where our money went. I can tell you exactly how this came about. It was before your time in parliament, obviously, but you should listen. It was in the dying days of the 1993 election when Paul Keating was facing the election he could not win. He came out with a plan to improve the waiting lists on dental care. There is no doubt that there were waiting lists. It was a state program and there were waiting lists. As usual, as the states normally do, they welcomed it with open arms. Here was some more Commonwealth money coming into an area which they were funding at that time. I remember it clearly because he made the specific promise that he would put in a specific amount of money for a specific number of procedures over a specific period of time. He said so. It is quite clear. It was not an ongoing Commonwealth program, but it may well need to be. As soon as the states, and especially the treasuries of the states, can see an opportunity to cost shift they do. That was what happened immediately in our government in New South Wales-and I am not frightened to say so. Treasury shifted the money that was going from the state into that program and used the Commonwealth money. Do not get up here and say that somehow this terrible government has stopped a Commonwealth program. It was not one; it was a state program. You can easily get up here and say, 'We should introduce a program.' Yes, I will accept that. I will accept that you can say that we should introduce a program. I might not disagree. But it is dishonest to get up and say that it is a Commonwealth program. It never was. I am sure that the Premier of Victoria would be smiling. He is very fond of putting the boot into the Commonwealth, whether it be the Liberal-National Party or the Labor Party in government. He has learnt that, I suppose, from a former Premier of Queensland. The fact is that at every opportunity he will blame the federal government. I am very disappointed that a member of the Labor Party would get up here and support the fact that he has been denying Victorians a program which should have been a state program. I am pretty sure that New South Wales are exactly the same, but they will not admit to it. As I said, I was there. I saw what happened. I knew where the money went out of the budgets in the state at that particular time. Yes, there was a waiting list, but it was a state program.",183,Representatives Main Commitiee
245,Mr Causley (Page) (12.35 P.m.},"-I feel compelled to stand and answer the honourable8730 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 Australian Defence Industries: Proposed Sale only in my electorate but all over Australia where there are people who derive their income from Australian defence manufacturing. The Prime Minister made a strong public commitment to the Bendigo region to retain the ADI plant in public ownership in the lead-up to the 1996 federal election. On 15 February, his exact words were 'No, no and no. We have no plans to sell AD!.' The electors of Bendigo took him at his word and returned a Liberal MP to this parliament. Some 15 months after that election, former defence minister, Ian McLachlan, in responding to a question from the then Liberal MHR for Bendigo, Mr Reid, announced that the plant would in fact be offered for sale at some time within the next 12 months. This blatant disregard for commitments given in an election campaign is yet another example of the Howard government's manic obsession with privatisation at all costs. The fact that this plant is an integral component of our vital defence manufacturing industry makes the proposed sale one of the worse acts of political treachery witnessed in recent times. Over the last decade, Australia has built a strong and viable defence industry which has returned some $30 million in dividends to the federal government, paid more than $140 million in taxes and developed world-class project management skills, with thousands of subcontractors engaged in leading edge technologies that would not otherwise be available in Australia. Bendigo's ADI Bushmaster project, worth around $200 million, is just one example of the world-class standard of design and engineering that this company is now providing. Now we have an ideologically hidebound federal government that sees no problem in virtually giving away our defence manufacturing capability to overseas interests. Media reports over the last few weeks are quoting figures of around $200 million as a purchasing price for the company. Government figures value ADI at around $400 million to $450 million. The Bendigo community is again waiting anxiously for the plant's future to be decided, being now quite used to the coalition's deceit regarding ADI in Bendigo. In 1981, the then Fraser government's Expenditure Review Committee recommended that the former Bendigo Ordnance Factory, which is now ADI, be sold. The government accepted the recommendation and announced the proposed sale, resulting in massive concern from all sections of the Bendigo community. This resulted in the most intense community based lobbying campaign ever seen in regional Victoria, to try and save the plant. This represented 450 jobs and over $9 million worth of economic activity in Bendigo's economy each year. The then Bendigo City Council, which was not widely renowned for its radical views, took the unusual step of having three of its most senior councillors nominate as candidates in the forthcoming state elections. They campaigned on a 'save the ordnance factory' ticket. The idea was that conservative voters who wanted to register a protest about the proposed sale could vote for a well-known conservative councillor and then give their second preference to the Liberal candidate. Those who wanted to protest and vote Labor would vote for the well-known Labor councillor and allocate their second preference to the endorsed Labor candidate. Those who wanted to protest and could not make up their minds could vote for a well-known Democrat councillor, who obviously could not make up his mind either, and issue the second preferences accordingly.",185,Representatives Main Committee
246,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (12.39 P.m.),"I rise today to speak about a major concern notThursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 8731 This political stunt gained considerable media interest and highlighted the intense community opposition to the proposed sale. David Kennedy, the endorsed state Labor candidate, campaigned heavily on the sale issue and won the seat comfortably from the Liberals. The Bendigo Trades Hall Council successfully lobbied the Australian Democrats to initiate a Senate inquiry, which resulted in the sale being deferred until the completion of that inquiry. They were the days when the Democrats had some backbone. This was over many months and resulted in the Fraser government running out of time, having to announce the scheduled federal election for 1983. The sitting Liberal member for Bendigo, government whip John Boucher, supported the sale and lost the seat to Labor's candidate, John Brumby, who campaigned vigorously against the sale proposal. History has shown that Australians prefer defence manufacturing to stay in public ownership. If Howard continues with the privatisation and sale of our defence industries, then there will be almost certainly a political price his government will pay. If a sale results in our defence industries being lost to an overseas interest that manufactures offshore, then the whole nation will not only pay a severe penalty but could well be placed at considerable risk. Deputy Speaker to remind members that, when they pass in front of the chair, they should show due respect to the chair-not to the individual sitting in it, of course. The honourable member for Robertson passed the front of the chair without acknowledging the chair. I just bring it to his notice as directed by the Deputy Chair. Senior Australian of the Year Award Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (12.43 p.m.)-Thank you very much for this opportunity to speak, Mr Deputy Speaker. For a moment I thought I had not acknowledged you in the polite and proper manner. I am glad to hear that I was acknowledged. I attended this morning the launch by the minister, Bronwyn Bishop, of a very important program in the International Year of Older Persons 1999: the Senior Australian of the Year Award. I was very pleased to see that launch. It really instils in me and many others a sense of the great contributions that our senior citizens make. The fact of our demographics is that we are getting to be an older population. At the moment there are one in eight older Australians who are in the work force. There are now 2.2 million people aged 65 years and over living in Australia, and by the year 2016 there will be 3.6 million people in this demographic age group. It is also estimated that, by the year 2036, people over the age of 80 will make up 6.2 per cent of the population. I have also been on a committee that dealt with mature age employment issues. The number of contributions that older people make in the community, in volunteer work and also in mentoring programs, cannot be ignored. Why do we need to have an award and a program such as this? A lot of people do take our older generation for granted. I had the wonderful privilege of growing up in a family where my parents came to this country from southern Europe. I also had the wonderful opportunity of having a very close relationship with my grandmother and grandfather. I learned much from them. In my day-to-day life as well I have had the privilege of having some wonderful older people as mentors not only in a business sense but also in a political environment. I must say that it is absolutely terrific to have someone to go to. There is nothing like age and wisdom, as they say.",186,Representatives Main Committee
247,Mr Deputy Speaker (Hon. D.h. Adams),"Deputy Chairs have been reminded by the8732 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 The reason these awards have been initiated in the first place is that they encourage mutual responsibility between the community and senior Australians. They recognise a significant contribution of older Australians to communities and families. They build partnerships involving government, business and the community to better meet the needs of .ustralians. They also improve younger people's understanding of older Australians and promote greater responsibility by families and individuals. I have a fairly active older constituency in my electorate of Ptttrie: 30 per cent is over age 65. I see the same people in the community organisations that I go out to every day; they do outstanding work in my community. I am absolutely overawed by their energy, .;esponsiveness and their sense of community. Organisations like Meals-on-Wheels, War Widows and University of the Third Age would not be as active or as well run i( it were not for the individuals concerned. I would also like to say that this is a very open process. Any member of the public is welcome to submit a nomination for the Commonwealth government Senior Australian of the Year Award. The person nominated for this award can be an Australian citizen. There is no formal age limit, so that is pretty good. The Commonwealth government Senior Australian of the Year is for those over the age of 65. He or she has to be a person of exceptional achievement who has made a significant contribution to the welfare of the nation. These particular kits have been sent out to all electorates. I welcome and encourage all the members in the Main Committee to participate in this terrific program. Nominations will be accepted by any member of the public. The award is complemented by a separate Commonwealth recognition award for senior Australians, which recognises people who have made a significant contribution to their local community and it is coordinated through their federal MPs. This will hopefully be an ongoing national award, managed by the National Australia Day Council. I commend this award to the House. member for Calwell, I will say that I mentioned to the honourable member for Robertson that the Deputy Chairs have been reminded by the Deputy Speaker to remind members that, when they pass in front of the chair, they should acknowledge the chair. The honourable member for Robertson was reminded a few moments ago; the honourable member for Calwell did exactly the same thing when he entered the chamber. I remind him of his obligation. I now call on him to speak. Maribyrnong Detention Centre Dr THEOPHANOUS (Calwell) (12.49 p.m.)---Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I apologise. I always do that in the House; I will do so here as well. I wish to raise a very serious matter concerning the rebellion that occurred at the Maribyrnong Detention Centre on 22 July of this year and certain aspects of that issue. The detainees in the centre are, of course, asylum seekers; they are not people who have committed any crime. Nevertheless, because of the conditions in that centre and the development of many grievances over a period, there was a rebellion. The department of immigration advised that, as a result of that rebellion, the internal part of the centre was totally destroyed, including a general trashing of the centre-destruction of televisions, videos, computers, furniture, and the like. ..",187,Representatives Main Committee
248,Mr Deputy Speaker (Hon. D.h. Adams),"Order! BeforeI call the honourableThursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 8733 One would have thought that this was a very serious event and that it would have been investigated. Instead, what happened was that the department of immigration tried to keep quiet the events that occurred on that day. It was only when Mr Nacer Benbrika, the president of the Algerian community of Victoria, came to see me that the matter was brought to my attention. That was seven days after the event. Mr Benbrika had certain allegations to make about the events of that day. He asserted that, notwithstanding the fact that 35 to 40 people--that is, detainees-had actually been involved in that rebellion, seven had been singled out by the department and six of those had been seized by police and security guards at the Maribymong Detention Centre and had been taken to Port Phillip Prison. They are still in Port Phillip Prison, as far as I am aware, and they have not been charged with any offences. Mr Benbrika went on to assert that these people had been assaulted by the security people in the Maribyrnong Detention Centre and by police. They had been assaulted physically-this is the claim that was made. I immediately contacted the office of Mr Farmer, the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, and one of his senior lieutenants spoke to me about the matter. I was not satisfied, however, with the explanation that was given. I did tell him that I would go down on the Friday-that was the next day-to visit the people. He did assure me that no-one had been injured and that only one person had a slight scratch on their forehead. When I went to visit these six people at the Port Phillip PrisonI discovered a different story. In fact, one had virtually had his arm broken-not quite broken but severely contorted-and he had been in hospital at the prison for a number of days. Several others had severe bruising in different parts of their bodies. The claim that these people had not been assaulted appears, on that evidence, to be false, unless there is some other explanation for these bruises. This situation gave me great concern and, on the basis of that, I raised the matter with the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The Commonwealth Ombudsman undertook to hold an inquiry into the matter. That inquiry has proceeded apace, and is still proceeding. I want to just indicate, because the time is running out, that there are a number of other very serious aspects to this issue. For example, why was it that 35 to 40 people felt so aggrieved that they actually rebelled in the detention centre? I have put two questions to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on this matter-question Nos 838 and 839-and I would ask members to have a look at those questions and to see what can be done. I am looking forward to the answers from the minister. I am also looking forward to the response of the Ombudsman, as is the UNHCR and Amnesty International-both bodies have had the matter raised with them. We are looking forward to getting real answers to what has happened in relation to this extremely serious question with respect to the people at the Maribymong Detention Centre. (Time expired) Chickens: Newcastle Disease in the community would know, areas of my electorate of Robertson were devastated by the outbreak of newcastle disease amongst the chicken industry at Mangrove Mountain on 1 April-that was the day that it was first identified this year. It resulted in the slaughter of some two million chickens and the devastation of the entire industry in the Mangrove Mountain area. More importantly, it resulted in devastation and financial difficulty for many families in that area.",188,Representatives Main Committee
249,Mr Lloyd (Robertson) (12.54 P.m.),"As honourable members would know and as many8734 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 12 August 1999 At that time, people from all over New South Wales, the state government and the federal government, all rushed to help the communities of Mangrove Mountain. It was a great effort by all the volunteers and government officials. The federal government arranged for some ex gratia payments to enable those families to at least feed their children, put food on the table, and pay some of the basic bills, because their entire livelihoods had been destroyed by an unexpected and unanticipated event. There appears to be a view in the community that this crisis is over, that the disease has been eradicated. But the crisis is not over, not for these families on Mangrove Mountain. While some of the farms are now beginning to slowly be restocked, many of them, particularly those farms that are under contract or work with the Ingham's company, have not been restocked. They hope to be restocked within a few weeks, but it then takes 16 weeks for these young chickens to be fully grown, and, more importantly, produce an income for those farmers. That will be in four or five months time. The ex gratia payments that the federal government has contributed, some $250,000, have now ceased because the quarantine restrictions have been lifted. These farmers are now left in limbo for the next four or five months, and it is causing a great deal of heartache in the community. I spoke only this morning to Dr Joanne Sillance, the Executive Director of the Australian Chicken Growers Association. She was very distressed by the plight of some of these farmers. She said to me, 'Jim, how do you think I feel when I have to look these farmers in the eye and tell them that they are not going to have any income for at least the next four or five months?' That was the difficulty. That statement really affected me because these people are my friends as well. I am part of their community and, when they hurt, I hurt. I appeal to the federal government to look at the proposal that I put forward, in oenjunction with Dr Joanne Sillance, to allow those ex gratia payments to continue for some time, not as a gift, not as a hand-out-these people do not want hand-outs-but as a small, interest free loan to enable them to have money to put food on the table for their children for the next three or four months at least, until we can get this industry back on its feet. There is an exceptional circumstances application which the federal government is looking at. But exceptional circumstances only come into operation when farmers have had a significant downturn in their income for more than 12 months. The Mangrove Mountain people do not fit into that criterion at this stage. I believe that they will. I believe that they will have a significant downturn in their industry and their income for much more than 12 months. But, at this stage, that application has been laid aside for two months until we can better assess the effect on the industry. There is also a Premier's fund. I understand the New South Wales government offers low interest loans to assist farmers at this stage. But I also understand that that is assets tested. I would appeal to the New South Wales government, and in particular to the New South Wales minister, Mr Amery, to look at the Premier's fund to see where they can assist. I was very disappointed in a press release that Mr Amery put out on 6 August where he claimed that the federal government was refusing the exceptional circumstances application. He knows that the application did not meet the criterion which all state and federal government ministers had agreed to. He knows that it has only been put aside to further increase the chances of that exceptional circumstances application being successful. Thursday, 12 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 8735 I appeal to the government, and to everyone that is involved in this crisis, to understand that the crisis is not over, that the families are still suffering, and that we need to do much, much more to ensure that those families are looked after in this crisis. (Time expired) Maribyrnong Detention Centre Dr THEOPHANOUS (Calwell) (12.59 p.m.)-I want to make a few more comments about the issue that I raised before which has to do with the Maribyrnong Detention Centre. As I mentioned, I put two questions on notice to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, but I am very concerned about the conditions in the centre and the reasons why the people rebelled in the centre. It should be brought to the attention of the House that 55 persons signed a letter to Amnesty International on 15 July, one week before this rebellion, protesting about the conditions at the centre. The minister has to look into this. I understand that there is an internal inquiry by the departmentMain Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m.",189,Representatives Main Committee
