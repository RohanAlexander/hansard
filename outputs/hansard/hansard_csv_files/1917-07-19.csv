While I appreciate the fact that it is necessary for the Government to get their programme on the statute-book as speedily as possible, and that it is necessary for Ministers to devote as much time as possible to administrative work, I cannot help feeling that it is not asking the Government too much to ask them to allot one day in every three weeks to private members who may wish to ventilate any special grievance worthy of a notice of motion, or to bring forward business of importance to the country.",11,Wirele Ss Service

72,Mr Heitmann,"I am not referringopportunity is given to private members to bring forward business, it will prove to be beneficial, not only to the Government, but also to the country. There is a matter to which I wish to devote some little time in the House before it rises. It is a matter of vital importance to the workers of tbe country, and is deserving of more than passing notice. I refer to the question of social insurance. Speaking from my experience of the Legislative Assemblyi u Western Australia, rather than see honourable members' privileges curtailed by their not being allowed a certain lime in each month for the discussion of private members' business, I would prefer to see that standing order which enables every honourable member to discuss on the motion for the adjournment of the House every question under the sun wiped out, and,, instead, allow honourable members the opportunity of moving definite and concrete motions which can be discussed on private members' day in a more intelligent way than is possible under the present system. In the Legislative Assemblyi n Western Australia, honourable members were allowed one day in each fortnight from the time at which the House met unti l 8 o'clock in the evening, after which it rested wibh the House itself to say whether private members' business should continue or whether Government business should be discussed. We always found that sessional order an excellent one. It obviated a lot of endless discussion, and it was beneficial to honourable members generally, and very often to the Ministry. [3.6] I trusti that the desire of the Prime Minister will be carried out. Right through the elections the cry was that this Parliament was to be brought together to win the war and look after the interests «f the people. Therefore, we should go on with legislation with the object of winning the war. Unless Government supporters go on strike, the whole of the business the Government propose with the object of winning the war should be dealt with in three weeks, and the balance of the time can be devoted to private members' business. I am surprised a* any one who supports the Government objecting to Ministers going on with the work of the country, and 1 hope that the Prime Minister will insisti on his motion being carried. I ican assure the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that so f a r as the Opposition are concerned, all the business the Government intend to do w ill be dealt with very speedily. House is under a debt of gratitude to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports for fche rebuke that he has administered in' advance to the less prominent members of his party whoi are sitting on the f r o n t Opposition bench; but while cordially endorsing every word he has uttered with reference to the importance of pressing ahead with public business, I would like also to congratulate him on the candour, quite unexpected from his side of the House, w i th which he drew attention to the difference he himself draws between "" w in n in g the w a r "" and ""looking after the interests of the people."" This is nob an unusual motion, but it) is certainly unusual for it to be moved at such a time, and as I have protested on previous occasions against the curtailment of privileges and opportunities of honourable members, I must also protest emphatically on this occasion. I promise the Government every possible assistance towards carrying their win-the-war policy. In fact, members of the Opposition are more anxious to get on with tliat policy than even the Government appear to be, for, although the House has been in session for some time, there is as yet no proposal before us which has any direct reference to winning the war or to the policy of the Ministry. What are the opportunities possessed by private members ? An y little privileges we have had as individuals are being gradually curtailed until we simply become items or atoms. When the junta has spoken, honourable members have simply to do and say whab they are told to do or say. They are only allowed to speak by permission. They are not allowed to bring forward any business unless they have permission to do so. During the recent elections the people of the country were told that members of the Labour party were l e f t no initiative, freedom, or liberty; but I ask, What liberty have honourable members now? They have none. No t a single shred of liberty is lef t to them to-day when the junta or an autoc r a t I do not know which-ha s spoken.

They are certainly far more important than any business which the Government have yet submitted. I have on the notice-paper a proposition directly associated with the war, which is due for consideration today, and if the Government were alive to the necessity of winning the war, they would he glad to have that question discussed. My notice of motion deals with the question of why so many men who volunteer for active service are rejected. There is something wrong in Australia when so many men of military age ""are held to be unfit for military service. ber will not be in order in discussing, at this stage, the subject of a notice of motion on the business-paper. sible to make sure that the views of private members will not be helpful in win-' ning the war? league, who represents the Minister for Defence in this House, would be glad to have a letter from tbe honourable member on the subject. be so ready to Teply.

Although honourable members belong to two different parties they are here first of all as individual representatives, with responsibilities as individuals, and if they are not afforded opportunities to deal with private members' business, then their individual responsibilities are taken from them. They become mere links in the chain, and are of very little use.

93,Mr Finlayson,"I have remainedfrom any criticism. I hope that the Government will extend to private members' business more consideration than is shown in this motion. . Mr J. H . OATTS (Cook) [8.16] The Government were elected on a number of political war cries,, and. o n e them was that of ""Freedom from the shackles of the parties."" They declared that members were tied to their parties and did not enjoy sufficient individual freedom. Here, however, Ave have a proposal on the part of the Government to take away from private members, no matter on what side of the House they may sit, any opportunity for bringing business before the Parliament. The Government and their supporters have said that they favour proportional representation; that, in some of the constituencies, because of the operation of the mass vote, there is no representation of minorities. This very proposal' which we are considering, however, shows that they do not desire to give minorities any representation whatever. Having a majority behind them they intend to suppress any business which the minority representation of the people might bring before the National Parliament. Honourable members on this side of the House represent over a million of the electors who recorded their votes at the. recent elections, and we have here an indication of the intention of the Government that those million voters and more shall not be allowed, through their representatives, to submit one item 6f business to the House. And this is the Government which waved the flag when before the electors, and talked largely about freedom. What they desire is not the freedom, but the suppresthis kind from being dealt with by Parsion, of the individual. Then again the Government and their supporters had much to say during the recent campaign about tbe existence of a junta. What is their own position? There is, first of all, the Prime Minister, who occupies a position of exceptional power He meets his Cabinet, which is in itself a little junta, and it imposes its will upon the party with which it is associated. That was demonstrated by the protest made this afternoon by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who complained that his liberty was being taken from him. Such a complaint shows that the party were not consulted before, this proposal was brought forward. It shows that the little junta of Ministers is imposing its will on its party, and that the party so manipulated is imposing, not its own will, but the will of the little junta of Cabinet Ministers upon a House of seventy-five °^ members. Whilst the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was protesting that he had no chance of submitting a motion that he wished to move, the Minister for the Navy interjected, "" Y o u will have a chance on every third Thursday."" That was a misrepresentation of the position. thing. Mr J. H . CATTS -The right honourable member knows perfectly well that, although on each third Thursday grievances may be brought forward, notices of motion standing in the names of privatemembers cannot be moved in the ordinary way. This is a proposal to prevent any private member, no matter on which side of the House he may sit, from submitting any business to the Parliament. We have been told by the Prime Minister that, when the session is ended-in other words, when honourable members are tired and anxious to get away-a n opportunity will be given for the discussion of private members' business. I remember such 'an arrangement being made when Mr Deakin was Prime Minister. It simply means that, on the last day of the session, there will be twenty or thirty notices of motion on the business-paper, and that they can only be disposed of provided those responsible for them will agree to a vote being taken without any discussion. It is the intention of the Government to prevent business of liament. The Win-the-war Government cannot have very much business to put before Parliament. If it had, it would not have moved the motion now under discussion, because, unless a definite motion is made providing time for the consideration of private members' business, no opportunity is open to honourable members for the bringing forward of such business. Seven or eight members of this House of seventy-five members have positions in the Cabinet, and they desire that none but themselves shall be permitted to bring forward proposals to help the country in the present crisis. The motion reveals the weakness of the Government.",14,Order Of Business
94,Mr Joseph Cook,"I said no suohI t shows that Ministers are afraid to deal with on their merits the questions which have already been set down on the notice paper in the names of private members. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie wishes to move for a return showing the cost of recruiting, but, although he is a Ministerial supporter, the Government is determined to gag that motion. The honourable member for Newcastle wishes to bring forward an ' important proposal affecting old-age pensioners, and that too is to be gagged.

WereI a member of the Ministerial party, I would bring forward in the party meeting any matters that I wished to discuss, and urge the Government to deal with them. It is moonshine to suppose that a private member could pass a measure providing for an insurance system, for example. assist the Government in passing its measures as quickly as possible.

The Prime Minister proceeded to state that he had seen a letter written by Mr Needless to say we would incorporate in the Hickey to Mr Grayndler (secretary of the Australian Union), which was totally incompatible with the suggestion that Mr Hickey was, or ever had been, associated with the Industrial Workers of the World. We have now been supplied with a copy of the correspondence with Mr Grayndler, referred to by Mr Hughes, which is as follows:Of course, the Prime Minister's statement They had done its duty. He made use of it during the election, and six weeks' later crawled down by declaring that he had seen a letter which showed that Mr Hickey was not a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, and had no sympathy with that body at a l l . This is Mr. Hickey's letter7 St. James Buildings, William-street, Melbourne, 29th August, 1916. Memo, for E. Grayndler, Esq., Gen. Secretary Australian Workers Union. Dear Comrade Grayndler, about the AmacI believe that the Industrial Workers of the World in this country is going to develop into a very serious menace to working-class In connection with that solidarity unless challenged. The astonishing enthusiasm of its members, coupled with an ever-increasing literature distribution on their .part, is penetrating everywhere. Its adherents make a dead "" set"" against any organization that is national in character, and by every method at their disposal endeavour to undermine the confidence of the rank and file, and by innuendo, open and covert, destroy the prestige of officials. I attend these ConferI have watched the concern for some years, particularly its operations in-America. I have in my possession at the present time a history of its checkered and questionable career in that country, together with charges of so grave a nature that I venture the opinion that if the information could be circulated amongst the workers of Australia it would keep Industrial Workers of the World members busy explaining away unpleasant truths. The trouble to date in Australia is that there has not been anything of the nature of a concrete case made against them other than to bewail their activities, and an appeal to the workers not to heed the propaganda. But workers interested in the Labour movement need something more tangible than wind as an argument against the Industrial Workers of the World. What they require is fact and argument, and in the history of the Industrial Workers of tbe World, from ithe bloody struggle in the steel mills of MeKees Bocks to the black betrayals of Akeron tically unanswerable. Now this is what I want to know from you. IfI compile a pamphlet on tbe lines indicated, would your organization turn it out! knowledge that something is being done to counteract the sinister campaign of the Industrial Workers of the World. If such a pamphlet was turned out, it would, I believe, act -as a deterrent to the direct actionists. production a chapter or two upon the local concern. I don't want you to buy a pig in a poke. I don't want your organization to say it will undertake the production of a pamphlet without perusing the manuscript. If you indicate",19,Unlawful Associations Bill Second Reading

136,Mr Tudor,"the willingness of your organization to embark upon the venture, I w ill gladly supply you with the manuscript. If after reading the copy you are not satisfied with it, frankly say so; it will be a good turn to me. You will be glad to hear that I am now general organizer for the Victorian Bailways Union. There is plenty of scope there for all one's energy. Trusting that you are keeping well, and awaiting an early reply, I am, fraternally, P. H. HICKEY. I think it only fair that these letters ' should be placed on record, as showing the attitude of bond fide representative trade unionists towads the Industrial Workers of the World. They are an effective answer to those honourable members who would have the country believe that bond fide trade unionists have fostered the Industrial Workers of the World movement, and that members of the Industrial Workers of the World have eaten their way into the unions, and have permeated the Labour movement to such an extent that they now hold all the important offices. Those statements are not correct. replied to Mr Hickey as followsHead Office, St. Andrew's Place, Sydney, 1st September, 1916. Mr P. H. Hickey, General Organizer, Victorian Railways Union, 7 St. James Buildings, William-street, Melbourne. Dear Comrade, I was pleased to get your letter, and congratulate you on gaining the position of general organizer to the Victorian Bailways Union, and the Victorian Railways Union is also to be congratulated in securing your services. Your letter and suggestion to write a pamphlet on the Industrial Workers of the World, its history and questionable career, together with the methods employed in Australia by its followers, are very timely. I have had the Bame idea of writing them up for a while, but unfortunately pressure of work prevents me from doing anything extensive in that line. Your knowledge and experience should enable you to cut right down to the bone in this career that is fastening itself into the vitals of unionism in Australia. To combat and counteract the insidious propaganda of the Industrial Workers of the World, it is necessary to dig down to the heart of the concern, and, by attacking their German-American origin and career, expose their doings and methods, and to keep their disciples and emissaries busy in attempting to explain it away. I will be glad to get the manuscript, and, as I feel sure you will handle the thing well, I will get our people to publish it. Send it along, anyhow, and I will attend to it. Fraternally yours, E. General Secretary. [ 1 2 ] -2 It is timely that this letter should have appeared to-day, when' we are asked to pass a B ill which w ill practically give the Governor General power to declare even the Australian Workers' Union, the Waterside Workers' Union, the Railway Union, the Miners' Union, and nearly every other trade union, unlawful associations. If there is any body of men which is in frequent trouble, it is the miners. We must not forget that the influence of the Industrial Workers of the World may be exercised on the other side. This body might be employed to foment troubles, and bring an industrial organization within the pale of the law. America. MT .

Time after time, when buildings have been blown up, it Mr Grayndler has been proved that the workers could not have placed the explosives in position. This is known f u l l well to those, who, like _ myself, have made a study of American industrial disputes. While I am in favour of granting the Government any power to deal with the Industrial Workers of the World, or any other organization which has for its object the destruction of human l i fe or property-and other honourable members of our party will express themselves in the same directionI contend that it w ill be utterly wrong to pass any measure which gives the Government power to say to an innocent organization, "" We intend to bring you within the pale of the law.

141,Mr Ttjdor,"Then w ill the Ministerconcerned, without any further words from me. In order to show how the Ministerial party, or. the Nationalist party, as of the principle of arbitration. In fact, they are termed, endeavoured to link the party on this side of the House with the Industrial Workers of the World, I quote from All for Australia, a publication sent to me by a soldier. I do not wish to give his name. I suppose he would be punished if it were known he had anything to do with any honourable member of the Opposition. I hold.three issuesI am sorry that I have not the fourth, because then I would have the complete set. The Nationalist party in this publication used the words, ""Vote Opposition, and you support pro-Germans and the Industrial Workers of the World."" One soldier, writing about the elections, has said"" The election has gone off quietly. An officer came to us and said, ' If you want to vote for the Allies, vote for>theNationalists. If you want to vote for the Germans, vote for the Opposition.'"" That officer would not come here and say that about me. He would not say that honourable members of the Opposition desire to have the Germans here. It was a deliberate lie he uttered. The party opposite might say, for electioneering purposes, that we were connected with the In ration did not vote for the honourable dustrial Workers of the World, and, as I have said, that statement is not true. But I ask them to leave bond fide trade unions free from the operations of this Bill, so that they may not be branded as unlawful associations-it must be remembered that there can be no appeal from any decision given under the Bill-and from having all their property seized and their newspapers prevented from going through the post. All I ask is that the bond-fide trade unions in this country shall have the opportunity to exist which they have had in the past. I make this plea to the Ministry. If they grant it, they can have the Bill with very little debate from this side. -My attitude towards the Bill is very easily stated. I am heartily in support of the measure, so far as it purports to be an attempt to deal with the Industrial Workers of the World, and I promise the Government any assistance in the direction of dealing with that organization effectively. There is no need for any such an institution to exist in Australia. Its members are strong opponents supporters of the Government have more community of interest with the Industrial Workers of the World than have honourable members of the Opposition, who are enthusiastic advocates of the principle of arbitration; whereas some Government supporters are quite open in their statements that arbitration is a failure, and does not bring about industrial peace, but rather encourages industrial disputes. Again, the members of the Industrial Workers of the World are opposed to constitutional action, and in that respect, also, they will find more community of interest with the National party than with the Labour party. Workers of the World employers? Federation might be considered distinctly as a branch of the Independent Workers of the World, in so far as principle is concerned, though not. so far as name is concerned, because all of their operations, and all of their business, are based upon direct action. member. Industrial Workers of the World did. honourable member to prove that the In dustrial Workers of the World voted for ine. I told them that I would have nothing to do with them, that I was opposed to them, and that I would obstruct them at every possible opportunity. If the members of the organization do vote for members of the Labour party, it is not because they hope for any assistance or sympathy from this party; it is probably because they have less to fear from us than from the other party. They know ' that honourable members on this side are progressive, and are inclined to give even their opponents a fair deal. On the other hand, they know that the members of the National party are not inclined to give friend or opponent a fair deal.

148,Mr Finlayson,"I challenge thefifteenth century. This measure takes us right back where the Germans have taken us. As the Germans, with a jerk, have taken civilization back into the savage ages, this Bill takes civilization, freedom, democracy, liberty, and justice back for two or three centuries. The history of political advancement is but a record of dealing with unlawful associations. Every organization that has done anything for civilization as we know it to-day, was at one time an unlawful association. Throughout history, there has always been an autocratic Government which, in order to secure power, would refuse to allow any one else to hold an opinion of his own. The whole history of political government is illuminated by episodes such as have been introduced in this Bill, which makes it an offence to do anything that the Government think is wrong. The thing may be right or it may be wrong, but it matters not so long as the Government deem it wrong. orable member think that the cutting of the wires of the cruiser Brisbane was an offence? an offence. think that it is necessary to have legislaization, the principle for which it stands tion to deal with such people as would do that? . 1 cient legislation in this country already to deal with any man, or body of men, who would do such damage. This Bill is not brought forward to deal with such tilings. word to deal with the men who are behind those who do the damage. the Labour party are said to be those who are behind these men, this is a Bill to deal with the Labour party. able member says that the institutions behind the National party are associated with the Industrial Workers of the World, it is a Bill to deal with us. for the Navy must remember that the ^culminating point of the whole thing is the fact that it is the Attorney-General who declares what is an unlawful association. Would the Attorney-General say that the associations which are supporting him are unlawful ? He is much more likely to say that the associations which support his opponents are unlawful. British history has scores of instances of associations having been declared unlawful. Many years ago trade unions were considered most obnoxious institutions, and they were declared unlawful. It was an offence for three men to meet in the street, or even to hold a meeting for the purpose of discussing hours of labour and conditions of labour. Honourable members who represent Tasmanian electorates can tell us how their island was originally populated by men whose great offence, for which they were exiled from their native land, was that they belonged to associations for the improvement 6f their conditions. I remember when I was a youngster the Fenian organizations of Ireland. They were declared unlawful. Any person who was a Fenian was declared to be a traitor, and the organization was suppressed; but who imagines for a moment that the principle for which the members of that organization' were busying themselves was suppressed 1 The relations between Great Britain and Ireland to-day show that, no matter how one might attempt to suppress an organlives and cannot be suppressed. member suggest that nothing should be done in regard to these unlawful associations ? opening remarks I said that, so far as the Bill was made to apply to the Industrial Workers of the World, I supported it, and I would suppress that organization, because in a constitutionally governed country there is no need or reason for the existence of such an institution. Take the history of France or Russia, or even that of Germany, which, behind as it is in matters of Democracy, still has had some ideas in regard to these so-called unlawful associations. An association is only unlawful in the opinion of the ruling powers. In regard to religious and political liberties social or economic advancement, we are indebted to unlawful associations for the position^ that we occupy to-day, and for the freedom that we enjoy.",22,Grayndler To That I W I L L Sit Down And The Govern

In the Parliamentary Library yesterday I found a very illuminating book entitled German Scraps of Paper, which is really a reproduction of a number of proclamations issued by the Germans when they violated the neutrality of Belgium. I was very much struck by the fact that the ethical ideals promulgated in these German proclamations were the same as are to be found in a Bill of this kind. On page 16 of the book the following appears:The following will be immediately shot:Any one who tears down these notices. AH gatherings of more than three persons and .that in itself is a condemnation of the are forbidden. Hostages will be shot if there is tbe least endorse. In section 5 of the Act it is prodisorder. In future the inhabitants of places situated vidednear railways and telegraph lines which have been destroyed will be punished without mercy (whether they are guilty of this destruction or not ) . The inhabitants will be deported by order and removed into the country. . . . By this measure they will be given the opportunity of providing better for their subsistence. That is the old cry of the concern of the wolf for the lamb. The very provisions of this Bill are an indication of the v psychology of the Government. a quorum. [Quorum formed.'] Bill as it is true of these German"" scraps of paper,"" that the authors, in their conception of their victims' psychology, betray their own. This Bill is an indication of the moral ethics of the Government. I was ready to pass by many of the Prime Minister's charges against the members of our party during the election campaign. He was very abusive, most insulting, and certainly most false in the statements that he made about members of this party. But as I , like every other honourable member, know that the Prime Minister's standard of moral ethics is not of a very high character, those statements by. him were of small concern t'o me. Here, however, we have the Government and its supporters identifying themselves with the statements made by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister may say what he pleases, but when his party begin to assert that every organization in this country which will not say and do what the Government wish is, therefore, an unlawful association, then, from my point of view, they are going too far. In clause 2 of the Bill the Government themselves declare that, so far from the Industrial Workers of the World being an organization which ought to be permanently suppressed, it should be suppressed only for the period of the war and six months thereafter. I am against them on that point. If the Industrial Workers of the World, or any organization having similar aims and methods, is to be suppressed in war time, it is equally important that it should be suppressed in time of peace. The Government, however, impose this limitation to the Bill, very principle which they invite us to Whoever, being a member of an unlawful association, advocates or encourages, or incites or instigates to any action intended or calculated to prevent or hinder the production, manufacture, or transport, for purposes connected with the war, of troops, arms, munitions, or warlike material, including foodstuffs, shall be guilty of an offence. Penalty : Imprisonment for six months. U n d e r t h a t provision any strik e could be dealt with. ber will not be in order in discussing the clauses of the Bill in detail at this stage. sir, that the provisions of this Bill aim not only at the Industrial Workers of the World, but, as the Leader of our party has contended, at trade unions. One has only to read section 5 of the Act to see at once that the Bill will apply to any person who incites or instigates any men to strike when they are dealing with transport, production, or distribution work which, in the opinion of the Attorney-General, is in connection with the war. That applies also to men on the land. If the m n engaged in sugar-growing in Queensland complain that the wages and conditions of",23,Grayndler To That I W I L L Sit Down And The Govern

And so w it h men engaged in the stacking of wheat or in railway or steam-ship services; the same principle w ill apply. Under this B ill the Government can make anything on sea or land an offence against the law, and bring within the provisions of this B ill the members of the association responsible for it . If the Government are honest in their proposals, why can they not exclude from this measure everything but a reference to the Industrial Workers of the World? Let them do that, and,so far. as I am concerned, they can have the B ill without further debate. If they w ill not go so far, let them insert an amending olause providing that the B ill shall not apply to those bodies which have secured registration under the Act of Parliament establishing the Arbitration Court. I am only asking the Government to be'honest -to make their practiee parallel with their professions.

We heard what he said about liberty, and we know that he is associated with a party, a school, or a clique, that drove out of the Labour party the men who founded it, simply because of an opinion they held regarding conscription, and that notwithstanding the fact that the TJnited States of America and most of the countries allied with Great Britain at the present time have legalized conscription, and almost every civilized country in the world regards it as the corner-stone of Democracy. hypocrisy of the honourable member is astoundingI know of no other word which would better describe his speech. The muddle that he made of history was amusing. But the party to which he belongs is in a chronic state of muddle, never being able to reason logically, or to stand by their positions. The law of historical criticism which I learned in my teens was that every man, institution, and phase of history should be judged by contemporaneous thought. To muddle up the events of the early part of the nineteenth'century with what is happening to-day was on a par with much that has been done by the honourable member and those with whom he is associated. I shall support the Bill, because the In dustrial Workers of the World are at war with society. Those on this side would be the last to denounce any attempt to interfere with the propagation of opinion, though, during a war like the present, cerLiberty is a tain restrictions must be imposed. This measure is a war measure, and, as such, will cease to have effect six months after the war is over. There is much that is being done at the present time to which I would not consent were it not for the war. A great deal of the stupid nonsense which is being preached ito the people by extremists will, no doubt, work its own cure when the war has been ended; but if, as I have been told on pretty good authority, the chief literature in circulation in the back country is the' Sydney Worker and Truth, the responsibility is thrown on some oneI do not say that it is thrown on the members of this Of all House to provide some antidote. No one has more sympathy for the people than myself. I know that they are deluded by rascals who use their education and ability to deliberately misinform them in the trashy stuff they supply. Many of these working people have had no opportunity to obtain a proper education, and they certainly deserve better treatment than that of being left to the tender mercies of the men I have described. Personally, I should give short shrift to these men who so misguide their fellow creatures; indeed, I do not ithink that hanging them by the neck would do much harm. At any rate, if these men cannot find better use for their pens than The double-distilled, canting to deliberately mislead the masses of the working people, it is time they were dealt with. This is a war measure, and it cannot be denied that the Industrial Workers of the World are making war on society in such a way that we have a perfect right to do all we possibly can to stamp them out. Why should this measure not apply to all unlawful associations? If the Industrial Workers of the; World were to rename themselves th& "" New-found-out Whistlers,"" or some other Yankee name, we should, if the suggestions of some honourable members were acted upon, have to go through all the forms of legislation again to declare the organization unlawful. The Government are only treating this House with nroper respect when they ask us to pass a measure of this kind, because of illegal acts which are a menace to society, and propose that the measure should apply to all organizations that break the law. Personally, I do not think for a moment thafc the Bill will ever apply to fche Australian Workers Union or the waterside workers of Australia. rabid Labour days, I always gave Conservatives the credit of believing that they were Australians and Englishmen; for one moment did I think that they were bereft of the principles of justice and equity. took a different view from thafc of myBelf, and, indeed, they do now; but it seems to me monstrous to assume fchafc any Australian would use legislation of this character for the purpose of ""suppressing or injuring trade unionism. the policy of every Government is to remain in office as long as possible, and no Government could last six months in Australia who acted as has been The possibility of a measure of this kind applying to bona fide trade unions is very as the Industrial World fluence amongst the unions in will have disappeared. literature and their operations are suppressed, the less likelihood there will be of this dangerous influence permeating trade union movement, as, it does to an extent afc the present time. I do not believe that honourable opposite think there is any danger in this direction, but, rather, that all their objections are mere fireworks, dazzle the gallery. to be in a position to go round and tell the people that the intend to use repressive measures against the union organizations and their statements are just as accurate as they are usually. say will effect its purpose, to some extent, in misleading that section of our fellow countrymen who are not so well informed as they might be. I do not think it possible that any trade organization in Australia would be prepared to follow on the lines of the Industrial World; but, if there should be such an organization, should not be dealt with as the Bill proposes. However, as I say, I do not think such an event is afc all likely, .and, therefore, I regard the objections raised by honourable members' opposite as of very little value. the honourable seemed fco jumble up their history, and Mr Archibald. not to regard it as every intelligent eritic must when dealing with questions of this Even in my most kind. We have heard the old statements about Mr Walpole, who was connected with the Employers Federation some never twenty years ago. Certainly, in public affairs, they that even the Employers' Federation at bhe present time holds views of such a character. oh the Treasury benches tion employed Mr Walpole for years afterwards. A fundamental desire in Employers. Federation is subject to evolution and improvement, in the matter of their policy, and even if such were the opinions of the Employers Federationsuggested. though I do not believe that they ever wereI do not see anything to be gained by raking up events and utterances tjhat remote, the more so because, have no real connection wifch contemporary Workers of the affairs. The Leader of fche Opposition are put down, the worse incomplained very bitterly that during the Australia last election the opponents of the Labour The more their party described that party as being associated with the ' Industrial Workers of the World. the unfortunately, I noticed that honourable members opposite were nob anxious to debate the A d members dress-in-Reply, though I think that arose more from a reluctance to rehash the speeches they had delivered a l l over the country than from any desire to save designed to time. Sof a r as I am concerned, and They apparently wish I speak also for those associated with Australia me, we never said that our opponents were Government members of the Industrial Workers of the World. WhatI ' did say was ithatl memof this country; bers of the organization were fighting for the Labour party, and that there was no Doubtless what they necessity for the latter to become Industrial Workers of the World. The Labour party has adopted the principles of that organization, and if a man adopts the principles of a school or party, he may be said to be pretty well associated with that school or party. What is Workers of the the difference between myself and honourable members opposite? The differthere is no reason why it ence is that I , as a conservative Laborite, if honourable members choose, stuck tb the principles that were laid down in the early nineties, when the Labour movement was built up.

If honourable members opposite wish to know who supported them at the election T can tell them that they had the solid support of the German vote, of the Sinn Eeiners, and of all the "" cold-footers"" who under no circumstances would fight for their country. Only about 30 per cent, of the workers who voted for the Labour party were really honest men, and these voted as they did because they followed the flag. It is a historical fact that the great masses of people will always follow the flag of their party, and though leaders may shift and change, there is always a number willing to cling to their old associates.

I was glad to get it. said that there was no necessity for the honourable member to join the Industrial Workers of the World, because he has adopted their principles. man do? Workers of the World do not believe in arbitration, but in direct action; and the number of strikes that occurred in the three years prior to the present party coming into power shows the influence which that organization has exerted. Those strikes are evidence that the Industrial Workers of the World have utterly corrupted the Labour movement. It has been stated this afternoon that the action which the Government are taking is tyrannical, and the honourable member for Brisbane, in an amusing speech, prophesied that there would be a prosecution of trade unionists under this Bill. I do not know whether the Industrial Workers of the World are members of trade unions, but they stand a good chance of being prosecuted. We have been told that the party supporting the Governmenb is proposing to imitate the repressive legislation directed by William Pitt against the trade unionists in the early part.of the nineteenth century. I ask any man outside a lunatic asylum whether there is anything in common between the present age and the early years of the nineteenth century, when trade unionists were being sent to Botany Bay? We know that those deportations were due to a repressive tyranny in the Old Country caused by the reaction against the Trench Revolution. Any schoolboy is aware of that fact; but, of course, one does not expect a knowledge of history on the part of the honourable. member for Brisbane. It is impossible to believe that there is any possibility of the introduction in this country of legislation similar to that which William Pitt passed through the British House of Commons. I do not know that it would be altogether a disadvantage if some of the spirit of William Pitt were abroad in these days to rouse our countrymen as the Great Commoner roused the people of England at another time of trial.

It is a war for the freedom of the Allied people, and it is, in its essence, a war of emancipation from the most infamous tyranny that the world haa experienced since the decline of the Roman Empire. Far be it from me to compare the Roman Empire with the infamous German Empire of to-day. With these facts confronting us, it would be monstrous to allow any organization to undermine society.

We believed in those days that sion also. I think the Government are justified in seeking the power which this Bill will give, because I am satisfied that no Government could by any possible means operate this proposed law unjustly. The attempt of honourable members opposite to draw an analogy between the proclamation of the Huns in Belgium and the proposed actions of the Government under this legislation stands self-condemned on the face of it. I hope the Bill will be passed, for I believe it will do some good. But there is something else that honourable members opposite can by Section do, and the, sooner they start the better, words:; and and that is to restore the love of liberty amongst the workers of Australia. It -existed amongst them before it was corrupted by the peculiar policy recently pursued by the Labour party. character of the man who stood against you. of that man showed the infamy to which the Labour party has sunk. On the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway we may get a fair specimen of liberty as it is knownto-day. A meeting is convened by the beating of a kerosene can, and a proposal is made that the men shall strike. They allow the engineer no time to decide what steps he will take; they do not ask him for what they want, but they tell him that if he does not do a certain thing the men will strike. A man standing amongst the crowd shouts, "" Take a ballot and go to the engineer."" Immediately there is a cry, "" Y o u scab! Clear out of here within forty-eight hours, or your tent will BrokenH ill knows that that is a true specimen of the liberty which obtainsmembers talk about liberty it is a wonder their cant does not choke them. I do not charge them with doing the things I have mentioned, but I do say that they sit quiet while they are done.

I urge every true Labour man to revert to the principles laid down in 1890-libert y of sneech, the right of every man to expresshimself, and obedience to the will of the truth was on our side, and that if we did not win in one day we should do so in a decade or a generation. And we did win. But these anti-Labour men, these Industrial Workers of the World lackeys, have smashed a movement which they had not the brains to build up. Question resolved in the affirmative.

The followmg are hereby declared to be unlawful associations, namely:move That the following words be added at the end of the clause :"" but no trade organization of labour registered under the Commonwealth Arbitration Act or under the law of any State, or whose conditions are regulated by a Wages Board, shall be declared an unlawful association by any notice published by the Governor General without the consent of Parliament."" The object of the amendment is to insure that no trade union can be brought under the operation of the pronosed law because of 'the act of one or two of its members. It is possible under the Bill as drafted for the Government to take action against a trade organization on account of the act of some of its members, and .seize the whole of its property, and any man who was a member of the organization, even though he had no knowledge of the offence, could be imprisoned for six months. The amendment, if carried, will remove that possibility. orary Minister) [5,19] -This amendment is based on an entire misconception of the Bill. The honourable member for Yarra is endeavouring to make it appear that, by some means or other, the Bill can ""be made to apply to bona fide unions or bond fide industrial organizations. By no stretch of the imagination can it be said that that is the intention of the Bill or that such organizations are included within its scope. The Bill is intended to deal only with unlawful associations, and it is made clear by sub-section b of section 3 that unlawful associations are associations which by their constitution or propaganda advocate, or encourage, or incite, or instigate to, the taking or en. dangering of human life, or the destruction or injury of property. The implication that it may come within the scope of the operations of legitimate trade organizations to advqcate, or encourage, or incite or instigate to, the taking or endangering of human life, or the destruction or injury to property, is unjust to them. The object of the proposed subsection c, which the Leader of the Opposition is seeking to amend, is merely to give power to the Governor General, that is to say, the Executive Council, to declare that certain kinds of associations which by their constitution or propaganda carry on the objects of advocating, or encouraging, or inciting, or instigat(Yarra) [5.16] I ing to, the taking or endangering of human life, or the destruction or injury of property, may be declared to.be unlawf ul associations. Surely the Leader of the Opposition does not consider that any associations which have these things as their objects should be regarded as lawful associations. By no stretch of imagination can the power given to the Governor General be extended to apply to bond fide organizations carrying out their natural industrial purposes. The amendment cannot be accepted. There is no necessity for it. The Government would do well to accept the amendment, especially seeing that the Honorary Minister says that it is not their intention to bring bond fide trade unions under section 3 of the Act. I feel sure that no honourable member of the Opposition is in sympathy with the Industrial Workers of the World or their work, and we are quite prepared to allow the Government to have the Bill to deal with that organization, but at the same time we are charged with the responsibility of seeing that no legislation is enacted which will deal with bond fide trade unions in an injurious way. I do not know why unlawful associations cannot be dealt with fully under the Act as it now stands. The Bill proposes that an unlawful association may be any association which the Governor General by notice in the Government Gazette declares tO be an unlawful association within the meaning of sub-section b .. of section 3 of the Act, and that sub-section provides that any association which by its constitution or propaganda advocates, or encourages, or incites, or instigates to, the taking or endangering of human life, or the destruction or injury of property, is an unlawful association. Every one knows that in times of industrial upheaval little things occur which are magnified-it may be that there is destruction or injury of property-and immediately that occurs the Government can declare that the organization concerned is an unlawful association. .

And once'the association is declared to be an unlawful association it becomes subject to the penalties provided in the Act, and any one who contributes afterwards to that organization is penalized. The Arbitration Act may minimize strikes and lockouts, but we cannot prevent them altogether, and when there is a good deal of feeling engendered something may occur which will permit of the organization being declared an unlawful association. shown that the organization was responsible, it cannot be declared an unlawful association. number, an association which is really not responsible for the actions of its individual members, has been held responsible in the eyes' of the law. If the Honorary Minister says that the Bill is not intended to apply to bond fide trade unions, what objection can there be to the amendment, which places it beyond doubt that trade unions will not come under the proposed new sub-section? If the Government accept the amendment, we are prepared to allow the Bill to go through at once. We are just as ready as honourable members opposite are to put , down the organization known as the In dustrial Workers of the World; but, at the same time as we must protect trade unions, it is necessary to make the intention of the Bill perfectly clear, and not to leave it framed in such a way that a trade union, because of some little trouble, may become liable to the penalties provided in the Act itself. Minister and Attorney-General) [5.30] If I thought that, under the measure, it was possible to apply the proposed subsection to any bond fide trade union, I would not have introduced it. If I thought that any bona fide Labour organization of"" this country would fall naturally, or in any circumstances, under sub-section b of section 3 of the Act, I would not have hesitated to frame the Bill so as to cover it ; but it is a very poor tribute to the organized labour of Australia when honourable members say that, in any circumstances, a bond fide Labour, organization can be affected by I do not think so. that sub-section, or by the proposed additional sub-section. The honourable member for Hunter has said that, in times of excitement, individual members of organizations may advocate the destruction of property. I know it. Buti f they do so, they will be liable under section 4 of the Act as it stands. That section provides that, whoever advocates or encourages, incites, or instigates the taking or' endangering of human, life, or the destruction or injury of property, shall be guilty of an offence, and be liable to imprisonment for six months. That is the law as it can be it stands. Suppose some hot-heads, during an industrial trouble, advocate the destruction of property, the honourable member contends that the association would be liable under section 3. He is wrong. Only the persons who advocate the destruction of property will be liable, and they will be liable under section 4 of the Act as it stands.^ The honourable member must see that the provision in the new Bill is directed against the propaganda and the constitution of the association, which cannot be affected by the statements of individual members, but only by the deliberate declaration of the organization as such. I know too much of unionism in this country to listen for a moment to a statement that these industrial organizations, as such, are in favour of the destruction of property or the injury of human life. On the other hand, I know only too well that there are members of such organizations who will say anything. Some mean it, and some do, not; but, all the same, they may become liable under section 4 of the Act as it stands. But the new provision cannot affect such men. Under the proposed new sub-section, the Governor General in Council will be able to do nothing more than this: If the Industrial Workers of the World, against which this Bill is directed, changes its name, and calls itself anything you like, we shall be able to deal with it under its new name just as",31,Grayndler To That I W I L L Sit Down And The Govern

In order that trade unions may have from this Parliament an absolute assurance as to what is intended, the proviso should be inserted. The Prime Minister said that to insert the proviso would be to reflect upon trade unionism. If that were so, then we should have to take the very heart out of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and much of the industrial legislation introduced by Labour Governments.

I am sure Bonorable members opposite do not want anything of the kind, but that is what they are really asking me to do. It is impossible to make such a public declaration. We> could not do it. What the Opposition can, and ought to, say is that tihe Bill cannot, in the very nature of 1 things, be directed against trade unionism, because trade unionism does not recog1 nise, bnt detests, such principles. To do what the Opposition have invited me to do would be, on the face of it, to admit that there are in this country trade organOpizations registered under the law which advocate the destruction of property and the taking of human life. There ere no such trade organizations, but if one came into existence no one could defend ""it, and honourable members opposite know that they would not do so. I therefore ask them, with the assurance I hare given, to agree to this clause. I thought that the Government would accept this amendment in the friendly spirit in which it was offered. The Opposition do not object to action being taken against the particular organization at which the Bill is aimed. The Prime Minister has said that there is no trade union in Australia which advocates violence and the spoliation of property. We endorse that view,, and I would point out that if any such organization did advocate such a policy its registration under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act could be cancelled. That, therefore, does away with the Prime Minister's argument against the adoption of this amendment. Any trade . union which advocated violence or the spoliation of property could have its trade union certificate cancelled, and it would then come within the scope of this Bill. As to the Prime Minister's statement that the Government have, under the War Precautions Act, all the' powers they Eequire in this direction, I would point out that any man proceeded against under that Act has the right to defend himself.

If the waterside workers were out on strike, and the carriage of foodstuffs were being prevented by the laying up of shipping, honourable gentlemen opposite might say that the union was endangering the lives of men at the Front, and, on that or some other pretext, have it declared an unlawful association. When the Amalgamated Miners Association, at BrokenH ill , struck for a forty-four hours week, was of advantage to the companies. the Prime Minister denounced them as being in receipt of German pay, and said that the lives of the men at the Front were being endangered because they were hindering the supply of munitions. Had the proposed provision then been law, the Amalgamated Miners Association would have been declared an unlawful association. I have never been connected with the Industrial Workers of the World, and have no sympathy with either its propaganda or its methods, and the union of which I had the honour to be president for a considerable time, is opposed to the organization. member a member of the Industrial Workers of the World when the Amalgamated Miners Association broke it up? a member of tbe Industrial Workers of the World, though during the election campaign lying circulars were published by those supporting the present Government asserting the contrary. orable member been a member of the Amalgamated Miners Association? arrived in BrokenH ill , in 1911. I have never been a member of any organization but a recognised trade union. I have the honour to belong to the Waterside Workers Union, of which the Prime Minister was once a member, though he is not so now. I have no desire to protect the Industrial Workers of the World, or any organization advocating the destruction of property or life, but I do not trust the Prime Minister or his Government in this matter. I fear that they wish to secure power which will enable them to strain the law as the Defence Act was strained by them prior to the conscription referendum, and thus to declare an unlawful association any trade union whose members may be out on strike, no matter how damnable their conditions or how good their cause. It may even be that the union has been forced out by the employers. When the BrokenH ill strike, to which I have referred, took place, it . benefited the employers by enabling them to work off their surplus supply of lead and spelter, and the share list published in Sydney by Messrs. Joseph Palmer and Sons at the time showed that the strike, kind of the union to strike. you start a fire you cannot control it. That upheaval was beneficial to the men as well as to the companies. The Prime Minister has asked whether we think that if the Industrial Workers of the World changed its name it should no longer be pursued, and added that any organization that adopted similar methods should be dealt with. The honourable member for Hindmarsh, in the course of his amusing discourse on liberty, stated that if trade unions were to adopt what he considered to be the objects of the Industrial Workers of the World they should come under the Bill. If the provision to which we object be not amended, the Government will have power to declare any association an unlawful association. If miners were on strike, it might be alleged that they were destroying property by allowing water to accumulate in the mines, and other bodies of men could be brought within the Bill under similar pretexts. If the object r f the Government is to protect life and property, why is the Bill to operate only until six months after the war? Is there to be no protection after that time?

Apparently, however, Ministers know what a storm of protest would be raised were they to apply the War Precautions Act to a bona fide trade union which happened to be out on strike. Consequently, under cover of the feeling that has been created against the Industrial Workers of the World, this B ill has been introduced to empower the Government to deal in another way with the trade unions. Possibly one of its objects is to forestall action by the trade unions in opposition to an attempt to foist conscription on the country without a referendum. Possibly thab is the object of the B ill . If the Government will accept the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, the objections to the measure will vanish; but I can see no other object in this subclause c unless, either trade unions as a whole, or an individual trade union, is aimed at. I arrive at that conclusion for the reason that there is a sort of concerted attack on the trend of evolution in the industrial movement of this country at the present time. It was only the other week that Mr Beeby made an attack, not on the Industrial Workers of the World, but on the trade union movement, which is abandoning the old craft method of organization, and attempting t'o organize itself on industrial lines in the way of forming larger and more powerful bodies. Mr Beeby, in his attack, accused the trade unionists of this country of utilizing the latter form of organization for the purpose of imposing a sort of industrial tyranny on the people; and it appears to me that much the same idea must be behind this clause. Sub-clauses a and 6 give the Government authority to proclaim any association, which, by its constitution or propaganda, advocates or encourages, or incites or in stigates to the taking or endangering of human life, or the destruction or in ju ry of property. unions do that ? apply to them ? lieve thafc no union does such a thing that I wish unions fco be exempt. ply to unions how can it affect them f ago, when the Prime Minister was busy writing, I pointed out thafc this provision referring to the endangering of human life, could, under certain circumstances, be construed in a manner to suit the Governmenb of the day. For instance, if the miners went on strike at BrokenH ill , and the mines were in danger of being swamped with water, the question would arise whether, by leaving the mines, the men were causing the destruction of or in j u r y to property. If such were the desire or intention of the Government, the Governor General could, for the purpose of breaking the strike, declare fche Amalgamated Miners Association an unlawful one. say that what you are now saying is perfectly absurd. your attention to the fact thab when Mr. Justice Higgins was engaged in the Arbitration Court over the forty-four hours' strike, and the Ministerf or Defencei n tervened with a memorandum, and camA -to a certain agreement with the mining company and the men, His Honour stated that it did not matter whafc Senator Pearce meant by the memorandum, but that all depended on what he had written. It will be seen that, in the last analysis, Mr Justice Higgins decided whafc Senator Pearce meant. it matter what we put in the Bill? Mr. Justice Higgins, according to you, will do just as he likes. ister himself says that trade unions do nofc advocate undesirable action, and are nofc aimed at, what is the objection to exempting them from the provisions of the B ill 1 This clause, to my mind, is the key-note of the whole measure.

I am reading my own report. The people who are supporting honourable members opposite are those who to-day are doing their level best to place the Industrial Workers of the World on a sound footing, not only in the pastoral industry, but in the mining and waterside industries. The Prime Minister laughs, but I ask him: Who subsidized Packer's organization in Victoria? It was fostered and subsidized by 'the employers of that State, and Packer was merely the dupe and tool of the Employers Federation. In connection with the pastoral industry, the squatters decided that it would be a fine thing to break the Australian Workers Union, and immediately started the Machine Shearers Union, which was subsidized with large sums of money by persons unknown, of course. The union printed balance-sheets in which those large sums were described as subscriptions. When two sheds in the Moree district, one ab Burren Junction and another in the. ""New England district, were manned with Industrial Workers of the World last year, what can one infer? The employers knew that the men were Industrial Workers of the World before they arrived at the sheds I support the amendment, because the It is quite in the interests of the pastoralists to break the Australian Workers Union, and I assure honourable members that the pastoralists do not look very carefully at the weapons they use in effecting their purpose. Probably many honourable members opposite would be only too pleased to see some of the organizations broken up.

The personnel of the party over which he presides is directly anti-democratic, and anti-everything for the betterment of the working classes.

He gives us the assurance that the Bill is not aimed at trade unions, and I can see no reason why the amendment which insures it cannot be inserted. founded on the principle of equity. When a man joins a union he shares equally in its burdens and its benefits. On the other hand, our social system is not founded on equity. Consequently there is conflict between organized labour'and capital, and it will always continue until our social sysassociation. There are 50,000 men entem is founded on equity. It will be the easiest thing in the world to bring a trade union within the ambit of the Act which the Bill seeks to' amend. A simple disagreement with an employer would do so. The Seamen's Union, with which I am connected, has been one of the most law abiding bodies in the Commonwealth since it was formed. It has always abided by its industrial agreements. However, some eighteen months ago, the then Minister for the Navy chose to issue a regulation which enforced more work on the members of that union than they were supposed to do under the industrial agreement which controlled their labours. The members of the union affected immediately ceased work, and orders were issued to place them under arrest; but, happily, the men had the right to refuse to work, because they were off the articles of the ship; they had not signed any agreement. Tbat did not stop the Minister from forcing naval reservists into the particular vessel fo take the place of the trade unionists, and it was only the action of the officials of the union in asking the Department of the Navy to get Mr Justice Higgins to arbitrate upon the matter that prevented one of the biggest strikes in the history of Australia. Had that strike taken place, and had the provisions of this Bill been in operation, the union would have been declared an unlawful association, and all its members would have been brought within the ambit of the Act. It is our anxiety to prevent such a possibility. assist in winning the war. No one can say that organized labour in Australia has not done as well as others in this direction. Australia could not have conducted the war on the scale on which it has been conducted if it had not been for organized labour. The greatest difficulty that the unions have is the suppression of the element at which this Bill is aimed. Mr Wallace. We are in accord with the Government on that matter. We say, "" Yes, crush this element ' ' ; but we ask that the trade unions shall be safeguarded. If trade unions commit, offences against the Arbitration Act, there are ways and means of getting Labour organizations are at us; but if this Bill is brought into operation it will be the easiest thing in the world to declare trade unions unlawful associations. The Postmaster-General admits that a partial cessation of work would bring a union within tlie ambit of this Bill, and have it declared an unlawful gaged in transport work in connection with the war. If half-a-dozen of those men choose to knock off work, what will prevent the Government holding the organization responsible, and declaring it to be an unlawful association? the half-dozen men misleading you? could bring the union into trouble under this Bill. They can lead a. union into a position in which-the officials of the union would not know whether the men were controlling the organization or whether the organization was controlling them until such time as a meeting could be held of all the members. That would take two or three days, during which time a vote would have to be taken.' It is necessary to cease work to vote, and if there is a cessation of work for the purpose of holding a poll, the conclusion is at once drawn that the whole society is-out on strike, and that would bring it within the ambit of this measure honourable member to say that half-a-dozen members of the union can create a strike without consulting the union? known the Minister to take action on his own account at times, and then go to his Cabinet and ask for its blessing on his action. The same thing may occur in a trade union. We are quite prepared to I protest against this Bill. It is brought in to be detrimental to trade unions. The underlying purpose is to bring the unions within the ambit of the Unlawful Associations Act. I do not think there is any doubt about the matter.

Under the Arbitration Acti t is impossible to get before the Arbitration Court unless a dispute is created. The organization must first submit an affidavit to the President of the Arbitration Court stating that a dispute is likely to occur in, three or four States. If it shows that a strike is premeditated, the Governor General can immediately proclaim that organization an unlawful association The very law of the country forces the union to commit a crime against the Arbitration Act before it can go before the Arbitration Court. Thus we are treading on very thin ice in agreeing to the Bill before us. Before measures are' introduced for the purpose of bringing the unions to subjection, there should be more equitable laws that the organizations may observe. If the Arbitration Act were amended, giving better facilities for getting to the Arbi-tration Court, it would prevent industrial strife, and there would be no need for me to be asked whether five or six members of a union could create a strike. There would no longer be need for it The Prime Minister knows as much about the matter as I do. He may give the assurance that the Bill is not aimed at trade unions, but he would not ask me to go for a voyage to the Old Country without first signing articles of agreement. We want this agreement in black and white. Minister may not always be Prime Minister. He may find it necessary to leave Australia, leaving some one in his place, and in those circumstances his word would not be worth anything; just as the word of the captain who leaves his vessel at the first port is not binding on his successor. If the Bill is not intended to affect trade unions, why cannot the amendment be accepted? That is all we ask. We are anxious to make certain that it will not affect trade unions. If the amendment is not accepted, we are satisfied that the Bill is intended to hit the trade unions, and that this is only the first move of what we were threatened with prior to the elections. As pointed out by an honourable member the other day, trade unions did more to defeat conscription than any other section of the community, so possibly it is the intention of the measure to bring trade unions to that point that if conscription is again introduced they will be powerless to raise a hand against it . ter and Attorney-General) [7.59] -We have listened to what may be said to be the most outrageous and impudent state-' ments and distortions of the truth that it has ever been the lot of unfortunate man to hear.

They may do very well in. places where such statements are hatched for consumption by a too credulous people; but they will serve no purpose here. The statements made by the honourable member for West Sydney, although in a different category, are open to similar criticism. There is no escape from the position which I lay down: that either the unions must contemplate the destruction of life and property, or they are wholly excluded from the operation of this Bill. I have given the assurance that The Prime the Government will not apply this provision to trade unions. . What would be the position if I were to accept the amendment? Let me show how utterly futile it is in the face of existing facts. It provides that no organizationshall be declared an unlawful association by any notice published by the Governor General without the consent of Parliament. How is the Parliament at present constituted? Whetheri t be admitted or not, the fact is that whatever this Government proposes becomes law, and can be made law within an hour ^of its introduction.

Undoubtedly that is so. The powers of the Government at the pre sent time are unlimited. Therefore there is no need for this Bill. There is not a line of ifc which adds in any way to the powers that the Government can exercise at the present time.

No man may, under the ordinary laws of the country, incite with impunity to acts of war, or to the performance of criminal acts against life and property. A measure of this kind was not necessary at all, and the Bill means nothing. It is a piece of political fly-paper, greatest troubles that the country ever introduced to create discussion and to rivet public attention, the time of Parliament being occupied by its consideration while more important matters stand aside. When the original Act. was introduced it was specifically laid down that nothing was to be done but by the will of Parliament and under the law. There must be an accusation, a trial, and proof of the offence; but, under the new provision, it is left to two or three men to decide whether an organization is criminal or not, practically without trial. IfI had had my way, there would not have been a single word of discussion, for I would not afford the Government an opportunity of saying that the party on this side opposed the measure in any shape or form. The Bill, however, is a sham, a fraud, and a delusion. On the face of it, the Bill seems a very atrocious one; but I am not in the least afraid of it. It is not really a coercion Bill, but merely pretends to be one. It does not mean to intimidate anybody, and it will hurt no one. The coercion introduced by the honourable member for Flinders was the genuine thing; but, as I say, the measure before us is only intended to frighten people, and does not mean anything. effect is to give the Industrial Workers of the World the greatest advertisement it ever had, and the measure is absolutely worthless paper. It is an excellent subject on which to have four, or five hours' discussion, and the Government are only grieved that it will not occupy the attention of the Chamber for another five or six days. attention of Parliament riveted on a few more non-essentials, it would not be so evident that they are absolutely stranded for Win-the-war legislation. opportunity is afforded on the present occasion to the Prime Minister for working off some of his old phrases and terms of denunciation. gentleman has forgotten many of these; but. that beautiful little thing of his Mr Anstey. about the objects ""bred on the dungheap,"" and .the other one about the "" sewer rats,"" would have read very nicely in to-morrow morning's newspaper.

A man or woman who is a British subject from any part of the Empire, and who does anything contrary to law in any part of the Empire, should be proceeded against in the ordinary way, given a fair trial, and, if convicted, punished. I see no reason to distinguish Englishmen, Irishmen, and Scotchmen in favour of Australian-born subjects when it is a matter of breaking the law of the land.

The amendment of the Prime Minister in the previous clause does make that clause appear better, but it still leaves it in the hands of the Government to deal with a trade union which is on strike, though it delays the operation in order to first secure the de-registration of the union.

If the honourable member were to succeed in getting the words "" natural-born British subject born in Australia"" omitted, he would remove the protection which the law now gives to British subjects born-in Australia.

351,Mr Lynch (Werriwa) [9.3],"Th eare other considerations which should come under our notice, but the silos proposed to be erected ought to form parti of a comprehensive scheme of bulk handling. Even though the cost of the system of silo storage may be very considerable, and falls upon us at a time when we can least afford to bear it , still it is essential in order to give effect to a bulk handling scheme, or at least the principles of the scheme. Farmers may differ as to exactly what action the Federal Government should take in the matter of permanent storage, but the vast majority of them are agreed that we must go on and deal with it now. ThoughI believe in the principles of bulk handling I feel that owing to the difficulty confronting the wheat-grower in Australia at the present time, and the insecure feeling in the minds of many people as to whether Australia will be able to continue increasing the area under wheat, and specializing in wheat-growing, we should carefully examine the scheme and see just exactly what are its defects. Thus while giving effect to its principles in a modified form to the extent of providing for storage of one-third of the normal crop, we may conduct some experiment in regard to bulk handling before entirely departing from the old system. It must not be forgotten that while the farmers will be called upon to pay about £300,000 a year for the storage of one-third of the crop, the care of the greater part of the remainder for which storage is not now available in the shape of adequate sheds or other protection will fall upon the farmers. Therefore I should like to see in this Bill some provision by which a liberal arrangement can be made to assist the farmers in taking cooperative action to deal with this remaining two-thirds of the crop. Since the pooling system, notwithstanding its many defects-defect s not in principle, but in details of administration-is apparently going to stay, it is hardly fair, think it may be said with perfect safety if I understand the position aright, that the responsibility of providing this adequate and all-necessary storage for the bulk of the crop should remain an additional charge on the growers. If we are to continue the pooling system, if we are to continue systems, as I hope they will be continued, of the Commonwealth and the States agreeing to guarantee at least a fair price to the actual producers of wheat-if such principles are to be given effect to in the future and some system of Commonwealth and State co-operative marketing is to be introduced, it will be essential, as an honourable member put it last night, to provide a plan by which we may retain, not only in the interest of the producers, but in the interest of the consumers also, a portion of each crop until another crop looms up. As a man who is almost entirely dependent upon the actual work of wheat-growing, I believe that the majority of wheat-growers would be willing, in return for that concession from the general community, to make concessions, not only in regard to this reserve, which I think ought to be established and maintained, but also, in consequence of the community, as it were, guaranteeing them against absolute loss in the work of production, in regard to ""fixing at least a payable productive price to the grower. I believe that just now it is very hard to determine what the future outlook of the wheat-grower'may be. ""We know perfectly well that the freight problem will remain with us for many years after the war is ended. ""We know that the Australian grower, being the most distant competitor, is already heavily handicapped. I am afraid that, as a result of'this deadly war, teeming millions of people throughout the world will have their standards of living lowered, and it may be that many of the markets hitherto open to us will be closed because of breadless people being compelled again to revert to vegetable substitutes for wheat bread. ""We know, too, that it is extremely likely in the old countries that never again will the authorities allow their arable lands to go out of production whilst the danger of war threatens them; that never again will they allow themselves to become so wholly dependent upon foreign foodstuffs. Therefore, I that the Australian wheat-grower has no certainty of being able to maintain himself as a prosperous producer. I do not think that, at this stage, we should put a very great handicap upon him in consequence of the dangers which certainly threaten. ""We know perfectly well that if State guarantees are to be given they cannot be given at a price which is far ahead of what the world's markets may show -wheat to be worth. All that we can hope for is that the Federal and State Governments, in endeavouring to preserve this important industry, may use every legitimate means to cheapen all the requisites of wheat production, to cheapen as far as it is humanly possible the marketing facilities both at Home and abroad. can reduce the middleman's profit to a minimum. providing advances to farmers at lower rates than can be obtained by co-operative or individual action, they may be able to maintain a guaranteed maximum price, which would exceed the price obtainable under the old order if it were .re-instituted after the war. Honourable members will see that the community, whilst taking a responsibility in connection with the guaranteeing of a minimum price, must not be discouraged by any rapacious attempt on the part of us farmers to obtain more than we are legitimately entitled to. I think that in so acting we would only be destroying our hope of the development of the big principles which are exemplified in the pooling scheme, and from which, notwithstanding its many defects in administration, we as a class have benefited immeasurably. parent to anybody that if we were to insist upon 4s. per bushel being guaranteed to the grower, and the price were to go back even to the average price obtained by us in normal times, the community would be called upon-with a £40,000,000 crop such as we had in 1915-16-to face a deficit of anything from £8,000,000 to £10,000,000. I am sure that the common sense of the farmers will not allow their cause to be placed in such an untenable position. Whilst it is the most difficult thing in the world to get even a number of practical farmers to agree as to what the actual cost of wheat production is, yet we know to what extent the wheat industry flourished before the war and what prices were obtained. WhilstI quite agree with many of my class that it is easy to show that under existing conditions-with all the requisites to farming work so dear and with the cost piling up in every direction-we require a tremendous price per bushel to grow wheat, still the average farmer will be content tb make his calculation on average conditions and not to put forward demands based upon abnormal conllr. ditions which would prove the industry to be utterly unprofitable. The average price which farmers in New South Wales received for their wheat for the ten years immediately preceding the war was 3s. 8£d. f.o.b. That, it was calculated, was equal, on the average, to They about 3s. 4d. per bushel on railj and, as the average crop was under 12 bushels to In that way, and also by the acre, a great number of farmers managed, at all events, to live when they obtained an even lower price. Having regard to the fact that out of that return of 3s. 4d. per bushel on rail the cost of road cartage-which , on the average, would amount to from 2d. to 3d. per bushelas well as the cost of bags, twine, and farm implements, which represented no inconsiderable sum, had to be provided, it must be apparent that wheat-growers were actually producing wheat on the farm for about 2s. 9d. per bushel. In many instances the net Teturn was even less. I do not say it was a payable price. It was not. Then, again, a large proportion of 1 that wheat was produced by share farmers, so that the actual work of tillagethe putting in and taking off of the crop, It must be apwithout the attendant expenses of marketing-wa s done on the average by such men for less than Is. 6d. per bushel. While it was not a payable price, we, nevertheless, made.much progress in wheat-farming during those years. Failures were many, and if the present abnormal prices for all farming requisites continue, I dare say failures will be numberless. Under this new system, which, I hope, will be of effective benefit to the farmers, I trust we shall not spoil our case by asking for too much. The difficulties that confronted the wheat-grower during those years weTe very great, but, as I have said, we made some progress. I believe it is possible for Governments to interpose for the farmer's protection, and to bring about a condition of affairs thab will at least enable him to advance still further, and to provide for the development of that new production to which we are all looking for-' ward, even in connection with wheat-raising, as one of the means by which we may meet the tremendous obligations incurred during the war. I believe that the Government proposal to begin the work Lynch. of providing permanent storage is a sound one. The cost of providing adequate protection for the bulk of the crop, and, perhaps, for even more than a year, may have to be undertaken. The tax upon the farmer which this measure w ill involve will be considerable. It w ill represent about £2 Is. Ss. per 1,000 bags of wheat, up to a production of 50,000,000 bags. That is a very considerable amount, especially when we add to it , as we must, the cost of supplying adequate means for the storage and stacking of the bulk of the crop. Whilst the general principles of silo storage are endorsed by experts, the system is one of which the average farmer has had very little practical experience. I would ask the Ministeri n charge of this B ill to carefully consider whether some provision should not be made, by arrangement with the States, for assistance in the storage of the greater quantity of our qrop. . The responsibility is one which, I presume, w ill rest also upon the grower. I am personally aware that much member not think, as a practical farmer, qf the loss suffered during the disastrous that the Government are justified in time that we have had our wheat stored, testing the principle by providing for silo for the most part, in the open, has been storage ? due to the storage conditions being of the most primitive character. Where millions of bags of wheat are grown, it is efficiency and cheapness of the system is necessary to provide afc railway stations, concerned, the bulk handling of wheat has especially in flab country, raised foundagone beyond the experimental stage.

Honourable members will have the words of those witnesses before them very shortly; bub I may be permitted to say that to arrive at the exact cost of producing a bushel of wheat is a most difficult problem. will probably agree with wfiat I said yesterday, that the Australian consumer should get his wheat cheaper than he is getting it to-day. majority of my brother farmers are against me, I have advocated throughout that if the community is to go on pledging itself-for that is what it is doing by the pool system-to provide advances, and above all, to insure a payable productive price on the farm, which is essential to the development of our wheat industry, the wheat farmers must be prepared to give the community a quid pro quo. We cannot afford to treat the masters of the parental Governments, who institute such systems for our benefit and protection, as though tbey were foreigners. Receiving concessions from them we must give them concessions in return. when they f u l l y understand the matter, the vast majority of our farmers will be only too willing to do that. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has asked me what is the cost of producing a bushel of wheat. fore I could answer the honourable member, although I claim to be a practical man, ib would be necessary for him to tell me where the wheat is to be grown, and if I had a knowledge of the local conditions, I might then be able to give him someidea of the cost of producing a bushel of wheat in that locality. You may have two men of equal capacity farming equal areas of land in different districts with equal plants. They may put an equal amount of labour into the work, and continue farming the same areas for three, four, or five years, and, under the system of averages, the wheat production by one of these men might other. One may be operating in a district in which failures occur only once in ten, twelve, or fourteen years, and the other in a district in which three or four failures may occur in that period. The lost labour, the higher cost of horse I have assisted in the feed and other accessories, will all tend fco make the cost of production greater in the one case than in the other. Though this is, perhaps, beside the question, I must say that it is a very foolish policy to endeavour to grow wheat in very poor districts, no matter how apparently cheap the land in those districts is, whilst we have immeasurable areas of good fertile land capable, under ordinary conditions and treatment, of producing infinitely better crops than can be produced from the poorer land. I trust that this question of wheat storage will be pushed on with, and that committees of practical men will be consulted in regard to all thafc may be necessary to protect the coming crop. I believe that even if the Government got to work at once only a very small portion of the com ing crop could be placed in the silos. If the r pooling system is to continue, and I hope it will, and if the concessions which the public will demand, and which I believe the farmers will be found willing to give, . are given, the whole cost, either of the silos or of providing adequate storage within sheds or in the open, should not fall upon the producers alone. ThisI believe that might well be regarded as a great national work, required for the security and well-being of all, and a fair contribution, towards its cost ought to be made from the public funds. All sorts of estimates have been given of the destruction Beof wheat by mice, but no one can say accurately what the damage will u l t imately prove to be, and we do not know how much the coming crop will be affected.

South Wales farms they are nibbling everything except the mortgages. Thousands of acres of fche best crops"" were levelled last year by hailstorms, not a grain being harvested; but there has been such a tremendous growth of clover that the mice have been provided with a limitless food supply. Therefore it is hard to say whether the removal of the wheat stacks will put an end to the plague. Mice are being trapped in tens of thousands upt far from my farms. Yet they are still in swarms, destroying our reserves of hay, and providing an argument against many of the accepted theories about storing. I am afraid that in the coming season the mice plague will be worse than it is now. I mention the matter to show the need for better protection with sheet iron, and foundations o.t concrete, or raised earthen embankments and floors of macadam or concrete.

The Government should not impose too heavy a burden on the wheat-growers in connection with the erection of silos, bufc should afford adequate and timely assistance, using its resources to provide the materials necessary for the proper protection of the wheat. I am in favour of the bulk-handling of wheat, but, because In some of the New of the present uncertainty, and of the financial difficulties which confront the farming class, I think thafc we should ""hasten slowly"" in that matter. In the opinion of the majority of experts, bulkhandling is the best system; but for the moment we should concentrate our energies on the difficulties which confront us, and it w ill tax our resources to adequately % deal with them. I shall not deal with this question from the farmers-' point of view, but as the representative of a large constituency I am interested in knowing where the Government intends to get the money which ib is to advance to the Statesa sum which, we are told, will amount to nearly £3,000,000 .

Of course, I have a general idea as to how the silos will be formed Possibly the ground portion will be of concrete, and as to that there will be no difficulty; but if galvanized iron is to be used for the upper structure, it must be rememI f the whole of Tasmania bered that that commodity is now £ 7 2 fco £80 a ton, whereas before the war it was from £ 1 9 to £ 2 1 per ton, and that it can scarcely be obtained at any price. Of course, it will be seen that if the necessary material cannot be obtained, our object in passing the measure will be defeated. We are told that the States cannot obtain money for the purpose of duplicating railway lines, which are required for the carriage of wheat, and this Government was elected for the purpose of curtailing expenditure. Y e t one of their first proposals is to have a vast expenditure in regard to which we are asked to vote in the dark. Never was a proposal of the kind made with so-little information available, and it would appear that Parliament is losing its control over the finances. ' I do notsay that the silos will not be of any benefit, because I think that, 'with their aid, after the war we shall be able to store so much wheat that the gentlemen I do not diswifch brass plates, who are so anxious to look after the farmers, will not be able to rig the market. If ' we had 'proper storage arrangements, we should always have in Australia at least twelve months' supply of wheat, or the means of knowing twelve months ahead what wheat we had, either growing or in store-a n important consideration in a country so subject to droughts.

I desire to supplement very briefly the remarks I sought to make this morning in regard to my reasons for saying that I believed the overseas vote had been manipulated in the distribution."" The Minister for Home and Territories suggested that I had not facts to support my statement. I wish to submit the only facts that' are at my disposal, and they are the newspaper returns of the election figures. Not for one moment do I impugn the honesty of the administration. Never have.,I suggested that the honourable member for Angas is in any way responsible for anything that may have taken place. Every member of the House, and especially members on this side, believe that the honourable member would not associate himself with any maladministration of the Act, but I shall submit reasons for my belief that the overseas vote was not properly distributed. Perth is credited with 3,119 votes; Brisbane, 2,885; Fawkner, 2,626; and Fremantle, 2,461. Those four constituencies received the highest number of oversea votes; all the others received under 2,000, and some under 1,000. ""WhilstI believe that Brisbane has done its share well in regard to enlistment, yet if one adds to the 2,885 votes the men who have returned, the men who have been killed or are missing, and the men who could not vote-becaus e there must have been a percentage of men who could not vote-on e must conclude that Brisbane did remarkably well, so well indeed that some other districts show up in a very bad light. Having regard to what was done in other capital cities, either Brisbane did very much more than its share or other capital cities ha.ve been very remiss in tbeir enlistments. For instance, the average for South Sydney and ""West Sydney-the only two contested divisions of that city-wa s 1,674. The total for Melbourne was 2,050; for Hindmarsh, 1,960; Boothby, 1,912; Denison, 1,150; and Perth, 3,119; and for the two divisions of Brisbane the average was 2,3S0. Those figures show either that Brisbane and Perth have had remarkable success in their enlistments or-as , in my opinion, is the case-the y have been credited with many more votes than they are entitled to. I am confirmed in that impression by the fact that the figures shown in the country divisions .are not at all comparable. For instance, ""the honourable member for Lilley would not agree that only 1,726 men enlisted from that division, and nobody who knows the district would suggest that its enlistments were less than those of Brisbane to the extent of 1,100. Again, the honourable member for Moreton would not admit that only 1,374 men went from his division. actual votes to do with the enlistments? my statement that the votes were manipulated in their distribution. I do not for a moment believe £hat Brisbane enlisted proportionately 1,500 more men than did the Moreton district.. If we look at the divisions represented by Ministers, we find that Bendigo received 1,344 votes; Parramatta, 1,401; Bass, '937; Gwydir, 1,437; Angas, 871; Balaclava, 1,601; and Darling Downs, 1,650; or an average for. the seven contested Ministerial seats of 1,320. I cannot believe that the recruiting figures for Brisbane and Perth were so absolutely superior to those of other divisions. I find that Flinders received 1,830 votes; and Henty, 1,571. The constituency represented by the Leader of the Opposition was credited with 1,613 votes, but no one will contend that that figure nearly, represents the number of enlistments ih the Yarra electorate. double that number of men to the front. They pay allotment money to the dependants of more soldiers than that, number from one post office in the district. man in the street infer from thesefigures? the comparison was wrongly made. conviction, and I am not alone in that conviction, that if they had known a few",55,Wheat Storage Bill Second Reading

Here is my suggestion as to how the difficulty arose:' I may be wrong, but it is. the only explanation that can satisfy me, in view of the fact that I do not think the officers were responsible for any tricks. I suggest that the officers who counted those votes, or allotted them on the other side, could not have known the divisions intimately enough to be aware of the boundaries, and that the votes were allotted according to the addresses given by the soldiers. It is quite probable that must take it that the honourable member a large number of men who came to Brisnow withdraws the observations he made bane and enlisted there gaye as their last night. a matter of fact, Enoggera is not in Brispersions. bane at all, but is in Lilley. The same remark could be applied to Albion, as a honourable member now assumes that the postal address, although Albion is not in Act has not worked as satisfactorily in Brisbane division, but in Lilley. Some the allotment of the votes to the various enlisted from South Brisbane,' and the divisions as the honourable member deproper postal address would be ""Mornsired. The Act provided that the votes ingside, Brisbane,"" or "" Wynnum, Briswere to be allotted according to the adbane."" But neither of these places is in dresses of the men on the naval or miliBrisbane. This is shown by the fact tary roll. The honourable member will that Oxley division only shows something remember that the vote was not according like an enlistment of 1,876, or 1,000 less to the enrolment. than Brisbane. I do not claim that Brisgiven to men twenty-one years of age, and bane did 1,000 better than Oxley, or 1,100 entitled to be on the roll, whether they better than Lilley, or 1,500 better than were or not. That excluded the possiMoreton. allotted according to the postal addresses because the class of voter abroad was not given by the men, and that was not the limited to persons enrolled on divisions. correct basis for allotment. I hope, Speaking from memory, I think that, at . therefore, .that if any subsequent' poll is the time the referendum was taken, sometaken under similar circumstances, this thing like 20,000 men could not say for will not occur again. I claim that the what division they were enrolled; so it men's vote should be allotted to the diviwas decided to adopt the principle which sions in which they live, as residence the House sanctioned. there is the qualification for enrolment. If this had been done in the recent election, I am sure that the figures for Brisofficers could allot those 20,000 votes bane and Perth would have been differwhere they chose. ent. I have nothing more to say, other than that I hope that care will be taken the errors that were possible under the to see that there is more nearly a proper referendum voting; but which, as it was and true distribution of the overseas vote in any subsequent poll that may be taken. Home and Territories) [10.35] I understand that the honourable member has changed the tone of his address to-night, because I gathered from' his previous remarks that he held the view that there had been a deliberate manipulation of the vote. To-night, the honourable member takes the stand that there was some blunder, and that the Act itself was wrong. In the Act, machinery .was provided for the"" appointment of scrutineers to allot the votes to certain districts.

412,Mr Glynn,"I am now dealing with the result. In order to secure absolute fairness at the last election, some one representing the Leader of the Opposition was nominated to act as scrutineer. Mr the divisions. The honourable member McGrath, a member of the party, was chosen,, and Mr Downer was nominated by the Prinie Minister under the terms of the Act, to act as scrutineer on behalf of the Ministerial candidates. These scrutineers were,or could be, present from day to day. They saw all that was being done, and, when the work was completed, certified that the scrutiny was conducted in accordance with the Act. A communication to that effect was sent by both scrutineers; but it has not reached Mr polled by the soldiers in the divisions. Downer, however, signed this telegram, which is now being sent out in connection with other correspondenceWe certify that the checking, allocation, scrutiny, and counting in connection with the recent Conunonwealth elections have been conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral (War Time) Act, and the Regulations thereunder. That is a sufficient assurance as to the bona fides, at all events, of the allotment of the vote. The honourable member also mentioned last night that ithere were some votes in his district allotted to the wrong. party and he complained about recounts, T as if recounts in two br three districts were made in order to find outl what the soldiers' votes in those districts, were, and what number would be required to turn the scale. counts in Brisbane, Macquarie, and Moreton were carried out on the initiative of the Chief Electoral Officer. He. has a statutory discretion under the Act, but if the voting is reasonably close in any districts he is obliged, to have a recount! in those districts. It was discovered in the recount in the case of Brisbane that about thirty votes from one polling place had been given wrongly to Mr Plane, the opponent of the honourable member. Therefore the recount, which was, according to the honourable member, carried out with ihe sinister object of ascertaining whether the Ministerialists were in danger, actually brought out the fact that the honourable member had been practically deprived of thirty votes which should have been tssigned to him. votes a week before the officers did. [14=3 Brisbane, undoubtedly a number of soldiers' votes in excess of the average for must remember that all members of the Australian Imperial Force over twenty-one years of age were entitled to vote, and , naturally a considerable number were not on the electoral rolls, while many had assigned their places of residence, not according to their permanent, residences, but according to .the places where they had spent a month or six weeks just before enlisting. . The result has been that in Fremantle? for instance, there was a considerable number in excess of the average not give their parents' residences, but gave the places in which they had resided for a month' or three months before enlisting. In the case of Brisbane there were 2,885 votes as against Batman with 1,83*1 and Angas, which the honourable member quoted, with between 800 and 900 votes. The anomaly in regard to Angas might be explained by the fact that there is a considerable number of men of alien origin in that electorate-somethin g like 8,000 or 9,000 Germans-whic h fact might have had an effect on the number of men at the Front. The figures in regard to Macquarie-on e of the districts in which a recount took place -ar e 1,002. If one motive in having a recount was fo endeavour to strengthen the position of ithe Ministerialists by a manipulation of the soldiers' votes, how is As a matter of fact, the reit that there were only 1,002 votes for Macquarie, a number which is considerably 'under ithe average of the divisional voting of the soldiers, while in the other case the number was nearly three times greater than there? I cannot see how the honourable member's common sense should have allowed him to assume that there was some deliberate manipulation of the soldiers' votes. Tonight he says that nothing of the sort took place, but I can tell the honourable member that everything was done under the legislation passed to meet the difficult circumstances presented by the counting of the votes of the men at the Front. No other system would have given an approximation of a reasonable estimation of the feeling of the soldiers in relation to the electoral districts.

Ministerf or .the Navy) [10.49] I wish to add one word to what has been said by my colleague, just to complete the chain of evidence which destroys completely the allegations made by the honourable member for Brisbane last night and to-night. We have heard the word ""manipulation"" trip from the tongue of the honourable member very glibly during the tlwo days. marvel that he raises ithe matter at all, so far as it affects Brisbane. if I had received such a political smack in the eye as he has received I should not have paraded it before the House and the countiy as he insists on doing. ever, he has his own method of doing things, and does not seem to mind parading the fact before the counttry that he represents a minority of the voters of Brisbane. fchat the Labour vote in Brisbane was about 700 below the National vote at the recent election. that the National senators polled 700 appointed at the result, but I regard M l votes or thereabouts more than the LaMahon's bour senators did. several hundred votes above the votes obhad troubled to send literature to the soltained by the highest National senator. thereby, another bifc of wonderment is started. What manipulating did the honourable member do to get those votes above those of his fellows? Was there any manipulation in Brisbane? sonal qualifications, no doubt. that there may have been manipulation in Brisbane to account for the appearance of the honourable member here ? In thing for the honourable member to say about the electoral officers in Brisbane. of f a i r deduction-assumin g that, we may Certainly no error was dismake inferences in this matter-if there has been manipulation as the honourable I need add nothing member alleges, it looks as if he did a b it up there, otherwise he would have been in the same case as the senators in the Brisbane division. in Queensland are above suspicion. speaking w it h all the perkiness of a man w it h a majority of 10,000 instead ofwas iti four or five? manipulation at all, then the honourable member's own chosen representative on the other side pf the world was the manipulator, for this is what he says on this matter, and ib is the reply to the honorI able member, given in the Melbourne Herald of the 2nd June: Warrant Officer D.

McGrath, M.H.K., who, I fancy that on behalf of the Official Labour party, organized the scrutiny of the soldiers' votes in connection with the recent Commonwealth elections, referring to statements made by Mr HowHugh Mahon, formerly M.H.R. for Kalgoorlie, indignantly denied that there was any possibility of malpractice in the allocating of the soldiers' votes. There, I think, is the reply to the honourable member. The outstanding feature is ""The scrutineers appointed on behalf of the Tudor party,"" he said, ""reported to me thai everything had been fair, and. that the greatest care had been taken in allocating the votes to the electorates from which the soldiers had enlisted.' Neither party had scrutineers at the I Understand casting of the vote. Personally, I am disstatement as most unfair, in view of the impossibility of his having a knowledge ot the facts.
