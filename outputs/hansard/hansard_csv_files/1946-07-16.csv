Will the Minister investigate the activities of this firm, and the reason for its interest in Australian politics? question in order, Mr Speaker? I have heard you rule out of order many questions of similar, character. This question' is a statement of propaganda. It does not seek to elicit information on public affairs. It merely, I suggest, furnishes further evidence of the use of question time for propaganda purposes now that questions are being broadcast.

The subjecthe has no knowledge o . the matter, will e ho make inquiries about ii? the matter, ' but I understand that to call at Brisbane and pick up food for the Minister for Health has discussed the Thursday Island? new treatment with the Commonwealth health authorities. I shall bring the honby orable member's question to his notice. so by the "" Australian authorities "", this quesWOOL. Minister say whether it is true that a conference was held in Canberra last week, attended by representatives of the wool-growers and of the Government, to discuss the disposal of £7,000,000 representing the profit on wool sold to the Government of the United Kingdom? If so, were the growers' representatives satisfied with the Government's suggestion for the disposal of this fund? Are the wool growers to be given the profits to which they are entitled,.or any portion of them? Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, and myself,met representatives of the wool-growers at Canberra, and discussed with them the disposal of a sum in excess of £7,000,000 that has accumulated as the result of the operations of the Central Wool Committee. The honourable member raises a debatable point when he asks whether the wool-growers will get the benefits to which they are entitled. I could debate that question at some length, but it will be sufficient for me now to say. that I do not think that the wool-growers are entirely satisfied with the proposals put before them by the Government, as. they have made representations for some variations of the proposals to be brought before the Parliament. Legislation will tunity will then be given to discuss it, there appeared in sections of the Sydney press, and I assume also in newspapers published in other capital cities, a statement that the Dutch vessel Piet Hein had taken foodstuffs to certain northern ports, was revived in the Melbourne Herald of the 15th July, in the following terms:. CALL TO ""BLACK"" DUTCH SHIP. Who ordered the Dutch destroyer Piet Hein To-day, one week after an announcement the Netherlands East Indies Information Service that the vessel had been ordered to do tion was answered. According to the Information Service and the Dutch Consulate in Melbourne, the request came from the Australian naval authorities in Brisbane, who asked the master of the Piet Hein, then under a ""black ban "" by Australian unionists, to pick up the food. The destroyer is now on its way back to the .East Indies, and is believed to be near Darwin. Has the Minister for the Navy seen the report, and can he say whether there is any truth at all in the statement ? order a complete investigation of public statements that have been made concerning this matter, and I am able to say that there is no truth whatever in declarations which allegedly have emanated from a source described as the official spokesman for the Dutch authorities. As late as this morning I had a further check made, and I can say positively that the Australian naval authorities have no knowledge whatever of any such request as has been reported in the press having been made for the services of the Piet Hem. As evidence that such a request would have been a strange one for them to make, I point out that the naval authorities state that because no fueling facilities are available at Thursday Island, the Piet Hein carried sufficient fuel to complete the trip to Darwin without re-fuelling en route. The first reports which appeared on this subject indicated that the Piet' Hem was a mercy ship carrying foodstuffs to Thursday Island. They were proved to be wrong. Later, it was reported",14,Heart Disease

A subsequent statement was to the effect that the ship carried certain fodder supplies to Darwin for His Royal Highness the Governor General. I understand that that also is incorrect. The latest report to which the honourable member has referred is equally unfounded. RE-ESTABLISHMENT. Post-war Reconstruction aware* that many ex-servicemen, students of satisfactory standing at the Sydney University, the Teachers Training College, and other educational institutions, are now being refused re-establishment training, although on the recommendation of Post-war Reconstruction officials and the Universities Commission, they have already completed a six months' preparatory course? Further, is the Minister aware that many of these ex-servicemen have expended their deferred pay, and that cases of hardship among them have been brought to the notice of the authorities? Will he say why these men have been refused training after having been assured that they were eligible to receive it? Will some effort be made by the Department of Post-war Reconstruction to see that these men are given the opportunity to complete their training in accordance with the original assurances, and to ensure that misleading and harmful advice is not given in the future to young ex-servicemen anxious to secure training for their intended careers? any one has been refused reconstruction training under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme At the present time there are 12,000 ex-servicemen and women enjoying reconstruction training of a university character. I shall cause an examination to be made to ascertain whether any of the .complaints made by the honourable member are justified. that the Delamere, a steamer built at the Whyalla Shipyards, and which incidently-as is the case of all other ships built there-is a credit to the workers and to all concerned in the industry at the modern shipyards established at Whyalla, irrespective of the fact that members of the Opposition desire to see ship-building cease in Australia for some reason best known to themselves able member may not, during the asking of a question, debate the ship-building industry, or traverse the views of those who favour or oppose its continuance. mere l if t a cargo of cement from Davenport, Tasmania, to South Australia, will the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping ascertain whether it is possible for that vessel to be then directed to Port Kembla and to take to South Australia a full cargo of galvanized iron and other building materials so urgently required for the building industry in that State? very deep interest the honourable member has taken in the matter of securing for South Australia adequate supplies of building materials. I shall discuss with my colleague the Minister for Supply and Shipping the possibility of making that vessel available in addition to those that have already been assigned for the purpose of transporting urgently required building materials to South Australia. the Army take action to. see that the committee of Army officers and departmental officials recently appointed hy him to expedite the discharges of men still in the forces carries out its duties with the least possible delay, so as to help the men concerned and the industries where employment is waiting for them ? which the honourable member has referred, which was only recently established, consists of Mr F.

Will he inquire whether thtTuggerali air strip can be used for this purpose; if it can, will he take steps to retain it with a view to meeting the needs of both growers and consumers of the crops ? that the Tuggerah air strip is one of a number of air strips which were utilized by the Royal Australian Air Force during the war.

I shall make inquiries in order to see whether the strip can be used by aircraft to bring early beans and other vegetables to market, I shall give sympathetic consideration to the honourable member's request. difficulties that are being experienced at the Launceston airport, Western Junction, and the reported opposition, of the owner of Valley Field to the use of the air-strip constructed there for the Royal Australian Air Force, will the Minister for Air have the position examined as early as possible to ascertain whether or not there is a better site closer to Launceston, such as Prospect, which could provide a permanent airport to accommodate all classes of modern aircraft?caused some temporary difficulties at Western Junction, but I am informed that the field was again in use yesterday, and also that there was no evidence to support 'the newspaper -allegation that cattle had been driven on to the airstrip at Valley Field to prevent aircraft from landing there.

As I see it, all three governments have rights to the water, the Commonwealth Government by virtue of an agreement with the State of New South Wales dating from, I think, 1910, the Government of New South Wales because the upper and middle reaches of the river are in New South Wales, and the Government of Victoria because the lower reaches of the river are in that -State. The proposal of the Government of New South Wales is that the water be diverted into the Murrumbidgee for irrigation purposes in its lower reaches. The Government of Victoria, however, claims that it should be diverted to the river Murray and that thereby a great volume of electricity could be generated. Indeed, I am informed that the volume of electricity so generated would be as great as that generated at Yallourn, and that after the generation of electricity the tvatcr could be used for irrigation in the river Murray valley itself.

Debate resumed from the 12 th July (vide page 2475), on motion by Mr That the bill be now read a second time. measure is not-only of vital importance to those engaged in the wheat industry, but also, because of the value of wheat in the Australian economy, the bill is of prime importance to all our people. It may be considered that the continuance of the industry is a matter of concern only to those engaged in it, but, of course, that is not so. This industry provides the staple food of the people, and in that respect it affects all. of the people, and provides, second only to wool, the volume of credit overseas upon which this country depends in importing some of the necessaries of every-day life. We are unable to produce rubber, petroleum, oil, drugs, tea and many other commodities, and we could not import them unless we overseas. Therefore, any course of events which resulted in diminishing our production of wheat to such an extent that nothing was left for export would adversely affect the whole economy and way of life of the Australian people. From every aspect from which the matter can be examined, this bill is one of national importance. At the outset I can only say that I am profoundly disappointed at the manner in which the measure attacks the problem of the industry. It will be interesting to traverse the history of wheat growing during the last decade or so, because all the suffering that those engaged in it could have endured has been centred in their experiences since the disastrous fall of world prices of primary products in about 1930-31. That fall threw the industry into the arena of party politics, and it has been an issue in party politics ever since. The party with which I am associated has",22,Gawler Camp

82,Mr Mcewen (Indi) [4.2],"Thisendeavoured strenuously, in office and out of office, to do those things which are designed to remove the industry from the political arena, and stabilize it on a basis of permanency fair alike to those engaged in wheat production and those indirectly affected by it. We have seen this Parliament called upon to vote many millions of pounds for the assistance of the wheat-growers. These producers have been obliged to grow ;it a loss many millions of bushels of wheat to feed the people of Australia. I shall leave that experience, and refer, merely in passing, to two things done on the initiative of the Australian Country party which were of first-class importance to the wheat industry. In 1938, a .home consumption price for wheat was established for the first time in Australia, upon the initiative of this party. Up to that time the people of Australia had been supplied with wheat sold to'them at a price which had nothing to do with its production costs, or the price at which it could be sold on the other side of the world, less the co t of transporting it to the people. We all know of the constitutional difficulties which had been regarded by all concerned as an insuperable barrier to the establishment of a home consumption price; yet, by a tortuous process, the constitutional difficulties were overcome, by the device of the flour tax and the' arrangement under which the governments of the six States should pass, for the first time, concurrent and similar legislation. about? the first time by the present Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully), and simultaneouslv the Minister took from the Australian Wheat Board every atom of authority that it possessed. The board has since functioned as a mere appendage of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. If ever the wheat-growers were sold a gold brick, they were when the board was reconstituted concurrently with the subtraction from it ofevery vestige of authority. In order to examine this proposal on its merits it is necessary first to decide one's attitude towards a great principle, upon which this Parliament should not. seek to avoid a l 2509 decision, namely, whether wheat grown by a private individual on his own land and on his own initiative should be regarded as his own property until sold; or whether wheat, alone of all products, is to be regarded as the property of the nation, to be disposed of in accordance with political policy. If it is legally and ethically correct to sell a grower's wheat to"" a pig feeder for half the price that an export flour miller would be prepared to give, then by the same logic, a dairyman's milk ought to be taken and sold to a nursery kindergarten at half the price that an icecream manufacturer would pay; or boots or shirts should be taken by the Government for old-age pensioners at half the price for which they could be sold to wage earners. On this point, my party stands clearly for the principle that wheat grown in this allegedly free country should be scld to bring the best returns to it-producers. From this we make one exception. Wheat sold for human consumption in Australia should be charged for, not at the highest price obtainable as a result of external competition, but at a' price which is related to the cast of production, allowing a fair margin of profit. This involves a willingness to feed the Australian people to-day with wheat at least 5s. a bushel lower in price than could be obtained by export, and such a concession by the producers is made out of a remembrance that, in the past, the Australian people have been taxed to pay relief to wheat growers, and out of a belief that, should the export value of wheat in the future fall below cost of production, the Australian people would again be willing to make some contribution to the maintenance of this basic industry. To-day, the balance of financial obligation is very much more by the ' Australian people to the wheat industry than by the wheat industry to the Australian people. From 1931 to 1941, a total of £21,202,144 was voted by this Parliament for the relief of wheat growers, and this amount is increased to £30,000,000 if three-quarters of the £12,000,000 vote for rural debt adjustment is accepted as having gone to the relief of wheat growers, and their creditors. But, during almost the whole.",23,Scully
83,. Mr Mcleod,Who brought that,24,Scully
84,' Mr Mcewen,"It was introduced forof this time, until the advent of the Hour tax legislation, wheat was sold at much less than the cost of production-for long periods at shillings a bushel less than the cost of production. Since the advent of the Labour Government, not one penny has been voted from Consolidated Revenue to supplement the .realizations of the wheat growers; but during the Labour Administration, wheat has been supplied for stock feed purposes-principall y to permit the production of cheaper bacon and eggs and dairy produce-a t £15,024,000 less than the same wheat could have been sold for to other buyers. When, about three years ago, I said in this Parliament that a continuance for another eighteen months of the Government's policy of selling the farmers' wheat at concessional prices would be tantamount to stealing from the growers £10,000,000-whic h additional amount they could get from alternative buyersI was laughed to scorn by the Minister and. his satellites in this Parliament. As immediate as an echo, came the same derisive denials from those elected leaders of the wheat growers' organizations whom the Minister had cunningly enmeshed by putting them on his pay-roll. To-day, it is, of course, history that I underestimated the amount by which the Minister had mulct the wheat-growers. Eighting a dogged, rearguard battle, lie merce and Agriculture. has since paid in partial compensation £9,095,000 to the growers, and it is a matter of simple arithmetic to calculate that, on the basis of what used to pass for justice in this country, another £6,000,000 is still owing to them. That fight will be continued, although not in connection with this bill. It is, however, very important to ensure that this bill shall not be passed in a form which would enable this or any subsequent Minister similarly to rob wheat-growers. For five years after the last war, the average export value of wheat, as shown in the Tear-Book, was 6s. 2d. a bushel, and for ten years after the last war the average value was a decimal point below 6s. Every fact which has a bearing upon world wheat values indicates a high level of prices for a number of years ahead; the absence of world stocks, the disorganized state of important producing countries, the heightened human consciousness that masses of people must not be hungry, and the war-inflated currencies, all point to a continuance for years of high prices for wheat. In short, a .guarantee of 5s. 2d. a bushel for five years literally is worth nothing. Therefore, this legislation means that, in exchange for a five-year guarantee which is completely worthless, the grower in this young country is to submit himself to an arbitrary and autocratic regulation of the acreage he may sow, and there is to be compiled a comprehensive set of regulations designed to prevent other persons from engaging in the industry Growers must submit to the seizing of perhaps one-third of their whole crop in one year, and its sale to"" persons in other industries for many millions of pounds less than they could obtain by private realization; to the retention from the proceeds of export sales of many millions of pounds of their money to be, at best, held for years against the day when some other growers may need assistance. To paraphrase Mr Churchill -neve r before in the history of this great industry has so much been taken from so many for so illusory an advantage. The vendor. of gold bricks and the rich uncle from F i j i should slink away in shame in the presence of their master, the present Minister for ComMr J. S. Teasdale, chairman of the Wheat Pool of Western Australia, and one of the growers' representatives on the Australian Wheat Board, is recognized, as if not the foremost, one of the foremost, authorities in Australia on wheat marketing. He has made certain simple calculations which reveal ""results of the most startling character which would attend the operation of this plan. Quoting the present export price of wheat at 10s. a bushel f.o.b., and allowing that, by the end of five years, the price may have fallen by half, he points .out that the mean average for the period would be Ts. 6d. a bushel, f.o.b., bulk basis. Then, taking last year's very modest crop of 123,000,000.bushels as an example, Mr Teasdale points out that, on such a crop, 32,000,000 bushels would",24,Scully
85,Mr Mcviwen.,"be used for home-consumption flour; and 28,000,000 bushels for consumption in Australia as stock feed, breakfast food, malting, & c ; leaving 63,000,000 bushels for export as flour and wheat. Multiplying these figures by five, to cover a five year period, he points out that 160,000,000 bushels would be sold at 5s. a bushel, bulk basis, being £20,000,000 less than export parity; 140,000,000 bushels would be sold at the .same price for stock feed, &c, providing a return of £17,500,000 below export parity; and 315,000,000 bushels would be exported, subject to an average tax of Is. 3d. a bushel for the Stabilization Fund, thereby withholding £19,787,500 from the growers; ' showing a total of £57,287,500 withheld from the industry in five years under this plan. Those calculations are clearly set out in a simple CBOP. Wheat for home consumption flour Wheat for stock feed, breakfast food, malting, &c. . .

Od. per bushel below average export parity: Shortage equals Export 315,000,000 bushels subject to average tax of Is. 3d. per bushel for Stabilization Fund: Shortage eqnals Withheld from the industry in five years Proceeding, Mr Teasdale points out that should the average annual marketable crop exceed 123,000,000 bushels and the average export price be 8s. f.o.b -as he says it may well be-the n the amount withheld from growers will be from £68,000,000 to £70,000,000. And this is stahilization! I have no need to say that the Australian Country party agrees with the principle of wheat stabilization. That party introduced the principle, which would be still operating but for the unforgivable action of the present Minister in terminating it. My party is again prepared to support the establishment of stabilization on a fair basis, but I emphasize that "" f a i r "" is the key word of its attitude. We will resist any plan, or parts of a plan, which are stupid or unjust, or which .do not recognize the principle that the grower has full property rights in his product until realization. My guiding points in examining the bill are-that the disposal of the growers' product must really be under the control of his own chosen representatives; and that any concession which a government may wish to make in providing lower prices for wheat for certain sections must be made good by the Government to the wheat industry. I have said that the Bushels. Australian Country party stands for ,. . . 32 000,000 ; stabilization. That declaration immediately infers, first, that the period of price . . 23,000,000 guarantee must be long enough to cover' 03,000,000 and equalize a cycle of price variations; and secondly, that the guaranteed basic 123,000,00 0 stabilization price should be adequate to cover the cost of production and provide a reasonable profit. I find myself in conflict with the bill on both points. In the .£ first place, the bill provides for a fiveconsumption flouryear period only. The most elementaryexamination of the world statistical posiexport parity: tion in respect of. wheat makes it quite . . 20.000,000 clear, that no glut of wheat which could result in low prices could possibly occur within five years. 17,500,000 Mr Teasdale recently made a statewheat or flourment setting out the grounds upon which he concluded that wheat prices would remain at a high level for some years. 10,787,500 I accept his judgment on this matter, and repeat some of his conclusions:.. ' .. 57,287,500 To-day, there are practically no world stocks of wheat, and there is also a world shortage of alternative grains, particularly rice. The unstable political structure in both Europe and Asia weighs heavily against the quick re-organization of full production in those continents. The destruction and obsolescence of machinery, both for production and transport, is an impoi-tant factor. Reduction in land fertility due to war-time fertilizer shortages; the world craving for",25,Scully
86,Table Prepared By Mr Teasdale,"animal fats for the production of which there must be a great consumption of grains; the increased population of India and other Asiatic countries, demanding increased imports; the elimination of Danubian countries from the list of exporters -while under. Russian control; the determination of the Great Powers to see that there is no widespread shortage of food, irrespective of capasidings is a fair basic minimum guarantee city to pay; and the recognized necessity to rebuild reserve stocks which calls for approxisuch a guarantee involves no possible mately 600,000,000 bushels. These are powerful factors which make it certain that there cannot be a serious fall of wheat prices within five years. Therefore wheat-growers do not need a five-year plan. Most growers believe that they would be very much better off without a five-year plan, when, with high prices and free realization, they could mend their own broken fortunes. What they do fully endorse, however, is the need for real stabilization of the industry, and that cannot usefully be attempted in any plan for less than ten years. I therefore disagree with the Government's proposal on the first point, and urge the necessity for a ten-year stabilization plan. mental in a real stabilization plan is that the minimum guaranteed price shall cover the cost of production and provide a reasonable profit. The Government's proposal of 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. ports does not cover the present cost of production, and no one can say whether it will be more or less than cost of production in five .years' time. An adequate plan must cover the cost of production to-day, and also provide for covering the cost of production for the whole period of the plan. No one will deny that there can be no true stabilization in disregard of cost of production; yet although, the present Government has talked of stabilization for years, it has either failed to conduct an inquiry into cost of production or has deliberately refrained from doing so. That brands the Government's administration as either incompetent or insincere. However, growers' organizations in every State have conducted such an inquiry and, in the absence of an' official investigation, the results arrived at by the organizations remain the only guide. They show that the cost of production averages 5s. 2d. a bushel at country sidings, bagged basis. On that basis, and bearing in mind the' undiminished upward tendency of all costs, the Australian Country party considers that os. 2d. a bushel at growers' for the forthcoming harvest. Obviously Treasury liability in face of the insatiable demand for wheat at its present export value of 10s. 6d. a bushel at ports. Our inability to name a guaranteed price for this year based on an' official examination of costs is entirely due to the Government's negligence, notwithstanding constant demands for an inquiry to ascertain the cost of production. In regard to the guaranteed minimum price for subsequent years, the Government's plan provides for 5s. 2d. a bushel at ports for the four following harvests. The wheat-growers want only a fair guarantee. How impossible it is to predict for several years ahead what would be an adequate price is shown by the fact that although only five' years ago the Wheat Growers Federation demanded stabilization at a guaranteed price of 3s. 10^d. a bushel at country sidings, costs had so risen within a year that that rate was quite inadequate. A year earlier the growers had asked for 3s< lOd. a bushel at ports as a basis for stabilizing the industry. In both cases within a year these prices were shown to be completely out of relation to the then existing state of affairs. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has reminded us that while he was Prime Minister the growers had asked for 3s. lOd. a bushel at ports, but that later they asked for that price at sidings. The honourable member for Wakefield( Mr Smith) also reminded us that within the last year this Government offered 4s. 8d. a bushel at ports and later raised the "" ante "" to 5s. 2d. a bushel at ports. All of this goes to show that in a world in which values and costs are changing rapidly there is no possibility at any point of saying that any price is a fair and adequate price to stand for five years. Therefore, the Australian Country party's proposal is that there should be established a statutory tribunal which, upon",26,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod
87,Mr Eeost,A t a lower rate?,27,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod
88,Mr Mcewen,"The second fundainvestigation and evidence, would ascertain the fair cost of production and devise a formula to enable that cost to be kept up to date. Upon the decision of such a statutory body, the annual minimum guaranteed price should be fixed, and provision should be made in the legislation for such a system to function and such a guarantee to operate for at least ten years, a3 no less a period than that can be regarded as sufficient to bring about the true stabilization of an industry 3uch as wheat-growing, in which such substantial capital investment is involved. The Australian Country party, however, believes that whilst the guarantee should be proclaimed as covering a minimum period of ten years, the arrangement should be of a permanent and continuous character. Furthermore, it believes this to be the system upon which all the major primary industries .should be stabilized, and that the price-determining authority ought to be of a character competent through its specialized sections to ascertain and keep under continuous review costs of production in all such major primary industries. It is a truism that an industry cannot continue indefinitely unless it receives cost of production; yet the Government brightly claims to be giving stabilization to the wheat industry by guaranteeing a price which, as far as I can see, might have been arrived at hy consulting the stars or by pulling a number out of a hat. Wheat may be said to be worth what it costs to produce, or, what some one is prepared to give for it. On the laitter basis, it is to-day worth 10 s. 6d. a bushel at ports; as to the former, there is no official evidence whatever. An amount of 5s. 2d. a bushel at ports was decided upon in 1938 by the Lyons Government as being the fair value for wheat for home consumption in order to enable a 4-lb. loaf of bread to be sold for Is., and. that amount was therefore .fixed as the basis for the calculation of the wheat-growers will have subsidized Ausflour tax. It will be remembered that all of the members of the Australian Labour party then sitting in opposition voted against that proposal. kind'. That is a completely untrue staterealized by export. There can be no disment which are to he found in the records of the Parliament will prove the accuracy of what I have said. To-day, that figure still stands for that purpose, but it was never chosen as a figure related either to cost of production or export parity. How the present Government came to adopt it as the minimum guaranteed price I cannot imagine, and the Minister has, not attempted to explain. This brings me to the point that a figure chosen in 1938 because it would produce a 4 lb loaf of bread for Is. is to-day completely out of date, and every loaf of bread consumed in Australia is made from wheat provided by wheat-growers at less than its cost of production. I challenge the Government to prove the contrary. No other industry in Australia is expected, let alone forced, to provide ;the Australian people with food to eat or clothes to wear at less than cost of production, and this figure must now be reviewed. I mentioned earlier that, during the life of the Lyons and Menzies Governments, £21,000,000 had been paid in direct assistance to the wheat-growers, and in addition approximately £9,000,000 had been provided as rural debt relief. T desire to draw the attention of the Government and the Australian taxpayers to the other side of the picture. Out of ' last year's harvest, 34,000,000 bushels will be used for human consumption in Australia and will be provided at 5s. a bushel less than the growers could realize by exporting it. In short, in this one year, the Australian wheat growers will, out of their own pockets, subsidize Australian consumers of bread to the value of £8,500,000. On the previous crop this reverse subsidy was worth not less than £5,000,000 to Australian consumers, and even if the export value of wheat is no higher next year than it is at present, growers will again subsidize consumers to the amount of £8,500,000. Therefore, on these three crops alone, tralian consumers to the amount of £22,000,000, and over the same period under . the Government's proposals growers will have provided wheat as feed to produce eggs, bacon, &c, for puting these figures. The calculations",27,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod
89,Mr Scully,"They did nothing of the £20,000,000 less than they would have",28,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod
90,Mr Mcewen,"The division listsare based on simple arithmetic, and show clearly that it is intended to compel wheat-growers by law to pay back to the Australian usurer's rates-all of the assistance they ever received ""in the depression years, and bare cost'of production to help the man very much more in-addition. This is a consumer's government dominated by members representing metropolitan constituents who are concerned only with costs to consumers. Yet it has attempted to masquerade as one which concerns itself with the problems of producers. It is an extraordinarily difficult' feat to satisfy, consumers that they can have the cheapest possible foodstuffs and at the same time satisfy producers by giving them the value of their products at a time when such value happens to be high. That feat this Government has not attempted to perform. Its acts have revealed it as a consumers government. Australian consumers werequite willing for about a decade in the "" thirties "" to have their bread made from cessional price determined upon. This wheat priced at its export value, and cheap merely because impoverished .people overseas could not pay a fair price. Wheat-growers would, therefore, have logic on their side if to-day they asked that Australian consumers should have dearer bread, because the overseas value is now high. To their great credit, however, Australian wheatrgrowers do not ask this. What they do ask is that their fellow Australians pay them, for the bread they eat, cost of production of their wheat, plus a fair profit. If the would be needed for stock feed and would Government believes that the price of bread should not be raised-and in that I willingly concur as that is the definite policy 'of my party-the should pay to the Australian Wheat Board whatever is necessary to meet the difference between the present home consumption price for wheat and its ascertained costs of production. The Australian wheat-grower's willingness to provide bread at cost to his fellow Australians is hot a gesture of liberality which he extends to Australian pigs. The principle here is quite clear, and surely unarguable. authority should not be invoked to take the product of one industry from its owners at a lower price than they could realize, and make it available to those Mr floFhcen. engaged in another industry. The Australian wheat-farmer is willing to produce wheat at cost of production for his public-plus interest at fellow Australians to eat bread. But he is not willing to produce his wheat at in the pig or poultry or dairy industry to produce his product more cheaply, or to help consumers get their eggs, bacon or milk more cheaply, regardless of the. value of wheat to an alternative buyer. He wants the wheat which he produces surplus to our human requirements to be realized at its market value. If any government wishes to aid a live-stock industry which uses wheat as a feed, and that really means if any government wishes to keep the cost of eggs and baconand dairy products low to consumers, then the wheat-farmer claims that the Government must pay into the funds of the Australian Wheat Board the difference between market value and any conprinciple the Australian Country party vigorously upholds. How grave an injustice can otherwise be done to Australian wheat-growers under the terms of this present plan can clearly be seen by picturing 'a recurrence of a drought such as that which ended a year ago. This would produce a condition under which there would be a low production of wheat and a stimulated demand for stock feed, in which case all the wheat surplus to human requirements be sold at bare cost of production, notwithstanding that a very high level of export values prevailed. So, the wheat Government industry, while suffering grave loss through drought, would he obliged to provide Australian bread consumers with wheat at less than cost of production, and. Australian stock feeders with wheat at less than cost of production, and at the same time, wheat-growers would have to draw upon their own accumulated moneys in the stabilization fund to bring their return up to the guaranteed price, notwithstanding the existence of high export It is that government values. The plan proposes to make wheat for stock feed punposes available forfiveyears at a price'of 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. ports; but neither the plan nor the Minister's speech reveals where authority is to repose to decide whether, or how much, wheat is to be sold for stock feed purposes. Either the Minister retains the power to direct the provision and determine the quantity of wheat set aside for stock feed purposes or the board must' make this decision. If the board is to possess the authority of decision, then it, comprising a majority of wheat-growers, acting virtually as trustees for their fellow growers, will be confronted with, the extremely difficult problem of deciding to allocate wheat for sale for local feed purposes at 5s. 2d. a bushel at a time when u could realize perhaps 10s., or more, a bushel by deciding to export. Is the Australian Wheat Board or the Minister to have the authority? Or is the board obliged under the bill to supply all the wheat demanded for stock feed purposes at 5s. 2d. a bushel ? That seems to me to be the only conclusion that can be drawn from the measure. The bill will oblige the Australian Wheat Board for so long as this legislation remains in force to provide all wheat demanded for any local purpose at 5s. 2d. a bushel. That requirement can result in a very serious loss to the growers. granted.] When the pig and poultry and dairying industries are at a profitable level there will be a high demand for feed wheat, and when a drought occurs this demand will be added to by sheep feed requirements.. The same seasonal conditions would produce a small crop, so I can easily' envisagea state of affairs under which all the wheat surplus to human requirements in Australia would be demanded for stock feed requirements at the proposed prescribed price. Such a state of affairs actually occurred only a year ago-. In these circumstances, wheat growers would not be able to take any advantage of high exiport values, and the position could be aggravated by other government policies designed to stimulate the pig, poultry and dairying industries. In short, a simple calculation will reveal that until such time as the export value falls below the guaranteed price, this plan will produce a result under which the smaller the crop the less price per bushel growers will receive. That statement is unchallengeable: and that result brands the plan as both stupid and unjust. The recurrence of drought in this country is so certain that that state of affairs is absolutely certain to obtain under this plan. I sincerely hope that the Government will recognize this fault in the general legislation and remove it now; otherwise grave injustice is certain to be done to wheat-growers in a drought year. In the circumstances, drought, which would cause growers loss in their operations, would at -the same time stimulate the local feed demand and automatically deprive them of the compensating factor of export sales at a profitable level. These are important principles, all of them founded wholly on equity, which the Australian Country party claims to be fundamental to a fair wheat stabilization plan. But there is one other point of first importance. It is that the administration of the plan, and particularly the ""disposal of wheat, should be in the hands of a grower-controlled wheat board, possessing real authority. If ever the wheat-growers were sold a gold brick it was when the Minister made good his [Extension of time promise to give the growers majority representation on the Australian Wheat Board, and, at the same moment, took from the board almost every vestige of power of any value. The growers would have, been infinitely better off had the Minister abolished it, for then he would at least have been recognized as the real centre of decision. As it is, the wheat board, powerless though it is, has proved an invaluable stalking horse for the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully). the Australian Wheat Board. to the Minister's political acumen. There is in this plan one principle which I hope all will recognize as a fundamental departure from every previously accepted principle of just public administration in this country. It is, that a portion of a grower's production is to be taken and set aside to be held as a reserve, without any suggestion or pretence of recording or recognizing that he retains any property right in it. Unless we are to abandon our traditional conception of the rights of the individual to the product",28,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod
91,Mr Scully,That is a reflection on,30,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod
92,Mr Mcewen,"It is a complimentof his labour, provision ought to be made in the plan for an equity register of all growers, so that, if circumstances permit, it shall he possible to repay some of the contribution on a basis that has regard to the total contribution of each grower. If the Government takes the view that growers have no right to their wheat once they have grown it, it should say so, and growers would know where they stand. Buti t is plain that if growers stage of the hill. PointsI have menstill have full property rights in their wheat under this scheme, their representatives should be permitted to sell it. That is organized marketing, of which the Government proclaims itself in favour in the referendum season. Anything less is not organized marketing, and it will be futile for the Government to proclaim itself from the referendum hustings as in favour of organized marketing of primary products if it is not prepared to permit the Australian Wheat Board to have authority to organize the marketing of wheat. That would not preclude the Government from, as a matter of policy, deciding that a certain quantity of wheat should be reserved for a particular purpose or a particular customer, but it would have to become responsible to the Australian Wheat Board for the current prevailing value of the wheat. This legislation establishes an Australian Wheat Board with a majority of growers' representatives, and is therefore calculated to persuade growers to believe that their elected representatives will be in charge of their own industry. I point out, however, that the two most vital points affecting a wheat-grower are the price which he receives for his -product and his opportunity to engage in production. This legislation has mandatory provisions concerning price, and to that extent it removes that issue from the authority of the Australian Wheat Board. I point out to growers that there is to be a wheat stabilization committee which will have complete authority to decide their opportunity to produce in terms of acres, but it will be nominated by the Minister and will be subject entirely to ministerial direction. Therefore, on the second vital point the Australian Wheat Board, with 'all its growers' representatives, is stripped of authority to decide or even advise upon the extent to which Sir. McEwen. growers are to be entitled to engage in their own industry. That is completely contrary to the interests of the growers, and I propose that the Australian Wheat Board shall be the authority to advise the Minister and act for him in the regulation of production. There are many other points of important detail which can more appropriately be discussed in the committee tioned are fundamentals, and so important to the formulation of a fair stabilization plan that I now* propose an amendment to the second reading which covers these points, and one other point of vital consequence dealing with a matter which is involved in the present plan, but certainly should have no place in it. I refer to the inclusion, of the 1945-46 crop in the Government's plan. The Government needs no reminding by me of the disastrous experiences of the wheat industry over the last fifteen years, and of the tremendous losses involved, and it is, I am sure, well aware of the resulting parlous financial position of a vast number of wheat-growers. Last year's harvest, following the most disastrous drought, was of quite modest proportions, and growers are desperately in need of the benefits of full realization at the present high level of values. Therefore, common sense ought to have induced the Government to allow the grower to benefit by these high prices and to gain some financial alleviation As a matter of just treatment of citizens, there is an. unanswerable case for the Government not to attempt to include the last harvest in the plan. Wheat-growers' official representatives are vehement in declaring that the late Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, assured them that in respect of the war-time pools, they would receive full realization. Does the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture deny that? But this wheat was compulsorily acquired from the growers by proclamation in November last year, and their ownership was converted into an entitlement to compensation by the Government. It would be a remarkable decision of law if it were decided that their entitlement to compensation could be satisfied by placing a substantial proportion of the realization on their crop in the fund designed to benefit wheat growers five years hence, many of whom would not be the growers who had built up the fund. The following table sets out how growers will fare under this proposal:Amount withheld from individual growers under proposal in bill in respect to 1945^46 crop, of growers who delivered various quantities to pool. Amount proposed to be withheld, for Stabilization Fund, 2s. 2d. per bushel, being 50 -per cent, of difference between 5s. 2d. and 9s. Gd.

It is an outrageous act of repudiation, and an action of yery questionable legality, to include last year's harvest in the stabilization plan, and an action which most callously disregards the acute financial needs of thousands of wheat growers. My amendment is designed to correct this injustice and enable the introduction of an adequate, workable and fair stabilization plan. I therefore move That all the words after "" T h a t "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:"" the bill be withdrawn and redrafted to provide for stabilization of the wheat industry for a period of not less than ten years excluding the 1945-46 harvest, and, in particular, to provide(a) a guaranteed price basis of not less than 5s. 2d. per bushel, bagged, at growers' sidings, for the next crop; (b) thereafter, an' annual guaranteed minimum price related to cost of production, allowing a margin of profit; (c) the entitlement of growers to the f u l l net realization of each annual pool less a contribution to a stabilization fund of not more than 50 per centum of realization in excess of the guaranteed price; (d) payment by the Government to the Australian Wheat Board of the difference between the prevailing export parity and the price at which any wheat is sold by Government direction for export or consumption within Australia, other than human consumption within Australia; (e) the establishment of an authority to ascertain current costs of production to enable the operation of the foregoing provisions; and (/) that, subject to the foregoing, the Australian Wheat Board shall have f u l l authority in negotiating export sales, and shall be the authority to advise the Minister and act for the Minister in respect to any regulation of production."" I say, with the full authority of the Australian Country party, that this f amendment represents the policy of my 54 party and, if the Government does not . . 1.08 accept this amendment, my party, if in . . 102 power after the next election, will . . 217 amend the wheat legislation in accordance . . 271 . . 325 with the principles of this amendment. . . 379 .. . . 487 Unlike the honourable member for Forrest. . 542 ( Mr Lemmon); I am unable to speak on this measure with the experience of a practical wheat-grower; but at least I can speak with the experience of a primary producer who has been engaged in the production of allied products, and with the experience of one who has served for eight years in the State Parliament of Victoria, and nine years in this legislature, during which time. I have been able to observe closely the wheat-grower's struggle for economic security, and imipact of his troubles upon the problems of this country. If we' examine the importance of wheat in Australia's economic structure, and take into consideration some of the figures that are available, we do not wonder that this industry has become a matter for intense political discussion. Australia to-day has approximately 50,000 wheat-growers. That number represents at least 75,000 farmers, and, in addition, there are approximately 25,000 permanent employees of wheat-farmers, making a total of 100,000 people .directly engaged in this great industry. In a normal year, wheat covers approximately 12,500,000 acres in this country, and for the ten-year period ended 1942-43 the annual wheat yield averaged 156,000,000 bushels, 'valued at approximately £30,000,000. Ordinarily, 32,000,000 bushels of wheat is consumed in Australia in the form of flour and other food products. According to figures for",30,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod
93,. . 433 Mr Pollard (Ballarat) [5.0],"the five-year period ended 1942-43, 13,000,000 bushels a year was required for stock feed. An impetus has been given to the use of wheat as stock feed, first by the concessional rates inaugurated by this Government, and secondly by the dire needs created by droughts-. The demand is increasing. Eventually .this new market for wheat will be of considerable value. A further 11,000,000 bushels of wheat is required for seed purposes, bringing the total of our home consumption needs to approximately 56,000,000 bushels annually. Australia occupies tenth place amongst the wheat-producing countries of the world, and in normal years it exports 18 per cent, of the world's total exports of this commodity. Eor the five year period ended 1938-39, we exported an average of 68,000,000 bushels of wheat, and in one year the figure was as high as 97,000,000 bushels. With a return to normal conditions and seasons, and the application of mechanical and scientific methods of farming, we can look forward ' .to a normal export trade of not less than 90,000,000 to 100,000,000 bushels of wheat a year. The indirect benefit of this industry to Australia cannot be overlooked. It gives to our railway services an annual revenue of £3,500,000, and, according to the wheat board's figures, administration, storage, and handling charges, &c, involved the disbursement of a like sum to the Australian community. In addition, the flour-milling industry provides employment for thousands of Australian citizens. Further employment, of course, is given by the demand for agricultural machinery, most of which . is manufactured in Australia. Considerable additional sums of money are disbursed upon bags, twine and other goods, required in the wheat industry. Last, but not least, is' the substantial standard of living that the industry should, and I believe, under this legislation, will provide for the wheat-grower and his family. That is the first reason for the political importance of this industry. The second reason-and it is a matter for consideration by Parliament-is the fact that, unfortunately, over a long period of years, world prices of wheat have fluctuated so greatly that the grower has come to realize that there is no alternative to political action to stabilize his means of livelihood by fixing the price of wheat Mr Pollard. at a figure sufficient to provide him with a standard of living not less than that of other Australian citizens who are rendering services to the community in their own particular spheres. The third reason for the political importance of this industry is this: Prior to the setting up of the authority which handled Australia's wheat production during the war of 1914-18 and for some yea.rs after, and during the period between the wars, the wheat-growers of this country, as of most countries, realized. that only through political action could they bp saved from the operations of dealers and speculators who have waxed substantially rich and fat upon the labours of the farmers. Consciousness of the value of organized marketing first impressed itself on the minds of wheat-growers -in 1920-21, the season in which the last wheat crop was handled under the marketing arrangements inaugurated during the war of 1914-18. About that time, the wheat-growers began to realize that during World WarI . an authority appointed by the Government had handled the whole of their crop in a comparatively 'efficient manner, and that the proceeds had been distributed to them without any tribute being paid to wheat dealers and speculators. In the days of open marketing, the dealers hadprofited from the increased returns from the sale of wheat that had absorbed moisture and gained weight while stored.. The growers did not fail to observe that the pool returned to them the amount of the increase. I mark that period as the time when wheat growers were first impressed with the value of organized marketing. Following the decision of the Hughes Government to discontinue the operation of the pool, open market conditions were resumed and until the commencement of World War II . , no effort was made by political parties other than the Labor party to introduce the acquisition or board method of handling wheat. It ' is true that, in 1920, wheat-growers in Victoria, conscious of the advantages of organized marketing, brought pressure to bear upon the State Paliament. The Labor party, always a believer in organized marketing, announced that it would support the establishment of a compulsory wheat pool in Victoria. The then comparatively radical Country party also declared that it would support the proposal. But in 1921, when a State election was precipitated, none of the three political parties was returned with an absolute majority, and the Country party accepted a political compromise offered by the National party, and the Government of the day inaugurated a voluntary pool. The disadvantage of a voluntary pool is that some, growers always decline to participate, and by reason of their refusal, they are able to break down the organized marketing efforts of those within the pool. Yet' that was the system of marketing which was adopted in Victoria in 1921. I admit that it would have been difficult-to operate the scheme successfully without the cooperation and complementary legislation of New South Wales, South Australia and perhaps. Western Australia. Had they so chosen, the four States could have worked their 'pooling systems in co-operation. However, from that time until 1939. the merchants, dealers and speculators had free rein to deal in wheat and manipulate the market. But on the outbreak' of hostilities in 1939, private enterprise was not able to face the financial responsibility of buying and storing wheat, and the ""hazards of war. The Menzies Government then came to the rescue of the dealers and speculators, and, incidentally, the wheat-growers, by announcing that it would acquire the whole of the wheat produced in the Commonwealth. wheat had been sold for Is. a bushel. Menzies Government appointed a board to market the wheat to the best advantage and pay the proceeds to the growers. As I stated, no effort was made between 3920 and 1939 hy political parties other than the Labour party to deal with this problem. I do not exclude the Labour party , because in 1929, the Scullin Government came into office and in the following year, the price of wheat throughout the world tumbled to a disastrous level. member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) urged farmers to"" grow more wheat. ber for Ballarat had better "" s k i p "" that episode. Australian Country party are anxious to encourage me to "" skip "" the true story of what occurred in 1929-31. The plain facts are that the price of wheat overseas tumbled to a disastrous level, and in Australia the price collapsed to 2s. a bushel. That return was so far below the cost of production that growers were not able to meet their commitments, and maintain a reasonable standard of living. able member for Yarra urged farmers to grow more wheat! ment, whether Labour, National or Country party, encouraged farmers to grow more wheat. Mi\ ABBOTT -Rubbish! State governments encouraged the ""grow morewheat"" campaign for the very worthy purpose of endeavouring to produce sufficient quantities of wheat to enable the Commonwealth to meet its liabilities overseas, and, in that manner, avoid repudiating its external debts. No one will deny that. The next development was that when prices were so far below the cost of production, the Scullin Government introduced the Wheat Marketing Bill, which provided a guaranteed price of 4s. a bushel at growers' sidings. The House of Representatives passed .the bill, but in the Senate the legislation met defeat by the vote of a member of the Country party and several other anti-Labour senators. Since that day, members of the Australian Country party, to a greater extent, and members of the Liberal party, to a lesser extent, have endeavoured to place the blame for the. defeat of the bill upon the Scullin Government. Following that very worthy attempt to assist wheat-growers, the Scullin Government introduced the Wheat Advances Bill which provided for an advance upon farmers' wheat. What was its fate? The government of the day . asked the Commonwealth Bank for an advance to enable those payments to be made to wheat-growers.

101,Mr Pollard,"I repeat that thewith the representatives of every kind of political thought except the Labour party, refused the necessary finance. That is the true story of why, at that period, the wheat-growers suffered so severely. Had the Commonwealth Bank Board been constituted differently, the growers' position might have been improved. When this bill was introduced a few days ago, the honourable member for Indi to the Lang Government's proposal to pay to growers 7s. 6d. a bushel. Gibbons propose? orable member for New England( Mr the Commonwealth Bank Board was out Abbott) something which he will not like to hear. I shall tell the true story of the attitude of the Commonwealth Bank Board at a time when an anti-Labour government was in office, and the board itself was controlled by directors whose views were not those of the Labour party. Its outlook then was very different from that which, I hope, the bank has to-day. I have never told this story before, but I consider that it should be placed on record. In 1930-31, Mr Slater was Minister for Agriculture in Victoria and I was an Assistant Minister. The peachgrowers of the Goulburn Valley were in dire distress because prices were so low, and they could not obtain money to finance the processing of their crop. Approaching Mr Slater and myself, their representatives suggested that the Labour Go-' vernment of Victoria should provide sufficient money to enable the payment of an advance of £5 a ton. If they received that assistance, the peaches could be picked and processed, and wages paid, and the canned fruit would then be available for export. The proceeds from the sale would have helped the Commonwealth to meet its overseas liabilities, which, at that time, Minister for Commerce and Agriculture were considerable. Although Mr Slater and I were impressed with the proposal, we had to tell them the plain truth, namely, that the State had practically no resources available to assist them. With the approval of the State Government, we approached the Commonwealth Bank Board, and visited the chairman, Sir Robert Gibson, in the "" holy of holies "" in Collins-street. We stated our proposal in plain terms. Sir Robert paced the bank chamber and looked intensely wise, and this is what he said: "" Well, gentlemen, your proposal is a good one. The money will be made available. I will do anything to help your government, but I will not help that man Lang."" There could not be a better illustration of political victimization by the great Commonwealth Bank. He was not concerned about the merits of any of Lang's schemes. He believed, no doubt quite conscientiously, that it was essential in the interests of the country that the Lang Government should be destroyed. I do Lang's proposals, but it is obvious that, irrespective of any merits of his schemes, to destroy his government. The Scullin Government's term of office was the only period between World WarI . and World War II . when any attempt was made to place the wheat industry entirely under the control of a board and to market wheat as the growers wanted, it to be marketed so as to obtain the best possible prices. Necessity forced the Menzies Government to adopt a similar plan at the outbreak of World War II . That government did what was apparently the only right thing to do and established the Australian Wheat Board. In the first place, the board was not substantially representative of the growers. In September, 1939, it consisted of a government-appointed chairman, Sir Clive MePherson, three merchants, a representative of bulk handling interests, and two growers. In November, 1939, one miller was added to the board, and in December, 1940, at the request of the growers themselves, two additional growers were appointed. After the Labour Party came into power, the Board was substantially improved from the growers' point of view, for, in November, 1941, the present ( Mr Scully) appointed three more growers. By October, 1942, the board consisted of seven growers, one miller, and one government-appointed chairman, and by 1944, arrangements had been made for the growers to elect their own representatives by ballot.

The hoard appointed by the Menzies Government, of which the honourable member was a supporter, had to bow to the government of the day and take instructions from it. Anybody would think, hearing the honourable member's statement, that only under a Labour government did the Minister have the final say in the decisions of the board.

I shall read an extract from a statement made by a member of the Government which the honourable gentleman supported. On the 15th November, 1939, the Minister for Commerce saidAll these boards and committees He referred to the stabilization committeeshave substantial grower representation and the Government is thus assured of securing the views of producers on the questions of price and market organization. That board included three merchants, and they would certainly give the Government royal commission was appointed in 1934 advice on prices and marketing organizawith Sir Herbert Gepp as chairman. tion! The statement continuedThey have assisted the Government in the of meandering investigation and taking negotiations as to price and other conditions, of and they control the marketing, subject to the was presented. But the report was directions of the Minister for Commerce. What is the purpose of all the humbug governments did not act on the recomtalked by the honourable member for Indi mendations of the commission. but to mislead the ipeople. the honourable member's remarks? 1 have quoted was made by a member of parts of Australia the cost of production a government which th« honourable memof wheat was 3s. 6d. a bushel and that in ber supported. That form of control has been continued by successive governments up to the present, and it would be continued even if the honourable member for Indi were to become Prime Minister to-morrow, an unlikely eventuality. Proceeding with the history of this troubled industry, we come to the period after acquisition had been instituted when the Menzies Government decided on a stabilization plan. In 1940 it introduced a plan, which provided for a price of 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.b. for a crop of 140,000,000 bushels. Anything realized over 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.b. I did not say what the was to be paid into a pool, which would be drawn upon to bring the payment to the grower up to 3s. lOd. a bushel in years when market prices were low. That price was the equivalent of about 2s. a bushel at sidings, and the guarantee covered 140,000,000 bushels. Actually, in 1941-42, the first season covered by the scheme, the crop was 153,000,000 bushels. Therefore, 13,000,000 bushels was not covered by the guarantee, and was subject to the vagaries of world markets. Could that. be called a generous scheme? How was it that the honourable member for Indi, the then' Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), and all the others who are now so insistent upon.the appointment of a committee to ascertain the cost of production, did not establish such a committee during the long period of low prices between 1921 and 1930 ?

These facts should be taken into consideration by the growers. in 1940 was well above world parity. gentleman at his word. If it was, how much further above world parity was the 4s. a bushel at sidings that was paid under the Scully plan? At that time, there was no world parity.

When the price of 3s. lOd. a bushel for the 1941-42 crop was guaranbeen the history of their attitude to the teed by the Government supported by the honourable member for Indi, the stocks from the speech of the Leader of the Oppoof wheatin Australia inNovember totalled the comparatively small quantity interested in making a point in regard' of 41,000,000 ' bushels. The conditions became worse Avith the entry of Japan into the war, and in November, 1942, a few months after the Scully price of 4s. a bushel at growers' sidings for the first 3,000 bushels had been provided, the stocks of wheat in Australia has increased to 104j000,000 bushels. Twelve months later they had swollen to 154,000,000 bushels, and the prospects of disposing of the accumulation were much blacker than they had been prior to the entry of Japan into growing; it is the result of consultation the war, when the guarantee of 3s. lOd. a with State Premiers, the Australian bushel f.o.b. was given by the MenziesPage-McEwen combination. I have stated facts, not drawn on my imagination, as did the honourable member for Indi, for much of the matter that he used. Had it not been for the wisdom of the present Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in breaking away from the stabilization plan of the preceding Government, disaster would have overtaken the wheat-grower in the drought which followed, the 1942-43 harvest. As it was, his plight was bad enough. The Government, through the then Prime Minister, the late Mr Curtiri, made the first really helpful gesture that had ever been made in the history of this country by any government, either Federal or State; it provided drought relief as a gift, not as a loan, and that helped to tide the growers over their difficulties. Members of the Opposition, whose past in regard to wheat is murky, and who-realize fully that between 1921 and 1939 they did nothing to place the wheat industry under the control of a board composed principally of growers, undermined politically. Therefore, they claim to be in favour of the principle of stabilization, but urge that the conditions was not a ought to be made more generous. I believe that, had they composed the Government from 1941 to 1945, the marhave been handed back to the control of the dealers and speculators. That has wheat industry since 1920-21. I gathered sition ( Mr Menzies) that he was more to the submission of a question relating to the organized marketing of primary -products at the forthcoming referendum than in canvassing the intrinsic worth of the present wheat plan. In his opening statement, he said in effect"" The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully), in his second-reading speech, pointed out that this plan had been made possible because of the cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States that are interested in wheatAgricultural Council, and so on. That being the case, why do we need a referendum on the organized marketing of primary products?"" I can visualize his attempts to make that point at the forthcoming general elections. What he did not tell the House was that this scheme has -reached the legislatures of the Commonwealth and the States only after arduous negotiation covering a period of many months.

118,Mr Pollard,"Compar e it with the honourable member for Indi said in regard to the plan for a home-consumption price, this stabilization scheme is to be given effect only after intricate and involved negotiations with the six 'State governments, during which there have been long and irritating delays which have' fretted the wheat-grower and everybody else who is concerned in the matter. By.no means is it assured of complete success even now. A very good illustration of the possibility of a breakdown is furnished by what occurred after a conference had been held in this chamber to deal with the reference of powers by the States to the Commonwealth Parliament. That conference was composed of Commonwealth party leaders and the Premiers"" and Leaders of Opposition of all the State parliaments. After much debate, the Premiers agreed to return to their respective States and to introduce legislation referring additional powers to the Commonwealth Parliament. A gentleman who is as astute as the honourable member for Indi, Mr Dunstan, notwithstanding the solemn promise he had made, as well as the political principle that he should have honoured, attached a tag to his State legislation providing that it should only operate Avhen similar legislation had been passed by all the other States. That proves how dangerous it is to depend uponcomplementary legislation by the State parliaments in respect of important primary products, of which wheat is.such a striking example. I have made these remarks in order to direct attention to the subtlety of the approach of the Leader of the Opposition to the matter. He referred to the delays that have occurred in the introduction'of this measure. I have stated the reasons for them. He argued that, because of those delays, the 1945-46 crop should be excluded from the scheme. organized marketing powerswhich are to be sought at the forthcoming referendum had been within the power of the Commonwealth Government this matte/ could have been completed last February or March, and irritating delays would not have occurred. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that a poll of the growers should be taken. It is quite obvious that honourable members opposite decided at a caucus meeting that whilst they could not say openly that they want to destroy this plan, they must raise against it every barrier that they can devise. I suppose it occurs to their rather subtle minds that if they could encourage the growers to clamour for a poll they might gain time, during which the merchants might exercise some influence on the"" growers' minds. Even the Australian Wheat Growers Federation itself has not asked that a pool be taken. The Leader of the Opposition said it would he unconstitutional to include the 1945-46 crop in the pool. I am not a lawyer but I believe that any product required for consumption in our own country could be dealt with under the price fixation legislation which I understand the right honourable gentleman himself introduced into this Parliament. I suggest to him that, as far as external prices are concerned, not one penny is to be taken from the growers that will not ultimately be paid back to them. would undoubtedly have arisen under the stabilization plan introduced by the Government with which the honourable member was associated. retrospectively. ber has suggested that the 1945-46 harvest, for which a high export price can DP obtained, should be excluded. rJo doubt he reasons that, as he will not be a member of a responsible government after the next elections, some other ministry will have to shoulder the responsibility should world prices crash. He will have no responsibility to make good any deficiency. The honourable member knows that there is every possibility that, within three If the years, world prices of wheat will collapse. dale. That gentleman also saidIf we fail to do something along these lines -if we try to secure high prices for our stored products.; in fact, any price at all-w e will inevitably break down international exchange, as resulted after last war.

We may arrange an alleged big price, it is true, based upon some bonds or pledges to pay in the future, which later, as after last war, would be whittled down to nothing. Why? Simply because they cannot pay. For how long does the honourable member think that a poverty-stricken, war-starved Europe, or even Great Britain, can continue to pay the high wheat prices at present obtaining? The devastation after World WarI . was as nothing compared with that resulting from ""the recent war. Canada, with a faith in the efficiency of pooling and organized marketing, stored its wheat after the first world war, and endeavoured to hold Europe and other purchasing countries to ransom as regards prices.. As a result, the governments of Germany, France, Italy and other European countries encouraged an increase of production, -and they succeeded to such a degree that those countries produced more wheat than was needed to meet their own requirements. In 1933, France exported 1,500,000 tons of wheat. [Extension of time granted.""] In Germany, wheat was denatured, and wheat prices the world over fell to a disastrous level in 1929-30. The position in Europe being what it is torday, a greater inducement than ever will be provided for the production of as much wheat as possible; and that must have repercussions on Canada, Argentina and Australia. Our production methods must be efficient if we are to be prepared for the possible fall of prices. Unless the bill be based on prices that would make it possible for the government of the day to meet a period of low prices without seriously affecting the internal economy of the country, the growers and the people of Australia will be facing a serious risk. member intend to deal with the bill? from the honourable member about the right of the grower to export his product at remunerative prices. What the honourable member argues now with regard to wheat has labour. Why not export labour, if shipping could be made available for that' purpose? The basic wage in the United States of America is equivalent to £21 night, I heard disapproval expressed by members of the Opposition because cloth was being exported to the disadvantage of ex-servicemen and other civil users, in order to obtain a high price for it. It would be wise for the wheat-growers to refuse to be led astray by the fallacious arguments of the honorabl emember for Indi. Sitting suspended from 5.J$ to 8 p.m. [8.0] -This bill represents another step in the long and chequered history of the wheat industry in Australia. This afternoon we heard a statement delivered with great clarity and some force by the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard); but nowhere in the whole of his speech did he offer either praise or criticism of the bill. Within the lifetime of almost every member of this House, and certainly within the recollection of all those connected with the wheat industry, great changes have taken place in its organization, in marketing methods and in the degree and nature of government interference with the industry. Let us go back to the period immediately before the outbreak of the 1914-18 war. At that time, there was no talk of pools or of government interference. The grower could select his land anywhere he liked, and on it he sowed whatever area of wheat he liked. The only market was the open market. During the first world war the farmers, for the first time, found themselves' obliged by law to surrender to the Government all the wheat they grew. The wheat was put into pools, which were managed indifferently. Not so much was known then as now about the control of weevils and mice, with the result that losses of wheat were very heavy, and the resulting political bitterthe honourable ness had its repercussions in the Commonwealth Parliament. Immediately after the conclusion of the first world war, a great battle' took place as to whether the system of compulsory pooling should continue, whether there should be a volun-' tary pool, or whether the system of open marketing should be restored. Those equal application to engaged in the industry were still debating these propositions up to the time of the disastrous drought of 1927-29. Then,' in 1930, when the season was good and crops",38,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod

125,Mr Pollard,I heard a great deal,39,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod
126,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"were abundant, there came the price crash due to the depression. It was then that the industry entered a new phase of political development, a phase through which we are still passing, and of which this bill is the culmination. The growers, through no fault of their own, but because of low prices, were not able to meet their commitments. Many became insolvent and had to go off their farms. The Chief Secretary in the Hill Labour Government in South Australia, who was in office at the same time as the honourable member for Ballarat was a Minister in Victoria, visited Jamestown, in the north of the State, and told the farmers that the only remedy for them was to go through the bankruptcy court. tive Council to contend with. himself a member of the Legislative Council, and the Government had a large majority. When the price of wheat fell, a royal commission was appointed by the Lyons Government, and it brought in a voluminous report and made numerous recommendations; but, as often happens in such cases, nothing much was done about'it. The fortunes of the wheat industry change from year to year, and what might be a good remedy in 1935 might have no application at all in, 1936 or 1937 by the time the Government applies the remedy. As the honourable member for Ballarat remarked, the year 1930 was notable for an attempt by the Scullin Government to do something for the benefit of the wheat industry, but the honourable member did not tell the whole story. He told only that part which was of use for the purpose of Labour propaganda. The,fly in the ointment was that the proposal of the Scullin Government to guarantee a price of 4s. a bushel for wheat, a proposal which the Senate rejected on the deciding vote of the late Senator E. B. Johnston, provided that each State government should bear half the cost of putting the scheme into effect. The Commonwealth Government was itself virtually insolvent at that time, so it can.be imagined that the various State governments were in an even worse position. In particular, the Governments of South Australia and Western Australia, with their small populations and large wheat production, were in a worse position than New South Wales and Victoria. The honourable member for Ballarat referred to an interview with the late Sir Robert Gibson, and to the fact that Sir Robert declared that he would not lend money to the Government of New South Wales led by Mr Lang. If the honourable member had been a director of the Commonwealth Bank at that time, would he have lent money to Mr Lang? tion, yes. like the honourable member to say whether he would regard any of the propositions which Mr Lang put forward at that time as sound. It was also proposed to stabilize the industry, to provide for debt adjustment, and to fix a home-consumption price for wheat. To listen to some honourable members opposite one might be excused for believing that no government other than the present one, had ever attempted to do anything for the wheat industry. When the flour tax legislation was first before Parliament, the Labour party voted solidly against it. Later, indeed, a Labour government abolished the tax. Then the war came, and a government of which I was not a member found it necessary to adopt measures to control the agricultural assets of Australia, in our own interests, and in those of the United Kingdom. It was stated this afternoon that a very ""low price was paid for wheat stocks then on hand in Australia, and it has been suggested that the reason for not paying more, in accordance with the recommendations of Judge Payne, was that the wheat was held by merchants and speculators, and not by the farmers. I put it to honourable members opposite that they cannot stand on two different grounds. Either the wheat was owned by the growers and the Menzies Government did an injustice to them, or the present Government did an injustice to them when it refused to carry into effect the recommendations of Judge Payne who investigated this important matter. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Lemmon) had something to say about the position of the wheat industry in this country in 1940.

His comments were these(i) 3s. 10M. f.o.r. ports for first 3,000 is the question of the inclusion of the bushels -This is the principle of the Bobertson 1945-46 crop. I have been informed by Plan.

It is also a principle of the 1945-the Prime Minister first having Wilson-Uppill Plan. (iii) Home-consumption price 4s -This is the right honourable gentleman gave an presumably a means of raising part of the fund to meet the guarantee under ( i ) . It is undertaking that the full realization price apparently a home-consumption price to the would be paid for the 1945-46 crop. Mr consumer. (iv) Flour tax unnecessary -This is so only I have his authority to use that informawhile the National Security Act makes it possible to have a pool. In peace-time, the tion. Hour tax is necessary for the above scheme unless the Constitution is amended. On the question of a home-consumption price of 4s. a bushel, I point out that normally two-thirds of our wheat is exported, so that, in effect, what the home consumption price would have done, would have been to have increased the over-all price by one halfpenny a bushel from the delectable figure of 3s. 10^d. a bushel to a retail trader's price of 3s. l i d a bushel. That was the Labour party's method of dealing with the wheat industry in 1940. Its members tried to offer something to the grower-certainl y they offered a bribe to the consumer. . They were angling for the consumers' vote, but they also wanted the growers vote. It is equally true that we asked the growers to make a sacrifice. The Labour party offered a bribe and in these circumstances it is not difficult to understand who is likely to come off best. I believe that there was no necessity for either a sacrifice or a bribe. The proper thing to do was to pay the grower in time of war a reasonable price for his product, because after all, military operations cannot be carried on for very long by any country unless it has adequate food supplies. I come now to the measure now before the House. It is a very important bill. It was not conjured out of the air. It has an interesting history, part of which is known to the public, and part is not known. I do not think that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr at all;. it is merely a taxing measure. Scully) will endeavour to deny that he met representatives of the wheat industry in Sydney and elsewhere and discussed this measure with them, or that the bill that he has presented to Parliament is not the proposal that he bad in [91] mind originally. In my opinion the bill has certain serious faults. First, there MrH . K. Nock, a former Minister in refused to meet the wheat-growers-that Nock was present at that deputation, and Mr ,SCUXI.Y I was present too, and I have not spoken before on that matter. I shall give the true story. Minister will have an opportunity to do that later. This matter has a direct bearing on one of the important points in the scheme. Furthermore,. I say that the 1945-46 crop was sown, grown, and practically reaped, under war conditions, and delivered to the Commonwealth, not by the free will of the growers, but under the force of the National Security Regulations.. Therefore the Government has iio justification morally, or, I believe, legally, to take from the grower what is his right under the National Security Regulations. There is also the question of a wheat stabilization policy being submitted to a poll of growers. I believe that if the words we have heard so often from honourable members on the other side of the House are to bear -any fruit, any practical results whatever, then the Government and its supporters who claim to be concerned about the growers should take their courage-if they have anyin both hand's-if their hands are not already full-and submit this bill, direct to the wheat-growerg and obtain their opinion upon it. I would not be surprised if the verdict of the growers would be far from what honourable members opposite would desire it to be. This bill does not provide for a stabilization plan It proposes to take away from the grower at a time when high prices are rulingand high prices may rule for some time aheada considerable amount of money and place it in the Treasury for use against some future contingency. The",41,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod
137,Mr Archie Cameron,"TheMinister's second-reading speech on this bill contained one of the most serious contradictions I have ever heard in this chamber. In introducing the bill the Minister said1 The effect will be to remove the feature which disturbed the industry most in the past: that is, the impact of unduly low prices. It will be replaced by a system under which wheat-farmers will know, for a period of years in advance, that they will receive a definite price for,, their wheat. They can plan their farm programme with an assured return, and wjth the knowledge that they will not be ruined by market .changes which cannot be foreseen or controlled. Later he made this staggering statementI t is not proposed, nor intended, that renot been given any information is the turns shall be permanently out of line with the export price, nor that the industry will be continually subsidized. Two-thirds of our wheat goes on to the export market, and we must compete with other countries for our markets. The plan gives time for adjustments to meet changing world conditions, and it protects growers against a rapid fall on the export market. It cannot relieve them of the need to meet world competition in the export trade. It is hoped, however, tliat an effective international agreement will prolegislation to be passed hy the States and tect export markets in future. For the next five years, however, come what may in the export field, growers are guaranteed the effect of a world slump. They will not receive, in any one of the five years less than 5s. 2d. Those two statements constitute"" one of the most amazing contradictions of policy I have ever heard uttered in this chamber. I do not know how many honourable members opposite representing wheat districts can read the Minister's speech and reach any conclusion other than the one I have arrived at. The next point is the question of hidden legislation. The manner in which this bill has been presented to this House is, to say the least,peculiar. During the Minister's second-reading speech on the bill now before us reference was made to the Wheat Export Charge Bill, but that measure was not brought before us until about a fortnight later. Usually cognate bills of that description would be introduced simultaneously. In this instance, however, we are still further in the dark because we do not know the contents of . the legislation which will be submitted to the State parliaments. Whilst it is not competent for us to be supplied with advance copies of measures which may be introduced into the State parliaments it Mr Archie Cameron. is surely within the competency of Ministers, having had two or three conferences with State Ministers on this subject, to indicate the principles of the legislation . which will be introduced into the State parliaments. Then, having obtained an outline of' those principles, and having the two cognate bills before us, we can determine exactly how the legislation as a whole will work out. At present we are asked to pass two bills in complete ignorance of what is to be done in the Statespheres We can guess, and perhaps our guess may be fairly near the mark; but that is not good enough. One of the things about which we have question.of the future expansion of the wheat industry. That has not been referred to during this debate beyond the general statement that opportunities will be given to farmers'' sons. and ex-soldier settlers to enter the industry. I should like to be assured on that point. I am not at all sure that that is to be provided for in the until that legislation is sighted by us we do' not know whether or not that aspect is satisfactorily covered. I do not wish to raise the ex-soldier settler question unduly; I merely content myself with pointing out that there are thousands of young men being discharged from the forces who will wish and will be entitled to grow wheat introductory in Australia and that they should be given some preference in order to enable them to do so. When I look at the present Government, I often say to myself that, as far as the ex-soldier is concerned, he may or may not "" get a go "". And when I look at the front bench on,the Government side, I also say to myself that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a returned soldier to pass through the Cabinet door into a Labour government. there is the position of the grower who will be taxed heavily to build up a fund which will be entirely in government hands and entirely at the government's disposal. That fund will not be an Australian fund; it will be built up in London as the result of exports made to",42,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod
138,Mr Speaker,Order!,43,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod
139,Mr Archie Cameron,"Thenother parts of the world. Therefore, the Australian wheat-grower will be contributing 2s. 2d. a bushel to build up London funds, the utilization of which will be entirely at the discretion of the Commonwealth Government for the next five years, and beyond that time if the scheme is still in existence. That is a position we cannot tolerate with equanimity. There is the position, too, of the individual grower. Supposing after making two or three years' contributions a grower meets the Grim Reaper, or at best he retires from the wheat-growing industry. It has been argued that a grower should not be allowed to take his land out of wheat production. I shall be extremely surprised if the measures to be submitted to the State parliaments will contain any provision, even to compel a grower to sow his licenced acreage. Unless a grower is compelled to do that, one could not argue against him going out of the wheat growing industry altogether. If having contributed for several years and having built up certain funds some one in authority says to him, "" Too had old boy; you go out and get nothing "" ; What is his position? We have not had any information from the Government on that point and I am afraid there will be many awkward questions coming from growers with respect to it. In regard to the question of the home consumption price I remind honourable members that it was laid down in the Gepp report, to which reference was made this afternoon; that on a'n average, the cost of producing' wheat was then 3s. 6d. a bushel f.o.r. ports. When one deals with the question of the cost of production, especially in a wide-spread industry such as the wheat industry, one can only hope at best to get a rough average I say, however, that considering the general economic conditions which prevail in Australia, and the protection afforded to secondary industries, by bounties and tariffs, and so on, and the protection provided by Arbitration Court awards for the average working man, that the time has come when the growers of Australian wheat are entitled to the full average costs of production plus a margin of profit for that portion of the crop which is consumed within the Commonwealth. I believe that before very long the present Government-or , maybe, its successorswill be obliged to formulate and introduce legislation making such a provision. The honourable member for Indi( Mr McEwen) raised the vexed question of the sale of wheat to other industries at a price below the market value. That cost will remain a burden upon the growers. It is bad business morally to expect growers of wheat, or of any other product, to make it available to any other industry at a price below the fair market price. I doubt very much whether the Government will succeed in pleading that case with the wheat-growers. It would be unprofitable to buy wheat at the present price of about 10s. a bushel, the highest that I remember, in order to produce eggs and pork; but that is no justification for the Government saying that those commodities must be produced and wheat-growers must supply wheat at half the market rate in order that they shall be produced. That kind of business and political morality will not go down with the wheat growers. The guaranteed price is to be 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. for a period of five years. The Minister has not told us how that figure was arrived at, or whether the Government consulted the stars, or pulled the figure out of a hat or whether it went back to the much abused Lyons Flour Tax Act and made the selection there. The Government has made no explanation as to how it arrived at that figure. As to the duration of the scheme, I believe that .a period of five years is too short. It would be better to remove wheat, if possible, from the arena of party politics. However, a period of ten, or even seven years, would be preferable. . will accept the five-year period. vernment, of course, has the numbers to force the bill through the Parliament; but I remind the honourable member that in the last Parliament, when the, numerical strengths of parties were different, the Government was most complacent ' and obliging.

I am of .the opinion that after the next elections, should fate be so unkind as to return the present Government, its numerical strength will be sadly reduced and honourable members",43,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod

141,"Mr Archie Cameron""","The Goopposite will be in a much more accommodating frame of mind than we have found them to be in this Parliament. I turn now to a matter which requires to be cleared up. I refer to the clause in the bill Avhich deals with the premium which is to be paid for wheat of a .special quality. The Minister, in his second reading speech, did not explain the meaning of that clause. I was a grower of wheat for over twenty years, and I sold wheat to flour-millers at ,a premium of 3d. a bushel. But that is not the normal trade practice in. Australia. It is the normal trade practice in Canada and the United States of America. In those countries a grower is paid according to the quality of his wheat when it is delivered. Every good farmer would be perfectly happy to see instituted in Australia a system under which a grower was paid for his' wheat according to -quality. The clause to which I refer hints at the institution of such a system, but does not say whether that system is to be carried out. of that system in the past, have been the wheat merchants. be interested to hear my friend accuse me of being a supporter of the wheat merchants. The clause hints at a system under which wheat will be"" paid for according to quality -market in the last twenty years, namely, followed for many years past. aware of it. I ask any honourable member who is a wheat-grower to tell me what price he has received from the pool for wheat above fair average quality. I have received a premium, but not from the pool. terjection of that kind from a Minister is a little bit "" over the fence "". That United States of America, Great Britain is not a statement which should be made by a Minister. I have received from the firm of Pflaum Brothers, Birdwood, a premium of as much as 3d. a bushel above fair average quality for wheat of a higher quality. If this system is to be introduced, jet it be .introduced as a system. depend on whether the Minister, or the Australian Wheat Board, thinks fit that it should be paid for a parcel of wheat. In the wheat trade a parcel is 500 tons. No grower will ever deliver' 500 tons. Does this mean that after the grower has passed in his wheat as fair average quality, a particular parcel can be got together by the board ? The Minister should clarify the clause. just does not understand the position with respect to the payment of a premium. freely that there are many things in the measure which I cannot understand; and there will be a lot of people in Australia who will be in the same position as myself in that respect. I assure the Minister that at the committee stage, when we are dealing with the measure clause by clause and line by line, he will he given full opportunity to explain many things. The last point with which I wish to deal is the future of the industry. That is one of the most, interesting aspects about the industry, and one on which the Government has been singularly silent up to date. After the war of 1914-1S great changes took place in the wheat industry throughout the world. Wesawthe disappearance from world trade of Russia,one of the great producers of wheat which has only once intruded upon the iii 1923. After the conclusion of World War II . we see other great changes taking place in the wheat industry due to the victory of that power. The whole of the wheat lands of Germany, Poland, Hungary, Roumania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia have passed under the control of Russia. In the division of Germany between the Allies the wheat and rye growing areas have passed under Russian control, but the great majority of the people who have to eat that wheat 'and rye has passed under the control of the and France. To-day, there is no traffic on the river Danube, which is one of the great wheat arteries of the world. The wheat produced in Roumania, Bulgaria. Hungary, and a part of Yugoslavia used to be taken upstream to Germany and Austria; but owing to Russian action To-day, it seems to that traffic has ceased completely.

149,Mr Archie Cameron,"I admitthe Danube is a closed river. In view of tiie policy carried out by Russia in the past, what is to be the future of the wheat industry of Europe, and the availability of European-grown wheat to those parts of Europe which stand outside the Russian-controlled zone? If Russia carries out the policy which it followed after World WarI . that wheat will be denied to the rest of Europe. . This will throw upon the other wheat-growing countries of the world a much greater effort to supply wheat, but I suspect that in that instance, as in all other instances, world wheat policy will be dictated by the Russian Foreign Office. In a time of plenty, surplus wheat from Poland, the Balkans and Germany will be thrown on the European market in order to ereate unrest among the peasants, whereas when wheat is scarce grain from the Russiancontrolled areas will be denied, except at high prices, to the workers in the big cities of Europe in order to cause dissatisfaction. To-day in Europe exist some of the most explosive factors which could be introduced into any international situation. It should pay honourable members, especially those representing wheat areas, to investigate that phase of the subject. The next thing I have to deal with is the influence of mechanization on wheat production, not only in the Balkans, Germany and Poland, but throughout the world. After the 1914-18 war we did not have anything like the degree of mechanization that we have to-day. Yet we saw the building up of wheat supplies. The degree of mechanization in Russia is extensive, but not so great as in the United States of America and Canada. But Argentina is well behind. The May issue of Broomhill's Corn Magazine shows that Argentina wheat acreage is down because Argentina does not have the machinery with which to sow to its full capacity. The journal also sets out the position in Europe. In Greece ,the bread allowance for an adult male has been reduced to 9 oz. a day, and in Vienna the position is worse, because in May, the allowance was reduced to 24 oz. a week. In other words, three-quarters of a 2-lb'. loaf has to last an .adult male a week. Honourable members will see that .there is every justification, with the hunger that Europeans are suffering, for increased wheat acreages and no justification for limitation of acreages in any wheat-producing country. It would be un-Ohristian, .uncharitable and unthinkable to restrict production of any commodity wanted for human consumption. The enigma is what will be the policy of the Soviet. It controls at least 30 per cent, of the world's ""wheat outside its own borders, 12-"" per 1 cent, of the world's maize in Yugoslavia, Rumania and Bulgaria, where maize is grown to a much greater extent than wheat, and 90 per cent, of the world's rye. Its stranglehold, if it cares to use it, on the grain supplies of the world is serious. I am not going to prophesy hoAv long the. crisis will last. I do not know the factors that will go towards determining wheat supplies and consumption, but I do know that the degree of mechanization is much greater than it was after the previous world war, fertilizers are better understood, wheat varieties have improved, and larger and faster ships can take more wheat more rapidly from where it is grown to where it is needed for human consumption. The trend, in my opinion, will be towards a quicker recovery in Europe, than is perhaps allowed for in certain quarters here. I have an abiding faith in the peasants of Europe to stand up to hard . conditions and get the crops in when the onus is placed upon them. But I do not know by what number of thousands the wheateating peoples of Europe have been reduced as the result of war and the famine that is stalking through different parts of Europe. That is an important factor. I am not attempting to deal with Asia. That is another story. It has to do with rice. This bill deals with wheat. I do not know the damage that may have been done to land, plant and stock. I doubt whether any man in Australia has the correct picture of those factors. SoI say we can go on with this measure only from year to year. In my opinion, there will be no great danger of wheat prices falling below perhaps 6s. a bushel until we have visible world supplies of not less than 600,000,000 bushels i i i store. So far as our local economy is concerned, I do not know what will be the trend of costs of production, but I am fairly confident that bill was defeated by the so-called that costs will increase as theresult of Country party members in the Senate. It policies enforced and the inflationary syswas and is a country party in name only. tem in being to-day. Therefore, however I pass on to the depression years.

150,Mr Langtry (Riverina) ' [8.45],"I have the interests of'the wheat-growersfought hard in an effort to obtain 4s. a bushel for. the first 3,000 bushels of wheat produced by them. I attended many meetings of farmers at that time. There were also numerous deputations to the then government. About 80 per cent, of the wheat-growers of Australia are what are usually described as small farmers. They appealed to the then government for a price fo'r their wheat which would enable them to pay their way, but their appeal fell"" on deaf ears. It remained for the present Government to give to the farmers a payable price for their wheat. Previous governments, consisting of the parties now in opposition, refused to meet the farmers in any way, yet to-night honourable mem : bers who supported those governments say that more should be done for the wheat-growers. Could any action he more hypocritical? I remind honourable members opposite that the wheat-growers want more than talk; they want results, and they have had them from the Labour Government. The present Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and I told the farmers that if a Labour government were elected it would see that 4s. a bushel was paid for the first 3,000 bushels of wheat produced by any wheat-grower. A Labour government was elected, and that promise was honoured. A previous government brought in what it described as a wheat stabilization scheme, hut it was not a plan at all. It did not even provide for a guaranteed price. Under it, a sum of £26,750,000 was set aside for an estimated crop of 140,000,000 bushels. I said at the time that that plan did not guarantee 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.b., as was claimedfor it. Under that so-called scheme, no farmer could say what he would get for his wheat. All sorts of false statements were made regarding that scheme, both in this Parliament and in the newspapers. It was claimed that it provided for a guaranteed price for wheat, but it did not do so. Farmers were told that they would be paid for only 140,000,000 bushels, although the crop amounted to 153,000,000 bushels. . The president of the Farmers and Settlers Association told farmers at Temora that in the event of the crop exceeding 140,000,000 bushels the sum of £26,750,000 would be spread over the whole crop. It will be seen, therefore, that there was no guaranteed price for wheat at that time. Fortunately for the farmers of Australia, the non-Labour government that had not interested itself in their welfare was putout of office and a Labour government which paid the guaranteed price for the * total wop of 153,000,000 bushels took its place. The Australian Wheat Growers Federation is truly representative of the wheat-growers of Australia, because only persons who have planted at least 50 acres of wheat can be members of the organization. The Farmers and Settlers Association, on the other hand, does not confine membership to practical farmers, and the result is that any one can be a member and not have at heart the interests of the wheat-growers. At a conference held in Sydney the present Government submitted to representatives of wheat growers a plan which was not acceptable to the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. The Government's proposal was for 4s. 8d. a bushel f.o.b., but the federation did not think that the price was high enough. That was my view also. Representatives of the federation discussed the matter with the Government, with the result that the Government agreed to a guaranteed price of 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.b. It was also' agreed that the 1945*46 harvest should be included in the guarantee on a fifty-fifty basis. It is incorrect to say that the Australian Wheat Growers Federation is not in favour. of this bill. For the information of wheat growers, I place on record the names of the delegates who attended the conference held in ""Sydney on the 11th December, 1945. They. were -H . T. Chapman (South Australia), W. J. Marshman (South Australia); J."" E Maycock (South Australia), C. T. Chapman (South Australia), E. Walker (Western. Australia), F. Rooke (Western Australia), K. Jones (Western Australia), J. W. Diver (Western Australia), H . K. Nock (New South Wales), H . S. Roberton (Few South Wales), T. P. Gleeson (New South Wales), G. Gibbons (New South Wales)', F. H . Cullen (Victoria). T. W. Lilley (Victoria),.and T. C. Stott the general secretary. They represented the wheat-growers of Australia, and they accepted the Government's plan. Yet the honourable member for Indi and other honourable gentlemen opposite considered -that those delegates were not capable of -representing the wheat-growers and did :not have authority to accept the plan. I state definitely that they were so authorized. Unfortunately, some of the gentle* men who attended that conference have since condemned the plan. Unfortunately, some of the gentlemen who were present at the conference, which agreed to the plan by a majority vote, have since criticized the scheme. In my opinion their views are not worthy of consideration. Some opponents of the plan deliberately make untrue statements for the purpose of misleading the wheat growers as to the actual position. I compliment the Government on having made a genuine effort to stabilize the wheat industry. In my experience, which extends over many years,this is the best plan that has been dev-ised in the interests of wheat-growers. Some honourable members opposite complained that the plan will expire after five years. That view is not correct. . The plan may continue for ten or fifteen years, but it will be reviewed after two or three years. Time brings strange changes. The price of wheat may rise to 5s. or-6s. a bushel, or fall sharply to 2s. a bushel. However, the Government has guaranteed to wheat growers a price of 4s"". 6d. or 4s. 7d. a bushel at country stations or sidings for the next five years, irrespective of the fluctuations of price on overseas markets. If Australian wheat-growers were given an opportunity to express their views regarding this plan, they would approve it by a large majority. Of course, a few wheat growers arc not in favour of it, but it is impossible to obtain complete unanimity. There is always a recalcitrant minority. If the Labour Government offered them £1 a bushel for wheat and 10s. per lb. for wool they would oppose the suggestion on principle. Their attitude reminds me of the reasoning of the Irishman, whose mate said, "" It is a splendid rain."" "" Where is it coining from ?"" asked the Irishman. '-'From the south,"" replied his mate. "" It will not beany good, then,"" declared the Irishman. Some opponents of the Government's plan are so ""one-eyed "" that they do not believe that the Labour party can assist the primary producer in any Mr Lanr/tra. way. I assert that this Government has done a great deal for the man on the land, whether he is growing wheat, wool, rice or fruit, or is raising fat lambs. A l though, under this plan, the Government offers wheat-growers a guaranteed price, honourable members opposite declare that the Minister is not sincere. In turn, they have been members of the Conservative party, National party, United Australia party and Liberal party, and have supported coalition governments, but over the years there has been only one Australian Labour party. Every time we have had an opportunity to help the man on the land, we have improved his standard of living and made him happier and more content. When, at a later date, the Minister. reviews this bill, I should like him to consider the advisability of inserting a safeguard against a sharp decline of price, as has occurred in the past. Provision should be made for a guaranteed price of 4s. 3d. a bushel at country sidings for the first 3,000 bushels. If that be done, the small wheat-grower will always be able to enjoy a reasonable standard of living and meet his obligations. In advocating that view, I speak on behalf of the small wheat-grower. The large wheat-grower is able to 'make, his living in other ways. With the mechanization of industry, particularly of farming,"" wheatcould be overproduced in Australia in perhaps two years. Honourable members opposite have referred to the position of the wheat industry after World WarI . , but I remind them that wheat farming now is vastly different from what it was 25 years ago.. Two men with a tractor can work as large an area in the same period as four eight-horse teams can do. Machinery is also more economical. I hope that the Minister will give careful consideration to my request. Honourable members opposite never inform the House what they did to improve the conditions of the wheat-grower. I shall remind the House of their unsympathetic attitude. When the price of wheat was 2s. 3d. a bushel, the honorwho was then a Minister refused the request of a deputation representing wheat-growers to submit to Cabinet a request for an increase of price,",47,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod

159,Mr Adermann,"This member ofreally one year longer than the term proposed in this bill. With the prospects of a good market, and in view of the fact that in each year within the period for which the scheme will operate, it is likely that the growers will have to make a contribution to the fund, the whole of the stabilization trust fund will probably be provided hy them, whilst the Government will not pay anything. In effect, the Government will make no contribution at all to the cost of stabilization, but will force the growers to make a contribution to protect themselves. An analysis of the bill must prove that contention to be right There is another reason why the 1945-46 crop should not be included in the scheme. Recently this Parliament passed a States Grants (Drought Relief) Bill. The governments of the States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, in conjunction with the Commonwealth Government, have provided over £3,000,000 to assist cereal-growers who lost their crops through drought. Mr .FROST -Does the honourable member object to that? tend that growers should be allowed to recoup heavy losses incurred by drought. No doubt the Minister, who interjects will vote for this iniquitous proposal of the Government. Queensland wheat growers are in a worse position than those in other States. When I moved an amendment to include Queensland within the scope of the States Grants (Drought Relief) Bill, the Government rejected my proposal and every supporter of the Government from Queensland voted against primary producers in that State receiving assistance. Farmers in portions of the wheat-growing districts in my electorate suffered as much loss, as did farmers in the southern States. In the Roma and Chinchilla areas, severe drought was experienced for two years in succession. As no rain has fallen in the wheat growing areas of Queensland 'this season, what will be the benefit of any price guaranteed under the scheme, if the farmers get no crop at all? Yet, under this proposal, Queensland growers who lost their crops for two years in succession, had one good season last year, and will have no crop this year, will be prevented from receiving the full benefit of their labours. Another reason why the No. 9 pool should not be included is the fact that the Government acquired the wheat crops during the recent war under National Security Regulations. I readily grant that the acquisition of the wheat crop for food is vitally necessary in time of war, but it is a distinct breach of faith on the part of the Government to divert portion of the proceeds to a % trust fund which has not relation to war needs. The High Courthas ruled that any property acquired under National Security Regulations must be paid for on just terms. With all due' respect for legal opinion, if the growers took the Government to court on the matter, I have no doubt that they would be permitted to retain the full price received for their crops. Apart from the legal aspect, however, the matter must be considered from the moral aspect, and the fact that the Government has broken faith with the growers is deplorable. In view of the prospectof good market prices prevailing during the term of the proposed agreement, I have no doubt, that ample sums will he paid into the trust fund by the growers, and that they will be sufficient during the period of the agreement to warrant the exclusion of the last crop. member consider that that would be a .desirable position. concerned only that the Government shall receive sufficient in payments by the growers to relieve it of the necessity' for making any contribution at all. My concern is to make the Government face up to its obligation, and also become a contributor. The next matter is the term of the proposed agreement. This is unsatisfactory, because, whilst the bill stipulates a period of five years, the agreement, in fact, covers only four years, because the season 1945-46 has already passed. The last crop to be handled under the proposal is that of 1949-50, which makes the term one year shorter than that under the British-Canadian contract, which was",51,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod

162,Mr Adermann,"The Minister iscompleted at 6s. 5d. a bushel. The bill provides for a price which I regard as unsatisfactory. 5s. 2d. f.o.r. is only equivalent to 4s. 3d. a nomy, but I ' object to the wheat-growers bushel at growers' sidings. With the present high prices prevailing, and the urgent need for wheat, the Government could readily accept the amendment desired by the Australian Country party and make the payment 5s. 2d. a bushel at growers' sidings, with a share to the grower, on a 50 50basis, of the proceeds r from any surplus wheat as sales are made. Any figure that meets the circumstances of. to-day may be quite disproportionate to the costs of production in future years'. We can best protect the growers hy guaranteeing to them a minimum price .covering the cost of production 'and a -fair margin of profit. That is the only basis on which this or any other industry -can survive and thrive. The present basis -of arriving at the price of wheat is out of date. There is need for an authority to ascertain current costs of production so ""that the Australian Wheat Board and the 'Government may be continually aware of those costs and of the circumstances of the farmers. Back in 1932-33, evidence was taken by the Gepp commission, which, after making an exhaustive found that the cost of production at that time was 3s. 6d. a bushel. It must be remembered, however, that the commission allowed only £125 a year living expenses for the grower and his family, and I am sure, that no honourable member would suggest that such an amount would be adequate now. Also, the commission allowed only £1 a week wages and keep for a son employed on the farm by his father. That would also need to be adjusted. The cost of producing a bushel of wheat, in 1938 was 5s. 2d., a figure which can be tested by any commission which may be appointed. The Gepp commission took into consideration all the items involved in the cost of production, including labour, .interest, machinery, rates and taxes, insurance, rail freights, handling charges, seed wheat, cartage, superphosphates, bags, power and maintenance of farm and buildings. I would support any proposal, whether emanating from the 'Minister or elsewhere, 'to set up an authority to determine .the cost of production. Mr Adermann. The proposal to continue a home consumption price for wheat may be necesIn effect, the price of sary, having regard for Australia's ecobeing compelled to make a sacrifice for this purpose whilst the Government evades its responsibility. Obviously, a home consumption price should be financed out of general revenue, to which the wheat-growers would contribute only in the proportion to their incomes. No other industry in the country would put aip with such an arrangement. To-day, the export price of wheatis over 10s. a bushel, but the farmers are not getting the benefit of it. At first, the restrictions imposed under the Scully plan prevented the industry from expanding, and it was further restricted by the shortage of labour and material, and by the effects of drought. NOAV, the Government, by this scheme, which amounts in part to confiscation, proposes to prevent the growers from recouping their losses. Under this cunningly devised sclieme, the growers are required to pay. at the rate of 2s. 2d. a bushel into a trust fund, when they should be receiving the money to enable them to make up for losses incurred in the past. The Minister, in his speech, forecast a continuance of restrictions-not , he said, inquiry, by regulation; but he also predicted that gluts arising out of over-production would be prevented, and how is this to be done except by regulation? Evidently, the Government intends so to regulate production as to avoid making any effective contribution out of the trust fund. The Minister, speaking in 1940 on the proposed wheat stabilization scheme, saidamount So many restrictions will be placed on the industry that I am fearful of the result. One of the most objectionable features of the plan is the proposal to restrict the acreage to be sown next season. That, in itself, is a defeatist policy, aiid is strenuously opposed by the wheat-growers' organizations. I unreservedly endorse those sentiments. Regulations and restrictions have been the curse of the industry. Because of them Queensland farmers could not get feed wheat. Such wheat as was available went to users in the southern States, Queensland being unable to get any quantity, whether subsidized or not. The Minister seemed to suggest that the wheat board shall have on it a majority of growers' representatives, but he did not say how it was to be elected, other than to state that it would be elected as prescribed. He said that State committees would be appointed by himself, and on this point I feel much concern. Does he mean that the Queensland board, elected by the growers, is to be superseded by a committee appointed by the Minister? The record of the Queensland Wheat Board is most creditable. For more than nineteen years it has maintained an average of 4s. 5d. a bushel to growers at sidings, as against the proposed price of 4s. 3d. under the present scheme. I hope that the Minister will allow the growers in Queensland to continue to elect their own board, which could act as a State committee under the general scheme. From the State committee the Minister could select a representative for the central board, but I -should prefer that the growers should make the selection themselves. In fact, I regard that as a basic principle. AgainI quote the words of the-Minister in 1940. The honourable gentleman cited the example of France, where he said primary producers had a majority representation, on marketing boards. He also said that, where departmental officials dominated, he had yet to see the successful operation of any wheat scheme. Little has been said regarding the issuance of permanent wheat-growing licences to returned soldiers. The Minister passed, over that matter very lightly in his second-reading speech by sayingOur normal pre-war basis of production can Lastly, the Government, and not the inbe maintained and it will be practicable to include in the industry soldier settlers and farmers' sons. What steps has the Minister taken to make provision for these people? When I raised this matter in the House a few day ago, the Minister replied, by interjection, that the Commonwealth Government did not have power to grant permanent licences. It is true that the National Security Act will remain in force for a limited duration only, but if this measure has the full support of the States as the Minister has claimed, I see no reason why an arrangement could not be made for the granting by the States of permanent wheat-growing licences to ex-servicemen and sons of farmers who have been brought up in the industry and are entitled to make a living in it. There is an obligation on the Minister to clarify these points. The Commonwealth Government certainly is not making any attempt to inaugurate land settlement schemes for returned soldiers who wish to engage in wheat production, whereas private landholders are assisting the rehabilitation ofex-servicemen by settling returned soldier share-farmers on their properties.' Even when the heavy expense of clearing land and breaking the ground has been carried out, wheat-growing licences are not forthcoming. Lack of power on the part of the Commonwealth to grant these licences is no excuse in view of the fact that this legislation is to be implemented by the passage of cognate measures through the State parliaments. The main points of my opposition to this measure may be summarized as follows: First, I oppose retrospective action. The 1945-46 crop should not be included in this proposal. Secondly, there cannot be any real stability in a four-year period. The term therefore should he extended. Thirdly, the basis of price fixation should be the cost of production plus a fair margin of ju-ofit. Fourthly, from the inception of this plan ex-service personnel should be granted permanent licences to grow wheat. Fifthly, a competent authority should be set up to determine costs. Sixthly, the Australian Wheat Board and State committees should, be elected by . growers, and for a specified period in each instance. These authorities should not be subject to the direction and will of the Minister. dustry, should be responsible for any deficiency in the home-consumption price as compared with the world price. Let U3 by this legislation as we on this side of the chamber propose that it be amended, assist the industry to get out of its present difficulties and give to it the right to enjoy some of the advantages to be derived from the present high price of wheat and to move forward towards a stable and progressive future. pressing support of this measure I believe that I am voicing the opinion of 95 per cent, of Australian wheat-growers. The passage of this legislation by .the Commonwealth and State parliaments, if successfully accomplished, will mark the end of",52,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod
163,Mr Fuller (Hume) [9.45],"-In exa long fight by wheat-growers for the stabilization of the wheat industry. The fight started when the right honourable member for North Hughes), whilst Prime Minister of this country, applied the political axe to the wheat industry at the end of World War I. His expressed view at that time was that trade should revert to its normal channels. What he meant, of course, was that the wheat speculators of Sydney, Melbourne and other capital cities should be permitted once again to fix the return that Australian wheat-growers were to receive for their year's labour. He omitted to say that no matter to what degree the price of wheat decreased, the merchants would receive preferential treatment. The belief of governments that have held office in this country for the greater part of the 45 years since Federaas that party to-day is doing its utmost to tion has been that so long as wheat merchants and other speculators in foodstuffs are happy and contented, in their suburban, mansions, all is well with the country. The attitude of the Nationalist party, later the United Australia party, and now the Liberal party, is traditional, phorically to run the farmer down and and accounts for its rejection by country people, particularly primary producers. We deplore the attitude of the Liberal party towards primary industries. Obviouslv it renders service to the food speculators and other city interests that support it. Members Australian Parliament ungrateful body. They are supposed to favour organized marketing of wheat and other farm products; but in practice the Australian Country party fights harder for portfolios than for organized marketing schemes. The first composite ministry in which the Australian Country party participated was formed in 1923. but the bargain did not include the passage of legislation for the organized marketing of wheat. Why? It included the allocation to the Australian Country party of a certain number of portfolios over which the then Prime Minister( Mr commissioner investigated the wheat' inHughes), and the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), who was the Leader of the Australian Country party at that time haggled; but there was no talk of wheat. AgainI ask why ? The ""Rruce-Page Government remained in Mr Fuller. office until the end of 1929, but no wheat marketing scheme was introduced. In 1930 the Scullin Government introduced Sydney( Mr legislation for a compulsory wheat pool and guaranteed a payment of 4s. a bushel at sidings. That proposal was killed and by whom? It was not killed by the Labour party. We supportedit to a man. It was not killed by the Trades Hall, the coal miners, the wharf labourers, the shearers or the "" farm workers, all of ' whom had been used from time to time by the Opposition as political bogeys. The cold truth is that certain representatives of the Australian Country party in the Senate joined forces with representatives of the United Australia party -no w the Liberal party-in defeating the measure. It was the Australian Country party that killed the measure just kill the measure now before us. I i i the history of Australian polities there has never been a more gross betrayal than the betrayal of the wheat-growers by the Australian Country party. Its leaders have sent out organizers in motor cars metabadger a subscription from him. It obtained money ostensibly for election purposes, but used its power to bargain for portfolios. The wheat-growers should have been given organized marketing at, -the conclusion of the first world war. of the There would then have been no necessity Country party in this for a royal commission to investigate the are an unhappy and insolvent position of the industry; there would then have been no need to disgrace Australia by placing on the statute-book . the Loan (Farmers' Debt Adjustment) Aets.. We would not have witnessed the sorry spectacle of wheat-growers beating a track to the Bankruptcy Court. Country towns would not have lost their populations. All of this, however, happened because members of the Australian Country party in this Parliament were more interested in portfolios than in measures designed to uplift the wheat-growers. When a royal dustry he found it in debt to an amount of £151,000,000. ""When war broke out it was even still deeper in debt. If there had not been war, or if the Labour party had. not found its way to the treasury bench, the wheat-growers, undoubtedly, would still be lamenting. merchants were unable to finance the indnstry, so they gave the United Australia party the "" all clear "". The United Australia party Government then established the Australian Wheat Board, which, in the first place, was a wheat merchants' hoard. I do not know whether they told the Government to "" weigh in light"" on the finances of the wheat-growers, but whether they did so or not the Menzies Government certainly treated the wheat-growers shockingly in that respect. The Australian Country party asked the Menzies Government to provide 2s. 6d. a bushel as a first advance. The right honourable mem-' ber for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) said that that was a lot of money, but that he would stretch a point. Then the honourable mem( Mr Bankin) and other members of the Australian Country party paraded before their electors and told the wheat growers how fortunate it was that there were representatives of the powerful Australian Country party in the Commonwealth Parliament. The growers, they said, were being treated liberally by the Government. Eor the last harvest the present Labour Administration advanced the farmers 4s; 4d. a bushel at sidings. That was Is. lOd. a bushel more on delivery than the previous Administration had given them. Members of the Australian Country party now, however, say that 4s. 4d. a bushel is too little as a first advance. Their words and actions obviously lack sincerity. The real test of a party's sincerity is what it does when it has power and not what it promises to do when it is in opposition. Measured by these standards, members of the Australian Country party should walk out of this chamber and look for a rope and the nearest tree. The right honourable member for Cowper, who presented the wartime wheat plan of the Menzies Government in this House, was quite proud of the measure. It provided a guaranteed, price of 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.b. and also provided that when the price of wheat for export exceeded that figure one-half of the proceeds should go to an equalization fund. The present Government suspended the operation of the equalization fund, shortly after it took office, a matter in respect of which the right honourable gentleman took a doleful view. He exWhen war broke out wheat pressed his disappointment in this chamber with accompanying ""Hear, hears"" from his colleagues. The facts are, however, that if the Government had not suspended the operations of the equalization fund wheat-growers would have made contributions from the Nos. 6, 7 and 8 pools. The returns from those pools are much lower than those which growers will receive from No. 9 pool. In their attempts to stimulate an agitation for the exclusion of No. 9 pool from the present five-year plan, members of the Australian Country party are again exploiting the wheat-growers for party political gain. After making contributions to the equalization plan from the 1945-46 crop, No. 9 pool, the grower will receive approximately 6s. 5d. a bushel f.o.b. for his wheat. Surelyi f there was a. case for deducting 50 per cent, of the excess price over 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.b. ihere is a case for deducting an equivalent percentage over 5s. 2d. f.o.r. The fact that the grower will receive 6s. 5d. a bushel f.o.b. from No. 9 pool strengthens the case. Growers like this plan because it is to operate for five years and not merely for one year. They appreciate also the fact that provision is made for the extension of the scheme beyond five years if desired. The working farmer who has no political axe to grind is not being misled by high prices ruling in the export market at the moment. He has been through bad times and does not want to experience them again. There are a few farmers who object to sharing the excess over the 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. with a stabilization fund. It will be returned with interest when prices recede, as they will all too soon. I believe that evp.ry Labour member in the Commonwealth and State Parliaments will support the bill. The Labour party believes in the organized marketing of -primary products. To members of the Australian 1 Country party I say that the days when they could pull the wool over the eyes of the farmer are ended. Their frantic efforts to stimulate opposition to the measure will influence only a handful of growers. Members of the Australian Country party realize how , barren is their record in this House; and the farmers of Australia are also well",54,Allocation Over The Five Year Pebiod

Mr Marshman said: A Political Move The following, "" TIic regrettable feature of the whole opposition is that it is a political move more than anything else. A t the last Country Party conference I listened to.the debate on the wheat stabilisation plan when the resolution was carried asking for 5s. 2d. per bushel at growers' speech in favor of this motion.. As I listened my mind went back a very few years and I reflected on a visit that I had to Canberra with a deputation from the Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers' Association, when we requested the Men/.ies-Country Party Government to make a payment of 3d, per bushel to growers on wheat that had been delivered to tliu 1939-40 Pool. During that visit, we interviewed Mr Cameron, the then Minister for Commerce, and were in no way encouraged by his attitude towards us. in the corridors of Parliament House and made known to him the purpose of our deputation, and requested his support. .The reply we received was: I refuse to embarrass the Government on sncli a matter at this time."" It so happened that a short time previous Co this visit to Canberra, the Association had written to all Victorian members of the Federal House requesting that each should declare his attitude towards the Association's effort for just treatment for the grower*, pointing out in this circular that, if support was not offered, we would be compelled to pledge our support to a candidate who would foster our claim. members of the deputation were in his room -it Parliament House, Canberra, he referred to this circular, which was on his table, and angrily remarked that he resented such an approach to him and would ignore the circular and the body that sent it .

The explanation given was that it was desired that the ordinary channels of trade should not be disturbed more than was absolutely necessary. I find it particularly difficult to reconcile the men that were and the men that are, and would warn growers to be most cautious about taking action to destroy a substance whilst they go out to chase a shadow. In reply to a question at the Country Party conference as to whether there was a limit to the quantity of wheat on which the Federal Country Party would guarantee 5s. 2d. would sign a blank cheque.""

How squirm when they feel the lash. The arguments of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) like a tub with a hole in it, will not hold water.

The first part, which was supposed to deal with the bill, butdid not, he read rather badly. The second part consisted of some comment made by a member of some organization or ' other. He read that equally badly. The third part was the worse of the lot, because it had nothing whatever, to do with the bill. It is a_ strange thing that, with the exception of the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr. Pollard), no Labour members claiming to represent rural constituencies have dealt with the b ill , ' and the honourable member for Ballarat merely skated around it. I propose to deal with the honourable gentlemen opposite measure. I consider that the hill fails utterly to solve the problem that it purports to solve. It is entitled the Wheat Industry Stabilization B ill , but honourable members opposite have forgotten that it purports to stabilize the wheat industry. It provides a part of a scheme under which the Commonwealth Government and the State governments are seeking to stabilize the wheat industry for five years. The principal provisions of the scheme are to licence production, to licence those who may receive the wheat produced and to provide a minimum price for wheat f.o.r.",57,Wbeck Eks

There are only five here to listen to this important debate. Mr Coif ELAN I rise to order. Is the honourable member for Warringah in order in stating a deliberate untruth about the number of members of this side that are present? Riordan) -That is not a point of order. ""honourable member for Warringah said that only five members who occupy seats on this side of the House were present. honourable members opposite representing wheat-growers were present. the point of order? ber for Warringah is the most offensive member of the House. no point of order. mentary upon honourable members opposite claiming to represent wheat-growers that so few of them should be present when this important bill is being debated. r The bill involves important principles. The first is the assumption that wheat production costs will remain static for five years. No more fundamentally stupid assumption could be made. The bill ""pretends to stabilize wheat prices on the basis of 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. for five years. I shall not deal with the equity of that price at this stage, but shall have more to say on that aspect later in my speech. ' At the moment, I propose to deal with a fundamental economic fallacy, namely, that, in a world of rising costs, the cost of production, in the wheat industry will remain constant for a period of five years. One does not need to be a wheat-farmer to realize that that it not a sound foundation for any legislation. In order to show that that is not my view alone, I propose to direct attention to a report by Professor Copland, whom the Government has appointed as Australian Minister to China. In a report nn economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Canada, Professor Copland, writing in his capacity as Economic Consultant to the Government, draws attention to the fact that in those three countries stabilization schemes are based on the possibility of changing costs. I should like the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) to correct mo .if T am stating wrong premises when I say that the Government's scheme is remain static. The guaranteed price is not to vary for the whole five years for which the scheme will operate. In his report, at page 15, Professor Copland statesIn Great Britain, the Minister for Agriculture has announced a four-year plan under which a review of the financial position of representative farms will be made each. February in consultation wit h representatives of the. farming industries. On the basis of this review, and after discussion with the representatives of the industry, a guaranteed price will be announced which the Government will maintain for the products of the industry concerned for that year . . . It is important to note that the method of guarantee is to a certain extent subject to frequent adjustment according to' changing conditions. In other words, he emphasizes the clear economic truth that we are living in a world of economic change. Any sound stabilization scheme for the next five years must have regard to the fact of changing costs. Professor Copland's report continuesI t is not the intention of the Government slavishly to adopt any figure that may be arrived at merely on the basis of costings. Costs must be a prime consideration. was known to the members of caucus when this bill was presented for approval. If so, the Government's inability to express itself clearly in legislative langauge is revealed in this measure, because it makes no provision whatever for any variation should costs rise, as they assuredly will. I pass on to quote from Professor Copland's report in relation to the United States.of AmericaIn the United States of America the arrangements for guaranteeing prices are much more complicated, though to a large extent automatic in their operation. . The Stabilization Act of 1942 as amended in 1944 provides that",58,Wbeck Eks

180,Mr Spender,"I wonder whether itno maximum price shall be established for farm produce below a price which would return to the producer the higher of the following:(o) the parity price or comparable price; (6) the highest price received by producers between 1st January and loth September, 1942 . . . . Parity is itself the ratio Between farmers' costs and prices in the period 1909-1914. It will be seen that in that great country "" also costs are recognized as a determining factor in fixing prices. In Canada a board purchases all the wheat that is grown. The price paid for the wheat, depends upon conditions which vary from time to time. In Canada, also, costs are a prime consideration in fixing prices. During this debate we have heard many political speeches, but not much has been said regarding the real problem with which the bill seeks to deal. Regarding ' the approach to the problems of the wheat industry in this country, Professor , Copland saidIt would also be desirable to emulate the British or Canadian plan of fixing the prices from time .to time according to changing conditions, and using the guaranteed price mechanism to promote the distribution of resources among the farming products which were most actively demanded. It is sometimes contended that a system of guaranteed prices has the effect tliat the control of production is required if it is to be successfully operated. That is not necessarily true. If the administration . is flexible, it is possible to vary the minimum price in such a way as to encourage or discourage -production according to the relative demand for the different products. This would still leave price as a principal determinant of output in the long run, but would offer farmers the opportunity of transferring from the less to the more profitable of farming operations with a reasonable assurance that they would get a minimum income in the process. An examination of the report makes it clear -that in the three countries that I ""have mentioned costs are a fundamental consideration in determining what the guaranteed price of any product shall be. also that in the opinion of the Government's economic adviser a similar course should be pursued in this country rather than a policy which"" limits production. Both these principles have been ignored in the scheme of the Government, and I desire to know the reason. Although there are only about 60,000 or 70,000 wheat-growers in this country, they constitute an important section of the community. Moreover, whatever is done in connection with the problems associated with the wheat industry must have its influence on the economy of the nation as a whole. As one who does not represent a wheat-growing community,"" hut has taken the trouble to study Professor Copland's reports and recommendations. I want to know why his recommendations have been disregarded, and _ why the scheme submitted to us makes no provision whatever for any variations of costs during the next five years. Will any honourable member say that he believes. that costs w ill remain static for the next five years? No one with a pennyworth of sense would deny that costs w ill move either upward or downward-probabl y upward. Further, will any honourable member deny that fchi stabilization scheme proposes to place limits on production? It purports to f it in with a State scheme, under which I have no doubt wheat-growers w ill be required to apply for licences, which w ill be granted only if certain instructions regarding production be observed. I desire to refer to that particular type of legislation, and I speak as one who has had some experience from the legal stand-point. It is not a new kind of legislation. In respect of quite a number of primary products, we have State legislation which provides that no producer shall engage in the production of a certain commodity unless he has been granted a licence, and usually, the framework of the State acts is to grant or refuse a licence without showing cause -1 have known many occasions when men have been compelled to follow a policy, which is not in legislative warrant, merely because administratively they have been told that, "" Unless you do this, you w ill not be given a licence "". The Government should not ask this Parliament to consider a bill which cannot be considered except as a part of a total scheme. We do not know what the It makes clear State legislation w ill contain. For my part, I voice my strong objection to all legislation of this kind. I have only one part of the picture. The Government informs the Parliament: "" This is the Commonwealth bill "". I ask: "" May we see a copy of the State legislation, because it must be a part of the one scheme? "". We do not know what it may be. The State legislation may contain important and objectionable features of legislation, and this Parliament will not have an opportunity to express an opinion about them.. Because this scheme assumes static costs in this industry over a period of five years, I assert that the plan must be condemned. The second ground of objection may now be considered. This is a stabilization scheme, and it includes the 1945-46 crop. It is well that the growers should know the legal position. When their crop was taken from them-thi s fact cannot be disputed-the y were entitled in accordance with the terms of the Constitution to fair, just and proper compensation for their wheat. What does the Government propose to do now? It does not deny that the wheat is worth more,hut proposes to take away the* additional money by way of a levy. I cannot imagine anything more immoral than seeking to justify a wheat stabilization scheme by taking out of the pockets of the wheat-growers the money which really belongs to them. I shall repeatthe proposition, because the. Government should reply to it. My proposition is that, when 'the 1945-46 crop was taken from the wheat-grower, he automatically had a claim against the Government for full and proper compensation for his product. That cannot be denied. The claim will -not be satisfied, but by an indirect means and perhaps by means which might even he challenged in a court of law, the Government says, in effect, "" It is true that that was the amount of money which we should have paid to you, but now we propose to impose retrospectively a charge upon it so as to support the stabilization scheme in future"". What moral justification can there be for that act? Yet every honourable member opposite who has spoken in this debate has not faced that problem. dealt with it. for Warringah was not here. House during the whole of this debate. If the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Lemmon) did deal with the problem, he failed to make his meaning clear. would not understand even the clearest explanation. ment' will not help save the issue. Let us examine the proposition. I shall repeat it for the benefit of the honourable member for Forrest. When the wheat was taken froni the farmers, they were entitled to full compensation for it. No one can deny that. I contend * that, morally, they are still entitled to it. made a bargain titled to it. What the Government seeks to do is, by a levy operating retrospectively-and retrospective levies are in any ' event objectionable-to take from the grower a portion of the compensation and put it into a stabilization scheme. Those objective facts cannot be disputed. It is a wholly immoral process. If the Government seeks to stabilize the industry, its scheme, should operate from now. The Government has no right to apply it retrospectively. If this policy be defensible, the Government has as much right to go back to 1943-44 and impose a levy for that season. But its plan cannot be justified at all. The third ground on which this bill should be condemned is the limitation of production, which is. inherent in this scheme and must be contained in the State legislation. I make no comment now upon whether this scheme will find constitutional support, having regard to section 92 of the Constitution. I note that clause 10 of the bill purports to give to the board, for the purposes of the export of wheat and wheat products, complete control over the interstate marketing of wheat. I assume that the State legislation will seek to take complete control over infra-state' wheat. By those means, the Government seeks to cover the whole of the wheat field. But I point out that, not so long ago, the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) declared that in the absence of an alteration to section 92 of the Constitution, the Commonwealth could not effectively deal with any primary product. He made that statement not once but many times. His views are contained in official publications of the Government. Therefore, I should like to hear the Government attempt to reconcile its plan with the view expressed by",59,Wbeck Eks

187,Mr Spender,"They are still enan eininenit jurist that a stabilization scheme such as this is legally incapable of being carried into effect. I express my' objection to any scheme which has as its basis the limitation of production, and I support all that was said by the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) on that aspect. In this debate, it has been said that the Government undertakes a re'al risk. I shall examine that statement. It is a wise policy for honourable members to. speak to the bill, and not around it. We shall see what risk the Government takes. I venture to say that it will be obvious that the Government bakes no risk at all, but that the wheat-farmer will not only stabilize his industry at his own expense, but also give a hidden subsidy to all who consume bread and use wheat for fodder! Honourable members"" on this side of the House have been accused of not doing anything to assist wheat-growers. I am impelled to say, as the Minister who was administering the Treasury at the time when the Menzies Government introduced its wheat stabilization scheme, that a comparison of the two plans will show that our scheme, if it were now operating, would be infinitely better for the wheat grower than this Government's plan. I shall cite a few facts, because I believe in keeping to facts, instead of indulging in general political speeches. ""The price of wheat has risen by 6s. 6d. a bushel since 1940. The stabilization scheme of the Menzies Government in 1940 was based upon a price of 3s. 6d. a bushel compared with 10s. a bushel, its present export value. The present Government's 1946 scheme guarantees,, as I shall show, only 2d. a bushel extra for the 1945 crop, compared with the 1940 stabilization scheme, notwithstanding increased costs of production in the meantime. As I shall also show, that small apparent advantage is more than counterbalanced by the greater amount of money which, under our scheme, would have gone to stabilization. This is the Government's scheme: For the 1945-46 crop, the wheat-farmers are to receive 6s. 7d. a bushel for 123,000,000 bushels,, a total of £40,487,500. There is to be a tax of 2s. 2d. a bushel on 63,000,000 bushels, a total of £6,825,000, which is to be paid into the stabilization fund. In short, the total to be paid to the farmers and to the fund will be £47,312,500. Under the 1940 stabilization scheme introduced by 'a government of which I was a member, which was criticized bitterly by honourable members opposite to-night without any regard to the facts, this would be the position: The export value would be 10s. a bushel, less a maximum of Is. a bushel wheat tax, leaving 9s. a bushel. The guaranteed price, plus half the excess, namely, 2s. Td. a bushel, would be 6s. 5d. a bushel, compared with 6s. 7d. a bushel. On 123,000,000 bushels, at 6s. 5d. a bushel, the farmers would receive £39,462,500, and the payment into the stabilization fund on the same quantity, at 2s. 7d. a bushel, would be. £15,8S7,500, a total payment to the farmers and the fund of £55,350,000, compared with a payment under the present scheme of £47,312,500. Those figures are either correct or incorrect. I claim that they are correct. If any honourable member disputes them, let him show me where they are wrong. Therefore, under the 1940 scheme the wheat farmers would have received 2d. a bushel less in cash, but their payments and equity would be £8,375,000 greater than under the present proposal. Therefore, what grounds are there for honourable members opposite to direct criticism against those who sjt on this side of the House? In the long run, the 1940 scheme would give infinitely more protection to the wheat-grower. There are some figures which I should like to have recorded in Hansard. I take as my basis -figures which the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) gave to this Parliament, and I place them under a number of headings. First, I assume that for the next four years the value of wheat on the export market will drop progressively by Is. a bushel a year. That is a fair assumption; because, as the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Adermann) has pointed out, Canada has been negotiating with Great Britain on the basis of an export value of 6s. 5d. a bushel over four or five years. The figures that I now give show the average to be 5s. l i d a bushel. Therefore, the assumption that I make is a fair one, namely, that the export value will drop from 10s. a bushel to 6s. a bushel in the next four years. The record of present prices, taken in conjunction with what occurred after the last war, and the negotiations that have' taken place between the Governments of Canada and Great Britain, as reported, give fair support to those figures. The crop value, based on the export value of the present crop, that is the 1945-46 harvest, and the four succeeding crops, would be £61,500,000, £55,350,000, £49,200,000. £43,050,000 and. £36,900,000, a total crop value for the whole period of £246,000,000. How much is the wheat farmer to get? He is to receive a total of £182,287,500. There is a deficiency of £63,712,500 over that period. Where does that go? Of the total, £21,525,000 goes into' the stabilization fund, and £42,187,500 goes to subsidies to consumers and stock feeders. How, then, can one justify this as a stabilization scheme? That is about the last term that I would apply to it. A scheme.of this description which extracts from the wheat-grower the large amount of £63,712,500 cannot be justified. The amount may be less than that; but it would not be les3 than £40,000,000. The farmer gets only one-third, and the balance goes towards the payment of subsidies in respect of those who consume bread and those who use wheat for fodder. I say, first, that this is not a stabilization scheme; and secondly, that it is a mere pretence to claim that the Government will run any risk at all. Indeed, the Government has worked out what seems to me to be nothing but a political programme, and proposes to make the wheat farmer pay for himself and others for a period of five years, during which, there can be no doubt whatever, the scheme will more than pay for itself. The scheme cannot be justified, on these grounds: first, the payment of 5s. 2d. a bushel will be insufficient, for we cannot assume that the coat of production will remain static; secondly, the inclusion of the 1945-46 crop is morally without justification; thirdly, the adoption of the principle of limitation of production is objectionable from an economic viewpoint; and fourthly, the extraction of' nearly £64,000,000 from the wheat-grower imposes a very heavy burden upon the wheat grower. Mr Spender. I have said enough to direct attention to what appears to me to be the principal features of the bill. The matter upon which I feel most strongly is the need for the Government to' justify before this country the principle of extracting, in the guise of a tax, what really belongs to the wheat-grower. I can only say, as. a lawyer, and as one who considers the principle involved, that if property be taken from a man the one clear obligation is to pay him what it is worth. Even though it may be justified legally, there is no moral right to seek to extract from him a substantial portion of the real value of his compensation by means of a tax. If that be correct, there is no end to which this manoeuvre, or this intrigue if one may use that expression-ca n be employed; because it simply means that one can take from a person wheat or any other property, and then, in flagrantdefiance of at least the spirit of the Constitution, introduce in this House a bill imposing a levy, thus preventing him from getting that which the Constitution clearly states he is entitled to receive. The bill should be withdrawn, as it does not provide for a proper and sound stabilization scheme. The wheat-farmers would indeed be infinitely better off during the next five years if allowed to go oh a free market. The scheme is designed simply as ,a pre-election dodge to enable the Government to say to the farmers "" We have given you a guarantee of 5s. 2d. a bushel for the next five years"". It is clear that there is no chance whatever of the Government during that period being called upon to pay one penny in support of the scheme. his concluding remarks, the honourable ""member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) told us why he isopposed to the bill. He desires the wheat of the farmers to be thrown upon the open market. He is running true to form, for he is an agent of the wheat speculators, who, of course, desire to make fortunes out of wheat by ""farming "" the farmers in future, as they have done in the pastHe has made various statements which, typical of a lawyer, were intended to deceive. I suppose that as a lawyer he believes in the sanctity of contracts, yet he says that the No. 9 Pool should not be",61,Wbeck Eks
188,Mr Mountjoy (Swan) [10.51],"I nincluded in the scheme. The official minutes of the Conference of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation held in Sydney at the close of last year show that the federation decided that, provided the Government met the full request it was agreeable to the 1945-46 harvest being taken into the scheme. This is clearly demonstrated by the following extracts from, the minutes of the conferenceMr Nock moved, Mr Roberton seconded""That the ]945 40 crop be eliminated from the ; plan, and the plan to commence from 1946-47."" After debate . Mr Diver moved, Mr Maycock seconded"" That the question be put."" , This motion was lost. The matter was then adjourned until all other questions were considered. This indicates the matter was fully discussed. After reconsideration, Mr Maycock moved and Mr Marshman seconded"" That subject to the Government accepting (c) (as below) we raise no objection to («)."" (quoted hereunder). (c),""The guaranteed floor price to be 5s. 2d, f.o.r., with participation in the additional return where the crop concerned realized campaign demonstrates that we should more than 5s. 2d."" (o) ""The guaranteed price should apply for five years and should be reviewed within that time with the intention of giving a further guaranteed period. The idea would be to have always a guarantee for.a reasonable time limit, to review it regularly and to make adjustments for the period and the price at each review. The initial period would cover the present crop (1945-46) and the following four crops to 1949-50."" If the honourable member recognizes the member does not like the truth. If his sanctity of contracts, he will have to party were given its proper name, it agree that the 1945-46 crop is being taken would be called "" The wheat speculators' into the pool by agreement with the and the wheat agents' party"" or "" The Australian Wheat Growers Federation, henchmen of the vested interests party "". which represents the growers. The The vested interests party is, of course, honourable member for Warringah also the true name of the Liberals.

It is not long since he called that official a bureaucrat, but he is evidently prepared to hold him up as an authority when it suits his purpose. A regrettable feature of the plan under consideration is that the Government and its supporters are accused of making party political capital out of the wheat stabilization scheme, but that charge is unwarranted. Honourable members opposite are attempting to make political capital from the scheme and the spearhead of .the Opposition to the proposal is the honourable member for Indi with half-baked facts by Mr John Teasdale. knowledge of the wheat industry, but he is so blind politically that he cannot refrain from twisting facts in order to supply political ammunition to the honourable member for Indi. For the last six months the wheat-growers have been subjected to an intense barrage of propaganda from the Australian Country party and its political friends. The whole not place too much reliance on party names. One would assume that members of the Australian Country party would be champions of country interests, but they are not. They are the champions of the wheat speculators. member is "" on the stump stuff"". It appears that the majority of the farmers of the opinion that the bill is a step towards the socialization of production and wealth, which honourable senators on this side of the chamber do not support . .

195,Mr Mountjoy,"The honorableagainst the measure were Senators Colebatch, Lynch, Pearce and KLingsmill, of the United Australia' party, and Senators Carroll and E. B. Johnston, members of the Australian Country party. The latter party then, as now, protected the interests of the wheat speculators. defeated at that time had been introduced by the Scullin Government to guarantee -4s. a bushel at sidings, and the action of the honourable senators associated with the Australian Country party resulted in the farmers receiving only 2s. 4^d. 'a bushel at ports. The crux of the fight was that the plan provided for a compulsory pool, but that did not suit the representatives of the wheat agents in this Parliament, who are fighting the present plan now. When I hear the speeches from the Opposition benches, or read the propaganda in the press of the wonderful things that are to come, if by an unlucky chance the Opposition should be returned to power, I immediately ask why these things were not clone during the years when the parties opposite were in office. We hear promises to-day by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Eadden) that if his party were returned to office the farmers would receive 5s. 9d. a bushel at growers' sidings, and-from the honourable member for Indi that the price should be ys. 2d. a bushel at sidings, but those prices are offered when the Opposition is no longer in office. What did the Leader of the Opposition. ( Mr Menzies) say on (he subject of the wheat industry when he was Prime Minister in 1939? On turning to Hansard, volume 162, at page 1738, I find that on the 29th November of that year he said1 am able to announce that we have arranged not only that the amount of the ndvances wjll be increased to 2s. 10id. a bushel for bagged wheat, less rail freight, and 2s. 84d. a bushel for bulk wheat less rail freight, thus giving an average return of 2s. fid. a bushel on bagged wheat at the country siding, but also that the advances will be paid in one amount as soon as practicable after ""delivery of the wheat. After explaining how finance could be arranged, he went on to sayI most earnestly say to honourable members that these financial proposals represent not only a fair also a generous approach to the problem by the Government. On the following page he is reported as sayingWe cannot continue to provide large sums of public money to support wheat-grower3 while they go on .producing unsaleable grain, such a procedure would be demoralizing and unsound. The hill I am well aware that grain to-day has a ready sale, but prices will not remain high for long. In two or three years' time they will be much lower, and what will be the position .of the growers then if the present opposition happens to be in power, and no stabilization scheme is in operation? We should remember that the Leader of the Opposition has said that, if his party gets into power again, it. will repeal the Commonwealth Bank Act put through Parliament by the present Government, thus taking control of the country's finances out of the hand of the Parliament. We should remember, that after the Scullin Government proposals for the payment of a guaranteed price for 4s. a bushel had been defeated, it attempted to arrange for the payment of a smaller amount, but the Commonwealth Bank Board refused to make the money available. If the Commonwealth Bank were again to be put under the control of such a board as then existed we might find that, at some time in the future, when finance was most needed in order to assist the wheat industry, it would not be available. When the Opposition was in power, it had an opportunity to do the things which it now says the present Government should do. The honourable member a former government, as were other members of the Opposition. Mr Marshman was quoted by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller) on .the past activities of the honourable member for Indi, and they are in startling contrast to his words to-day. Times have changed, and the government of which the honourable member for Indi was a member is not now in power, but the men who were members of that Government haye not changed.

The wheat industry, as is well known, lity of Australia, and should be the subject of informed discussion rather than of This maximum price will make London' parity. We are receiving There arc some who would be preled, ultimately, to the ruin of the industry. The Government, in offering the present plan, is asking the wheat-producers in their own interests, and in the interests of the nation, to forgo a shortterm advantage in favour of a long-term stability of income. Some honourable members, aided by the press, have been loud in their condemnation of the plan, and have spared neither expense nor trouble to damn it; yet they now shed crocodile tears of sympathy with the wheat-farmer. They are condemned by the manner in which they treated the industry for many years. The abandoned farms, the broken homes, the number of men with specialized knowledge who were forced to leave the industry because of the ' action of the Australian Country party and Nationalist governments, and their unwillingness to do anything for the industry, except to make promises which were easily broken and which caused ruin to great numbers of growers, and brought others to the verge of ruin, rise and confront them. In my own electorate I know men who sold their wheat for as low a& Is. a. bushel, and in one disastrous season, when caught by low prices and dry conditions, were left broken and penniless. . Growers have little to hope for from the Opposition if this bill is defeated. Truly, wheat has been described-as political dynamite. If members opposite were one-half as zealous for the industry as they are in protesting their opposition to the Government in the vain hope of winning some of the so-called border-line seats, then the outlook of growers would be bright indeed. This scheme is like a joint savings bank account for the farmer and the Government, except that, though they both pay into the account, only the farmer can draw money out of it. The Government guarantees to pay in if the fund diminishes, truly an ideal arrangement from the farmers' point of view. Just prior to coming here for these sittings of the Parliament, I found in my electorate that, owing to the propaganda issued by antagonists to this scheme, which was featured in the press, the farmers were being misled into believing that they were being cheated of their just dues. That is a pity. We have all suffered the effects of broken promises in the past. We should judge on performances, not promises. This Government did a great Mr Mountjoy. deal for the people over the difficult war years, and it will do even more, if it be given the power. The Government has introduced the wheat stabilization plan as a result of representations made by the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, which, as honourable members know, is a council composed of representatives of various State organizations of wheat growers. Agitation for organized marketing of wheat and a stabilization plan dates back to the last war, when compulsory pools first handled and marketed the Australian wheat crops on an organized ""basis. Growers, vvho at first did not like legislative control of their industry, were firmly convinced by the end of World WarI . that organized marketing of -wheat was a payable proposition, and they strongly pressed the then Nationalist government for a. continuance of compulsory pooling. This was refused. No doubt the Nationalist party gained much financial support from people who had made fortunes out of farming the farmer, and therefore it was not prepared to agree to such a measure. Immediately following World WarI . , an effort was made to organize marketing of wheat through the medium of voluntary pools established in the various States. This was only partially successful because the scheme did not provide a minimum price guaranteed by the Government. Prices for wheat were good at the conclusion of that war. They reached as high as 8s. 10^d. a bushel in 1919-20, but it was not long before they commenced to slump heavily. In 1921-22 the price had dropped to 5s. 5£d. By 1931 prices had reached the low level of 2s. 4£d. a bushel atports, which meant that the grower was receiving somewhere in the vicinity of Is. 9d. a bushel at country sidings. Growers, of course, had not lost sight of their desire for pooling through legislative action, and these low prices merely strengthened the agitation. For ten years prior to World War II . , prices generally fluctuated between approximately 2s. and 3s. a bushel at sidings. During that period growers were consistently asking the Commonwealth Government for organized marketing of their product, and, just as consistently, they were being turned down by the Nationalist party, which by this time had changed its name to the United the grower was receiving a guaranteed Australia party. When World War II . first advance of Is. lOd. a bushel more, broke out, the wheat merchants, as in the wheu he delivered his wheat, than he was case of World WarI . , found themselves able to get from the preceding governunable to finance the industry, and consement. In those circumstances it is very quently their United Australia party clear why growers strongly favour the friends, under the right honourable memcontinuance of organized marketing in the ber for Kooyong( Mr Menzies), were post-war period, and fear being thrown told that it would be all right for them to back to the tender mercy of the wheat take the necessary steps to control the merchants and speculators. It is quite marketing of wheat during the war. It clear that the Government's decision to was arranged, of course, that the wheat give a guarantee of 5s. 2d. a bushel merchants should have strong representaf.o.r. ports for all wheat grown in the tion on the Australian Wheat Board, and next five years is not only in accord with that the Government should provide the the Labour party's platform and policy, finance. Indicative of the attitude of but that it is also in accord with the the Menzies Government towards the cherished objective of wheat-growers'"" grower is the fact that on the first Ausorganizations. The plan will require tralian Wheat Board there were only joint Commonwealth and State action, two growers' representatives on a board and in this respect has already received of nine. Merchants, of course, had strong the endorsement of the Conference of representation. Indicative also, of the Commonwealth and State Ministers and attitude of that government towards the Australian Agricultural Council. The growers was the fact that its guarantee necessary State legislation has been to wheat-growers was only 3s. lOd. a 'drafted and approved by State govern-bushel f.o.b., equal to approximately 3s. ments, and will shortly go before the a bushel net bagged basis at growers' various parliaments. There is much sidings, with a first advance of 2s. 6d. speculation as to what will eventuate a bushel. This guarantee was for a when that happens. marketable crop of 140,000,000 bushels, and in the first year, with a marketable Australian Wheat Growers Federation, crop of 154,000,000 bushels the growers and now chairman of the Australian were left with 14,000,000 bushels without Wheat Board, warned growers some weeks guarantee or protection. When the Labour Government assumed tives would now feel the full efforts of office it changed the composition of the the opposition to the post-war stabilizaAustralian Wheat Board, giving the tion plan. This has been echoed by growers seven elected representatives on other recognized leaders of the wheat a board of nine and, of course, banishing industry.

Later, the latter figure was of the Liberal and Australian Country raised to 3s. a bushel at sidings for overparties. It will be recalled that when quota wheat. Over 70 per cent, of the the Scullin Government in 1930 introproduction came within the 3,000 bushel duced the Wheat Marketing Bill in the quota-and carried the 4s. guarantee. For Commonwealth Parliament, a combinathe 1945-46 crop the Government raised tion of United Australian party and the price over the whole crop to 4s. 4d. Country party members defeated the a bushel bagged basis at sidings as a first measure in the Senate, and thus left the advance. The position was then that industry totally unprotected during the Sir Louis Bussau, first president of the ago that State parliamentary representaperiod of low prices which, followed. Eor the harvest which followed, Western Aus-. tralian growers received 2s. 4Jd. ports, equal to Is. 6£d. a bushel at sidings. There is room for speculation as to whether.history will repeat itself on this occasion. In recent years considerable mechanization has taken place in primary producing industries, and in this respect thewheat industry"" is no exception. ' Its potential production in the post-war years is assessed at from 180,000,000 to200,000,000 bushels yearly. There is every reason to believe that mechanization which envisages the use of heavy tractors and large machines makes that figure quite a probability. This is clear from, the end of Australia to the other, and finding fact that from the 1945-46 harvest approximately 124,000,000 bushels were marketed, despite the drought conditions in Victoria, South Australia and part of New South Wales. The average quantity of wheat marketed over the twenty years before' the war was less than 130,000,000 bushels. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture recently indicated that under the terms of the International Wheat Agreement, Australia will be able to export annually 90,000,000 bushels, and has to keep a reserve of 40,000,000 bushels. About 60.000,000' bushels will be required for home consumption. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) took exception to any control over. production. As an ex-Treasurer, the honourable gentleman must know that it would ' be impossible for any government to continue to guarantee the price of any .primaryproduct unless it. had some control over production. that Western Australia would require a quota of from 30,000,000 to 33,000,000 bushels, which is above the average in that State for the last few years. In 1929, production of wheat in Western Australia totalled 52,000,000 bushels, but that was achieved by bringing into production wheat lands which were too remote to be economic propositions when prices fell. Those lands have since gone out of production, and are now devoted to stock raising. A quota of. 33,000,000 bushels would meet Western Australia's needs at present It is felt that growers Mr Mountjoy. will aim at the production of this quantity. The price for five years will be a minimum of 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. ports for every bushel grown and marketed, and this, will give growers confidence in the years ahead. The plan can be extended under the provisions of the legislation. I am pleased to note that the Minister has -announced that he has recommended to Cabinet that a committee be set up to examine the cost of production. Every honourable member will realize that this will be a difficult task. In 1934 the government of the day set up a royal commission under Sir Herbert Gepp. That commission cost about £50,000, and after extensive research, extending from one that costs ranged from Is. Id. to 19s. l i d . a bushel, brought 'in a finding that so far as could be determined the .average cost of' producing wheat was 3s. 6d. f.o..r. ports. In the light of history therefore, it can be seen that the proposed committee will face a formidable task. Nevertheless, the attempt should be made. As an industrial worker, looking at this problem of wheat stabilization based on a guaranteed price and a compulsory pool, with all the natural sympathy that one worker feels for another, I believe that the industrial worker would never expect to buy farm products below the cost of production. He no' more wants the farmer to be exploited than he wants to be exploited himself. Just as he fights for a fair share in the wealth that he produces, he is prepared to help the farmer fight for a fair, share of the wealth produced from the soil. He does not want the farmer to exploit him, and he does not want to I.understand exploit the farmer. The flour-user of Australia from 1933-34 to 1942-43 contributed £11,529,957 in flour tax. This tax, as honourable members are aware, was for the purpose of assisting the wheat industry. If it.was fair for the people to pay 5s. 2d. a bushel for wheat consumed internally, when wheat was being exported far below that figure, in nine out of those ten years, it is fair that those same people should be able to buy wheat at that figure now when wheat has a higher external value. As a matter of fact, such provision was made in the original flour tax legislation passed in 1933. That legislation provided for an excise tax on wheat exported when the price rose above 5s. 2d. f.o.b. ports, the money collected from the tax to be paid to the miller so that the price of the wheat' used by him would remain constant. I have spoken to many farmers on this point, and all have stated that they consider the flour tax legislation valuable to them. . Apparently, the Opposition parties are capable occasionally of devising progressive legislation. That legislation was opposed by the Labour party on the ground, that it was the duty of the Government to guarantee a fair price to the wheat-farmer out of Consolidated Revenue rather than impose an unfair tax on the bread of the workers. However, that legislation has proved of benefit to the wheat-growers. ' One very fair minded member of the Country and Democratic League of Western Australia, in fact, the only fair-minded member of that organization I have had the pleasure of meeting, told me that farmers did not object to people getting wheat below export parity to-day as they had paid above export parity in the past, but they did object to stock feeders getting cheap wheat now, not help them in the critical years. There is something in this argument; but we should not lose sight of the fact that pig, poultry and milk producers were at that time receiving prices far below production costs, even after buying wheat at ridiculously low figures. I can remember eggs, for instance, being hawked from door to door for 5d. a dozen. Nevertheless, the argument has force, and it must be admitted that if this scheme was to wind up after five years, and. in those five years wheat continued at a price above, or just below, the figure of 5s. 2d. a bushel, the wheat-farmer would in fact have been carrying his fellow primary producers. This is another reason why I want the scheme placed on a permanent, basis. The wheat-farmer is assisting his brotherproducer to-day when his sky is blue, but should that sky be grey tomorrow, it will be the stock-feeders' turn to lend a helping hand. During the war years the primary proremember the brittle promises, and ducer has benefited by subsidies to the examine in the cold light of reason amount of '£20,000,000, and has shared the specious and plausible arguments in price stabilization subsidies which cost £13,000,000 more. What would be the effect on our economy if we allowed wheat to be sold internally at 10s. 4d. a bushel ? The price of milk would rise. Eggs could no longer be sold at a minimum of Is. 7d. a dozen. The price of meat would rise. The superphosphate and cornsack subsidies would have to be abandoned. The price of bread would rise. The market gardener would have to obtain more for his products. In fact, the prices of all commodities would rise. The workers, already struggling to live, would demand higher and higher wages in order to exist.. The cost of farm machinery, already costly, would increase. I i i fact, our prices structure would be smashed, and we would ex-' perience spiralling inflation. One has only to look, at the United States of America to see what the lifting of price control means. In eleven days prices have risen by 11.1 per cent., including butter, from 4s. per lb., to 7s 6d. per lb., beef liver from 4s: 9d. per lb. to Ss. 6d. per lb., coffee up to 36 per cent., maize 47.8 per cent, Rents have also headed into the as the stock feeders did ""wild blue yonder"". Does the Leader of the Opposition counsel this action? Other things can be done to make the prices received for our primary products overseas more valuable to Australia. For example, we should be exporting and importing goods in our own ships. The story of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers during and after World WarI . is worth repeating, but I do not intend to dp so at this juncture, except to say that that line cut the cost of freight, saving Australian primary producers many millions of pounds, and was also a sound business investment before it was given away to a not-so-noble English lord by the Bruce-Page Government. That action was just another crime against the Australian people in general, and the primary producer in particular, by a Country party-Nationalist government. I ask the farmers, in their own interests, to study the history of this unholy alliance, to put forward to-day by these self styled champions of the primary producer. I also ask the farmers never to lose sight of the fact that unless growers are protected, their position, with greatly increased world's production which will follow high prices, will be unenviable after prices recede in the world's market, as we can expect in a few years. ""Wheat growers can be assured that the Australian Labour party will whole-heartedly support the stabilization plan in all States. The real danger will come from anti-Labour forces, who appear determined to force the wheat trade back into the hands of the merchants and speculators. There is a great deal at stake also for months in New Guinea, where he conother sections of primary producers. It tracted malaria anddermatitis.

The Plywood Industry Advisory Panel has been created primarily to advise in respect of the peeler log supply position which is the fundamental difficulty facing the plywood industry. 2. No. I am already aware that installed plywood plant is working at less than full capacity in various parts of Australia because of the unavailability of peeler logs, that the plant referred to in part 2 [a) of the question was in the main lend-lease plant, and until the recent lend-lease settlement the property of the United States of America and unavailable for use in Australia, and since neither plant following papers were prenor logs were thus available the Alexandria factory was utilized for purposes of technical"" training of returned servicemen.

The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:Because of the use of the word "" assistance "" it is assumed that the questions asked by the honourable member have reference to financial assistance by means of agricultural loans up to £1,000, which can be obtained by approved applicants. The purpose of these loans generally is to enable the ex-serviceman to purchase plant and machinery, stock, feed, &c, and to effect improvements. They are' used also to augment capital already possessed by the applicant and enable him to acquire small properties and to pay off mortgages.

Questions 4 and 5 were referred to the State authorities, but with regard to the latter they were unable to give, with any degree of accuracy, the number of applicants actually in occupation of properties. This is attributed to the lag which does take place very frequently between the date on which a loan is approved and on which the applicant makes use of it, the delay occasioned by necessary legal matters which, at times, must be completed before the purchaser can gain occupancy, and to reasons of a personal nature affecting the applicant. notice1.

Will he immediately re-appoint the Land Board? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The rentals ranged from 7d. per square mile to 4s. per square mile. 2. The company did not elect to exchange iheir South Australian leases for leases under the Crown Lands Ordinance. 3. The leases granted by the South Australian Government expired in 1041 and 1942. They were then cut up into four blocks and applications were invited for the lease of the blocks -Only two applications were received, viz., from the North Australian Pastoral Company and the Wave Hill Pastoral Company. The former company .applied for the whole of the four blocks.' The Wave Hill Pastoral Company applied for two of the blocks. The blocks were granted to the North Australia Pastoral Company, the former lessees. The new leases contain clauses that one-half of the area may, if necessary, be resumed on the 30th June, 1965. 4. No. It would be most unfair and undesirable to cancel leases, unless the lessees were not carrying out the conditions of their leases. 5. Bovril estates have lodged an appeal to the Supreme Court in respect of the resumptions which the Government proposes to make from their leases. It is anticipated that this appeal will be heard at an early date. 6. The Northern Territory Administration is preparing plans of blocks, comprising the resumed areas and existing Crown lands, so as to provide living areas. The appeals which have been made against some of these resumptions in accordance with the provisions of the ordinance are holding up the work. 7. This, is a matter for determination by the Crown law authorities. 8. Yes. This was done on the recommendation of the Payne-Fletcher Committee. 9. The Department has no knowledge that this is a fact. 10. Consideration will be given to the question'of re-constituting the Land Board. Commerce and Agriculture, upon notice1. Has he seen the report of a speech in the House of Representatives of the New Zealand Sullivan) in which he stated that his government had arranged to pay the world parity of 9s. Id. a bushel for locally grown wheat this year, and that an arrangement had been made by which Australia would supply that Dominion's requirements for the next four or five years at the ceiling price of 5s. 9d. a bushel, and, if there were any fall in the world parity or any factors justifying a reduction New Zealand would get the benefit? 2. Has the Government made an arrangement with the New Zealand Government for the sale of Australian wheat out' of either the last crop or future crops at 5s. 9d. per bushel f.o.b.? 3. If so, were the sales made by the Australian Wheat Board, or with the knowledge and/or approval of that board? 4. Is the Government legally able to enter long-term ""contracts before the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill is law? 5. If a sale has been made at 5s. 9d. per bushel f.o.b. at a time when the Wheat Board's price for bagged wheat to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the London Food Council is 10s. 4Jdper bushel f.o.b., does the Government intend to make good to the wheat-growers the amount by which this sale falls short of export parity? 4,500,000 bushels of wheat to New Zealand in January last at the price at which all other sales were being made at the time. This was done in consultation with the Wheat Board and with its f u l l knowledge. The Government undertook to meet New Zealand representatives at a future date on the subject of future sales. This meeting has not yet taken place. MEAT STRIKE. senting the Minister for Social Services, upon notice1.

Social Services has supplied the following answers:1. Approximately £82,000, being liability to the 6th July, 1946. 2. Approximately 7,500 persons. It is estimated, however, that a further 10,000 persons will qualify for unemployment benefit during the week ended the 13th July, after the' expiration of the waiting period of seven days.

What is the reason for the governmental practice, effected through the New Businesses Committee, of preventing ex-servicemen from commencing business as wholesalers of tea and coffee unless they had been engaged in such business prior to the outbreak of the recent war? 0. Does this practice of the Government establish and protect a monopoly in the hands of existing wholesalers in the trade? and Customs has supplied the f o l l o w in g answers:1. (a) No. (6) Yes. (c) Yes. (d) StockB are and have been for some months past, sufficient to meet requirements on the present rationed basis of consumption. 2. Pre-war importations of tea reached 50,000,000 lb. Imports now, including tea for the services, cannot exceed 47,000,000 lb Australia's allocation from the Combined Pood Board. This. allocation includes a special allowance of 12,000,000 lb. to Australia at the expense of neutral nations in order to maintain the existing 2-oz. ration, and this allowance would be withdrawn if rationing were abolished. It must be remembered that demand in Australia has increased compared with pre-war years owing to increased population and also the extended use of tea throughout industry as a result of the establishment of industrial canteens. A press statement on the above lines wag made by the Minister for Trade and Customs on 5th April last. -i. The rationing of meat and sugar is bound up with Australia's obligations to the sorely pressed people of the United Kingdom. The party to which the honourable member belongs has repeatedly pressed for an increase in 'Australia's shipments of meat to England. As regards sugar, the 1945-46 commitment for sale to the British. Ministry of Food was 200,000 tons. Owing to a scarcity of shipping, however, the ful l quantity was not exported. Adequate shipping has been promised for the loading of all the sugar found to be available for export in 1946-47. The rationing of tea, meat and sugar is effected under the National Security rationing of motor spirit is done under authority of the National Security (Liquid Fuel) Regulations. The retention of a controlled system of distribution of petrol is essential in the public interest until an adequate supply position, based on an unrationed consumption, can be ensured at all times. The Government will not desire to continue rationing once the future supply position is clear and completely satisfactory, but this is linked directly with the future availability or otherwise of sufficient dollar funds, which matter cannot be determined-definitely unti l the f u l l -effect of the . decision of the United States Government on the American-United Kingdom loan is known. 4. Tea is regarded as auniversal necessity in Australia. In addition, coffee production has not been affected by enemy occupation to the same extent as tea production. It is pertinent to state that the United Kingdom found it necessary to ration tea but not coffee. 5. The war-time decision of the United Kingdom Ministry of Food to purchase the whole of the crop available for export from Ceylon and India, the only remaining major tea-producing countries, necessitated the Commonwealth Government's making the whole oi the purchases on behalf of Australia. The Tea Control Board is the authority which imports and controls the distribution of tea. The board directly supplies tea to primary wholesalers, i.e., -wholesalers who directly imported tea prior to the commencement of controls. The board also registers secondary wholesalers, who obtain their tea from the primary wholesalers. No ex-serviceman has been prevented from commencing business as a secondary tea wholesaler merely because he was not in such business before the war. Any recent applications have been examined on their merits, and the Tea Control Board will continue this practice. ' 6. It is not thought that any monopoly has been established as there are 96 registered secondary tea wholesalers in Australia. representing the M in is t e r for T r a d e and Customs, u p o n not i c e 1.

Isi t a fact that, at that time, ample supplies of Swigs watches were available for import? and Customs has supplied the following answers:1. Licences were granted to ex-servicemen for the purpose of assisting them in rehabilitating themselves. A condition that the applicants had previously been engaged in the watch-making or jewellery trade was not a 'prerequisite to the grant of quotas. 2. No. See answer to No. 1. 3 and 4. The precise terms of the Re-establishment and Employment Act were not taken into consideration in determining that a quota should be granted to an ex-serviceman. The spirit of that act was, however, observed in making the allocations. 5. The principal of the Election Importing Company arrived in Australia in 1938 with an agreement to sell "" Election""' brand watches in this country. The Election Importing Company proved base-year returns in"" February, 1940, which establishes the fact that it was an importer during the fiscal year 1938-39. 6. It is not clear what is implied by the term "" legitimate merchants"". If it is intended to refer to quota-holders, then the answer is that such firms would be entitled to apply for and secure licences within the limits of their quotas. No applications for special licences were received from quota-holders at the time the Election Importing Company was granted an additional licence to import Swiss watches. 7. Representations from the trade did not support this view. Information furnished always referred to difficulties which were being encountered because of enemy action. ter, 'upon notice1.

Can the Commonwealth give any such guarantee while coal-miners, steel-workers and others are constantly involved in industrial disputes and stoppages? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The subject has been mentioned to me by the Premier. 2. Consideration will be given to this matter if and when an official request is received from the Victorian Government. It is pointed out that the allocation, amongst housing and other projects, of steel supplied through Commonwealth Government instrumentalities is a matter-for determination by the Victorian Government.
