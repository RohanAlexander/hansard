That the following words be. added to the Address:"" And to inform Your Excellency that the Government merits the censure of the House and the country for its failure to rcalhie its national and constitutional obligations, for flagrant neglect of its duty to secure industrial peace and good ordeT, and to uphold the law within the Commonwealth; for its maladministration of public affairs and public departments; for its grossly partisan actions and appointments, and its reckless irresponsibility in thefinancial affairs of the' Commonwealth."" I join with other members in congratulating the mover andseconder of the Address-in-Reply on their speeches. I am surprised that an amendment amounting to a motion of no confidence has been moved to the Address. I cannot see that anything is to be gained by this course. There wil l be no wavering among Ministerialists; the Government can rely on the solid support of its party. I suppose the motive of the leader of the Opposition is to rally .his following in a united attack.

4,Mr Archibald (Hindmarsh) [2.31j,"in the French Parliament, made up of fragments of parties united only in their hatred of the Government of the day. While fighting that Government they are a happy family, but immediately the Government is dislodged their troubles begin. I do not think that this Government will 'be dislodged during this Parliament, or during the next. ment after that. far as that; but year by year the interest taken by Australians in the affairs of the -Commonwealth grows, and as it grows the difference between the Liberal party and the Labour party will become plainer to them. There is no mistaking our aims and objects,, and the public knows that, whether in or out of office, we shall keep faith with it. Opposition makes its. attack is the existence of industrial unrest under the present Administration. In the. first speech I made in reference to a proposal for the amendment of the conciliation and arbitration law, I pointed out that the problem which faced -us. was a difficult one, and that it would .take time to reach finality, if that were -ever reached. menting, and that a true solution would require the exercise of all the patience we possessed, but that, as Australians, we should not be afraid of difficulties. It was in that spirit that the proposals of the Government were dealt with. I am not surprised that there is not industrial peace. It will be many years before we have industrial peace in the sense in which most .honourable members use the term. There is industrial unrest all over the world. Thank God, Australian workers enjoy more favorable conditions; than do their English brothers, but the same causes are at work here and in England. This industrial unrest is not confined to the peoples speaking the English tongue, but prevails throughout the nations that are alive to the seriousness of their position. been told that the Labour party has not prevented strikes. prevented in ratio to the power of this -Government to deal with them. The only successful method of settling industrial disputes is provided by a tribunal such as that which is presided over by Mr Justice -Higgins. awards of that Court been defied or treated --with contempt? generalities to the contrary, such instances cannot be found. The President of the Court has been assisted by a friendly Government. When he has complained of being hampered, the Government has proposed the amendment of the law, and in proportion h> the extension of his. powers the peace of the community has beeni increased. Any honourable member who judicially studies contemporaneous economics must be struck with that fact. It was the same In New South Wales under the Wise Act, which had force for a period of -seven years. The Court established under that Act did so much to bring about industrial peace in the State that our friends opposite, and those politically associated with them in New South Wales, came to the conclusion that it must be killed. They thought it ought to be killed "" stone One of the charges with which the dead,"" and they killed it ""stone dead."" They were wise iii their own generation. If I had looked at matters from their point of view, nodoubt I should have done the same; but that Court brought about, in New South Wales, a very considerable measure of industrial peace. Had there been in power during that seven years period a friendly Government to remedy the deI said that we were experifects in the Act disclosed from time to time it would have done still greater service. There was a hostile Government in power during the whole of that period, however, and an Amending Bill to give the Court a wider scope was not passed. We come now to the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and I say to honourable members, "" Look here upon this picture,, and on this."" The Federal Court cannot lay claim to much originality. It is very largely a copy of that created under the New South Wales Act, but in connection with it we have enjoyed the advantage of having, in power a Ministry friendly to the Court and anxious, to give it every opportunity to deal with industrial troubles. On the other hand the New South Wales. Government, during the seven years period to We have which I have referred, hated the State Arbitration Court, and was glad when any But strikes have been weakness in the Act, which tended to limit the scope of the Court, was discovered. Leaving aside party prejudice, I ask honourable members whether they do not see in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court the proper road to travel? I am not going to In what instance have the say that if we travel that road we shall secure an absolute settlement of all indusNotwithstanding vague trial difficulties",14,Speech

6,Mr Archibald,"I would not go soway towards it. must be careful not to prophesy with regard to the settlement of all difficulties of this character. Adam Smith, in his Wealth of Nations, declared that it was impossible that banking should be conducted upon cooperative principles, yet it is being so conducted to-day. make that prophecy at a time when banking was conducted only on proprietary lines, and I refer to this historical fact to warn honourable members that whilst we may say that we are going to do this or that with regard to industrial matters, we cannot say what will happen in the days to come. We must simply, rest content with efforts to better the conditions of the people in our own time. No man can say that he personally will bring about that which in the abstract is known as industrial peace. Let us look at yet another picture: that of the Wages Board system in operation in Victoria. word against it, I should like to ask whether we are going to secure industrial peace by means of such a system, under which boards consisting of representatives of the workers and of the employers are created to deal with conditions of labour. The representatives of the workers on such boards have their livings to get, and we know exactly the difference between their position and that of the employers. The difference between the Opposition and the Government and their supporters is that we have been "" through the mill."" means to be so situated, and I do not hesitate to say that only a single man is capable ing to such an amendment of the Constiof holding a seat as a representative of the workers on a Wages Board. Such a position cannot be taken by a man with a wife and children depending upon him, if he has any regard to his own interests. have Wages Boards in operation in South Australia. and have never favoured them. a lot of good, and the working men of South Australia admit that they have. nected with the workers of South Australia for thirty-two years, and I am in quite as good a position as is the honourable member to ascertain their feelings. I am not going to sneer at or condemn any system that will help to bring about better conditions; but I do say that the Wages Board system is not an efficient method of obtaining industrial peace. It is not the best, and therefore we cannot obtain from it the best results. I trust that our Victorian brethren and those in my own State will derive great good from the Wages Board system, and that later on I may be compelled, as Macaulay says, reluctantly to alter my opinion. Adam Smith was led to been inexpensively and satisfactorily settled by Victorian Wages Boards. go further into the question; it is simply a matter of common sense. I ask honourable members whether they do not think that a still better tribunal to deal with industrial difficulties is that which has the power to consider them judicially-to call for papers; to obtain information as to the earnings of a firm which is a party to a dispute-and in which the trained experience of judges like Mr Justice Higgins and Judge Heydon, of New South Wales, can be brought WhilstI do not intend to say one to bear upon the facts? Both those judges are bright ornaments of the judicial bench of Australia, and if anything happened to them. I believe we should be able to find equally good men to take their place. But if two and two are four, and the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles, then, as men of common sense, honourable members must admit that we cannot obtain from Wages Boards what can be secured from an Arbitration Court. The present Government have done all within their power to strengthen the Court and to We know what it widen its scope, and I hope that the people of Australia will see the wisdom of agreetution as will give us more power to follow up this issue. The working men of Australia simply ask for a fair deal. There may be amongst them one or two wild men We also just as there are one or two in the ranks of the Opposition. We have not a monopoly I am not in favour of them, of all the wild men of Australia; but if there are one or two among the workers it is because of the feeling that they are not getting a fair deal under existing conditions. To that feeling must be attributed the absence of that contentment which we should all like to see. One of the chief motives of the Opposition in submitting this motion of want of confidence was to drag before the people the question of the Brisbane strike. That strike was one of the greatest blessings that ever befel the Opposition. It has given them an opportunity to say everything possible from their",15,Speech

12,Mr Archibald,"I do not want topoint of view with regard to the Labour party. They do not need an argument against the present Government; all that they have to do is to assert that in some way, directly or indirectly, the present Government was connected with the Brisbane strike. I am not in favour of strikes; I favour conciliation and arbitration, and there is not in Australia to-day a working man who has ever lost a day's employment by accepting my advice. If honourable members opposite knew the anxiety and worry that a strike means to honourable members on this side-if they knew the difficulties of the situation-the y would hesitate, not once, but three times, before they charged us -with being fond of such conflicts. We are asked why we do not denounce strikes. Over forty years ago I made up my mind that the rest of my life should be devoted to the benefit of the working people, and for twenty years or more of that period, when there was no strong Labour party, such a position meant abuse and ignominy, and being looked down upon as an agitator.

No. -committed an error of iudgment. it is my business to defend and help them, as honourable members on this side will always do. ber is afraid to do otherwise! -charge as that to those who know me best. 'There are two sides to the Brisbane strike. -whether it is called a strike or a lock-out; ""but I know that, for party purposes, as -much as possible has to be made out of it ""by honourable members opposite. -not matter what evidence is brought forward, not a speech on the part of the Opposition will be altered. 'because the speeches during this debate have already been too long, and the whole ground -of the Brisbane strike has been covered by the honorahle member for Brisbane, who ""had the privilege of being on the spot. -One of the advantages of the Federal Parliament, to which members are cal'ed from all parts of the country, is that, when there '-is an incident of this kind during recess, 'the House, when it meets, is in a position -to get thp truth from those who krow the 'farts. There are nnlv one or two points tn which T desire to refer. We have in Brisbane a franchise which ought never to hnve been given to a private company, and ""the giving of it constitutes blunder number one. As the manager of that franchise we have an up-to-date American who hates trade unionism. He is typical of those coal owners who, when an American State Parliament passed an eight-hours Act, defied the law, and constituted themselves masters of the situation. That is the sort of man who is employed by this British tramway company; and the results are obvious. The Government of Queensland has neither sense, tact, nor judgment. Queensland has always struck me as one of the richest of the States; but it has a most remarkable history so far as its Governments are concerned. Labour Government. three days. did some work during the three days I of Queensland have been conspicuous for their unscrupulous methods and lack of If they have judgment. When the dispute arose the men assembled and marched in procession; and any one with a grain of common sense must know that unemployed men are better marching about and holding meetings than in doing nothing. But the wonderful Premier of Queensland did not appreciate the fact. The evidence shows that the whole of the trouble was brought about by the high handed proceedings of one man; and it is I am not particular difficult to come to any other conclusion than that he was backed up by the State Government. I do not suppose we can get any legal documents to prove that statement, It does but the truth of it must be apparent, for this Badger would, otherwise, never have played the antics he did. The State GoI shall be br ef, ; vernment called for the aid of the military, and the Federal Government wisely declined to send troops.

I was hoping, and still hope, that this amendment will be withdrawn, for then all references to the calling out of the military will, as a matter of fact, cease. Responsible members of the Opposition should -be very careful in a crisis of this kind, and try, rather, to attempt to elevate the thought of Australia. We know that honourable members opposite have their tongue .in their cheek when they talk about the calling out of the military; but the people outside believe that the Opposition would have acted as they say the Government should. -for ""honourable members on this side. We have passed a defence scheme that is against all the prejudices of the Australian people. of fhe world 'have-nothing of a compulsory character in their defence methods; and we have persons coming into Australia every week and criticising our Defence Act because it is contrary to the notions of 'the Old Country. There has been a loyal determination on the part of the Government and their supporters to uphold this defence system. I have stated more than once in my own State that it is not a party question. Buti f the Opposition, for the purpose of damaging the Government, are going 'to impress upon the people of Australia the idea that they are prepared to let loose the military whenever there happens to be a small cabbage garden riot orable member mean by "" let loose "" ? -mean by "" calling out the military."" I -am told that the honourable member for Ballarat has had a pretty good record in connection with calling out troops. Do honourable members opposite think that their .present action is going to make the defence system more popular? It appears to me that they are quite prepared to wreck the system by scaring the people of Australia with the idea that, in a matter thafcan be -dealt with by the ordinary police force in a judicial way, they are .prepared to call out the military. If that be so I am satisfied that I committed an error of judgment when I said that defence was not a party question. I am not going to "" carry the baby "" of defence if the Opposition are determined, on the slightest pretext, to pursue that policy. Let there be no misunderstanding on that point. Action of this kind may be all right for party purposes, but the front Opposition benchought to realize that an important issue of this kind ought not to be played with. The people of Australia ought to be made to understand that the military forces can never be used in a case of mere disorder, and that it is only in a most grave and' -serious crisis that they can be called into service. allusions made to calling out the troops inGreat Britain during industrial disturbThat is a serious matter ances.

We cannot apply similar statistics for the ascertainment of the conditions of our own people. But there is another method by which a national balance sheet can be made out. It is based on the valuation of the estates of deceased persons, as giving an indication of the manner of distribution of the capital of the country. Mr Money points out that there has been a demise of the Crown eight times in the past two hundred years, or once in about twenty-five years, and taking the mean of a large number of actual cases he estimates that, on the average, estates change hands every thirty years by reason of the decease of their proprietors, and that there are thirty living property owners for every dead one.

58,Mr Sampson,"What is to prevent thishonorable member. Federal Government, whether it be one the honourable member would support, or one I would support, is prepared to take over the State debts without getting some guarantee with regard to State borrowing in the future. Honourable members opposite are aware of that; and what is the use of humbugging the people about it? honourable members opposite made to get the State Governments to come into line with them on this matter? Australian people to give us the powers necessary to deal with great and important problems, but the party opposite have never asked for any additional powers at all. On the contrary, they have systematically blocked every proposal of the kind made from this side. great opportunities to do evil, and have never missed a single one. secured an amendment of the Constitution to enable the Commonwealth to take over the whole of the State debts. the question somehow. Constitution was amended in the way described, but I ask the honourable member for Wimmera to say whether the Leader of the Opposition or any honourable member on the front Opposition bench is prepared to take up this question before some arrangement with respect to future borrowing has been come to with the State Governments? them will do so. My own opinion is that in this matter the State Parliaments realize the handwriting on the wall, and that is the reason why they are going in for the policy of boundless borrowing which they are following at the present time. They know that, sooner or later, the Australian people will pull them up, and when they do honourable members opposite will be converted on this question. little borrowing in the last few years. matters of principle, and I do not propose to go into details. I have stated the position with regard to the consolidation of State debts. I have attempted to show that we have tried to do all we possibly could to bring about industrial peace; but we do not hold out any hope of industrial It is because no peace until there is a better distribution of the wealth of the community. That is my personal opinion; and, though I do not ask honourable members on this side to shoulder any responsibility for it, I think that is the view generally held on this side. I was pained the other evening to hear an honourable member opposite refer to us as parasites of Labour. There are honourable members on this side who began the practice of throwing in their lot with their mates years ago, when they could have no hope that they would ever become members of Parliament; and they got nothing but abuse for it. In season and out of season we spent our leisure in trying to improve the lot of our fellow-workers, and it is most unjust that men who have grown grey in the service of their fellow-workers-me n who have reThey have had cognised that if the conditions of the working people be improved, if justice be done to them, then every other section of the community must in turn be benefitedshould be thus aspersed. We have done this, believing that if the lower rungs of the social ladder be sound, attention must be paid to the remaining rungs, and that an appeal for justice by the professional and other classes could not then be neglected by the Parliament. I have not at hand the particular work to which I had intended to refer, nor.is it to be obtained in the Parliamentary Library, but I have a keen recollection of a passage in which the great historian, Froude, refers to the effect which a university education has upon most men. What does it do for them? It develops their intellect, he says, and gives them We know that not one of greater facility for study, but. for the most part they use that development of their intellect in the maintenance of existing conditions, and in finding arguments to support the oppression of the people. Ninety per cent, of the graduates of universities are trained only for that purpose, and both in Parliament and out of it we find amongst men who have had a university training more cads than are to be found in any other section of the community. I must congratulate the honourable member for Hindmarsh on the candid admission he has made, that he is for his party right or wrong.

I can only conclude that when he is most vehement he thinks his party wrong, and since he was particularly vehement in his declarations regarding the question of industrial unrest, I have come to the decision that he thinks that in that regard his party has been at fault. I have no desire to discuss the matter at length, but it was news to me to learn from the honourable member that the Labour party favoured the New South Wales Arbitration Court. I have not had time to look up the facts, but, speaking from memory, I think it was the Labour party that killed that Court. front. such a remarkable suggestion would be made, I did not come prepared to answer it, but my recollection is that the Labour party converted the arbitration system of New. South Wales into a Wages Board system. Boards, and believe that the Liberal party has likewise from the first held the view that the Wages Board system affords a proper means of settling industrial disputes. The Arbitration Court of New South Wales was established under an Act introduced in 1902 by the See Government. was a Liberal Administration, and we have in this House to-day several members of the Liberal party, as well as one member of the Labour party-the honourable member for Gwydir-wh o assisted in the passing of that measure. was introduced by Mr B. R. Wise. tion was introduced by the See Government in 1902, and I was astonished to hear the statement made this afternoon that the Labour party were in favour of the Arbitration Court of New South Wales. The Arbitration Act of New South Wales contained a section under which the funds of unions were made respbnsible for the nonobservance of awards of the Court. That alone, I should think, would destroy its value from the Labour point of view. The difficulty that arose with the Court was that its business became so congested that no progress whatever could be made. those days tried to destroy the Court. statement is correct. of the Court was, I think, Mr Justice Cohen, who retired, fairly broken down under the weight of its machinery, which, apparently, would not work at all. Judge Heydon then became President of the Court, and he publicly declared that its business had become so congested that it was impossible for it to do the work of the country. The people of the State, therefore, demanded a change, and the Wages Board system was introduced. die. that my statement of the position is absolutely accurate, because, as I have said, I have not had time to look up all the facts; but I am confident that the people of New South Wales demanded the introduction of the Wages Board system with the result that the Arbitration Court was abolished. Coming to the Governor General's Speech, I think it is the most paltry we have had I have always upheld Wages since the day when a speech of one paragraph was put into the mouth of the Governor General by the Reid-McLean Administration. This fact convinces me that the Government are already showing signs of senile decay. It is but two years since the tom-toms of the Trades Hall were That -loudly beaten to proclaim the victory of the "" glorious 13th April."" We were told that that victory would remain for all time a bright spot in the annals of Australia. Yet to-day we find the Government coming down to the House with a few paltry platitudes and suggestions. whole of our platform into legislation. What more could the honourable member expect ? Government should make room for another Administration that is prepared to do something. The honourable member for Bourke, in his celebrated "" Sedan"" speech, was very outspoken concerning this very matter. According to a report published in the Age on 22nd March lastMr Anstey said there was no Government more entitled to the support of the democracy than the present Federal Government, but there was none that would have such .1 hard struggle for the maintenance of its position. When it was deposed, however, as it would Tje at the -next elections, there would be nothing left for the succeeding Government to do within the limits of the Constitution. . . .

One point to be occur to reverse the position next time. That was an outspoken utterance, and clearly foreshadowed, I think, what is actually going to happen next year. Later on we shall hear people speaking of another ""glorious 13th""-the glorious election of 1913, and when the result of that election is declared we shall no longer hear the tom-toms of the Trades Hall. I join in the congratulations in the Governor General's Speech on the bounteous season before us, though, speaking from long experience, I never saw in Australia a more threatening state of affairs. I am surprised that the Government do not claim any credit for the prospective glorious season; they display a degree of modesty with which I did not credit them. As to the Commonwealth Bank, the great trouble is that this institution is going to rob the States of their Savings Banks. to the States in this connection, but it is a proposal most inadequate and ridiculous. The Commonwealth Bank is like a burglar who says to the poor States, ""You have some property; we shall take the whole of it and give you back three-quarters."" any institutions are doing well, they are the Savings Banks of the States. They use the money of the people -in a splendid way. cier system in Victoria is deserving of all commendation, and I had always hoped that it. would lead to a solution of the rent question. The only solution is that every man shall own his house; and, under the Credit Foncier system, the poor man has that chance. Government are going to take away the jnoney from the State Savings Banks, the solution of the rent problem will be rendered impossible. From that point of view alone, and from many other points of view which have been and will be mentioned, it is very ill-advised for the Commonwealth Government to endeavour to rob the State Governments of their Savings Banks. The Commonwealth Government object to a dual the indications afforded by the Gympie returns, control of immigration, and why do they not object to a dual control of Savings Banks, in as they must do if they are at all logical?

Both sides say that they are going to do it, but the Labour party does nothing when if has the chance, whilst the Liberal party is in earnest. The Liberal party would import I should like to the proper kind of people, not loafers who would take a job from another man. There are two views of immigration. One is that every man or woman imported into Australia is going to do another man or woman out of a job. The other view is that every man or woman who comes here, if he or she be one of the proper sort, is It is a great pity likely to make work, particularly if the immigrants go on the land. Instead of doing a man out of a job, they are more likely to make other people's jobs secure by increasing the area of work, and doing good to the country generally. We do not wish to consider the proposed maternity grant seriously, until we see how it is proposed to be administered. We want to see the Bill.

I hope to see safeguards provided, so that the grant will really reach those who are in distress. Of course, we can see why the Government have made this proposal. The purpose is obvious. A tyro in politics like myself can see that it is only a bribe. Every Labour man will strike his breast, and make out that his support of the policy comes from his heart. from the fact is not to come from the pockets of honourable members opposite. The fact is that when the Labour party abolished the postal vote there was a great outcry amongst the mothers. Our Labour friends cudgelled their brains as to what on earth they could do to quieten the discontent. So they said amongst themselves, "" We will sling them a fiver in the form of a maternity grant.""

Would he vote for me for that sum? ber offered me £10,000 ! that this grant will buy the mothers of Australia, but the object of it is perfectly clear. It is nothing better than a bribe, and I am satisfied that the mothers will regard it as such. I see that we are to have other referenda on proposals to amend the Constitution. On the last occasion the proposals of the Government were defeated by a majority of 250,000. Surely that ought to have convinced our friends that the people do not want to surrender the powers which the States at present have. succeed, try, try, try again."" bers opposite try for ever they will not get what they want in this regard. The cost of the referenda was over £47,000. other huge expenditure to get another refusal. However, it may be worthwhile to teach our friends wisdom, even at this tremendous cost. Another matter with which the Government are inclinecl to juggle is the Inter-State Commission. I should like to ask the Minister of External Affairs whether that Commission will deal with the Fiscal question? The suggestion on this side is that it should do so. ber speak for his side on the question ? But it does not. Incomes nothing more outrageous since I have been in Parliament than the way we have dealt with the Tariff. What has occurred has been nothing short of disgraceful. The manufacturers have rushed up here to see members of Parliament, and while the Tariff was before Parliament I never had an opportunity of sitting in the chamber and listening to the debates. We cannot blame the manufacturers for coming up. Parliament is the arbiter on the Tariff, and the manufacturer who has not sufficient protection has to do his best for his industry. Members of Parliament have to go out and tion they desire to present. From that point of view alone we require an Interstate Commission, or some body of the sort which will deal thoroughly and scientifically with the question. Members of Parliament will then be able to form a deliberate opinion, and give their votes in accordance with the evidence. I admit that I gave a wrong vote when the Tariff was formerly before us, but I had an opportunity of putting it right at a later date, and now I am glad to know that the industry affected is flourishing under sufficient protection. We on this side are twitted with being both Free Traders and Protectionists. But we are common-sense men, and can make a bargain amongst ourselves. We recognise that Protection is the settled policy of Australia, and I feel sure that our Free Trade friends will agree with us that the proper way of handling the matter is by means of a Tariff Board. Promises were made at the last election that this matter should be properly considered, and our Labour friends said that if they remained in power they would do what was wanted at once. They have given us a few paltry matters to deal with, and a still more paltry explanation of them.

If they are to be made a mere dumpingground for political supporters, they are likely to become places where the refuse of political parties will be shot.

"" I feel sure that the idea of the honourable and learned gentleman that there must always be industrial unrest until the whole system is changed, is not sound. Before election time we hear more of this sort of talk than we do at other times. One cannot help thinking that it suits our friends opposite to have a little industrial unrest when they want to be elected again. To have people exclaiming against things, and to be able to tell them, "" We are going to put things right when we are the elect of the people ""-to stir up a bit of strife so as to get themselves another lease of power suits them very well. It is very disconcerting, indeed, to a man of peace like myself to find that notwithstanding all the methods which the Labour party have proposed to solve this problem, there are more strikes than ever. Government ownership will not heal this strife, because I think there have been more strikes to a square inch at Wonthaggi mine, which is a Governmentowned mine, than in any other industry in the whole community. I find that our honourable friends opposite are a good deal divided among themselves upon this question of striking. Some of them say, "" We are for a strike every time,"" whereas there are others who do not like a strike. The Minister of Public Works for New South Wales, Mr Griffith, is reported to have saidI f a section of the community declares war to starve it out, it is only natural to expect that when the opportunity comes the public will hit back. has happened, both in South Australia and Queensland. Only let the strike promoters get to work and organize a general strike in Sydney just prior to the next general election, and for a moment that Comrade Munro would our party will get rubbed out, but not otherwise. The best thought in the Labour movement regards the strike as a barbarous and obcare of his own skin, but he might incite solete weapon, and the public resents its reintroduction just as it would resent the reintroduction of the feudal system, or trial by torture, or any institution which did service in repudiate them. the past, but which has been superseded by more civilized methods. Mr Griffith ought to be a Liberal. When the strike was the only method of obtaining a fair deal for the workers a strike before an election helped the Labour party very materially, but when the strike has been superseded by intelligent legislation, to strike great shearers' strike of 1891. At the time, is a retrograde movement, and is naturally resented by a progressive people. I entirely agree with every word that Mr labourers to Barcaldine, this individual had Griffith uttered, and therefore I felt very disappointed when I discovered that no measure dealing with this matter is outlined in the Governor General's Speech. I had Mr Fairbairn. hoped to see in it some mention of a Bill requiring a compulsory secret vote to be taken by every union before resort could be had to a strike, and I also desired that the women should be allowed to participate in the ballot. We must all recollect that it is the women who haVe to bear the heat and burden of the day in -connection with any strike. We know that a glass of beer will keep up the spirits of the men, and that, in reality, it is the poor unfortunate wives ancl families who are the chief sufferers. During the course of this debate, we have heard a good deal about the Brisbane strike,' and I have no desire to discuss it at length. But it does seem deplorable at this time of day-especiall y in view of the fact that a remedy has already been provided for industrial disturbances-that a lot of otherwise sensible men should have struck work for such a trifling cause. We know that Mr Coyne triumphantly claimed that lie had reduced Brisbane to the state of a cemetery. We also know that another gentlemana unionist-in the person of Comrade Munro, saidI f a man would not join a union they were justified in dealing with him as the BrokenH ill miners or the Sydney wharf labourers did. Drop something on him, or push him overboard. If a girl refused to join a union, .put something in her way so that she would fall over it and break her neck.

In the middle of the night, he rose, grabbed a rifle and bayonet, and put the bayonet right through a man who was lying alongside him. He murdered that man. He was subsequently tried for his life, and at the trial, it was conclusively proved that he was a man of weak intellect. bayonet unless the pastoralists supplied it? That incident illustrates the class of man whom the pastoralists were prepared to employ. principle of freedom of contract, and of our right to employ any individual whom we may choose. like to pay them? favour of paying only the best wages; but, in return, I want the best service. If my honourable friends opposite would denounce the remarks of Comrade Munro, they would be rendering a service to the community. We want to settle industrial disputes in a civilized way. We wish to do away with strikes. Personally, I am a man of peace, although I seem to have the unhappy knack of always getting into the firing line. at Kerang threatened to starve Melbourne. Why does not the honourable member repudiate that threat? think it was a very indiscreet remark. the utterance of Comrade Munro. to have extracted that expression from the Minister of External Affairs. I listened with very great interest the other evening to the speech which was delivered by fhe honourable member for Brisbane. kindly Scotch accent suggests that he has not been long in this country, and he naturally looks upon soldiers as an enemy of the people. But I would remind him that in Australia we are governed by the people, and if they do not wish the military to be employed to quell any civil disturbance they have a perfect right to say that they shall not be so employed. The position in Scotland is very different. There, only a few persons possess a vote, so that the military may be controlled in an autocratic way. I cannot understand why, in a democratic country like Australia, any sane mortal should fear the police or military. It will be recollected that, in connection with the Brisbane strike of tramway employees, both sides wished to have the military called out. Mr Coyne wanted them called out on behalf of the Strike Committee, and Mr Denham also asked for their assistance. It is evident, therefore, that both sides regarded the position as an 'ilarming one. If a majority of the people do not desire the services of the military to be em, ployed in the way that has been suggested, they have a constitutional method of exr pressing their will in the matter. It is easily conceivable that a State Government might be put to very great expense in providing a means of checking industrial strife, because, when such disputes arise, passions become inflamed, and a lot of gaol-birds collect for the purpose of disturbing the I am in peace of the community. The honourable member for Brisbane takes rather the Old World view of the military force. He conceives it to be necessarily a force controlled by an autocrat, not a force composed of, and controlled by, the people themselves. To my mind, the fear of the military is groundless. In this country there has never been a man hurt by soldiers. Coming back to the big shearers' strike, if it had not been for the calling out of the military, blood would have been shed then. I took up the first lot of free labourers to Claremont. We got a telegram from a place 250 miles away, saying that 1,000 men were coming to pull us out of the woolshed. Before they left Barcaldine, they wrecked the township. As day after day they got nearer, it became a question whether they or the troops would arrive first. We were away in the interior, far from any help or protection. feel queer? well, and the honourable member would not have enjoyed the position. member's courage was in his boots. to see the matter through, and very glad when the military arrived, .because we were all afraid of bloodshed. No one desires the shedding of blood in this country. We know what it has done in Ireland to prevent the peaceful settlement of difficulties. The big shearers' strike was not connected with any question of wages or housing accommodation, though the housing accommodation of the day was not all .that could be desired.

We took over that country from the kangaroos, and to get to it had to cross two mountain ranges, over which all our materials had to be carted.

No doubt, it did me good. years under canvas, and some railway employees live under canvas all the time. been on the question of housing, we should have conceded the demands of the strikers. Their demand, however, was that we should employ only union labour, and I held then, as I do now, that an employer has no business to ask a man whether he is a unionist or a non-unionist. It was really on that question that we fought. Nowadays, the shearers do not waste their earnings on frivolities, but bank their money. In those times, there was a great deal of gambling, and men would get into a state in which they could not work, and would then declare the sheep to be wet. and throw shearing operations into disorder. However, this is an old tale, and the past is done with. I refer to the matter only in reply to the statement of the Prime Minister. member sooner have things as they were, or as they are? sire the settlement of industrial disputes by properly constituted Wages Boards, Arbitration Courts, and other civilized methods, and not by the savage method of striking. The honourable member for Brisbane seemed to think that the workers would be afraid of the troops. He and many others treat them as if they were children. We in Australia are an educated people, and the workers know as much as any other section of the community. The honourable member spoke of catching glimpses of the dawn from the pinnacle of education, the pinnacle of universal suffrage, and other pinnacles raised by the Labour party, though, in point of fact, none of the benefits he mentioned are due to the efforts of Labour members. What the Labour party will bring about is a state of chaos leading to the disappearance of these pinnacles. The working men and women of Australia are too well educated to be afraid of soldiers. I am glad that I converted the Minister of Home Affairs to my opinion that a remedy for industrial unrest is for the unions, instead of wasting their money on strikes, to buy shares in industrial concerns. I made this clear in a speech delivered in this Chamber on the 30th September last. It is to be found in Hansard, at page 842 of the debates of last session. I am pleased to see that I have made one convert, and that there is one little ewe lamb that I can call my own. orable gentleman a long-woolled sheep. achievement in one's political career to be able to claim, that he has made a convert from so united a phalanx as I see opposite me. I quote the following statement of the honourable gentleman's remarksTlie Minister of Home Affairs, Mr King O'Malley, yesterday made an outspoken condemnation of strikes, which he declared to be responsible for the recent Labour reverses. the Tasmanian strike? after the Tasmanian strike. The honourable gentleman went on to sayI have noticed since I have been in Australia, and particularly since I have joined the Labour party, that nearly all these strikes are created or developed *by splendidly enthusiastic young fellows who have studied economic questions and looked into the whole history of the great fights between capital and labour. They realized the accumulated evils of centuries of wrong inflicted on the great majority by the selfishness of small coteries on the other side. The results of the realization of this causes them to start a strike, ancl their brethren feel that they are bound to stand by them. Now, tlie greatest sufferers in the community are the women and children, because it is like a great domestic war, a great family fight, and when families fight nothing is so bitter. These questions must be settled by discussion after these terrible strikes, and after the commercial life of-the community has been paralysed. Both sides must sit round a common table and discuss some mode of settlement. The Minister was here clearly advocating Wages BoardsI f they do not one side is defeated.

When the Victorian elections were oa there was another industrial strike. Now at the South Australian elections there is the great strike in Brisbane. Naturally our opponents use these facts and profit by them. I wish again to make this suggestion in the advocacy of which I have now so able and responsible a colleague. I ask honourable members to think it over, and see whether this continual industrial unrest cannot .be put a stop to.

138,Mr Fairbairn,"I remind the Minlong to explain to the honourable member how that came about that I shall not worry the House with the explanation. I shall give it to the honourable member privately if he will spare me an hour some day. The number of people who own land valued at over £5,000 and undeT £ i 0,000 is_ 8.736; the number owning land valued at over £10,000 and under £15,000 is 1,792; and the number of people owning land valued at over £15,000 is 4>743I do not hold any brief for absentees, but I want to put a commercial proposition before the Government. Absentees are taxed on land valued at from £ 1 upwards. The number owning land valued at up to £5,000 is 1803; the number owning land valued at over £5,000 and up to £10,000 is 189; and the number owning land over £10,000 in value is 201. This accounts for the total of absentees affected by this tax. imposed on absentees over and above the tax imposed on residents amounts to £21,425. justifiable, under a properly regulated system, to require the absentee, who does not spend his money amongst us to encourage production, to pay a little more than the resident; but I ask whether it is worthwhile, for the sake of £21,425, which is a rapidly diminishing amount, to impose this differential taxation upon absentees. It causes a great deal of ill feeling amongst people who lend Australia an enormous sum of money. We pay in interest to these people about £9,000,000 a year on money borrowed from them, and, in view of this fact, I think that it is hardly worthwhile to make the difference which is made under our legislation in the taxation of absentees. charity ? may resent our differential legislation, and be induced in consequence to make harder bargains with us. It is not reasonable to suppose that they like being taxed in the way they are. I ask honourable members to consider the position of these men who have to pay an absentee tax in Australia and a heavy income tax in Great Britain. The continuance of this differential treatment will simply mean the withdrawal from Australia of a vast sum of British capital. I have no personal interest in this matter; I put it forward only as a business proposal. member think that the A. A. Company, which obtained a very large area of land in New South Wales free of charge ought not to pay taxation ? it should be taxed, but is it worthwhile imposing what is really an absentee tax? A company may be registered abroad and yet have amongst its shareholders many residents of Australia. Another point to which I desire to refer is that, of the vast amount of British capital which is scattered abroad in fertilizing streams, £36,000,000 goes to Canada every year, and £18,000,000 to the Argentine, while o r H y £3,000,000 finds its way to Australia. Whatever may be the views of honourable members as to immigration, and one man competing with another, I do not think that any one will object to the competition of capital, which means cheap The revenue derived from the tax money for the people. On the occasion of a. recent visit to Canada, I found that, although it is not half as good a country as I agree that it is perfectly is Australia, its prosperity was phenomenal: Its flourishing condition shows that it is a good thing for a country to have a large amount of British capital to assist in its building up and development, and we ought not to do anything to discourage the introduction of capital into Australia. In conclusion, I hold that every effort should be made to secure closer settlement and to encourage immigration. As I am not a believer in long speeches, I shall not detain the House further. K thank honourable members for the encouraging attention they have given me.

Service Act and the Commissioner. would not take away a single power which he possesses, but would add to his powers. If I had my wsyr, I would repeal that part of the Act which I referred to, and allow the Commissioner to appoint a person from outside the Servicei f he had passed the necessary examination and could do the work better than some person in the Service, so that men outside should have exactly the same chance as men inside. t if y that no person in the Public Service can do the work. He might be abie to get an officer to do the work, but he might be able to get a man outside the Public Service who could do the work better. As 'ong as he says that there is an officer who can do the work, he has to fal l back on the Public Service. As regards appointments to the Northern Territory, whilst I am not in favour of interfering with the Public Service, I would give public servants and men out of the Service exactly the same opportunity. I believe that the .Northern Territory could be very materially helped if it were possible to make an arrangement with the States that a permanent officer who is chosen from a State Service to fill a position in the Northern Territory shall not lose his rank or his grade, or -the opportunity of promotion in the State Service by reason of that act. Suppose, for instance, that a State is employing permanently a person who, we think, could I am very glad that render a service to us in the Northern Territory. He will hesitate a good deal before he agrees to accept a position in the Northern Territory, unless the salary offered is very much higher than he is getting. officials if you do not do that. make an arrangement of the kind I have mentioned with the States, we shall be very I am not one of those glad, because then we could have some officials in the Northern Territory who, after WhilstI serving there for four or five years, could, it they so desired, fall back into the State Service from which they came. If any honourable member thinks that Mr Clarke was not the best out of the five applicants It is quite for the position of Director of Agriculture I shall be glad to hear him say so.

I long experience. that he was a good deal in the running, but, to my mind, he did not possess quite the qualifications necessary to fill the bill , sen. I was very pleased with the recommendations which were submitted in favour of Mr Day. When I had to appoint a Chief Surveyor, at the same salary as I had previously fixed for the Director of Lands, I sent for Mr Day and gave him the appointment. He was a civil servant. No one spoke to me on his behalf, except one member of Parliament, and that was Sir Josiah Symon. Having mentioned his name, I think it is only fair to tell honourable members what Sir Josiah Symon said. He said, "" I understand that Mr Day is an applicant for the position of Director of Lands. I do not wish in the slightest degree to influence you in making an appointment to that office. I merely come to you as a public man to say that I know Mr Day. He did some work before the Court that dealt with the disputed land boundaries case of Victoria and South Australia a little whole ago which was eminently satisfactory.

Speaking at Lithgow, he saidIn the old country they were trying copartnery in many places, and had never gone back on it. He knew it would be pooh-poohed and blown out by the men interested in blowing it out, but the people who paid the piper should begin to think about it for themselves. His opinion was that the future belonged to oo-partnery, and not to Socialism as preached to-day. Co-partnery was capable of infinite expansion in all good ways; tbe other would bring them no good. I should not have made this quotation but once with being a blatant demagogue. But for the assertion made by the honourable these were the solutions which the honourable member for Panamatta that he had not almember then offered for the prevailing tered his position. Addressing the people social unrest. He went on to sayof Lithgow, who first returned him to Parliament some twenty years ago, he asserted, its industries are declining there is, under the the other day, that his position remained present system of government, no possibility Mr Thomas. Because somebody has been fool enough to lucky men have come here and picked the eyes out of the country, we are to be told lay claim to any possibility of getting a livelihood from them. As some one has said, It is because all the gold and all the coal beneath the surface belong to the people as a compensation should be allowed to people who for the time being monopolize the right to use those materials. That suggests the advocacy of no compensation for monopolies. It certainly savours of something more than ""co-partnery."" I have here a rather lengthy extract from a speech made in the New South Wales Parliament by the honourable member for Parramatta, in reply to a statement made by because of strikes coal had not been sold; just as the honourable member for Kooyong clared, yesterday, that a similar state of affairs had arisen at Wonthaggi. Sir William McMillan had said that it was necessary to have more enterprise and thrift, and, in reply to that statement, the honourable member for Parramatta saidWould thrift and enterprise bridge over the tremendous handicap that exists in the matter of railway freights in the Western district at the present and enable the people at LithgowI wonder would thrift and enterprise prevent the development of coal mines in Japan and the consequent losing of trade by the Newcastle miners ? say that strikes have been the cause of it. good deal to do with it. ber and other members know better. . . .

The honourable member for Parramatta had nothing much to say about ""co-partnery "" in those days. He then held the opinion that the social unrest which existed was due to the fact that a few land-grabbers had the country by the throat. The honourable member told this House, a day or two ago, that the Federal land tax had not broken up the big estates-that they still existedand I should like to ask him whether "" copartnery "" is likely to break them up. As a member of the State Parliament, he saidWe want a good, stiff tax on land va'ue, which would drive capital out of those speculative enterprises and lead to its investment in more legitimate channels. . . We want some of the best soil we have in the country made available, so that the unemployed may hare a fair chance. That, I suppose, is '* co-partnery "" ! Let me make one more quotationThe honourable and learned gentleman to-night made much of the fact that there are sacred rights of properly held in the shape of land. It seems to me, however, that the trend of economic thought, and even of popular thought, realizes the iniquity of the recognition of private property in land. member for Parramatta make that statement ? ago. member of the Labour party? Lithgow, the other day, he declared that his position remained unchanged-that whilst other men had changed, he had not done so. It is for that reason that I make this quotation. He went on to sayI t is the one thing above all others that has cursed this country, and has cursed every other country of which we have any knowledge, and unless it be abolished it will curse these countries in the future as they have never yet been cursed. The initial wrong done to society is in attempting to recognise such a thing as property in land. There can be no property in land in the sense that there is property in houses or in anything else that men make by the use of their muscles and brain. It was the sacred rights of property in land, and not co-partnership, that stood between the people and content, rest, and prosperity. The land has been sold, and we recognise such a thing as the "" sacred rights."" I have been rather amused to hear some people twitting us with not being supporters of arbitration, in view of the fact that it was the Labour party that forced arbitration to the front. I cannot speak with authority in regard to other States, but I can so far as New South Wales is concerned. There the Government, of which Sir George Reid was the head, and the honourable member for Parramatta was a member, introduced a Conciliation Bill. Sir George Reid would not accept compulsory arbitration, and we had to fight him on the question; and this was one of the reasons why that Government was defeated. The honourable member for Hume, who was then in the New South Wales Parliament, agreed to bring in a Compulsory Arbitration B ill , because that was what the Labour party had fought for and had put on their platform. Sir JO HN FORREST I introduced a compulsory arbitration measure in Western Australia and passed it when there was no Labour party. only fair to say, what has been publicly stated, that the honourable member for Swan did so in Western Australia just before Federation, when there was a motion of censure against his Government, and three votes were in question. without any foundation. It has been so stated by members of the Labour party, and no one else. It is not correct; there is not A good many years one word of truth in it. orable member's denial. in the matter; but the statement is without foundation. I had introduced a measure the year before. It is the second occasion when a B ill was introduced that the honourable member is talking about. accept the honourable member's statement. Compulsory arbitration has been one of the planks of the Labour platform; and when it was first proposed, who opposed it? It was adopted in the teeth of Conservative opposition.

Whether the Labour party will have the ability and courage to lead and guide in this direction I . w ill not say; but I am emphatically of opinion that a party whose highest ideal is co-partnership can never do so. To suppose that social unrest can be settled by means of co partnership is as idiotic as to suppose that you can sweep back the incoming tide with a broom. I believe that I shall be expressing, not only my own views but the views of every member of the Government, and I feel sure of every member of the party that has so willingly and loyally supported us, when I say that I. rejoice that this motion of censure has been submitted. I am delighted at the language in which it is couched. We are pleased beyond measure with the speeches that have been delivered in its support. Very little has been said, up to the present, about partisan appointments or the extravagant expenditure of money. Four ex-Minis ters have spoken, and scarcely a reference has been made to these subjects. gravamen of the charge against us has been that we have refused to unsheath the sword, to fix the bayonet, to put ball into the rifle, in order to overawe and shoot down our own kith and kin in the streets of the capital of Queensland. We shall' be able to go before the people and prove that we have done more than any other Government to provide an army and a navy for this country. We were not content merely to pass a Bill. We had the courage to take action. We breathed life into the dry bones. We have created and are creating an army and a navy to-day, so that, if ever the occasion arises-whic h Heaven forbid !-the people of Australia will be able to give a good account of themselves in face of a foreign foe. While we shall be able to go before the people and prove these things, we shall also be able to show that the Opposition have endeavoured to censure us because we refused firmly to use the power created in this way to trample Australians into the dust. The result of this debate is a foregone conclusion. Nobody on the Ministerial side, no Minister, has hacl one anxious thought about the issue. Not one of our supporters has had any doubt about the conclusion. It has not raised one false hope in the minds of honourable members opposite. know that our majority is assured, they know that our phalanx is unbroken, as far as this House is concerned. We all realize that this is but a mimic battle. But in a few months the conflict' will be transferred from the circumscribed area of this chamber to the whole field of Australia. We shall not then be speaking merely from the floor of this House, but the public platforms will be our sounding-boards. From every one of our platforms, I can assure the Opposition, there will be emblazoned this motion, and the natural corollary to it. That natural corollary is that if honourable members opposite had been in power, the troops would have gone to Brisbane. If that is not the natural corollary, then the submission of this motion is a mere waste of time. If it is not the natural corollary, the speeches that have been delivered in support of the motion have been nothing better than "" sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal."" We are prepared to face the battle on this great question. It will not be long before we shall have to meet those who can either send us back here in triumph or dismiss us with contempt. We are quite prepared to face the people, who will be asked to decide between this party, which believes that the The products of the world should be in the hands of the producers, and the party opposite, who have nothing to offer the disinherited but a co-operative store and the rattle of musketry. We shall enter into that conflict with all the confidence of victors; we shall throw ourselves into the battle with all tlie assurance of those who have victory in sight. Sitting suspended from 6.25 to 7.4,5 -p.m. have followed'this debate from its inception very carefully, and the further it has proceeded, the more satisfied have I been that the-launching of this vote of no confidence in the Government is justified. The very weakness of the position taken up by the Ministerialists is evidenced by the peroration to the recent speech of the Minister of External Affairs. Their whole aim has been to conceal the real gravamen of this vote of no confidence, and endeavour to make members of the Opposition declare that if they had been in the position of responsibility in which the Government were placed lately, they would have called out the military, and sent them to billet themselves upon the citizens of Brisbane. That, I think, is not carrying on this discussion in a manner They which will commend itself to the common senseof the people of Australia. There",44,Speech
286,Mr Sampson (Wimmera) [7.45],"Ihas been no statement made by any member of the Opposition which indicates anything of the kind. Bendigo stated it. ber for Bendigo merely stated what he would do if the circumstances justified action. So far as I recollect-and he is well able to defend himself-h e made no direct statement that in the circumstances which existed he would have called out the military in connection with the Brisbane strike. from the Opposition side in this debate is more drastic than the statements which were made during times of quietude by the Prime Minister and members cf the Ministerial party. Of course, I can quite understand how it has been found necessary that the whole trend of this debate should be sidetracked, in order that the Ministerial party might excuse themselves for backing up a strike which represents the first taste of syndicalism we have had in Australia. I venture to say that no responsible Ministers in a National Parliament could possibly blow hot and cold as Commonwealth Ministers have done in connection with that strike and retain the confidence of the people. Every speech from the other side has been an apologetic support of the strike. Honourable members opposite have endeavoured at every opportunity to fasten upon the Opposition the statement that they would have called out the military if they had occupied a similar position, when, as a matter of fact, there has been no statement made on this side which is consistent with any other interpretation than that if the Opposition had been in power the course they would have taken would have been to give to ""the Premier of Queensland an assurance that this National Parliament would see that the law was vindicated, and the civil authority maintained. That is all that was required. I was not in Queensland during the strike. It is not a matter on which I intend to speak at length to-night. I have followed this debate as carefully as I possibly could. I have heard the speeches on each side. I heard the impassioned eloquence of the honourable member for Brisbane, who, in the first part of his speech, did not excuse the strike. The only conclusion I can come to is that, as at one time the civil power was overthrown in Queensland, as the control of that city had been passed over to the leaders of the strike, it was the bounden duty of the Commonwealth Government to state firmly and definitely, in response to the request of the Premier of that State, that, whilst they did not see the necessity then of calling out the military to preserve order, he might depend upon the National Parliament to see that order was maintained. That was all that was necessary, and that is all that is asserted by the Opposition. But instead of doing that, the Prime Minister forwarded a spineless kind of reply that he did not see the necessity of sending the military. This reply, in effect, was an apology for the strike. It gave an opportunity to those who wished to defy the law to continue to do so, showing as it did clearly that the present Government, being under the domination of unions, was unable to express, freely and fearlessly their sense of the obligation which rested upon them to see that the civic authority of the State was maintained. The question of the right of the tramway men in Brisbane to wear badges was to be referred to the Arbitration Court. Whilst that matter was contained in the plaint, and the Court was waiting to hear the case, the men insisted upon the right to wear the badges. This was clearly against the instructions of the Tramway Company, and the men were not allowed to go to work. I admit that, technically, that was a lock-out, but the real cause of the lock-out was the insistence on the part of the men in acting in defiance of the instructions and regulations of the Tramway Company whilst a case was already filed and waiting to be dealt with by the Arbitration Court. The result of that mistaken and misguided action on the part of the tramway men, who, the honourable member for Brisbane told us, were not informed that the question of the right to wear the badges was contained in the plaint, was that no less than forty-three unions came out in sympathy with them. What was the object of their coming out if it was not for the purpose of paralyzing trade, overthrowing the civil authority, which they did, and taking into their hands the reins of government? It was an experiment in syndicalism. Notwithstanding the disaster and the magnitude of the strikes in Great Britain. I know of no place in the world where, during the last year or two, such a general attempt has been made to enforce the revolutionary principles of syndicalism as was witnessed in Brisbane.

290,Mr Sampson,"No statement madelater will wonder that this exhibition of syndicalism, which contemplates the general strike, did not work much more disastrous effects. When the civil authority had been overthrown, when the strike leaders had taken in hand the control of the city of Brisbane, and when the Premier of Queensland had appealed to the Prime Minister for military aid, all that Mr Fisher required to do was to send a firm reply intimating that whilst he considered the time hacl not yet arrived for calling out the troops, he would see that the laws of the country were upheld, and that the civil power and Executive authority of Queensland were amply vindicated. After all, it must be recollected that our military force consists of our own citizens, who would not be likely to injure their fellows. A statement of that kind would have hacl such a moral effect on the citizens of Brisposed upon us. But the time will asbane, and such a terrorizing effect on the strikers, that the Queensland Government, instead of being obliged to swear in special constables, would have been able to maintain and vindicate the civil power without interruption from the strikers. Whether the need existed for calling out the military is not a question which demands serious discussion. It is merely an attempt to side-track the real issue. The weakness of the position taken up by the Ministerial supporters is in condoning this first exhibi£4,000,000, the Oodnadatta railway and tion of syndicalism in Australia. In order to excuse the action of the Government the real issue has hacl to be obscured. I come now to the speech which was delivered by the Governor General at the openCapital ing of the present session. I have carefully perused it, and I have endeavoured to extract the ""meat"" from it. I have studied the thirty-nine articles which comprise ita members who will fully express their views very significant number from a constitutional aspect. I have endeavoured to pick out the questions mentioned in that speech which are likely to come up for serious discussion during the present session. TheseI have reduced to four in number, excluding the recrudescences from previous Vice-Regal utterances. They comprise the maternity grant, constitutional amendment, the Northern Territory policy, and the Navigation Bill. There are several other measures mentioned, such as Bankruptcy and Copyright-measure s which were promised in previous Governor General's Speeches, ancl measures in respect of which the Government have failed to fulfil their pledges. 1 do not intend to deal at length with the financial proposals of the Ministry, because I recognise that it is very difficult to criticise a Government which has produced a surplus of £2,250,000 for the year. At the same time, the Ministry cannot escape responsibility for having increased our expenditure during the past two years by £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 per annum. However big the surplus may be, however buoyant the revenue may be, we know that that revenue comes from the pockets of the people. The taxpayers of Australia may be able to pay the taxation imposed upon them during years of unprecedented prosperity, but when the lean years arrive they will inevitably feel the pinch. I rejoice to know that we are evidencing a wonderful capacity for production. We are able, by reason of the good seasons which we have experienced, to pay the heaviest taxation which has yet been imsuredly come when we shall have to adopt a policy of retrenchment, and probably that thankless task will devolve upon a Liberal Government. I repeat that while our expenditure has increased by £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 per annum during the past two years, the Government have incurred new. liabilities to the extent of £12,500,000. The construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, which work we all approve, will absorb Northern Territory debt now amounts to £5,500,000, which means an annual loss of £500,000 for many years. Then the contemplated expenditure upon the Federal will amount to another £3,000,000. As to the wisdom of incurring that expenditure there is a good deal of difference of opinion amongst honourable upon it at a later stage of the session. The case of the Northern Territory was dealt with by the Minister of Externa] Affairs in the spirited speech which he delivered before the suspension of the sitting to-day. But before he announced the nature of the land policy to be adopted in connection with that Territory, it seems to me that he should have submitted a Land Bill to this House in order to permit the whole question to be discussed,, and to afford honourable members an opportunity of sanctioning whatever . form of land tenure they chose to approve. The honourable gentleman made it quite clear that leaseholds in the Territory will be immediately negotiable-that those who take them up will be able to transfer at once under conditions' which he did not state, freehold principle in connection with its but which will require the eon'sent of thelands.

Cqming .to another matter, I recognise the Australian Notes Act as the best stroke of constructive policy for which the Government are responsible. I shall leave it to expert financiers to speak on the subject of finance, merely saying that it is the bounden duty of the Treasurer, having made bank notes a Commonwealth monopoly, to see that nothing is done which may injure our credit. Australia has now a splendid credit, though it does not possess the reserves, the accumulation of wealth, and the financial stability of older countries. We cannot claim to have the huge accu: mulated reserves of capital possessed by such countries as Great Britain, France, and Germany, and,therefore, in entering upon a new departure in connection with our Australian Notes Act, we should have made provision for a gold reserve for our notes certainly not less than that provided for by Statute law in the older countries I have mentioned. We can develop this -country only by broadening ithe basis .of our trade relations with other countries of the world. We must in this way be more or less influenced by the systems of currency operating in the countries with which we have established trade relations. In the circumstances I say that this National Parliament, charged with the duty of -establishing and safeguarding the credit of the country, should have provided even a .much higher gold reserve for its note issue [3 JULY, 1912.] Address-inrReply. 393 than has been found necessary in olderestablished communities. But the lessees, after sixteen There is one paragraph of the Speech the discussion upon which I thought would be left to the debate on the Budget. It ,has reference to the £500,000 proposed to be given to Tasmania under section 96 of the Constitution. I am prepared to admit that some honourable members on both sides will regard this as a considerable sum, but as one cf the members of the Tasmanian Customs Leakage Commission, I say that the Government proposal treats the Tasmanian people in a niggardly manner. That Commission was composed of members from both sides, of all shades of political opinion. They visited Tasmania, and made exhaustive investigations into.the financial relation^ existing between that State and the mainland. After their inquiry ,they unanuuous,ly decided that Tasmania is entitled, -under section 96 .of the Constitution, to an amount from the National Treasury of something like ,£900,000. The Government, ih cutting their estimate down ,to £500,000, are treating tlie Chairman and members of that Committee very cavalierly, to say the least of it. The Tasmanian Government, .through the transfer of their .Customs revenue to the .Commonwealth, lost during the .first nine years of Federation between £900,000 and £ 1., 000,000. Direct, taxation , in the State amounted to 12s. rod, per .head at the beginning of Federation, and it had increased to 3.2s -fid. per head in. 1909, . or by 19s. ,8d., whilst .the increase in direct taxation over the whole Commonwealth for the same period was only 2s. iod. per head. I shpuld, perhaps, make it clear that these figures cover a period no later than 1909. We know .that taxation in. the Commonwealth since 1909 has been increased substantially. Tasmania is the smallest State in the group, and, if we are a true Federation, it is our duty, not merely because of the provision contained in section 96 of the Constitution, but because this Parliament is bound to see that the citizens of no one State shall suffer financially through the operation of Federal laws, to come to the assistance of such a State as Tasmania.

When we were discussing Supplyon Friday last, I said something on the subject of our defence system. willing to admit that, after ""the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence is probably the best asset the present Ministerial party possesses. I believe that the success of the Minister of Defence, so far, has been mainly achieved because he has endeavoured to carry out the monumental piece of legislation passed by the Liberal Government of 1909, in establishing for the first time within the British Empire a system of compulsory service, and laying down a fleet unit, on lines suggested at a Conference held in Great Britain, which is unanimously approved in Australia, because it maintains the connection between the Commonwealth and Great Britain, and gives us a fleet which for practical purposes we can really call our own. The schemes of compulsory military citizen defence and the building of a fleet unit at the disposal of the Admiralty, should extraordinary occasion render that necessary, are two monumental pieces of constructive legislation which must be placed absolutely to tfie credit of the Liberal Government. The success of the present Minister of Defence is due to the fact that he has loyally endeavoured to carry out those two great, schemes initiated by the Liberal Government, and to the amplification of the military scheme suggested in the report of Lord Kitchener, the eminent soldier from the centre"" of the Empire, who was invited to visit the Commonwealth by the same Liberal Government. and "" Liberal"" go well together. considers that both convey the idea of permanency. manent measures that make for the amelioration of the people, and do justice to every class in the community, we must go back over the list of measures passed by the Liberal Governments that have successively held office in the Commonwealth. namesake pulled down certain permanent pillars. what little I can to assist in pulling down the present Government. which the honourable member's deputy leader denounced the compulsory business. orable gentleman's credit that he had sufficient constructive ability to successfully I am pilot through this House the two great measures to which I have referred, in the face of thefiercestopposition that this Parliament has ever seen. I should like now to call attention to the neglect of the present Government on the important question of establishing an all-red cable service from Australia to Great Britain. The Liberal Governments some years ago.laid a cable across the Pacific Ocean to the coast of Canada, and it is generally understood that that has had the effect of bringing down the cable rates, both to the general public and the press of Australia. At a conference of pressmen held in London in September last, it was acknowledged that, owing to the competition of the Pacific Cable, the rates for ordinary cable messages had been reduced from 4s. gd. to 3s. per word, whilst a substantial reduction had also been made in the rates for press messages. The credit for the laying of that cable belongs to the Liberal Governments of Australia, and so far its working has resulted in a loss-bu t fortunately a diminishing less-amountin g at present to about £20,000 a year. At the Colonial Conference held in London in 1911 Sir Joseph Ward movedThat in view of the social and commercial advantages which would result from increased facilities for intercommunication between her Dependencies and Great Britaini t is desirable that all possible means be taken to secure a deduction in cable rates throughout the Empire. Following upon the adoption of that resolution, Senator Pearce, as a representative of Australia, movedThat this Conference recommends the nationalization of the Atlantic cable in order If we are to look for perto cheapen and render more effective telegraphic communication between Great Britain, Canada, and New Zealand by thus acquiring complete control of all the telegraphic and cable lines along the All Red route. A further resolution was carriedThat in the event of considerable reductions in trans-Atlantic cable rates not being effected in the near future it is desirable that the laying of a State-owned cable between England and Canada be considered by a' subsidiary conference.

In a time of abundant prosperity, by putting on one side a fair proportion of the surplus to accumulate in a separate fund , it would be possible, in the course of years, to alter the present pensions system by introducing the contributory element.

General himself said that Victoria had iargely benefited from the disintegration of large estates, to the extent of settlement on hundreds of thousands of acres. To my mind, it is absolutely conclusive that the only result of the Federal land tax in Victoria has been not to burst up large estates and to settle people upon the land; certainly not to the extent of more than 500 cases a year. Even as to those, I do not suppose that the most ardent advocate of the land tax will claim that a few of the 500 settlers did not obtain their land in ihe ordinary way of purchase and transfer quite independently of the operation of the Federal land tax. settlement before 1910? the same. Considerably more, was it not? but I think that the increase would be about the same. I may state, in reply to the interjection, that during the last two j-ears there has been a good deal of activity in the settlement of the Mallee which did not obtain for a number of years. steady increase in the number of holdings. We had a bigger increase in cldser settlement. We had a larger subdivision of estates in 1908-9, because money was cheaper, and there was a greater demand for land. These figures show conclusively that the claim that the Federal land tax has increased the number of immigrant settlers is a dismal piece of make-believe. effect. Nobody disputes the fact that it is a large revenue producer. That is a question which we do not wish to discuss now; I , for one, am not prepared to do so. I believe that every member of the Opposition would have been pleased if any Jegitimate Federal law had had the effect of bringing out a large number of immigrants to people and cultivate the unoccupied areas of Victoria, or other parts of Australia. make, in the Governor General's Speech., the audacious statement that, through the operation of the land tax, a large number of immigrants have been placed on the land, and that land is now easy to obtain, it is nothing more cr less than an attempt to deceive the public. Seeing that during the last twelve months the largest number of immigrants have found their way into Victoria, if the Government's claim had a tittle of foundation, it must show that the number of settlers placed on the land through the operation of the Federal land tax was greater in proportion than could be found in any other State in the Union. tax heavier? a policy for the Government in ""this connection. I have made other suggestions where I believe the Government have been guilty of a grave dereliction of duty in bringing forward measures which contained the impress of some statesmanship upon them; hut I do not intend to state a policy for the Government. It will be quite time enough for the Liberal party to announce, a policy when we come to grips at the next election. We could have had no better proof of the desire of the present Government to continue to rule this country under a system of close water-tight organizations than the absence of a reference to electoral reform from the Opening Speech. We have the most defective electoral system to be found in any part of Australia. This is supposed to be a Democratic Parliament, and to lead tlie State Parliaments in enacting measures democratic to the very core. The very foundation of Democracy is electoral machinery, to insure that the will of the majority shall be given expression to, and the Parliament be truly representative of the corporate intelligence of the people. Yet that is the very thing which the Government seemed to fight shy of. the previous Government take some action ? vernment was not able to do everything. It made a legislative record which is unparalleled in the history of Commonwealth achievement. At present, it is impossible for our party to do anything. It was only through the extravagant promises of the Labour party-promise s which have never been fulfilled-that the people, for the But when the Government time being, were hypnotized into giving a vote which I hope they will never repeat.

If the responsibility of the Government rested in this House, it would be loudly clamouring for some such electoral reform; but as the real responsibility rests with the bodies that control the Government, but are outside the House, Ministers believe that they can score best by perpetuating the present unjust system, because, whatever differences Of opinion might arise in connection with those outside their own fold, there is no possibility of such differencejs arising within their own fold. This is, after all, only another evidence that the outside organizations are controlling this plank as well as other planks of the policy which honourable members are elected to carry out, and which is it that you they must carry out at their political peril. I have addressed the House much longer than I intended to do. I have endeavoured JOHN FORREST -It was never so to avoid ground which has already been traversed during this debate. I believe that the discussion of this motion, as it will be recorded in the pages of Hansard, will be read at the next election as the indictment which will result in the deposition of the Government from the Treasury bench. The very fact that Ministerial supporters are harking back to the question of whether or not the military should have been called out during the recent Brisbane tramway strike is an evidence of the weakness of their case. It is an admission that they cannot defend the indictment which has been hurled against them, and consequently I say that the Government should suffer for their misdeeds when they face the people. I believe that the electors of Australia have already declared their preparedness to displace them. I hold the view that the people of the Commonwealth are too strong believers in Democracy, too great lovers of liberty to allow their freedom to be bartered away, or to permit of their institutions being undermined by a party whose members are bound hand and foota party which seeks to transfer the liberative Chamber to a secret caucus outside of it .",54,Foster Th E English Two Years

I find that the definition of a "" Democratic party "" or a "" Democracy "" isThat form of government, in which the sovereignty of the State is vested in and exerover any attempt at State control. It implies cised by the people at large, the populace regarded as rulers. Not by a section of the people. and combines, but by the great mass of the people. We are here as the Democritic party pledged to do all we possibly can by legislation for the amelioration of the conditions of the people. A Democrat is one who adheres to Democracy, or a government by the people. As reformers they seek to change from worse to better, to amend, to correct, to reclaim; to abandon that which is evil; to amend that which is defective, vicious, corrupt, or depraved; to change the regulations of parliamentary institutions. The party opposite includes the Free Trade party, the Protectionist party, the Liberal party, the People's party, the Single Tax party-the honourable member for Parramatta will not deny that-and a number of other parties. These different parties are joined in a fusion for what purpose? For the purpose of getting on to the Treasury bench. That is their first consideration, and not the true interests of 'the people. I wish to direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that one of the charges made against the Government by the honourable member for Ballarat, and one of a very small character, indeed, was that they had delayed matters in connection with the prosecution of the Coal Vend. I need do no more than refer honourable members who did not hear it to the speech of the Attorney-General in reply, to that charge. They will in all fairness admit that the honourable gentleman absolutely proved that the Government did everything they possibly could in that matter, and that th^ra was not a moment's delay in the prosecution of the Trust for which they could be held responsible. The result of the prosecution was that some forty different offenders were fined £500 each. That money will go into the people's Treasury now, because, from what I have seen in the press, I understand that the defendants have abandoned their appeal. question of industrial unrest, it will be found at page 80 of Hansard for this session that the Leader of the Opposition advised this Parliament and the people, as a panacea for that evil, to introduce the principle of profit-sharing. I believe that the honourable member for Parramatta holds the same view. The Leader of the Opposition saidThose methods possessed enormous advantages a handling of business directly between the employers or owners of the works and their employees. When the latter are satisfied with their lot, as they appear to be most abundantly satisfied in England in several great enterprises, and in a few elsewhere, we have a solution of the problem. Let me tell honourable members what is the position in England to-day as described by one of the principal members of the Immake the following quotation from a cablegram dated as late as the first of this month :The Chancellor of the Exchequer ( Mr Lloyd-George) addressed a gathering of 5,000 persons at Woodford on Saturday on the benefits of his National Insurance Act. In the course of his speech he said :"" We boast that we' have the largest navy in the world, the greatest commerce by land and sea, the greatest mercantile marine, and that we are the greatest Empire the world has ever seen! When shall we think it worthwhile to boast that we are an Empire of the happiest people, free from poverty and from the terrors of children crying for bread? In front of you is the biggest task the democracy of Great Britain has ever undertaken. We have got to free a land shackled with the chains of feudalism from that which is a shame and disgrace to the richest country in the world. The Insurance Act is a beginning, and, with God's help, it will be but a beginning."" These statements also appear in the pressIt is rumoured that the Asquith Ministry is preparing a Radical land policy, which will include provision for the minimum wage for agricultural labourers, and land courts, which will fix rents and terms of land tenancy. George has inaugurated n far-reaching inquiry into the land question in England and Wales, and has appointed a commission for the purpose. Later, this statement was published in the presslished by the New York Outlook, of which Mr Roosevelt is associate editor. millions of idle rich in Great Britain, who lounge about London clubs, walk about the country with guns over their shoulders and Speaking on the dogs at their heels, and have motoring and golf as their serious occupations.

375,Mr Lloyd,"George states :"" There are twosatisfaction which the principle of profit-sharing is giving to the people of England. members of the Opposition present. These quotations are too rough for them. gret that honourable members of the Opposition are not prepared to remain here to listen to some truths that I intend to give them concerning the position within the neighbourhood of their own homes, and which show the absolute necessity for some of the legislation that has been passed by this Government. The Labour party is determined, whether in office or out of office, to constantly press forward with proposals that will enable every man, woman, and child in Australia, not only to live, but to be properly fed and clothed. I have now a quotation regarding a strike at Adelaide which should interest the honourable member for Wakefield, who, I regret, is temporarily absent from the chamber. The quotation, which I take from the Herald of 30th ultimo, is as followsAbout thirty girls engaged at the white work factory of 6. and R. Wills and Co. have ceased work because a request for higher wages has been refused. The girls were mainly employed to manufacture underclothing, and the rates for certain articles have been 2s. 3d. per dozen. As only half-a-dozen could be made in a day the girls asked for 3s. a dozen, but the demand was refused, and the girls went on strike. Is there an honourable member of the Opposition who would not justify the action of the girls in striking, or resorting to any other means of resisting the demand that they should work from morn till night for a wage of about 6s. 3d. per week? This is what is happening in Adelaide, where the honourable member for Wakefield has had an opportunity to Break down such a condition of .affairs. Would he send out the military to shoot down these girls who went out on strike? I come now to the question of Protection. I have always regarded the Leader of the Opposition as a sound Protectionist, and I believe in my heart that .he is a Protectionist to-day. I ask him, however, whether he has surrounded him.self with a body to whom he can look with any hope of carrying into force a Protectionist policy? Can he expect to obtain Protection from the honourable member for Lang, the honourable member for Parkes, the honourable member for Illawarra, the 'honourable member for Wakefield, and other .members of his party whom I could mention ? Opposition tried to secure the return of Mr Conroy as the representative of Werriwa, but had he been elected, he would have given him no help whatever to secure a thoroughly Protectionist Tariff. The Sydney Daily Telegraph, which is supporting the Opposition at the present time, is pointing out now, as it has before, that the Fusion compact does not bind one Free Trader in the Opposition to vote for Protection. It points out that the members of that party have a perfectly free hand to vote for as wide a measure of Free Trade ns they please. Then, again, outside bodies with whom the Leader of the Opposition has associated himselfI refer particularly to the Women's National Leaguehave in the very fore-front of their programme the retention of the present Tariff. They would not interfere with it. It is a good old Conservative principle that existing institutions should not be interfered with, and therefore the Women's National League say that, although the Tariff is not good enough, we must retain it as it is. The Leader of the Opposition can have no hope of securing a vote for Protection from the party with which he is associated. I desire to make my own position clear. I have always been a Protectionist, and in this House have voted every time for the highest duties. When the Tariff of 1508 was before us the honourable member for Bendigo, who was a member of the old Liberal party to which I belonged, refused to vote adequate Protection in respect of many Australian manufactures, simply, because the rate of duty proposed was higher than that which the Tariff Commission, of which he was Chairman, had recommended. He wanted to make himself the absolute arbiter of the measure of Protection to be granted to Australia, on the ground that the Commission, of which he was chairman, had declared that certain duties ought to be imposed. When it was shown in this House that the duties proposed by the Commission in many cases were insufficient, he, amongst others, declined to vote for a higher duty. member vote for the highest duty on wire netting ? would do so again to-morrow. Whilst there are some good Protectionists in the ranks of the Opposition, there are also some excellent Free Traders, who have been",58,Foster Th E English Two Years

What we desire, however, is not the protection of one section of the community, but the protection of the manufacturer, the wage-earner, and the consumer. uphold the manufacturer, and to help him along; Protection to help the wage-earner, the artisan, the mechanic, the labourer, and the clerk, and also Protection for the consumer who is now, in many instances, being robbed.

That principle was good enough for every member of the old Liberal party in those days, and they voted for it. If it was good then, how can it be said that it is bad to-day? policy for which we have declared-the policy embodied in an Act of Parliament, but subsequently held by the High Court to be unconstitutional. It is absurd to say that it is impossible to fix prices. Every one is really doing so at the present time. For instance, produce merchants are fixing the price of butter. In the newspapers yesterday, we saw a statement that the Sussexstreet ring in Sydney had fixed the price of butter for six months, and they have "" honourable understandings "" with similar associations in Melbourne and elsewhere. The unfortunate housewife has to pay for this. What cure does the Leader of the Opposition propose for all this? understand him aright, he would hand over to the Inter-State Commission the determination of all such matters. When one looks at the Constitution, and sees the multitudinous powers and responsibilities with which that body may be clothed, one wonders how it would be possible for it to deal also with this great question of the Tariff. If the Inter-State Commission carried out the primary duties for which it was created, it would be impossible for it to give to the Tariff question the time necessary to enable it to be properly dealt with. Honourable members themselves know what is really required in respect of the Tariff. They can obtain sufficient information to enable them to deal with it, and whenever any Protectionist proposal is submitted to this House, I shall vote for it, always keeping in view the necessity for protecting, not only the manufacturer, but the wage-earner and . the consumer. Time will not permit me to justify the Leader of the Opposition in the action he We desire effective Protection to then took in regard to agricultural machinery. This was made the subject of inquiry by the Royal Commission on the harvester industry, of which I , among other honourable members, was a member It was known then, and it is known now, that the farmers, who are being gulled into voting against the Labour party, were and are being robbed By the Agricultural Machinery Combine day after day ancl week after week. The accusation of partisan appointments has been dealt In that with by the Minister of External Affairs, and I shall not further refer to it.

Fortunately for us, we have not to go bej-ond the Northern Territory for' experience in this connection-a n experience which no man who thinks well of his country would care to see perpetuated.

The line has been absolutely choked by this absentee company, which, like the dog in the manger, will not use the land itself, or allow any one else to use it. The leasehold system may be difficult to apply in the more settled States, like Victoria and New South Wales, but the Government are to be commended for their determination that the land irt the Northern Territory shall be leasehold. Why is the freeholder backed up in this House by so many? It is simply because, when he gets his title, he can traffic in the land, holding it for a rise without producing anything whatever, and reap the increment which belongs to the people. No land should be disposed of by the Government except for the purpose of production; and that end will be attained under the leasehold system. leaseholder will get the land for many years without payment, and afterwards at a very low rental.

The Commonwealth note issue has been condemned; but what was the position in the past? Then the notes were issued by the Associated Banks, which paid a small tax of 2 per cent, to the' various State Governments. A person had to pay 20s. into a bank in return for a piece of paper, which was a promise to pay on demand; and money was poured into the banks by millions. Now, however, the position is reversed, and the banks have to go to the Commonwealth Treasury and pay money for the people's piece of paper. That is a considerable reform; and already, notwithstanding what the honourable member for Bendigo has said, over £180,000 has been earned in this way by the Commonwealth. Will any one tell me that theguarantee behind the notes of the -Associated Banks, with their few millions, is> as valuable as the guarantee of the TreaI n the first place, the sury, backed by the whole of the resourcesof Australia ? What is the good of speaking about £4,000,000, or any other amount, as a reserve ?

The Commonwealth has a revenue of £20,000,000 per annum;, and the argument that we cannot have a* note issue of £10,000,000 without being involved in difficulties is one that might be used at a debating society or a meeting of the Women's NationalI .eague, but not in this House..

Nevertheless the Queensland Government engineered this charge of trying to starve the people of Brisbane. It was published in the press throughout the length and breadth of Australia. The attempt to show that riot and disturbance prevailed in Brisbane is nonsense. It has been said that a shot was fired in Brisbane. Who fired the shot ? An honourable member said here that he was precaucus now right enough. pared to name the individual who did, and to bring an eye-witness of the act. The shot was not fired by a striker, but by a sub-inspector of police. Why was it fired amongst innocent persons who were not disturbing anybody? Was it not a part of the game to rouse them? If anything will rouse passion in the breast of an ordinary man it is the danger of either himself or those belonging to him being injured in that way. Notwithstanding all these attempts to make the men break the peace, the authorities could not succeed, and then they went to the Commonwealth for assistance. The Constitution was made by the people of Australia, and the Defence Act was passed in conformity with the Constitution by their representatives in was done in caucus; not a word was let Parliament. The Act clearly provides what should have been done before any call was made upon the Federal Government for military assistance. First there had to be a proclamation by the Governor of Queensland that a state of domestic violence existed. That proclamation was not issued, nor has. it jet been issued.

There was no division, and the motion of the honourable member for Bendigo was carried unanimously.

To which the Leader of the Opposition repliedI desired to prevent bloodshed. The honourable member admitted just now that there is a better guarantee of success when authorized persons undertake the control of a popular rising than when that control is left to unauthorized persons. For that reason, if for no other, the Commonwealth Government should have stepped in on the occasion in question. What inference can be drawn from these remarks.

I recollect a disturbance in New South Wales many years ago, but on that occasion the Riot Act was read by a proper official. If Brisbane was in a state of riot, why was not the Riot Act read there? The fact is that there was no made by the honourable member for Brisbane the other night, and particularly to his remarks about the manner in which Mr an opportunity to make when the honourable Coyne and the other leaders of the men, instead of inciting them to disorder, moved among them, and counselled them under no circumstances to resort to violence.

I asked the honourable member to withdraw that, and was called to order by you, sir, and ordered to resume my seat, which of course I immediately did. I wish to say that I am not aware that the Minister of External Affairs made any speech last night. He did make one to-day, in which he quoted from a speech JOHN FORREST -Why did Mr of mine made some time or other. I shall satisfy myself by a reference to Hansard, which the honourable member for Riverina will pardon me for saying I prefer to a second-hand statement, as to what the Minister did say about myself. But I most certainly did not, last night, or at any other time, deny the truth of anything said by the Minister of External Affairs. The honourable member was in error in making that statement.

It must be recognised that if we sard a report of a speech which I had the make the terms upon which land can be leased sufficiently liberal, people will be as ready to honour of making in this House. lease land as to purchase it . We arc in a position to give liberal terms, and we can best conserve the interests of the natives of New Guinea, who should receive our first consideration, by adopting the principle of leasing. In leasing -the land we cannot only'secure lo them their present rights, but can afford them opportunities to ascend the scale of civilization by prcvenliag the speculator from trafficking in it. We have been told that the territory contains enormous mineral wealth, and that its soil will grow with marked success all kinds of tropical products. Buti f the land can be sold ia fee simple, large areas of It may be acquired and held by speculators, who may prevent persons desiring to cultivate or to use it in other ways from obtaining possession of it. Furthermore, the conditions of the natives under such circumstances wil l practically amount to a state of semi-slavery. The industrial legislation passed by this House would be evaded, and our desires frustrated, if these tropical products were raised by the labour of the natives, and exploited by the speculator. Not only will the practice of selling the land give opportunities to exploit the country, but its unfortunate aboriginal inhabitants will be dispossessed of their property, and will become virtually the bond slaves c f those who acquire it. That was the statement upon which I based the remarks to which the honourable member for Laanecoorie has taken exception. I withdraw my remarks with pleasure, as the honourable member assures me that he was not here and did not make the interjection I attributed to him.
