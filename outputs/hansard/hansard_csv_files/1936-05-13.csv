LANE -In view of the lavish amount of money that has been given to the farmers by way of subsidies on fertilizers, is the Minister not of the opinion that they should have been able to grow such bountiful crops and so substantially to increase their incomes as to be no longer in need of a. renewal of the subsidy? the granting of a subsidy for the use of fertilizers for the purpose of growing crops other than wheat is to encourage the primary producers of Australia to use more fertilizers, and thus increase their production and enlarge our exports from Australia. This is considered to be a very sound business proposition from the point of view of the Commonwealth Government. the Commonwealth Government has to pay bounties on primary production in order to make up the difference between the cost of production and selling prices, does the Acting Minister for Commerce consider it a safe business proposition to The Commonwealth Governpay a subsidy on fertilizers to increase production when the farmers cannot sell their surplus production at a profit now? honourable gentleman, I suggest that he' is rather at sea in his question, because the bulk of the subsidy is paid on fertilizers that are used for the production of cropj which are not receiving bounties, such as pasture improvement and production of hay, ancl crops other than those referred to by the honourable gentleman.

The report was tabled, surer's Advance. This provision, which on the 14th November last.

In accordance with the usual practice, details of expenditure met in this way must be set out in the form of supplementary estimates, and these items are now submitted for covering appropriation. As copies of these estimates have been circulated among honourable members, I do not intend to refer to the items in detail. The vote for the Treasurer's Advance for 1934-1935 was £2,000,000. It has been the usual practice in recent years to make provision for that sum. The expenditure from that V IIIXI . ---The vote was £689,625, made up of £672,112 for the ordinary departmental expenditure and war services payable from revenue, and £17,513 for additions, new works and buildings.

51,Mr Ctjrtnr (Fremantle) [3.19],".""Estimates. The expenditure on Miscellaneous Services, which accounts for £34S,000 of the. total, includes payments which have not been authorized by Parliament, but which have been incurred because of administrative decisions of the Government. The reason, presumably, why the Auditor-General's certificate is necessary before Supplementary Estimates are submitted to the committee, is merely to certify that the expenditure has been incurred; but it is for the committee to determine whether the expenditure is justified. Let Uc assume that yesterday, or the day before the Government decided to appoint a royal commission to investigate a certain matter. A commission is issued to certain gentlemen, but the fees to be paid and tie expenditure whicli they will be allowed to incur, are at that stage, matters entirely between the Government and the members of the commission. Members of this chamber hear for the first time about the expenditure incurred by the commission either upon addressing questions to Ministers, who sometimes do not furnish satisfactory replies, or when Supplementary Estimates are submitted to us. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) says that this expenditure relates to the last finanof 10 guineas is to continue for a period cial year. That is perfectly true. Several matters are referred to in the miscellaneous expenditure before us. probable that these expenditures relate to a. long inquiry, and represent moneys paid out of the Treasurer's Advance, simply because a royal commission co3t more than the Parliament expected it to cost. That is, presumably, what has happened in connection with the Wheat Commission. The committee appointed to formulate the reply of the Commonwealth to the secession petition of Western Australia involved an expenditure of £15,000, but I do not remember that matter being submitted to Parliament for determination as to whether the Government was justified in authorizing that expenditure. This branch of the legislature is responsible for the control of the public purse, and the Government should not have a licence, willy-nilly, to set up commissions, or incur any expenditure on a large scale, without parliamentary approval. Although these estimates relate to expenditure of last year, the Government has already set in action a royal commission to inquire into the monetary and banking system; but what control has thia committee over expenditure by that body ? Only to-day, I received most astounding information, in reply to a question which I placed on the notice-paper, as to the fees paid to counsel assisting that commission. Various public bodies, I understand, requested the commission to be permitted to appoint counsel to represent them, so that their witnesses might be examined by him, for the purpose of bringing forth the evidence they desired to give. The commission stated that it is competent to do all that is required, yet it has engaged counsel to assist it. I suspect that the gentleman selected is a former unsuccessful anti-Labour candidate for parliamentary honours. He is to receive a reading fee of 100 guineas, and a daily fee of 15 guineas for each sitting day. of whatever length, while the commission sits in Melbourne. For sittings out of Melbourne, a fee of 20 guineas will be paid for each sitting, of whatever length it. may be. There is to be a fee of 10 guineas a day for Saturdays, when the sittings of the commission take place out of Melbourne. Tn the event of any adjournment, the daily fee of fourteen days after the adjournment. Counsel is to be at the disposal of the It is commission during such period. If counsel is out of Melbourne, and it is necessary for him to remain out of Melbourne beyond the fourteen days of adjournment, a fee of 15 guineas a day is to be paid. The clerk's fees are to be at ordinary rates. Up to the present time, £918 7s. 6d. has been p'aid to the counsel appointed. This expenditure is being incurred in the current year, and is being met out of the Treasurer's Advance; but the estimates before us relate to expenditure met out of the Treasurer's Advance last financial year. Expenditure of the kind to which I have just referred has probably been incurred by the wheat commission. I do not know whether that body consulted Ministers as to what organization it should set up; but it engaged a large and expensive staff of advisers. I find that the total cost of the commission was over £40,000, but the fees paid to the commissioners did not amount to anything like that sum. Obviously, an expensive staff was recruited, and, probably, sumptuous offices were occupied. I desire to know what control the Government exercised over the activities of the commission in deciding to set up a lavish organization. I do not object to a commission doing this, provided the Government approves, and the Parliament is made cognizant of the scale of expenditure to be incurred. How much is the Royal -Commission on the Banking and Monetary Systems expected to cost? We do not know for what period its inquiries will be continued. Apparently, no supervision is being exercised over its activities. venture the opinion that a great deal of evidence which has been submitted orally to the commission could have been omitted if the members of the commission themselves had indulged in research into standard works on 'the subject of their investigation. It is quite reasonable to suppose that the members of a commission of this nature would be persons whose previous knowledge of the matter under consideration enabled them to avoid the obligation of having to listen for hours, at great cost to the public, to statements on banking and monetary subjects which have been made by various authorities almost for the last 30 years. The Supplementary Estimates relate to expenditure other than that authorized by the Parliament. that, in respect of the ordinary administrative expenditure of the departments, the amounts now before us represent the difference between sums voted and amounts expended, broadly speaking, the difference is not very great, and, probably, in some instances, votes have not been drawn upon at all. Yet. by and large, these Estimates afford the only opportunity that honourable members have to express their opinion concerning the use of the £2,000,000 customarily voted as an advance to the Treasurer. If we do not draw attention to the position now, we can do nothing to prevent the use of the advance for governmental purposes without parliamentary authority. I shall not now discuss the schedule in detail, but in it are certain items which should not Hfr. Curtin. appear in it without a substantive statement justifying them. Eor instance, I note further expenditure in connection with the inquiry made by the Petrol Commission. The amount, in round figures, is £2,500. Although this money has been paid, this is the first opportunity we have had to consider the expenditure. A great deal of money has been expended on this inquiry, yet we do not know what conclusions the Government has reached in regard to the commission's recommendations. I notice that the expenditure incurred by the Royal Commission on Taxation is not very large, and I am glad to see that there has bean at least one royal commission which has done its work competently, I and set a standard for others to follow. It did not go around the country inviting evidence from every Tom, Dick and Bill. sioners declined to accept any fee for his services. body of research workers, and their efforts resulted in the introduction into this Parliament of a bill designed to bring about uniform tax assessment methods as between the Commonwealth and the States, and Parliament has found the bill substantially satisfactory. In some instances, items of expenditure covered by the Treasurer's Advance are scattered in such a way as to make it difficult to see at a glance just how much Whilst it is true has really been spent. Eor instance, there is an item of £112 under the Prime Minister's Department to cover the cost of Australian representation at the International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, while under the heading of the Attorney-General's Department there is an item of £23 for the same thing. I have not had time to scan these estimates closely, but it is possible that there are similar examples occurring elsewhere. I understand that several publicity officers have been engaged by various government departments, and expenditure incurred in connection with the employment of these men may be included in these estimates, or it may not. I should like the Treasurer to say how many publicity officers the Government has appointed",17,Supplementary Estimates 1934 35

53,Mr Curtin,"It was essentially ain the Prime Minister's Department and in other departments, who they are, how mush they get, and what services they render. These Supplementary Estimates provide money for certain urgent works, but the provision of a new general post office for Brisbane is an urgent work for which no provision has been made. For many years past, honourable members. have been urging in this House the provision of better postal facilities in Brisbane. As far back as 1924 the then Government agreed to have plans and specifications prepared for a new building, but, although this is now 1936, nothing further has been done. There is a fine post office in Brisbane, erected long before federation, but it is not large enough to meet the increased demands made upon it as the result of the growth of the department's activities. The item to which the honourable member is referring is not, in the estimates before the chair. asking why it has not been included. People from the city of Brisbane and surrounding suburbs experience great difficulty in receiving attention at the General Post Office, although the staff are doing their very best. The Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs is constantly reorganizing the layout of the building in an endeavour to get the utmost possible nsa from the cramped quarters at his disposal. I ask the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) to bring this matter under' the notice of the Prime Minister and the Postmaster General, so that it may be regarded as urgent when the works Estimates are being prepared for next year. The present position is deplorable, and it should not be allowed to continue. A post office worthy of the city of Brisbane should be regarded as an urgent work. -The matter raised by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) regarding the payment of expenses to persons associated with the Royal Commission on Banking calls for an explanation from the Treasurer ( Mr Casey). Evidently these payments are made in such a way that no direct information is given regarding them during the discussion of the ordinary Estimates presented to Parliament, and the situation has developed into a public scandal. The CHAIRM AN ( Mr Prowse) The honourable member is not entitled to discuss a royal commission to which no reference is made in these Estimates. I allowed the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) to refer to the subject in passing, but it is not discussable under these items. which authorized these payments is under discussion, so that the payments it authorized should be discussable also.

This provision has been made, I presume, to assist in carrying out the work of Dr. Donald Thompson. This morning honourable members were given an opportunity to see a film made by Dr. Thompson while he was in northern Australia. I am sure that every honourable member who viewed the film must have been greatly impressed by the very fine work that Dr. Thompson is doing. We have been told that he is returning to Arnheim Land almost immediately. I , for one, can only say that the anthropological research he is undertaking has been delayed far too long. It is not yet too late, however, for good work to be. done. I have tremendous admiration for a man who is prepared to live with these unfortunate, simple people, for months on end, and is able to convince them that they need not fear the arrival of the white man. I should like the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) to state whether the amount to which I have directed attention was expended upon the work carried on by Dr. Thompson. is so. 1919 to 1931 it was ray privilege to represent the Division of Brisbane in the Parliament of the Commonwealth. In 1931, that electorate decided to make a change in its representation, and elected a very excellent member. During those years, I repeatedly brought before the Government a matter which I considered was of tremendous importance to the capital of the northern State. Since then, the honourable gentleman who now represents Brisbane( Mr George Lawson), has raised the subject frequently, and on every occasion I have supported his representations. In 1925, the Government of 'tlie day completed plans for the erection of a General. Post Office, including a. parcels office and a new telephone exchange. I believe that you, Mr Prowse, were a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee which recommended the early erection of these buildings. The automatic exchange is the only por tion of the scheme which has so f a i been carried out. The balance of the work is more urgent to-day than it has been in the past. This great city, with a population of 300,000, is carrying on with practically the same facilities, as far as space is concerned, as existed when the population was only 50,000. The original General Post Office stands like a pigmy amongst giants. honourable member knows that I have already ruled that the matter of the Brisbane General Post Office is not referred to in the Estimates before the committee. no wish to transgress. I understood you to say, sir, that it was permissible to ask the Treasurer why the work had not been proceeded with, and to emphasize its urgency. orable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) has drawn attention to the fact that, over a period of years, the gentleman who is chairman of the Wheat Commission, has received by way of fees,, expenses and salary, no less a sum than £34,000. These Estimates make provision for an expenditure of £21,404 upon different royal commissions. It is time that this Parliament did the work which tbe people elected it, to do. Whenever the Government is faced with a political difficulty, it sets up a commission in order that that body may bear the brunt of any attack which may be made in connection with the matter. There are widespread protests against this delegation of powers and duties to royal commissions. Surely the Parliament should appoint a committee of its members to discharge this function.

The probability of that occurring was pointed out before the inquiry was commenced.

A great deal of unnecessary expenditure would thus be saved. Tlie honourable member for Swan( Mr ing of importance was elicited.

The best work done by a commission was that of the commission which conducted an inquiry into the taxation laws of the Commonwealth and the States, and peculiarly enough, it has been the cheapest to the Commonwealth. The Government should take more advantage of the services of members of Parliament. Many honourable members are not only willing, but also competent to make the inquiries winch are referred to royal commissions. Even if there were no additional remuneration, I am sure that, they would be pleased to undertake the task. It is their duty to devote thei ,% time to public purposes. I should like to be informed of the fate I am sure that they would not of the request which, on several occasions, has been made for the establishment of a post office at Maylands, Western Australia. protest against the useless expenditure of public money upon so-called royal decision was commissions, which draw large fees and, generally speaking,'do not furnish worthwhile information. If the Government needs advice, and considers that honourable members are not competent to obtain it, qualified members of the Public Service could procure it more quickly and efficiently than royal commissions. Before the Petrol Commission was appointed, the present Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir John Latham, who was then Commonwealth Attorney-General, introduced amending legislation designed to compel the oil companies to furnish information which was desired, but nothobtained. Much more effective results character that the public did not know what it meant. Counsel who investigated the affairs of the companies might have satisfied himself on certain subjects, but the actual results of his investigations were never disclosed to either the commission or the general public. I entirely disagree with the principle of placing such heavy responsibility on the shoulders of one individual. Information gathered in such circumstances should be made The Petrol Comavailable to the royal commission concerned, and to the public generally. It ia alarming that, since the consummation of Federation, an expenditure of more than £1,000,000 has been incurred on royal commissions of one kind and another. The Bruce-Page Government, and also this Government, have been particularly at fault in this regard.

The time is ripe for the re-appointment of the Public Accounts Committee and the Public Works Committee. Years ago these bodies performed invaluable service for the Commonwealth. It is impossible, as a general rule, for all the members of the Parliament to make specific inquiries into particular matters; but if they know that such inquiries are made by their own colleagues, they are more willing to accept the recommendations submitted . than would otherwise be the case. Instead of continuing the policy of appointing irresponsible royal commissions, the Government should call upon the services of members of the Parliament, who are directly responsible to the electors, for they could gather information on the various points at issue more satisfactorily and economically than cumbersome commissions. It is high time that honourable members royal commission, since ho was first engaged opposite protested against the expendiliy the Commonwealth in any capacity. ture of so much public money on royal commissions. The manner in whicli this policy has been pursued in recent years makes us wonder what is behind it all. Why should certain individuals draw thousands of pounds in fees annually, while so many of their fellows are obliged period the 9th August, 1920, to the 8th August, to subsist on the dole ? These supplementary estimates seek to validate the expenditure of more than £36,000 on royal commissions. One individual named Reynolds has been connected with royal commissions in one way and another since 1920, when he first became associated with the Driver case. It may be said that he has lived on briefs, for and against the Government, for the last sixteen years. The practice of the Government in guillotining the discussion of the Estimates year after year has prevented honourable members from effectively voicing their antagonism to a continuance of the policy of appointing royal commissions, which, generally speaking, perform no useful service whatever to the community. Of what use to the 1 notice that an amount of £15,473 is being provided to meet the expenses of the Wheat Commission. What a More of this kind "" rake-off"" Sir Herbert Gepp has been able to make by means of this commission and others, the reports of which have proved to be of very little use. It is time that Parliament took a hand to see that the interests of the general taxpayers are protected, for the Government itself appears to have little interest in the matter. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) interjected while the honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden) was speaking, to the effect that Sir Herbert Gepp's income of £34,000 odd from royal commissions had been spread over ten years. But information supplied only to-day to the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) by the Treasurer reveals a very different state of affairs. The honourable member asked the TreasurerWill he supply details of the amounts of (a) the fees, (b) the expenses, and (c) the salary, paid by the Commonwealth Government to Sir Herbert Gepp, either as adviser; consultant, or member of an inquiry, committee, or The reply received was as follows:(«) Fees .. . . £11.811 7 0 (6) ttxpcnsi's .. 2,807 18 2 («) Salarv 19,413 13 4 £34.092 19 0 The salary shown was paid during the",24,Supplementary Estimates 1934 35

What beneficial result has that expenditure had for the general taxpayer? The issue appears to have been forgotten already in Western Australia. At any rate, very little is heard of it. I have no doubt that the Banking Commission will also prove expensive and useless to the nation. Dnless the Government calls a halt in expenditure of this nature, there can be no doubt that intensely serious results will follow. Apparently the membership of these various commissions is determined by club membership. Parliament should not allow such a ramp to continue. The whole thing is politically indecent, if not worse. Why should membership of this, that, or the other club in Sydney or Melbourne entitle an individual to appointment to a royal commission? A select committee of members of this House should be appointed to inquire into the whole subject. racketeering and rampages should not be permitted to continue. Can the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) justify expenditure of this description ? am aware I have never attempted to do so. savours of the scandals which have occurred in Paris recently, and have actually wrecked governments. remember the Stavisky scandals, which revealed bribery and corruption in the very worse form. The people of Australia should not allow the present procedure to continue any longer.

While Sir Herbert Gepp is paid large sums of money, the poor unfortunate Australian aborigines, who are fast dying out, often are left to starve. This Government has recently in-, curred an expenditure of £12,000 in respect of ministerial visits overseas. Does it not owe sonlethins to the aborigines of this country? We nave heard a good deal in this Parliament recently about the raid of Italy on Abys*sinia, but that was no worse than the raids made in this country on the aborigines. Surely more than £484 could have been spent in research work in the interests of these unfortunate people. there was lavish expenditure in this regard. ber for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) seems to have constituted himself the apologist-in-chief for this Government. In his independent position he could do a good deal to ensure better Such political treatment of these people. We should be spending more than we are spending in scientific research, and a great deal less on royal commissions. Speaking from memory, our general research vote for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research amounts to about £92,000 a as I year; yet a proposal is on foot that the taxpayers should be called upon to provide £100,000 to assist the wool industry. whole thing This also appears to me to be a political ramp. We should voice a protest against it. Indeed, it is time that a select committee of this House was appointed to inquire into the cost of commissions set up by this Government over the last few years. I am sure that if this were done many matters that this Government would not be capable of justifying would bo brought out. Yesterday, certain references were made to the people who are seeking gold in the Northern Territory. An item of £31,605 for expenditure on the territories of the Commonwealth appears in these Estimates. What do people in the Northern Territory get out of that amount?

110,Mr Riordan,"The honourable membe forced back on tbe do^ in the cities? These are questions which the Treasurer or some responsible Minister should answer. Yesterday the Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson) said that inquiries' would be made into the position at Tennant's Creek, and he also said that some reduction of ore treatment charges might be made. The crushing charges at the State-owned and co-operatively worked crushing plant at Kidston in northern Queensland are about 5s. 6d. a ton, whereas the cost of crushing and carting at the privately-owned batteries at Tennant's Creek is £4 10s. a ton. This comparison shows the benefit that accrues to miners when they do their own crushing. The same comparison between the charges made by private enterprise and those of Government enterprise can be extended to other commodities. For instance, as the result of the establishment by the Queensland Government of a shed at Mareeba for tlie treatment of tobacco leaf, the growers were able to reduce the cost of selling by more than £6 a ton or by about 50 per cent. Success or failure of industry very often hinges on the charges levied for the treatment of the raw material. The exorbitant nature of the crushing fees demanded by the owners of the private batteries at Tennant's Creek, is further shown by the fact that at the privately-owned battery at Batavia, in Cape York Peninsula, where tbe cost of commodities is greater than it is at Tennant's Creek, and where the stone is much more difficult to treat and miue than it is at Tennant's Creek, the charge for crushing is only £2 5s. a ton. orable member, when discussing this preliminary motion, is not entitled to discuss the matter to which he is now referring. There is nothing in the3e Supplementary Estimates relating to the mines at Tennant's Creek. tary Estimates include an item of £31,605 for the Territories of the Commonwealth. I want to know whether that item included expenditure for the treatment of ore at Tennant's Creek. This is a very burning question. Infact, public meetings of protest at the Government's inaction have been held, and, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mi'. Blain) and I pointed out yesterday, there is a threatened invasion of Canberra by a delegation from Tennant's Creek, led by men on camels. I do not know whether the camel corps is to be led by the manager of the privately-owned battery, Aga Khan, in order to enter his protest against government batteries. People want to know where this money is going, and also another £400 which has been set aside for scientific research on behalf of the aborigines. To put it bluntly, I should, like a definite statement from the Treasurer, the man who controls the purse, whether the Government proposes to take any action to relieve the position of the mining industry at Tennant's Creek by the establishment of battery facilities to treat more than half a million tons of over 10 dwt. ore. If the Government proposes to take no action, the people will know what to do, that is, to walk off the field, and then the Government will have accomplished its purpose of handing over the claims of the Tennant's Creek miners to the miners of Pitt-street, Sydney, and Queen and Little Collins streets, Melbourne. join with other honourable members in condemning the practice of all governments of the Commonwealth to indulge in the appointment of royal commissions. An issue is raised before the people and the people desire a settlement of that, issue by this House; but in order to avoid or postpone a settlement of that issue the Government of the day appoints a royal commission. The.matter is then investigated and is ultimately lost sight of. With the possible exception of the Royal Commission on Taxation, that is invariably what happens. What has been done with the reports of the Constitution Commission, the Family Endowment Commission, and the Petrol Commission ? And what will be done with the report of the Banking and Monetary Commission when it eventually arrives? This method of postponing the settlement of important issues cannot long continue. It is very expensive. Worse thaii expensive, it is a method of postponing altogether action in regard to the matters investigated. It is the policy of a man",26,Supplementary Estimates 1934 35

For instance, if he were engaged on long private work he would expect the same daily fee. Mr Reynolds is a junior barrister of very good standing in Victoria. My acquaintance with him began about 22 years ago when he unsuccessfully opposed mc at an election. I do not think that it is fair to allow these things to be said without some check upon them. I think that the money spent on the representation of the Commonwealth in the Western Australian secession case was largely wasted and the Commonwealth made a grave mistake in attempting to burke the issue as it did. It should have waived the preliminary objection to the hearing of the petition to the British Parliament and allowed the case to be dealt with on its merits. By taking up the stand that the matter should not be inquired into and that it was a matter entirely for Australia and for settlement by the Commonwealth Parliament, it created a very bad impression, not only in Britain, but also all over the world. It is regrettable that so much money was spent to get an inconclusive settlement. [4.49] -The revelation contained in the answer to a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) is bers on this side of the House should not allow to pass in silence. I must profess my profound astonishment at the action of Cabinet in agreeing to what I believe to be an absolutely unwarrantable expenditure. Some time ago I had the benefit, entirely at my own expense, of doing a fair bit of work in connection with the Wheat Commission. There, again, absolute superfluity of human beings who were touring Australia to get the essential facts regarding the Australian wheat industry. A qualified barrister was appearing to assist the commission-h e was a member of the Commonwealth Public Service and was a very capable gentleman-bu t I was never able to discover why it was necessary to have this gentleman asking all the questions which the commissioners could have asked themselves: I was never able to discover what work was done by him other than to ask witnesses tbeir views on different things; because, even after he finished, members of the commission usually fully availed themselves of the right to ask additional qiiestions. In connection with the Banking Commission, all honourable members must accept some responsibility for the expense of that commission. We cannot allow the Opposition to take the attitude that, as soon as anything unwelcome comes to light, as it has this afternoon, they can get away under a smoke screen by raising Cain about the expense of royal commissions generally. Immediately after tlie last election there was a great deal of activity on tbe part, of honourable gentlemen of the Opposition to secure the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into banking. But now it has been appointed, we have the astounding information given this afternoon. I candidly say that if a lawyer considers that he is worth five guineas a day travelling allowance for every day he is away from Melbourne, his ideas of the cost of living are altogether too expensive, for the people of Australia.

I simply support the honourable member's remarks as to Mr Reynold's high standing, and point out that the fees paid to him are such as would be considered reasonable if paid to a barrister of his standing engaged on a case in private practice. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) expressed the view that a travelling allowance of five guineas a day under the circumstances is unreasonable; but, in fixing that fee, allowance is made for the fact that the barrister is not available for work in connection with his private practice while absent from Melboiirne. member must not continue to discuss the position of a barrister assisting the commission that is now engaged in its inquiries. [4.55] I should have no complaint regarding the cost of the Royal Commission on the Wlieat Industryi f the recommendations submitted by it had been properly acted upon. I do not claim to possess the inside knowledge of commissions that members who have spoken claim to possess, but immediately I this report and recommendiations, I saw the hand of the mathematician behind it. The simple but telling graphs published throughout the report gave it the stamp of a scientifically prepared document. It was clearly demonstrated by graphs how futile is the policy of permitting farmers to attempt to produce wheat on land suitable only for sheep raising. It was shown that wheat is being grown at a cost, in many cases, up to 4s. 6d. a bushel, and, in some instances, even up to 18s. 6d. a bushel. Surely, farmers trying to grow wheat on land beyond Goyder's line of rainfall should be transferred to more suitable localities. If the commission's report had cost even £60,000, and suitable action had been taken upon its recommendations, it would not have been too costly. Subsequently, when the chairman of the commission, Sir Herbert Gepp, visited Tennant's Creek goldfield, I was disappointed over the small amount of information which he furnished regarding it, considering the fact that he has had a long experience of mining operations; all Sir Herbert Gepp could suggest was uneconomic haulage of ore to central batteries, but that would not solve the problem there. of mining matters at Tennant's Creek is irrelevant. to a scientific investigation carried out in Arnheim Land, and I have been wondering whether the expenditure mentioned covers the cost of the scientific work which I did in the area as a surveyor. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) has declared that the expenditure incurred in the investigation made by Sir Herbert Gepp at Tennant's Creek is far too great, considering the services rendered, and I agree with him. Until recently, I was probably the only person who has endeavoured to render service to the settlers in that remote area. I realize now that I have a competitor, and I much appreciate the help being given to me in this matter by other honourable the honourable member for Kennedy. I have been unswerving in my support read of the claims of ^the men at Tennant's Creek, and in my maiden speech I mentioned the names of some of those prospectors who, following the track which Allan Davidson blazed in 1900, discovered the Tennant's Creek gold-field. These men deserve the full reward of their efforts. We all know how the small man has been squeezed out in New Guinea. I feel that I have convinced the Minister for the Interior of the justice of my case, and that he, in turn, will convinee the Government that it should provide the necessary facilities at Tennant's Creek, by providing a government battery.

The item of £1,122 covers the expenses of Sir Maurice Hankey, Sir Alexander Godley, Mr Masefield, and Mr Malcolm MacDonald, who visited Australia at that -time as the guests of the Commonwealth. With regard to the Commonwealth's -contribution to the cost of a memorial -to Albert Thomas, the position is that, -since the Estimates were framed, a variation in the exchange rate between the Australian £1 and the Swiss franc has made it necessary to add an extra £1 to the £65 which represents the Commonwealth's contribution. Mention was also made of the payment of a sum of £34 to the widow of an officer of the Patents Department. This officer, who had been compulsorily transferred to Canberra, died within twelve months of his arrival here, and it was agreed to make his widow an ex gratia payment of £34, to enable her to remove her furniture and effects to Brisbane, her home town. Payments of this kind are scrutinized very carefully, and all applications come before me personally, before being granted. ment. ber inquired regarding the remission of duty on material for naval construction. This was in regard to material imported for the construction of two sloops at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) and the honourable member for Lilley( Sir Donald Cameron) mentioned the need for a new post office building at Brisbane, and asked why provision had not been made for this work in the Supplementary Estimates now before us. In the time available I have the Government wants specific informanot been able to obtain an answer to their question which they would regard as satisfactory. Tlie chief officer of the department is not available on the telephone, but I assure the honourable members that the matter will be gone into, and I shall communicate with them later. The scientific investigation work in Arnheim Land mentioned .by the honourable member for Lilley is in connection with the sojourn in that area of Dr. Donald Thompson. The amount shown in the Supplementary Estimates does not represent Dr. Thompson's full remuneration, but will be added to the amount of £750 shown on the Estimates proper. The total amount will represent Dr. Thompson's very moderate personal expenses, plus the cost .of equipping and maintaining himself in Arnheim Land. I am sure that all honourable members regard Dr. Thompson's work with favour. The honourable member for West Sydney drew attention to the item of £78S representing the expenses of a delegation from New Zealand to Australia. When my predecessor in office, Senator Sir Walter Massy-Greene, visited New Zealand on Government business, his expenses were met by the Government of New Zealand, from the,time he arrived in that country until he left. The Commonwealth Government paid the same courtesy to the delegation from New Zealand, which visited Australia on similar business during the last financial year. include Mr Forbes and his party, who were returning to New Zealand from Great Britain? Australia at the specific invitation of the Government. Several honourable members have spoken of the co3t of royal commissions. I do not defend any excessive expenditure under this heading, but I feel impelled to reply to the suggestion that royal commissions are altogether unnecessary, and that the work they perform could be performed by members of this Parliament, or by public servants. Any one who has been closely associated with public servants, particularly those in senior positions, knows that every minute of their time is taken up. When tion on such subjects as banking, taxation, &c, it mu3t go to sources outside the Public Service, if for no other reason than that such, public servants as might reasonably be able to do the work, cannot devote the time to it. In the Treasury, at any rate, the senior officers are occupied every minute of every working day with their own duties, and some of them devote their week-ends",30,Supplementary Estimates 1934 35

To that their expenses have been very heavy; but I still think that governments, no matter what their political complexion appointment of departmental officers, may be, will have to rely on people outside Parliament to obtain information upon of their chiefs. It is best, therefore, that certain subjects. In some countries, notably in France, Germany and Great Britain, permanent bodies, such as quire into important matters.

145,Mr Gregory (Swan) [5.15],"Iessential for its purpose. In many cases the cost of inquiries has far exceeded, not only the estimated cost, but also the worth of the reports presented. I suggest that the Joint Committee on Public Accounts, not necessarily constituted on the old basis, but consisting of a smaller number of members, should be reappointed for the purpose of conducting examinations, in regard to expenditure, and reporting direct to Parliament. The reports of such a body would certainly compel the Treasury to be more careful in regard to applications for the provision of funds suoh as have been made by royal r commissions in the past. The past reports of that committee have proved of value to this Parliament. As formerly constituted, the committee consisted of ten members. I regard that number as too many; 1 think three members of the House of Representatives and two Senators would form a suitable committee. Provision appears in these Supplementary Estimates for the Royal Commission on the Petrol Industry. The appointment of some members of that inquiry did not meet with the general approval of the community. There was criticism at the time that certain persons were always appointed to positions of this sort. Public Tevelations at any rate showed that at least one member of the commission should not have been chosen. It was anticipated that an opportunity would be given to honourable members to discuss the report of the Petrol Commission, but so far no effort has been made by the Government to provide it -South Wales. It is said that since the Another item included in the Supplementary Estimates is in connection with the petition of the Western Australian people to the British Parliament in regard to secession. A sum of £16,000 has been expended by the Commonwealth Government in controverting the case established by the Western Australian people. I do not know how this enormous expenditure was incurred, but I do know that the Case for Union was prepared in Canberra and consisted mostly of matter prepared by the manufacturers of Australia. At any rate I have seen the same arguments advanced in the Manufacturers' Journal. Tens of thousands of copies of the Case for Union were posted to persons throughout Australia. Possibly this may account Mr Gregory. for the huge expenditure involved. I commend to honourable members and to the Government the advice given by one of the Labour leaders, Mr Eorgan Smith, as published in the Scotsman. If it had been followed in the past we should never have heard a single complaint from Western Australia, and there would have been no need to incur this expenditure; the people of Western Australia would have been found to be as loyal to the Commonwealth as they were to the Old Country in its time of trial. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) evidently has received wrong information from his departmental officers regarding Mr Reynolds. Does not the honourable gentleman recollect that Mr Reynolds appeared for the War Service Homes Commission in the case Driver v. The War Service Homes Commissioner which was before the courts for four years, and that Driver subsequently got a verdict for £144,000? It appears to me that the departmental officers are endeavouring to put it over the Treasurer. I have' had several inquiries relating to the administration of bankrupt estates in New South Wales, which it is stated was for about 70 years undertaken by official receivers at no cost to the country or the taxpayers. Over twelve months ago, despite much opposition, particularly from Sydney itself, the Commonwealth took over the task, and a new office was created to administer estates in New office was created salaries have amounted to over £4,000, in addition to expenditure incurred in connection with office rent and sundries. No doubt there are reasons for the change. Could the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) state what fees have been received during the last twelve months, or for the period up to the 30th June last year, and what, advantages have been gained by the creation of the new office?

Consequently, the Government has decided to make available to the States an annual amount of £100,000 for a period of ten years, beginning with the present year-1933-3(5-for the purpose of subsidizing interest and sinking funds on certain of the loans for public works purposes raised by local public authorities. The terms "" public authorities"" aud "" public works "" are liberally interpreted in tbe bill. The definition of ""public works"" is designed to include water and sewerage works, gas or electricity enter.prises, public hosjritals, and institutions for maternal or infant welfare. The other principal provisions are as follows:1. That the State governments shall select the loan works which are to benefit by the Commonwealth subsidy towards interest and sinking fund. 2. That the State governments will make contributions towards interest and sinking fund on these works to at least the same amount as the Commonwealth grant, or, alternatively, by a capital amount conveying the same relative degree of relief. '3. That the States need not pay out tbe amounts received by way of Commonwealth grant in the year of receipt; that is, they can pay such Commonwealth grants year by yeaT into trust funds, and draw on such trust funds to meet the increasing annual subsidies as new local works worthy of such assistance are approved and started. 4.

Normally"", local governing bodies outside the capital cities .cannot offer as good security, and so cannot borrow on such good terms, as the great metropolitan local governing Atr. Casi'-y. bodies. The provisions of the bill will put selected local governing bodies 011 a considerably improved basis. It will be possible for public works, such as water and sewerage, gas, electricity, public hospitals, &c, which could not otherwise be put in hand for years ahead, to be undertaken in the near ^future. The bill will consequently make possible an appreciable degree of decentralization of public works expenditure, which hitherto has been largely concentrated in or about the capital cities. Loans raised by local public bodies under the benefits of the bill will provide an attractive field of investment, with adequate provision for meeting the service of the debt for many years. Indeed, in a great number of cases, the whole of the life 6f the loans will be covered.

If that is so, why should the Treasurer ( Mr the Commonwealth Government to put Casey) be seeking authority to appropriate £10,000,000 ? We have been led to believe that the expenditure on war pensions had passed its peak, and that the amount required would be reduced year by year in. consequence of the deaths of soldier pensioners. wish to know whether this procedure has been questioned by the Auditor-General? Reference is made in the Auditor General's report to the amount of money placed in trust funds from time to time, and it has been alleged that this practice prevents the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) from indicating the exact expenditure of the Government in any financial year. If this is so, it seems to me that Parliament is being misled. This bill, as I understand the position, seeks to continue a practice initiated in the first decade of federation, when the proposal to pay federal invalid and old age pensions was first adopted. It was' contended for a long while by the State Governments that the Commonwealth Government was under consitutional obligation to pay to the States all its surplus or unexpended revenue. For this reason the people were told that it would be impracticable to provide for Commonwealth invalid and old-age pensions. The High Court, however, decided in the case New South Wales versus the Commonwealth, that the Commonwealth Government could appropriate money for trust funds for any purpose in respect of whicli it had power to legislate. result of that decision was the establishment of a pensions trust fund from which Commonwealth pensions have ever since been paid. In other words, this is the method that was adopted to override the contention of the States that. the Commonwealth was under an obligation to Is this an indication that refund to them all its surplus revenue. I think the honourable member for Darling Downs( Sir Littleton Groom) will agree with this view. Downs) [5.59] -That is so. Honourable members who have followed the history of the Commonwealth closely are aware that in the early days of federation, strong pressure was brought to bear on into force a commonwealth-wide system of invalid and old-age pensions at the earliest possible date. The only way in which that could be done under the Constitution at the time was for this Parliament to appropriate moneys to a trust fund. The whole subject came before the High Court. I had the honour to argue the case on behalf of the Commonwealth. The Court held that this practice was valid and in accordance with the Constitution. It was, in fact, the only means that could be discovered by the officers of the Crown Law Department to introduce the invalid and old-age pension system so early in the history of federation. I believe that the procedure now being followed is proper and constitutionally sound. Notwithstanding the statements in the Auditor-General's report, the Treasurer always shows definitely and clearly in his budget the figures for each financial year. I can see nothing whatever in this practice which in any way impairs Parliamentary control of the public purse. This is not the only trust fund that the Treasury operates; there is a very great number of them, and with regard to many of them. I have nothing to say. With regard to the trust funds, such as this one, and the one related to the invalid and old-age pensions, which are regularly coming before Parliament for replenishment, the suggestion I make to the department is that it should treat so much as a necessary reserve in the trust fund, say, The £5,000,000, and then, at the end of the year, ask for a specific appropriation by Parliament for the amount of the actual expenditure. For example, if this had been the procedure in respeot of the war pensions trust fund last year, this year,",36,Second Reading

173,Mr Curtin (Fremantle) [6.0],"perhaps, the fund would have a balance of £5,000,000. This would not be sufficient to meet the expenditure on war pensions in the current year, but, if in the to them in proportion to their contribuprevious year £8,000,000 had been expended, I submit that it would be proper for the department to ask Parliament to appropriate £8,000,000 to meet the requirements for the following year. Then, if the expenditure exceeded the appropriation the reserve in the trust fund would enable all obligations to be met. there would be some limit on the amount of money this Parliament wo.uld appropriate from revenue for trust account purposes. If it had not been for the existence of trust accounts the Commonwealth Treasury would have experienced all sorts of difficulties. Furthermore, the States must realize that without trust accounts the Commonwealth Parliament itself would have been in great difficulty in framing a policy over a period of years in which expenditure was inescapable. The long term defence policy is a case in point. In any long-range plan if Parliament voted a sum of money in one year it would be wasted if some similar or larger sum were not to be expended in the next year or in the third or fourth years. Therefore, the trust accounts enabling a long-term policy under the eyeiof Parliament to be definitely envisaged are necessary. If the trust account device were not available, Parliament would be unable to budget for the expenditure of moneys except for each specific year, whereas most of the activities of this Parliament involve long-range policies. is unemployment for example. Although the greater part of the expenditure for alleviation of the unemployment situation comes from loan funds, there should be some realization on the part of this Parliament that, in embarking on a programme designed to assist in the solution of the problem, it is not only incurring obligations for the current year, but it must also have in prospect expenditure in succeeding years. The action necessary to make provision for future expenditure is one of the things Parliament must keep in mind, and I do not object to the allocation of surplus funds for that purpose. In the early days of the Commonwealth it was assumed that the States would have the whole of the surplus moneys credited tions to the revenue. vided for that. Treasurers themselves have had to resort, to trust funds in order to stabilize the relationship between the Treasury and the Government policy as a whole. It is, In that way therefore, no exceptional provision on the part of the Commonwealth to institute trust funds. I frankly confess that I will object to an undue growth of Commonwealth trust funds, and I do think there should be some limit to the amount which is to be. retained in each specific trust account. The suggestion I have already made should approximately meet the point. I have in mind, particularly, the invalid and old-age pensions, and the war pensions trust accounts; but, as the Auditor-General's report indicates, there are other trust accounts of great variety. WhatI want the country to know is thnt, as far as my study of that report enables me to form an opinion, and having regard to the obligations cast on Parliament, the greater part of the Auditor-General's criticism of Parliament and of trust funds is entirely unjustified. the States to the Commonwealth there is an impression among those who stand for what I shall call "" the pre-war relationship of the Commonwealth and the States "", that the trust funds of the Commonwealth have been used in order to There defraud the States of the right which they should have to share any surplus funds which the Commonwealth may possess. did share for some years. tice, until 1907 and, in theory, until 1910. given by the High Court had an important bearing on that aspect of the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States. decided that, if the Commonwealth appropriated from Consolidated Revenue money for expenditure in future years,",37,Second Reading

In the investigamoney, because it is placed into trust tion of the Western Australian case before, the Commonwealth Grants Commission, some considerable time was taken up in air examination of this phase, and the Commonwealth Treasury ""was asked to justify its use of trust funds. Broadly speaking, there is no other way in which this Parliament could provide for social services on any extensive scale, and even on a limited scale, than by this method of trust funds. As one w'ho conceives increasing obligations on this Parliament in respect of social services, largely because the States are incapable of competently providing for them, and, furthermore, because they cannot provide for them without some of the States feeling tlie burden much more heavily .than others, thereby accentuating existing inequalities between the States, I foresee that, in order to meet the increased pressure, there will have to be an increasing use of trust funds. There is support on the Government side for a scheme of social insurance. Without an extension of the powers of this Commonwealth, I doubt whether we could provide social insurance in respect of industry. We certainly could not provide it without the creation of a trust fund. The fact that this Parliament has had the system of trust funds in operation for many years may not be taken as complete justification for the course we are pursuing, but it must be clear to those who have inherited the procedure of the last 20 years-3 0 years in respect of the invalid and old-age pensions-that the practice was not instituted -without justi30th June. Until the money now in the fication, and has not been continued without equal justification. like the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) to explain if this appropriation will be taken into consideration in the balance-sheet for the current year, and whether it will affect the surplus. Is it likely that this appropriation will wipe out the surplus altogether? [6.10] -Following the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), the question of trust funds is a recurring one in the public mind, apparently; but as the result of the Auditor-General's last report, there seems to be a feeling that' funds, so far as this Parliament is concerned, is never seen again. That is a. mistake. All feedings-into and drawingsfrom trust funds are set out iu the financial papers made available to this House ancl to the public from time to time. All details of receipts and expenditure in relation to trust funds are given in the budget in the same way as are all details of any other appropriation for expenditure from revenue or from loan funds. Anybody can see them; there is no attempt to hide the facts. Moreover, if some honourable members are not sufficiently familiar with the financial papers to examine them and find out the facts for themselves, they can always elicit by a question on the notice-paper information in relation to any or all of the trust accounts. Thus, in no way is this trust fund derogatory from the obligation on the Government to bring forward in the budget its financial proposals for dealing with war pensions. The budget papers will contain in full detail the expenditure from all trust funds. In reply to the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Nock), the answer is "" No "". Only so much as is actually paid out in war pension? will be taken into account in this year's expenditure. This is a formal appropriation, and it will have no effect whatever on the surplus which, it is generally anticipated, we shall have on the 30th June next. The money already in the trust account will last until a month or even six weeks beyond the trust fund is expended, no advantage will be taken of this appropriation. Mr E. J.

As the Leader of the Opposition has said, it appears to be a popular misconception in many quarters that if the Government had the w ill it could milk off a great deal of money which is not required in these trust funds. An amount of £8,000,000 has been stated to be the sum, which, if we were honest, we would repay into general revenues from trust accounts. It is impossible, to do so. The trust funds are there, and, unti l a trust fund is finally decided to have no services to perform, we cannot transfer any surplus that may remain in it to the Consolidated Revenue. Nevertheless, from time to time as trustfunds go out of existence the Consolidated Revenue does benefit from such transfers of moneys. This should effectively dispose of statements that £8,000,000 or even £1,000,000 or anything like £1,000,000 could be milked by legal process from trust funds and given other application.

Debate resumed (vide page 1622) on Tliat the bill bp now read a second time. This bill arises out of a discussion between representatives of the Commonwealth and the States in regard, to the difficulties associated with the promotion of public works under the control of local authorities, in view of the fact that the rating powers of those authorities are limited by statute, and that they are naturally restricted by the economic situation, in that, beyond a given point, it is impossible for them effectively to carry any increase of obligations following upon an increase of capital expenditure. 'The result has been that works which f a l l within the compass of local authorities have not been proceeded with, because these bodies cannot bear the debt charges. The bill is designed to make a Commonwealth contribution towards the interest and sinking funds obligations of the local authorities which raise loans for public works that have to be approved by the Government of the Statei n which the local authorities exist, with the proviso that the State government has to give an equal contribution to that which the Commonwealth Government makes.

I should be astonished if the money market did not take cognisance of the additional security inherent in this proposal. measure. I assume, w ill be to widen the ambit of public borrowing outside the limits set by the Financial Agreement. Theoretically, perhaps, that assertion could be disproved, but, in jjractice, it is a reasonable statement of the facts. The Financial Agreement Act compels make certain financial provision in regard to sinking funds, &c., and further authorizes the Loan Council to ration out the amount of money which, it is assumed, the market w ill provide. This, no doubt, has had the effect of making it difficult for local authorities to raise money, or of causing the money which a State would pass on to a local authority to be deducted from the amount which it would directly expend itself on pnblic works. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) said that this difficulty was being met by the procedure which had been adopted, and that it was hoped the trouble which had previously been experienced would be overcome. I find no fault with the definition in the bill of ""public a u t h o r it y "". It embraces any 'authority constituted by or under the laws of a State; but I think that in the definition of "" p u b l i c w o r k "" Government guarantees interest on thethere is undue restriction. The definition in the bill is as follows:"" Public work "" includes any gas, electricity, capital works costing about water supply, or sewerage undertaking, or the erection of any public hospital or of any public institution for maternal or infant welfare, where the work is constructed, controlled or maintained by a public authority. I question the wisdom of making any definition beyond referring to public works as approved by the State governments. There is a large number of districts in Australia which naturally cannot provide gas or electricity supplies, and it is doubtful whether they will be involved in hospital construction.

During the last three years, the loan expenditure of the States on public works has been very considerable. it amounted to nearly £18,000,000 while the estimate for this year is £25,600,000. In 1933-34 the amount expended was £14,600,000. internal economic recovery as has taken place in Australia is due' very largely to this increased expenditure by State Governments on public works, in that it has improved the. purchasing power of the poorer sections of the community, those who are dependent upon their earnings as labourers. The wages which those labourers have brought home have been expended almost to the last shilling on the purchase of consumable goods. The loan expenditure of the States, which was only a little over £14,000,000 two years ago, will this year be over £25,000,000, and this increasing expendiworks which were regarded as most urgent. ture has affected in a marked degree the economic condition of the country. Now there is a tendency to prune State Government expenditure on public works. Recent manceuvrings by the Commonwealth Bank Board and the private banks suggest that there is a wide-spread conviction in financial circles that there should be a reduction of this class of expenditure. any reversal of the public works policy whicli has been pursued during the last, few years is bound to have most serious reactions upon employment, and even factory employment. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade and Customs havetold us about the improvement whicli has taken place in the volume of factory employment, due, they say, to tariff reductions. As a matter of fact, the improvement bears no relation whatplace in spite of ' them, and not because of their effect. Employment has improved . because the increased I agree that it is right loan expenditure of State Governments has stimulated the purchasing power of the Australian people. That purchasing power, employed in the purchase of the products of Australian factories, has in turn, stimulated trade and created employment. I urge honourable members not to countenance any action which will have the result of reversing this beneficial policy. More than 14 per cent, of the Australian people are still out of work, and private enterprise cannot provide Last year employment for all of them. It will remain necessary to devise government employment of an economic character in order to take up the slack, and the devisI n my Opinion, such ing of such undertakings should be regarded as a proper and necessary requirement of statesmanship. The Government should consider plans for the creation of a national employment council representative of the Commonwealth Government, the State governments, and local authorities, who are large employers of labour. Through this council the efforts of these various employing agencies should be co-ordinated, so that they might not be competitors in the same field either for labour or for money. Under a system of proper co-ordination the available money would be apportioned to those A State government, for instance, might, desire that work of a particular kind should be undertaken when, as a matter of fact, some other work under the control of a municipality might be of greater national importance. If a council of the kind I have mentioned were in existence it might be possible to bring to bear inI utter a warning that fluence which would ensure that a proper selection of public works was made. We should remember that local authorities. State governments, and the Commonwealth Government are all agencies used by the people of Australia to carry out their will, and to the extent that it is possible to correlate the efforts of those various bodies, we should be more effectively serving the people. The bill contains no provision for the protection of wage standards in regard to the works for which assistance is to be granted. We have been informed that in the allocation of this money, preference is to be given to works in country districts. My experience has been that, in country districts, it is notorious that the personnel of local authorities entertains an unreasoning hostility to industrial regulations. They are prone to carrying out of works by contract, and there is frequently introduced a vicious system of sub-contracting, with the result that the wage standard customary to the district is not observed. ranted attack on local governments. have said is true of many country districts.

My only objection to the bill is that it is too narrow in its application. The Government no doubt intends that only reproductive schemes shall bs brought under the measure, but I have in mind certain works which, while they will not come within the definition laid down by the Government, would still be reproductive, and of great value to the community. I am thinking particularly of municipal improvement schemes, such as shark-proof enclosures and other beach works at places like Coogee aud Maroubra, and the construction of scenic T h a t is an unwarmarine drives which w ill pass through and adjoin Crown lands. Works of It is not. WhatI that kind would be reprodtictive, because they would improve the value of p r i vate lands, and would open up new suburban areas for settlement. I do not wish to appear parochial, aud am not The successful tenderer lets advocating that expenditure should be confined to the Sydney area. I know tliat in other parts of Australia, in places like Cottesloe, Glenelg, St. Kildn and Southport, foreshore improvement work could be carried out with advantage to the community generally, and would provide extended employment. I ask the Treasurer to take these facts into consideration, in order that these reproductive schemes might be put into operation under the terms of this bill. If no such evil exists introducing this bill, the Treasurer ( Mr. Casey) made great play on the fact that the moneys provided would be a substantial contribution towards the solution of the unemployment problem. In New South Wales at the present time, it is true that a good deal of relief work is being provided by municipal and shire councils, which are subsidized for the wages paid to the men, but only in respect of a small portion of the materials used. Before we can make any estimate of the I effect which this legislation will have on the possibilities of municipal councils accepting a greater share of responsibility for dealing with the unemployment proUnder the blem, we should first consider their capacity to undertake any further loan works. For instance, in 1932-33, the latest figures shown in the Commonwealth Year-Book, the total debt of South Wales will be able to municipal and shire councils in Australia amounted to £68,662,000, and in the",41,States Grants Local Public Works Bill 1936 Second Reading

In the boom period, up to 1929, when they raised loans for carrying on ordinary municipal services, the councils had to pay exorbitant rates of interest. Unlike State and Commonwealth governments, municipal and shire councils, particularly in New South Wales, have no power to convert existing loans into loans bearing a lower rate of interest, and they have to continue to meet the burden of high interest payments until the loans are repaid. Most of the loans bore interest rates of from 5 to 6 per cent. Examining the position from an Australian point of view, and on the assumption that the average rate of in terest on the municipal debt is 5 per cent., the municipal councils of Australia, besides financing their ordinary services, have to meet an annual interest bill of £3,400,000. interest bill alone, without considering provision for sinking fund for the retirement of the loans, computed at 5 per cent., wouUl amount to £1,750,000. Before we consider how the provision of the £100.000 over a period of ten years w ill affect loan money for new works, we must consider the capacity of the municipal and shire councils to continue their present services and, at the same time, meet interest charges on the total debt of £68,000,000 already contracted. out interest, they would not mind. whether they can get it without interest, but whether they have any further borrowing capacity. If the honourable member will read the bill, he will find that the works must be of a new character, that the assistance to be'granted is for the raising of new loans for the purpose of carrying out those works, with the f u r ther qualification that the municipal councils must first of all obtain the consent of the State Government before loans can be raised under this scheme. The honourable member knows that the Local Government Act of New South Wales provides-and this is another point which the Treasurer might consider-that no municipal council shall raise a loan over a certain amount without taking a plebisFurthermore, we must cite of the ratepayers if it is demanded. Power to raise loan money to create employment does not remain, as the Treasurer seems lightly to indicate, with the State governments or the municipal councils, because, after all, even if they are animated by the best of intentions, and are warranted in incurring the liability, every municipality in New South Wales is at the mercy of a handful of ratepayers, who can demand a plebiscite. Mr An OH IE CAMERON -I s tliere anything wrong with that? the rights or wrongs of that, but I point out the difficulty that will be experienced in raising loans. The Treasurer has said that the moneys to be provided under this bill w ill be a substantial contribution towards the solution of-the unemployment problem in New South Wales, and that the provision of this money would open In New South Wales the up new avenues of employment; but I point out to the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) that, whether we desire it or not, whether the State Government or local municipal councils desire it or not, in the last analysis, the decision as to whether the money shall be borrowed lies in the hands of a handful of ratepayers, who can delay and possibly deflect anv proposal to adopt this scheme. of the majority of ratepayers. If they could get it within South Australia, but it is certainly not so in New South Wales. A fte r overcoming the barrier of debt that may prevent the councils from participating in the distribution of the moneys provided under this bill , if a council is in a financial position sound enough to warrant the contraction of further debt in order to take advantage of the scheme proposed in this bill, it will be necessary to overcome the further barrier set up by the provision, which I have mentioned, in the Local Government Act in New South Wales. problem is that New South Wales generally is deeper in debt than any other State. not about the amount of debt in New",43,States Grants Local Public Works Bill 1936 Second Reading

223,Mr Rosevear,"There is onecentres. In the metropolitan area, the expenditure of the municipality is very much greater and the rates levied are higher than in country districts. If this the proposed apportionment of the grant measure is designed to provide work for the relief of unemployment, any preference should he enjoyed by those centres in of the whole continent, and, unfortuwhich there is the greatest aggregation of unemployed. Unquestionably, these are to be found in the metropolitan areas and the larger towns of every State. I support the contention of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) that, as far as we can reasonably do so, we should make sure that any shire or municipal council which undertakes works under this scheme is compelled to insert in all contracts a provision that the award wages and conditions prevailing in the district must be observed. From time to time, when making grants to the States for the purpose of providing work for the unemployed, this Government has stated that it would not interfere in this direcWestern Australia. tion; but it has always expressed the pious hope that the States would see that award wages and conditions were observed. That policy has been adopted by the Commonwealth in connection with its own relief works at Mascot and elsewhore. The municipalities, themselves might not feel inclined to break the law, but contractors and sub-contractors would certainly take advantage of every loophole offered to them. When the Leader of the Opposition said that there had been breaohes of award wages and conditions on relief works in certain country districts, the honourable member for had not occurred in Victoria, and the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) made a similar statement in regard to Western Australia. It would seem that breaches are not committed in any State; yet, strangely enough, the experience of men who depend for an existence upon relief works, is that they occur everywhere. Many sub-contractors abscond without paying any wages. We wish to guard against such contingencies. Since so much indignation has been expressed by Government members at the accusation of the Leader of the Opposition, and they emphatically affirm that these conditions do not prevail in their States, they should not be opposed to an amendment which will make the position secure. thank the Government for having introduced this bill, although I consider that is hardly fair. The area of Western Australia is, roughly, one-third of the area nately, it is the least plentifully endowed of the States with natural resources, such as rivers and lakes. A strong effort is being made in that State to establish towns and villages, but considerable difficulty is experienced because of the lack of an adequate water supply. Extensive use is being made of the goldfields water scheme, one of the big undertakings of the world, but it cannot penetrate to every part of the State. I appeal to the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) to see if it is not possible to make an apportionment that will be commensurate with the conditions, taking into consideration the natural disadvantages and the tremendous area of Other grants are made on an area-population basis, but this is to be made entirely on a population basis. party basis. indicative of considerable ignorance. I am confident that due consideration would cause the Treasurer to feel that what is suggested is reasonable. 2 of the bill does not make provision for certain public works .for which I consider that provision should be made. It reads"" Public work "" includes any gas, electricity, water supply, or sewerage undertaking, or tbe erection of any public hospital or of any public institution for maternal or infant welfare, where the work is constructed, controlled or maintained by a public authority. I should like to be informed as to whether swimming baths, parks and sports grounds provided by municipalities in country districts, are covered.

228,Mr James (Hunter) [8.53],"Claus eyears 1935-1945, it may not be of material benefit to them. There is a particular work concerning which I made representations to the honourable member for Parramatta ( SirFrederick Stewart) while he was Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Employment. I refer to the Maitland sewerage scheme. Representations in regard to it were also made by the State Government, and it was agreed that the scheme should be included in the list of works approved of in consultation with the States. An expenditure of approximately £370,000 was involved, the State's quota being £275,000 and that of the Commonwealth £92.500. The Commonwealth has contributed its quota, but so far the State Government has made no contribution towards tbe cost of the work. Prior to the last election, the promise was definitely made that award rates and conditions would be observed on the work. I remember distinctly the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) asserting in this House that the money was made available in an endeavour ro hold a seat which at one time was held by a Labour member. That, of course, was denied. At the outset, award rates and conditions were observed. This was in accordance with a definite promise to the Maitland electors by the State government on the eve of the 1935 election, but the scheme has since been included in the category of emergency relief work. I maintain that the election promise of both the State and Federal Governments should be honoured. The State Government, however, having assumed control of the scheme, is expending Commonwealth funds on the miserable dole basis. The municipality, clergymen, business men, and others have protested, and have made representations by deputation to the State for the redemption of its promise. wealth Government does not intend to use its influence to ensure that award rates are observed. This, incidentally, is in accordance with the Prime Minister's policy speech. Paragraph / of clause 6 of this bill states thatWhore the Government of a State directly would have put Ned Kelly to shame. controls a public work of a kind which, in any Discrimination has been shown against other State, is controlled by a public authority, the Government of that State may the Cessnock municipality and Kearsley apply the whole or portion of the moneys shire. I can see a strong likelihood of Mr James. towards payment of interest and sinking fund charges on loans for that public work, iu the same manner and subject, mutatis mutandis, to the same conditions as if the public work were controlled by a public authority. That suggests to me that, if a local governing authority exhausts the amount of money provided by the Commonwealth for a particular public work, and completes the undertaking on relief conditions with money which it has raised, it may still take advantage of this measure. inserted principally to meet the case of the Government of Western Australia, which carries out a good deal of the work that, in other States, is done by local governing authorities. Western Australia will pay award rates. WhatI wish to know is whether instrumentalities which carry on certain public works under relief conditions may apply this money to the payment of their interest bill. wealth Government is not concerning itself, in this measure, with the payment of award rates. It presumes that the State authorities will do the proper thing. Government undertook to ensure that award rates would be paid on all public works constructed with money provided by the Commonwealth. I ask that that promise be fulfilled. Although this measure provides that the money shall be allocated to the various States on a particular basis, we have no undertaking whatever that the State governments will, in turn, allocate the money made available to. them in accordance with the interest commitments Apparently, the Commonof their various local-governing authorities. It is quite likely that discrimination will be shown, as has already been shown, in the Maitland district.

I , personally, do not give the honourable gentleman much hope of retaining his seat, but no doubt everything possible will be done to create an atmosphere favorable to him. Specific conditions should be laid down to govern the distribution of this money by the State governments to the various municipalities. I also ask that loans raised prior to 1935, even as far back as a year or two prior to the depression, should be brought within the provisions of the bill. consideration' be given to the commitments entered into in respectof various hospitals. Hospitals were built in Cessnock and Kurri Kurri, in my own electorate, largely by money raised through a levy of Is. a fortnight on the miners. Unfortunately, debts have since been incurred in making additions to these institutions. Although the State government subsidizes hospitals on a £1 for £1 basis in respect of money spent on extensions, some of the hospitals are in dire straits financially. these institutions do entitles them to more consideration than they have been receiving. Seeing that the Government placarded the country, prior to the last election, with promises that it would take steps to ensure that award rates were paid on ail works constructed by Commonwealth money, I ask the Treasurer for an assurance that this condition will be insisted upon in connection with the disbursement of the money to be provided under this bill. Otherwise honourable members on this side of the chamber will be obliged at the committee stage of the bill to move amendments to achieve that end. One other point to whicli I direct attention has relation to the policy of preference to returned soldiers. Municipalities in Victoria are committed to the policy of preference to returned soldiers. This Government has, for many years past, adopted that policy in regard to its various public works, but to-day it is having a very damaging effect on the sons of returned soldiers who, though too young to go to the war, find themselves now, at the age of 30 or more, unable to obtain employment, because the preference principle is so rigidly adhered to. The situation has become so unsatisfactory that the secretary of the Kurri Kurri branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia has requested me to urge the Government to abandon this* policy. Preference to soldiers was a valuable principle in the years just after the war, when strong efforts were being made to repatriate our returned men, but it is regrettable that to-day the sons of deceased soldiers, who were too young to r go to the war, find the policy operating It is desirable, too, that more adversely to them. In the circumstances I urge the Government to reconsider the whole subject. If reasonable consideration is given to the suggestions made during this debate by lionorable members on this side of the chamber, it will not be necessary for us to delay the passage of the bill at the committee stage by moving amendments particularly relating to the observance of award rates and conditions. orable member for Hunter( Mr James) The humane work which and some of his colleagues opposite seem to be very unhappy at the success of the United Australia party.

Why should this bill contain clauses which discriminate against city local governing bodies? realize that the Country party is strongly represented in this Parliament, but surely honourable gentlemen who belong to that parry have twisted the neck of this Government long enough. I hear some honourable gentlemen laughing, but the truth must come out. Practically the whole of the concluding days of the last period of this session was devoted to the consideravice homes, and 50 per cent, of them are tion of bills designed to confer benefits exclusively upon country people. Order! The honourable momber must connect, his remarks with the bill. minute. I have complained previously of this issue being raised in the dying stages their situation to-day is no better, if it of the session. On the last occasion when a similar measure was before Parliament, I approached the Treasurer and asked that the metropolitan areas be allowed to participate in loans to municipalities and shires for the provision of water and sewerage. As a matter of fact, I interviewed members of the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Board, Sydney, and asked if they could utilize some of this money to provide sewerage facilities for portion about 70,000 people, where only half of the houses are sewered. This Government and the Government of New South Wales know that this is the case. The board assured me that tliere were two areas where it could immediately put men on sewerage work, and it informed this Government that it had already borrowed £2,000,000 in order to cur 17 out works in the metropolitan area. AlthoughI do not object to rural areas participating in benefits, because they inwrongly in deciding upon the methods clude installation of electricity, water supplies, sewerage and other amenities to public hospitals) &c, I do think that the bill should be amended to include metropolitan areas in the proposed benefits. The metropolitan areas of this country arc far behind those of other countries ia respect of the provision of sanitary arrangements. Surely this Government does not propose interminably to set aside sums of money for one section of the community and to divide this country by a. contest between country and city interests. I regret that it is necessary to make these protests against a government of I which 1 am a supporter, but it seems that the "" powers that be "" are tempted to let go the reins when arranging the distribution of loan moneys of this kind. Why should not the Commonwealth Government use some of this money to provide sewerage to war service homes in the metropolitan areas. In my electorate, there are at least 1,300 war sernot sewered. The Government should know the difficulties with whicli occupants of war service homes have to contendA great many of them bought their homes when prices were high, and, when, work I shall do so in one became scarce, many of them had only intermittent employment. Consequently, is not worse, than when they first entered into possession. These men are applying continually to have their homes sewered. I raised the matter with the Minister in charge of War Service Homes some little time ago, and he said it was intended to extend the facilities when money became available. It is not to* the credit of the Commonwealth that so many war service homes which were erected about fifteen years ago should not have essential serof the area containing vices, and the time has arrived when the Government, seeing that it has the money, should spend some of it on premises over which it has control. If it is not prepared to allocate some of the present funds for the purpose, it should take other steps. It should not fail to remember that these men are its direct responsibility, and before distributing money in the present proposed circumstances, it should look after them. I claim that-this Government has acted proposed in this bill for the allocation of the money. Honourable members have been talking about municipalities not taking some of it, but I do not agree with what the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) put forward.' I believe that the municipalities will gladly take this money.

If the moneys are availed of by the bodies to which it is offered, it will mean that between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000 of loan money will become available. For instance, the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New South ""Wales have agreed to subsidize moneys borrowed by municipalities on a pound for pound basis. I understand that if a public body borrows £50,000 free of interest, the State Government may say to it, "" Here is another £20,000 which can be borrowed but we shall charge a certain rate of interest, provided the loan money comes from outside the particular money borrowed under this scheme, and provided that certain public works are carried out."" I have advised the municipalities in my electorate to take advantage of the offer. While money is so cheap, municipalities which fail to borrow to make improvements are neglecting valuable opportunities. It would be ridiculous to say that for an unlimited period, we shall be able to have money at the rates of interest now prevailing. If there be any acumen among the municipal and shire councils, they will avail themselves of this money, and make improvements of vast benefit to the communities which they represent. Honourable members opposite, in this bill, are seeking to place restrictions on the State governments. I do not think that State governments can be compelled to spend this money entirely in rural districts as I do not think it is within the province of the Commonwealth Government to tell the States, once they have got the loans, how the money is to be spent. Nevertheless, I do believe that I do not doubt it, because the gentlemen's agreement incorporated in this measure will be honoured by the States, and that the money will be spent in country areas unless we insert a clause which will bring in the metropolitan areas. I have not the slightest doubt that the Bruxner party in the New South Wales Government will feel itself bound to honour this gentlemen's agreement in its entirety. Honourable members opposite, I believe, are trying to insert amendments in this bill for political purposes.

For many years, the need for action to that end has been urged, but, until recently, few measures calculated to bring about this reform have been introduced. The drift of population from the rural areas to the cities has been due to two principal causes. unprofitable nature of rural occupations and industries, and, consequently, of second factor is the greatly improved amenities of life provided in metropolitan areas and provincial cities and towns during the last couple of decades, in comparison with the conditions existing on the farms and in small country towns. In these circumstances it is not strange that this drift has taken place. It is far cheaper I do not object to award to provide social amenities in large centres of population than in sparsely settled areas. ""Water schemes, hospitals, Honourable members opposite and . the like can be provided at a lower cost per capita in cities than in rural areas. This measure demonstrates that the present Government is country-minded, and is taking a most practical step in the direction of the decentralization of the population by providing for dwellers in rural areas some, of the social amenities As the enjoyed in the large centres. For that reason I am particularly glad to see a clause in the bill indicating to the State This measure governments that they should give preference to works undertaken in rural districts. Together with that direction is one providing that preference should also be given to works calculated to employ the greatest proportion of manual labour. The extent of the drift from country areas to the cities and large provincial towns is not realized by the average metropolitan resident. I find, on referring to the Commonwealth Year-Book, The United Australia party that the 1933 census discloses that iu New South Wales 47^ per cent, of the total population lives in the metropolitan area. Excluding provincial cities and towns, only 30 per cent, of the population resides in rural areas.

252,Mr Mcewen (Echuca) [9.35],"Thismust realize that our destiny cannot be fulfilled when approximately one half of the population dwells in the six capital cities, and only 35 per cent, of the people reside on the land or in the small country towns. It should be the policy of any national government to give serious and constant consideration to the best means of securing the decentralization of the population. Unfortunately, the only practicable course available to this Parliament, in the present circumstances, is to take measures such as the bill now before it. The division of governmental authority in Australia, and the fact that the State Governments deal directly with the local governing bodies, make it impossible for the Commonwealth Government to do other than make money available through the States for public works of this type. this bill, I again express regret that this Parliament lacks constitutional power to deal directly with pressing problems affecting the welfare of the people. I disapprove of the principle of the Commonwealth Government raising revenue through taxation, and handing the money over to subsidiary governments with only the most meagre directions from the central authority as to the way in which it shall be spent. Various estimates have been made as to the total amount of money likely to be expended under this scheme. The £100,000 per annum provided in this bill is to be supplemented by a like amount from the State governments. With the £200,000 thus available my calculation in round figures is that, on tlie basis of providing interest and sinking Bank are in close touch with the agencies fund at the rate of 5 per cent., a capital sum of £4,000,000 could be raised. However, these funds are to be used only to supplement the contributions of local authorities. The contributions by State and local authorities together should provide interest and amortization on a capital expenditure of between £6,000,000 and £S,000,000. I take it that the proportion of siuking fund payments found by the State governments will vary in accordance with the needs of the public authorities they will be assisting. In some instances, the governments may shoulder a large proportion of the liability; but, in regard to the larger municipalities, a State government would properly insist that they should bear a considerable proportion of the cost. I agree that it is better that no definite proportion of the loan charges should be allocated to local authorities, but that this should be left to the individual State governments to determine. The local governing authorities, backed as they will be by State and Commonwealth governments, will be placed in a very sound position as borrowers. and will be entitled to raise money at the minimum rate of interest. First, they will pledge the rating capacity of their ratepayers for a certain proportion of interest and sinking fund on the money raised; then they will have, as additional security, the contributions of the Commonwealth and State governments, so that they will be able to offer security WhilstI support only a little less sound than that of the governments themselves. I hope that, in the raising of their loans, the local bodies will not be left to a roach the loan nT, brokers and underwriters. They should receive in their loan negotiations the assistance of some government, prefer 1 ably the Commonwealth Government. I see no reason why it should not be possible for the Commonwealth Bank to underwrite all loans approved by the State government. be much need for underwriting, and the State governments are closer to the matter than we are. MrM c EWEK I appreciate that; but I also realize that the Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth through which money may be raised for public purposes. It is presumed, that, during the period of ten years mentioned in the bill, there will be a constant flow of applications to the State governments from i>ublic authorities seeking to raise funds. I assume that, in seven or eight years' time, applications will still be coming in. Those local authorities who are able to take advantage of the scheme immediately will have the benefit of a ten-year period of assistance by the Commonwealth and State governments in regard to the money they raise, but those which seek to raise money eight or nine years hence will",51,States Grants Local Public Works Bill 1936 Second Reading
253,Mr Casey,"I do not think there willhave a guarantee of assistance of only one or two years. If this measure is not followed up in a few years' time with another to extend the period of the assistance, it will be of little value to local bodies seeking to raise money in the future. I suggest that whatever government is in office in, say, five years' time, paragraph, I think, leaves it open for should introduce legislation extending the operation of this measure. The bill provides that "" public works "" are to include, among other things, the erection of public hospitals. In my electorate, no new public hospitals are being built, but substantial additions are being made to existing public hospitals. Those public hospitals which were erected by public contribution have, in some cases, been declared base hospitals, and they are entitled to a certain amount of assistance from the State Government. definition of public works included in the bill is to be interpreted literally, no money can be made available under this scheme for additions to public hospitals. I suggest that the definition should be altered so as to include the erection of, or additions to, any public hospital. Public hospitals are not usually in a position to offer the same security for the raising of loans as are other public authorities. They have no rating power, and are not regarded by banks as satisfactory customers to whom to lend money on overdraft, for capital expenditure. Their income, for the most part, is dependent on charitable contributions from the public. derive revenue from lotteries. of the system that obtains in Victoria. I ask the Treasurer to consider a suggestion for amending the bill to permit hospitals to receive under this scheme capita] grants for necessary construction work, instead of having to raise loans. AgainI ask that consideration be given to the inclusion of bush nursing hospitals with public hospitals. cipal hospitals in Victoria. / of Clause6 provides that, where a government of a State directly controls a public work, which, in any other State, is controlled by a public authority, the Government of that State may apply the whole or portion of the moneys towards payment of interest and sinking fund charges on loans for that public work in the same manner as if the public work were controlled by a public authority. That certain State Governments, if they so desire, to appropriate the whole of their share of this money to some of their particular undertakings to the entire exclusion of the class of works which this bill is designed to assist. For instance, in Victoria, the State Electricity Commission fulfills a function which, in some other States, is undertaken by public authorities. As a matter of fact about ten or fifteen years ago the supply of electricity in Victoria was undertaken If the by a public authority. Senator BRENNAN -Does not the honourable member regard the Electricity Commission as a public authority? out that it is one of the instrumentalities which come within the provisions of this clause which would entitle the State to appropriate Commonwealth moneys for the purpose of paying interest on the moneys invested in that particular undertaking. I do not think that it is the intention of the Government, and I feel sure that it is not the wish of the House, that moneys voted under this bill should be appropriated by State governments for the purpose of paying interest and making contributions to sinking funds on any of their own undertakings. I ask the Treasurer to give consideration to that point before the bill is finally disposed of. No provision seems to have been made that a State must approve of the spending of this money within a definite period. We must remember that, in the allocation of the money provided under this bill to a local spending authority, the State governments are under an obligation to find an equivalent amount. Last year we passed a States Grants Bill, providing for the granting Paragraph of money to various State governments contingent upon them finding an equivalent amount themselves. To escape its obligation to provide an equivalent amount, Tasmania declined to take any",52,States Grants Local Public Works Bill 1936 Second Reading

258,Mr Mcewen,"Yes. I am pointingCommonwealth money. If Tasmania or any other State should decide to pursue the same line of action in connection with the bill now before the House, it would be possible for such a State to take moneys voted under it, place them in a separate account, and refrain from allocating them to local government bodies. AlthoughI do not think that there is any likelihood of that happening, I draw the attention of the Treasurer to the omission of any provision for a definite time limit within which the State must provide for the spending of the money to be granted. I conclude by again affirming that, in my opinion, this is one of the most meritorious bills that have come before this Parliament, and by expressing the hope that the same country-mindedness will continue to actuate the present Government. I hope that we shall see a continuance of legislation designed to make country industries moro profitable. I commend the Government for the introduction of this bill, which will increase the amenities of our rural industries and go a long way towards bringing about decentralization in Australia. commend the Government for the introduction of this bill, believing as I do that encouragement, but other works are not it will genuinely afford some relief to the unemployment position. A certain amount of criticism has been directed by lionorable members opposite to the fact that the Government has not fulfilled its pre-election promise to include a Minister for employment in the Cabinet. . That has worried me very considerably, because, during the last election campaign, I made that a feature of my election appeal. Nevertheless, a measure such as this, and others, which, I understand, are to follow, constitute a definite indication to the House and the country generally that, although the Prime Minister has not been able to see his way clear, owing to the reconstruction appoint a Minister for employment, the Government is thoroughly alive to its responsibilities, and is endeavouring whether a particular work is to receive to take practical steps to alleviate the unemployment position. Turning to the intimate provisions of the bill now before the House, the definition "" public work "" also worries me very considerably. "" Public work "" is deemed to include any gas, electricity, water supply or sewerage undertaking or the erection of any public hospital or of any public institution for maternal or infant welfare, where the work is constructed, controlled or maintained by a public authority. I ask tbe Treasurer ( Mr Casey) whether municipal councils carrying out road and bridge construction work are excluded from participation in this legislation? designed to be as wide as possible. The items specifically referred to were included at the instance of the States, which desired the definite inclusion of these various undertakings. The legal officers have informed me that this definition is as wide as possible. that assurance from the Treasurer, because I feel that if that were not the case municipal authorities throughout Australia, which do not engage in the activities specifically mentioned, would be excluded. It would have been grossly unfair if the money were to be provided only in respect of those works specifically mentioned in the definition clause. the definition are those most worthy of excluded. The term "" public work "" is an all-embracing one. excluded ? hospital would come under the provision. surer has gone further in his explanation I am not quite so satisfied about it. There are many useful bridge and road works which could be undertaken, which would absorb a number of the unemployed, and if certain municipalities are excluded from the bill, the unemployed in those municipalities will also be excluded from the relief which this of the Government, to bill is designed to grant. the instrumentality which must determine the benefits provided under this bill. Treasurer's assurance that ordinary municipal works will not be definitely excluded, I shall be satisfied.",53,States Grants Local Public Works Bill 1936 Second Reading

267,Mr Fisken,"S o long as I have thethe sum of £100,000 is to be appropriated in each financial year commencing on the 1st July, 1935, and ending on the 30th June, 1945. Since my return from the war, I have been a member of a municipal council. On various occasions circulars have been received by the council from the State government asking it to send in a schedule of works which might be' proceeded with under some such scheme as this. Invariably it takes a considerable time to decide what works might be carried out with the money to be made available, and there has always been a further delay on the part of the State government in deciding whether or not the works submitted by the council should be approved. I can visualize many works now being thought of by municipal authorities, which will not be put in hand for two or three years. I was wondering whether there was any possibility of continuing the provisions of this grant at a diminishing rate for some years after 1945 in order that municipalities should have the benefit of the assistance for the full ten years. As the clause is constituted at present, if works are held up for three years, they will obtain the benefit for only seven years. matter when I reply. provision that there should be some control by the State government of the claims vision is a wise one, because a very subput forward by the municipalities. As a councillor, I have seen my colleagues rush amount of sustenance and unemployment in with various schemes when they think easy money is available, schemes which often, on more mature consideration, would have been turned down by the council. The very fact that easy money is available leads the council to say, ""We will get as much as we can irrespective of whether the work is to be of the least benefit or not"". The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) has raised the point that probably there are many municipalities unable to avail themselves of any further loan moneys because they have already borrowed up to the hilt. He cited a provision in the Local Government Act of New South Wales under which a certain number of ratepayers can demand a poll of ratepayers before any loan can be floated. That provision is not peculiar to New South Wales. It is embodied also in the local government legislation of the State of Victoria. Although in that State one or two municipalities cannot afford to borrow further, the vast majority of them will be able, and are entitled, to do so, if given assistance of this nature, which will be of immense benefit to them. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has made a statement to which I , as the representative of a country constituency, take strong exception. I understood the honourable gentleman to suggest that some country muncipalities have the habit of evading the observance of wages board awards. He asserted that such observance should be made compulsory in this measure. I assure the honourable gentleman that, although the municipality of which I am' a member is financially one of the poorest in Victoria, it has always paid award rates of wages to its employees. I have yet to learn that there is any municipality in Victoria which does not do so. The honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) in a characteristically delightful criticism of country districts, took exception to the provision that, as far as possible, the loan moneys which are to be subsidized should be expended in country municipalities. He was at great pains to show that rural industries and country people generally are unduly favoured by this Government and others. I assure him that in the present case, that prostantial proportion of the enormous relief money expended in Victoria recently has been spent in and around the City of Melbourne, on account of the preponderating number of unemployed in that area. I commend the Government for the introduction of the bill, and hope that tbe House will ""ce fit to pass it. the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) stated that some municipalities do not observe award rates and conditions, the honourable members for Echuca( Mr land) retorted that that did not anply in Victoria.

273,Mcewen) And Wimmera ( Mr Mcclel,"the same attitude, while the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) has sought to exonerate Queensland from the charge. Yet, it is contended that the suggested amendment of the Leader of the Opposition to compel this observance would prove detrimental to municipalities! I point out to the honourable members for Ballarat, Wimmera and Echuca tliat the municipal councils of Victoria do not pay award rates of wages to relief workers, and that a regulation promulgated by the Government of that State permits them to pay a lower rate. The municipal employees at Coburg downed tools on that issue, and those of Brunswick and other municipalities demanded that relief workers should not be employed on municipal undertakings at less than award rates. I cannot speak of the conditions in Western Australia. that State arc compelled to pay 25s. a year to a union before they can obtain employment. 25s. a year to a union if thereby they are able to obtain full rates of wages. The honourable member for Echuca has referred to the drift of population to the cities. Is there any wonder that that should be so. When tlie reason is either that tlnjy are being paid low wages, or that they have no employment at all? The New South Wales Industrial, Gazette of the 31st December, 1935, sets out the rates of wages paid on declared relief works by the Stevens Government to different groups of employees. Single men or widowers without dependants work 44 hours in each period of five weeks £12,000,000, and those of New South and receive £3 8s. 6d., which is equivalent to 14s. a week. A married man without dependants works 88 hours in each period of seven weeks and receives the equivalent of 19s. 6d. a week. A married man with two dependants under fourteen years of age works 88 hours in each period of five weeks, and is paid at the rate of £1 7s. a week. A married man with three dependants under fourteen years of age is employed for 132 hours in each period of seven weeks, and is paid at the rate of £1 9s. 6d. a week. A married man with five dependants under fourteen years of age works 88 hours in each period of four weeks, and receives £1. 15s. a week. A married man with seven dependants works 132 hours in each period of five weeks, and receives £2 6s. 9d. a week. A married man with over seven and under tw elve dependants T under fourteen years of age works 176 hours in each period of five weeks, and receives the magnificent sum of £2 13s. a week. Yet the honourable member for Barton claims that prosperity has at last arrived in that State! The Industrial Commission had laid it down that the lowest amount which should be fixed in respect of rent in the case of a married man with two children is 17s. 6d. a week. Therefore, a married man with two dependants would have only 9s. a week on which to feed and clothe four persons. Would any honourable member opposite care to live on that amount? Prior to the elections last May, members of, the Stevens Government said that if they were returned to power they would see that full award rates of pay and conditions were observed. That promise gained them one or two seats, but it will not avail them anything when the next appeal is made to the electors. It is possible to deceive the people once. The honourable member for Barton, and some other honourable members opposite realize that their political days are numbered. While the honourable member for Dalley was referring to municipal debts in New South Wales and Victoria, the honourable member for Echuca interjected that Victoria was in a more satisfactory position than New South Wales. The Commonwealth Statistician, however, reports that, while the debts of municipal bodies in Victoria amount to Wales to £35,000,000, the debts of semi-government bodies in Victoria total £37,000,000, while those of New South Wales total only £7,000.000, making the total aggregate debts of municipalities and local governing bodies £49,000,000 in Victoria, against £42,000,000 in New South Wales. The honourable member tried to make some capital out of the fact that certain municipalities in New South Wales are controlled by Labour; but I remind him that only six local governing bodies in New South Wales, out of 354, are under Labour control The remainder, like the municipalitie* and shire councils of Victoria, ar.e under the control of persons connected with the",55,States Grants Local Public Works Bill 1936 Second Reading

275,Mr Garden,"It is better to payUnited Australia party or Country party. The lionorable member should also bear in mind that, while the per capita debt of municipalities and semi-government bodies in Victoria is £26 12s., that of New South Wales is £15 13s. of the Labour party said that the local governing bodies of New South Wales were insolvent. I simply wished to make it clear that that was not the case in Victoria. ber laid it to the charge of the Labour party that local government affairs had been mismanaged in New South Wales. Statistics indicate worse mismanagement in Victoria, where the Labour party is not in power in any sense. Honourable members opposite should be ashamed to suggest that the provision of £100,000 for the purposes of this bill is of any real value to the unemployed people of Australia. This Government has paid £36,000 to one individual in royal commission fees and expenses. Moreover, it expended a considerable amount of money to send the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) overseas to investigate the proiblems of unemployment. Yet it now finds itself incapable of tackling the problem in any statesmanlike way. The Commonwealth Government is about to float an internal loan of £S,000,000, and we are told that it will be required to pay 3f per cent, for the money. How much are municipalities likely to have to pay for money that they borrow? I suggest that the interest rate, including discount, on any municipal loan is likely to be very close to 5 per cent. Allowing an additional 2 per cent, for sinking fund payments, municipalities or semi-government local bodies will be involved in interest and sinking fund commitments of 7 per cent, in respect of any loans they float. The honourable member for Echuca said that it should be possible, under the provisions of this bill, to raise about £8,000,000 for public works, but he would need to be a financial magician to achieve that result. In my opinion, very little more than £4,000,000, jf even as much as that, will be raised. The real trouble with municipalities is that, for some reason, they cannot take advantage of the money which the Commonwealth Government has already made available to them. I asked the Prime Minister a question on this subject recently, and was informed that the Government of New South Wales, and also other State governments, were entitled to more money from the Commonwealth than they had at that time applied for. Why have they not taken advantage of Commonwealth moneys already made available to them? The reason, of course, is that they cannot comply with the conditions imposed by the Commonwealth. Commonwealth money must be used to meet wages costs, but the local-governing authorities find it difficult to raise the necessary money to buy raw materials for the works they wish to put in hand. The members of the Country party who support this Government are jubilant, because the Government has made millions of pounds available to the primary producers, but they show no concern about the inadequate amounts provided for the relief of unemployment. How far is it expected that this £100,000 will go to meet the needs of the situation? It is deplorable beyond words that a man with a wife and twelve other dependants should,, in five weeks, working 176 hours, earn only £2 13s. a week. Do any farmers live under such conditions? farmers have had to face worse circumstances than that. obliged to pay heavy rents. Does the honourable member for Barton, who said that prosperity had returned, regard as satisfactory the remuneration that relief workers are getting in New South Wales? The figures that. I have cited do not suggest that prosperity has returned. Smith has said that prosperity has returned. for what Mr Forgan Smith says. The figures that I have cited speak for themselves.

281,Mr Garden,"I am not responsibleobliging the local-governing bodies of Victoria to pay lower rates of wages, and fix longer working hours than those prescribed by the industrial tribunals of the State. The Government is not acting with any generosity to the municipal and local governing bodies, for it requires these hard-pressed instrumentalities to subsidize on a £1 for £1 basis the money they may receive under this measure. A scheme of this kind, to be effective, should provide for the expenditure of at least £100,000. Any one listening to the remarks of the honourable member for Cook( Mr has been spent in the cities, and it is Garden) might assume that conditions in Australia are no better to-day than they were five years ago, but the most casual examination of our affairs would reveal to them instantly that the circumstances of the people are infinitely better than when this Government assumed office. This is particularly true of New South Wales, where a great many more people are employed to-day than were employed during the Lang regime. The honourable member for Cook cited certain figures to show that, relief workers were not being paid award rates in New South Wales. The work is undoubtedly rationed, but the honourable member failed to disclose that when the men are working they are paid award rates. During a period of depression, governments should pursue a progressive and sound public works policy to make up for tlie lag in private enterprise, and since its provision of amenities which, so far, only inception this Government has not been lax in applying that principle. This bill is only another instalment of its public works policy. At first sight the amount of £100,000 mentioned in the measure seems rather small, but it should be realized that the money is being paid as a. contribution to interest and sinking fund payments. [Quorum formed.'] The contribution of a further sum of £100,000 by the States will bring the amount to £200,000, which will be sufficient to pay interest at 5 per cent, on roughly £4,000,000 of public works. provision by the governments of £200,000 will mean a total reduction of interest of 2 per cent, on [5(»] £10,000,000. It will, therefore, be seen that the potentialities of the grant proposed in this bill are much greater than would seem at the first glance. The Commonwealth money is to be made available to the States for application to selected schemes, but it has been laid down that, in giving this assistance, the States must provide an amount equal to the amount provided by the Commonwealth, either by interest or sinking fund reduction, or by capital grants, or a little of each. The bill fairly provides that preference is to be given to country municipalities. Over the last four or five years, the bulk of money spent in relief of unemployment desirable that the country municipalities should have greater opportunities of participation. The big city municipalities are able to borrow at lower rates of interest than the country municipalities can, ancl furthermore, the greater number of people in the metropolitan municipalities makes the sharing of the interest payments much lighter than it is in the country. The clause will have a tendency to decentralize population. [Quorum formed.] Men have been attracted to the country to work on certain schemes, and after their completion they have frequently been given employment in the locality and become permanent residents of it. I hope that the expenditure of this money will attract people from the crowded cities to take up permanent residence in the country. Another benefit that will result to country residents from the expenditure of large sums on electricity and sewerage works will be the cities have enjoyed. This should be another means of attracting families to the rural districts. A wise provision in the bill is the clause which gives preference in the allocation of money to schemes which are likely to create the greatest employment-wate r and sewerage works, for instance, which will provide work, not only directly, but also indirectly. I hope that preference will also be given to works that have already been started in anticipation The of these moneys. I have in mind particularly a work in my own electorate, which I think I can say definitely was started, largely because of a promise of",57,States Grants Local Public Works Bill 1936 Second Reading

285,Regarded As Fortunate Persons On The Basic Honourable Member For Indi ( Mr Hutchin,"single women or widows, wlio have nobody to maintain them, and who receive HO relief at all. It appears to me that their position is one of great hardship. The sum provided under this bill does not justify the amount of talk that has been devoted to it. It is really only a small sum, and it must be obvious that this expenditure can bring no real relief to the unemployed. It will merely help to keep unemployed persons living in a state of semi-starvation. A class of unemployed exists, the members of which are always in expectation of getting work. Some of them get it from time to time, but that does not relieve unemployment generally; it merely assuages the pain, without removing its cause. I am satisfied that it would be in the interests of this Commonwealth to have everybody who is willing and able to work provided with it. Tlic person who cannot find ordinary employment should be given work by the community. We are told that prosperity has returned. I doubt whether it has returned permanently, but if it has, it is a hopeless sort of prosperity; it is a prosperity of a much inferior quality to that we formerly knew. If we have got back to normality, it is upon an inferior basis, and upon a lower plane. If that is all we can look forward to, the prospers as I stated recently, is that sooner or later-and matter will have to be dealt with by providing, on a large scale, work for all people who cannot be absorbed in industry to-day. Many young men fall within this category. They have left school and have received no industrial training, and, year by year, their capacity and will to work decreases. I believe that this country will have to provide employment of a useful character on a large scale for this class. Although their employment would not increase the volume of consumable goods, it would provide them with the means of purchasing consumable goods. The. only way to do this in any country is by an expansion of credit, or by an increased issue of notes. The fear is expressed regarding every form of expansion of credit or of the note issue that it will lead to inflation, but expansion of credit, is taking place every day. Every loan does that.' Not only does it transMr Hlackburn. fer a large sum of money from private pockets, but the person who lends his money receives a security which he can easily convert into credit, and which his bank will readily liquefy or remonetize for him. The fear of expansion of credit has been that it will be carried out by a government whose chief concern is to retain power at the next election. Where the expansion of credit isaffected by a bank, whose business it is to deal with money, it is regarded as having an interest in keeping the supply of money as low as possible. I agree that there is considerable danger of inflation when the expansion of credit is carried out by one .government or one parliament, but I believe that that danger is easily removable if the body which has charge of the expansion of credit represents not the Commonwealth Government only, but all the governments of Australia, and all the political parties. I believe that the Commonwealth Loan Council, or a Premiers Conference, which would be much the same thing,' could be trusted to decide what expansion of the note issue is necessary, in order to put men now unemployed into useful work. There are many useful works which could be undertaken, works which would improve the amenities of the arc poor indeed. My view, country, make it more productive and a better place to live in, and provide emthe sooner the better-this ployment for the people. A government which does not provide employment for the masses of the people does not deserve to continue. What has overthrown democracy in Europe is that the prosperous people neglected all considerations but themselves, and that the unemployed have nothing to hope for from maintaining existing conditions, and everything to gain from change. As far as the bill is concerned, I commend it to the Blouse, but it does not go very far. John Stuart Mill truly remarked that, in the case of desperate diseases, attempts to cure by ineffectual remedies only inflame and aggravate the condition. In the main I am in accord with the principles of this measure, but there are a few points to which I desire to direct the attention of the Treasurer ( Mr Casey). My first complaint is regarding the long delay that has taken place since",60,States Grants Local Public Works Bill 1936 Second Reading
286,Mr Peancis (Moreton) [11.18],"this proposal was first mentioned in the budget nine months ago, though I agree that the States must accept some responsibility for that because of the conflicting views they put forward and the difficulty in arriving at any agreement. The bill proposes to make available £100,000 each year for ten years, the payment of interest and sinking fund on moneys raised to assist local authorities in carrying out approved public works. That amount is to be supplemented by contributions from the States on a £1 for £1 basis. Under £5,000,000 should be made available to local authorities which have played an important part in meeting the unemployment problem. Many of them are in difficult circumstances to-day, because they yielded to the pressure to provide employment for as many men as possible. Some have raised loans until they can borrow no more, ancl have increased their rates until it is impossible to raise them any higher. In spite of their efforts there are still many persons unemployed, and many public works that should be carried out. Many local bodies employ special staffs, engineers, &c, and keep plant for which there is not full-time occupation because they lack funds, and in most local-governing areas there are works which could be undertaken if additional funds were made available. I draw the attention of the chamber to the definition in clause 2 of "" public work"", which is stated to include any gas, electricity, water supply or sewerage undertaking, or the erection of any public hospital or of any public institution for maternal or infant welfare, where the work is constructed, controlled or maintained by a public authority. I should like to know whether that definition will include all the general activities of municipal and local authorities. lic works as the construction of roads, and bridges, &c, but will not include ordinary administrative expenditure. shore improvements and buildings required at seaside resorts? regarded as a public work. draining of lands ? I would include that also. that assurance. According to the bill, "" approved loans "" means loans the terai3 to be devdted towards of which have been approved by the Government of a State. I think the bill should state more definitely the terms upon which the moneys will be made available. The whole scheme will be a failure if the terms are made unduly harsh, and if a proper recognition is not this scheme approximately shown of the peculiar circumstances in which many local authorities find themselves to-day. This measure should be administered in the light of the assurance given in the budget speech of last year which contained the following:As the result of further investigation into means whereby the Commonwealth can assist in the problem of relieving unemployment, it has been decided, subject tn satisfactory arrangements with the States to make provision from revenue for an amount of £100.000 in 1935-30, to be used in the form of contributions towards interest and sinking funds on loans for the public works of local authorities. It is known that many local governing bodies are debarred from proceeding with public utility schemes by reason of the consequent debt service being beyond their rateable capacity. It is hoped that as a result of consultation with the State governments, a scheme can be evolved under which, with joint help on the above lines from the Commonwealth and State Governments, a number of such public u t i l i ty proposals may be undertaken with consequent amenity value to country districts as well as absorption of men who are now unemployed. I should like to receive an assurance that money will be made available under the scheme to assist hospitals. In the country districts of New South Wales, I understand, hospitals are controlled and administered by local authorities, but in Queensland we are reaching a position in which they are maintained, for the most part, out of funds raised by means of a lottery; they are not publicly controlled and owned in the sense of being administered by a local authority. I should like to know whether they will be entitled to benefit under the terms of this bill. The principle behind this measure is to provide employment, and with the sum of about £5,000,000 which may be raised it should be possible to do -",61,States Grants Local Public Works Bill 1936 Second Reading

292,Mr Francis,"I am glad to have a good deal in this way, particularly in country districts. If that can be done, it will help still further towards bringing about economic recovery. [11.28] I congratulate the Government upon the introduction of this measure. To me its most favorable feature is that it recognizes the principle of planning, in that it sets out to do something over a number of years. 1 feel, however, that honourable members are exaggerating the importance of the measure from the point of view of providing employment. The money to be made available is to be used to help local bodies meet interest payments on loans already raised, and on future loans. The bill provides for the appropriation of £100,000 by the Commonwealth for this purpose, and the money is to be distributed over six capital cities, as well as the leading provincial towns in each State. I have no doubt that claims will be numerous, and it seems to me that only a comparatively small sum can be made available to each claimant, certainly not enough to make much difference to the unemployment situation. This bill provides a very handsome grant to municipalities, State Governments, which works on loau moneys, and will be of material assistance in helping them meet their interest bill. Surely, however, it is not suggested that it will enable them to start new public works. clause 6 provides that the money shall be paid in respect of works commenced on or after the 1st of July, 1935. help to reduce the burden of interest payable in respect of public works which are commenced this year, and it certainly does apply to fresh loans raised during the next ten years. From that point of view the bill deserves the commendation of the House. But how can it be claimed that it will result in the absorption of large numbers of the unemployed? At most it will not provide many men with employment. Certainly the amount to be provided is not sufficient to finance the numerous works mentioned by the honourable members for Barton( Mr a metropolitan constituency, I have Lane) and Moreton( Mr Francis), or to enable any municipality, local governing authority or State Government to undertake any big public works. The amount to be provided will give employment only to about 100 menfor one year in each of the capital cities. commend the Government for the introduction of this measure. Any criticism I have to offer is directed not so much to what the bill contains, but rather to what it omits. It has been well drafted to cover the needs of the particular councils that come within its ambit; it will materially help them and assist in some degree to solve the unemployment problem of this country. Municipal councils in the past have had very many projected works which they have been anxious to put in hand, but they have been hampered because of their inability to secure the money necessary to finance them. This bill will enable many of those works to be put in hand, and for that reason it will be welcomed by the councils. attention to the state of the House.

311,Mr Clark,"I .was proceeding tonature of an attractive bait, the object being to induce municipalities to raise loans on their own security and thereby remove from the Commonwealth and the States the responsibility that now rests upon them. I feel quite certain that that is before the end of the session greater prothe intention of the Government. Some1 municipalities and shires accepted earlier loans and endeavoured to find employment in their districts, but because they were allowed only about 10 per cent, for supervision and materials, they had to cease these operations for the relief of unemployment. these councils, which have already done a fair share of relief work, will be penalized, because their capacity to borrow is not equal to that of councils which did not take advantage of the facilities previously offered for the raisdefined as including certain undertakings. ing of money at current rates of interest. Honourable members of the Opposition also object to the rates that are to be paid upon works undertaken by municipalities. ployment relief work has been made in New South ""Wales, in which State less than the ruling trade rates is paid. The Industrial Gazette for February shows that 28,553 men were employed in that month on emergency relief work, under dole conditions, single men receiving about 13s. 6d. a week, and married men with three children under fourteen years of age only £1 9s. 6d. a week, compared with the basic wage of £3 8s. 6d. a week. Special rates have been gazetted for ordinary relief work, and the margins for skill have been eliminated. The number of men employed in this direction is 15,508. Previous speakers have claimed that there has been an improvement of the unemployment position, the figure for New South Wales now being only 13 per cent. in my electorate, there are 2,132 men, of whom 496 are registered with the labour exchange, while an additional 40 or 50 unemployed are not registered. unemployment in this town is 25 per cent. Last June, when the council interviewed the Minister for Works in an endeavour to obtain money for drainage works, it was officially stated that the unemployed in the town then numbered 387. There has thus been an Mr Clark. increase of about 20 per cent, in the last eleven months. The Government could do much more for the unemployed if it felt so disposed. This measure does not go so far as it should, and I hope that vision will be made. [11.57] -in reply-The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has forecast two amendments by means of which he seeks to extend -the definition of ""public Under this measure works "". As I have said by way of interjection, the Government has attempted, after consultation with the States, to make this definition as all-embracing as possible. The description "" public work "" is, of course, well known. Here it is These were included at the express request of the governments of the States, to indicate, I think, that they were of the type which should be given more encouragement than others should receive. Special provision for unemBut the definition is not exclusive. I assure the Leader of the Opposition that the Government intends that the description shall be a3 wide as is proper. But if it is provided that the States may name any activity, the scope of the legislation might be extended immeasurably, and the money be so widely distributed that its principal purpose would not be achieved. Governments give that indication? did so individually. The bill has been built up piece by piece. It is rather peculiar that those honourable members who have complained that the definition in regard to hospitals is not sufficiently wide come from the two States, the Premiers of which particularly requested In the town of Dubbo, the Commonwealth to word it in this form. Admittedly, it will not embrace hospitals in country districts that are run by local committees.

The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) sought information regarding the terms and conditions under -which this money would be made available. That matter is entirely in the hands of the State governments A State government may decide that a particular work shall benefit to the extent of 1 per cent. Commonwealth money and 1 per cent. State money, or the percentage may be fixed at some other figure. The object of the Government was to introduce a bill giving the maximum degree of flexibility. Clearly, in the early years of this scheme, the State governments will not be able to use all the money that goes into the trust fund. That leads me to make a suggestion, which, however, may not commend itself to some State governments, that particular consideration should be given to certain classes of public works which, in their early stages, may not be incomeearning. I have in mind a large public work which it has been difficult to put in hand, for the reason that its interest and sinking fund payments would be particularly heavy in its early years, before any substantial amount of income was being earned. A State government might reasonably provide, in connection with such an undertaking, that a varying sinking fund payment shall apply. In the early years this might be at the rate of 5 per cent., but subsequently it might be dropped to 2 per cent., or even 1 per cent. That would enable a State government to get a work well started, and reduce its capital commitments in its early years. There is really no limit to the adaptability of the bill. Mr E. limit imposed in respect of rural works. be applicable to works that have already been put in hand? menced this financial ""year, yes. It will be quite competent for State governments to apportion some of the money to such works. to strike out the condition giving preference to rural works? of the bill is to effect a decentralization of public works. Such bodies as the Sydney Water and Sewerage Board, which have the authority of the State government behind them, can borrow on terms as good as those offered to the State government itself. bodies in rural areas are also in that position. rural works because it is realized that local governing bodies in rural areas which have not the guarantee of the Government behind them are not able to borrow as advantageously as certain big instrumentalities in the city, which are guaranteed by the Government. I can think of no local governing body outside of the big cities of the Commonwealth which can borrow on terms comparable with those obtainable by governments. If we can effect a decentralization of public works it will be beneficial to the whole community. that I have in mind must get the consent of the Government before they can borrow even from such financial institutions as the Australian Mutual Provident Society. Government does not enable them to borrow on better terms. bodies in Sydney have borrowed so much money in recent years in order to put relief works in hand for the unemployed, that they have now exhausted their credit. Why should other local governing bodies which have not endeavoured to that extent to help the unemployed be put in an advantageous position ? Parliament can pass can rectify such a position. Approximately £20,000,000 is being spent annually on public works in Australia at present. This bill will affect only a part of that vast programme. The hope of the Government is that this scheme will permit a relatively large number of comparatively small public works to be put in hand in country districts. The next year or two will indicate clearly whether this hope will be realized.",65,States Grants Local Public Works Bill 1936 Second Reading

As one who has had a good deal of experience of negotiations The Government with the State governments during recent years, I can only say that my personal view-whic h is also the view of the Government-is that when grants are made the Commonwealth should lay down the main purposes to which the grants shall be applied and not impose conditions which might detract from the sovereignty of the States. be required to pay award rates? the States are sovereign bodies which know right from wrong. The Commonwealth should be content to lay down the main purpose, and not impose irritating conditions. This matter was discussed with the States-the e Labour governments and three United Australia party governments-and they all asked that they should fix the conditions under whicli the work should be carried out. I believe that they will all do the proper thing. It would be humiliating to place in the bill a provision that the State government, or other authority, shall observe certain conditions in regard to labour. already contained in the bill. of the Opposition will not persist with RecentlyI the amendment which he has foreshadowed.

In practice, no public authority maintains a hospital. The great majority of hospitals obtain revenue from a variety of sources, and whilst the management may be said to maintain a hospital out of its revenue, there is doubt as to whether the management can be described as a public authority within the meaning of tlie State statutes. State legislation does, however, deal with a public authority. I see no reason why my amendment should not be accepted. It provides that a State shall have the right to say that any work of which it approves may be regarded as a public work for the purpose of this legislation. As a matter of fact, later clauses provide that no work can share the Commonwealth's contribution to interest and sinking fund unless the State has approved of it. Therefore it appears to me that the fact that, a State lia3 the right to veto the assistance which a public authority may expect, establishes clearly enough that, in substance, the States are given almost the entire responsibility for deciding whether or not the provisions of this legislation shall apply to a particular work. what appear to be restrictive words in the definition of "" public work "". I realize that the Treasurer has said that the bill provides for considerable flexibility. He also said that we should not place humiliating restrictions on the States by imposing conditions under which certain works shall be carried out. I do not accept that argument as conclusive in regard to the conditions under which Commonwealth revenue should be expended. This Parliament should be satisfied that money made available by it is expended under such conditions as it thinks proper. expressed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin). The honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Fisken) is not satisfied that the ordinary work of municipal councils is covered by the definition of "" public work "". Although the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has given an assurance that it is, we recall that, despite similar assurances in the past, amending bills have subsequently been found necessary to give effect to the intention of the legislature. We have been led to believe that a great majority of the work to be carried out under the scheme of the bill is work such as that usually done by municipal authorities. Most of them deal with roads and footpaths, and with drainage and bridge work, but none of these things are covered by the definition of "" public work."" implied. ing a bill for a new act, which deals with new principles. The municipalities throughout Australia do not control such undertakings as those specifically mentioned in the definition, but every municipality is concerned with roads and footpaths, and with drainage and bridge work. The various State authorities may differ as to the way in which this Parliament desires the money to be expended, and therefore, the definition should leave no doubt on the matter.",67,States Grants Local Public Works Bill 1936 Second Reading

During the depression it did not cease borrowing but reduced the annual amount to an average of £1,000,000 or. £2,000,000. Later the New South Wales Government passed a bill which provided that if the board borrowed £3,000,000, which was to be expended within the five subsequent years, it would destroy bonds, representing money owing by the board to the Government',to the value of £2,500,000.

The reason for this is amendobvious.

Speaking subject to correction as to the legal interpretation of the provision, I should say that the local governing authorities would require to obtain approval before the end of this financial year. because the Victorian Parliament is not in session. member wants to happen can happen, I believe that approval will have to be obtained before the 30th June. ment inserted in paragraph (a) provision covering specific works which are excluded by a later paragraph? governing authorities another six months in which to obtain the approval of the State government? for Echuca has raised a rather subtle point.

Municipalities in pretation which, if given to it, may defeat the Sydney metropolitan area are just one of the objects of the bill, and inflict as much in need of financial assistance grave injustices on certain large country for public works as are municipalities towns, such as Newcastle, certain towns and shires in country districts.

Sydney metropolitan area are not responschemes. they have heavy obligations in respect of other public works, and I imagine that comparatively few of the country municipalities will seek assistance in order to carry on sewerage works. I strongly object to the discrimination in this bill between local governing bodies in metropolitan and country districts. I am afraid, also, that money made available under this bill will, in some cases, be used for election purposes, with the result that many rural districts will, for the time being, become nationalist in their outlook. I have in mind an incident that occurred during the last election at Maitland. Early in the campaign, word went round that the Government intended to spend many thousands of pounds of Commonwealth and State money on water and sewerage schemes, the sum of £200,000 being mentioned. Actually, the State government has not spent the £90,000 which it received from the Commonwealth Government. That proposal was definitely used for electioneering purposes. The Treasurer has told us that the Government does not desire to place any local governing authority in a humiliating position. Yet the bill contains provisions, enabling the Government to determine what works shall qualify for the assistance proposed to be given. This means that the works programme must be in harmony with the policy of this Government.

If the amendment of the honourable member for Cook is rejected, I shall move to substitude the words ""extra metropolitan districts "" for "" rural districts."" I welcome one of two principles of this clause of the bill, but oppose the other. I am entirely antagonistic to the suggested discrimination between the municipalities of the metropolitan area, and the local governing bodies of the .country districts. I have said frequently in this House, that the Commonwealth Government should determine the conditions under which money that it provides shall be spent. The Treasurer has told us that one .of the purposes of the bill is to decentralize public works; but I remind him that all the municipalities and shires of Kew South Wales have had it within their capacity in the last two or three years to put relief works in hand under an £57] arrangement by which the State government -would provide all the money needed for wages and also a portion of the cost of materials. Some local governing bodies have done so much in this way that they have reached their limit, while others have done practically nothing. Only last week one municipality in my own electorate, which taxes its ratepayers to the full extent permitted by the law, and has taken full advantage of the relief works scheme of the State government, was forced to ask the State government to (Corio-Treasurer ) relieve it of its responsibilities for one-third of the unemployed persons that it has been maintaining in relief work. Those men have been displaced and forced to accept the dole. If preference municipalities which, for two or three years, have done their utmost to relieve unemployment. Those local authorities which have not accepted any responsibility for the care of the unemployed should not be given preference. The council to which I have referred is unable to enter the loan market and borrow more money on which interest would have to be paid, but it would welcome a grant of money free of interest. At best it will be only palities and shires, which probably have not done anything to relieve the unemployment situation, and in ordinary cirterest, will get first preference. to cure all the ills of man. It does not cure the trouble referred to by the honourable member. that the Government has not considered all aspects of the situation in New South Wales, for if it had done so, it would have provided for preference being given to those local authorities which have played their part in trying to find work for the unemployed. Does the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) think that rural municipalities and shires should be given preference merely because they are rural bodies? Even among rural local authorities there are some which have done their best for the unemployed, whilst others have not done anything in that direction. Yet the latter will participate in this grant",73,States Grants Local Public Works Bill 1936 Second Reading

My district adjoins his, and I know that the position which he has placed before the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) is-correct. It must be remembered that the workers living in municipalities which have borrowed money at high rates of interest have had their rentals increased as a result. Rates also are high in such municipalities, and, naturally, landlords have passed on the cost to their tenants. The Treasurer should agree to the deletion of this paragraph, because general supervision by the Treasurer is provided for elsewhere. referred to the Water Board, of Sydney, as a big employer of labour, but he should remember that that body can only touch the fringe of the unemployment problem in a city with a population of over 1,000,000. As a matter of fact workers who live in the city proper have been at a great disadvantage for a number of years, because the State government has, at times, provided work of. a relief nature for the unemployed living in the suburbs, and the labour was drawn exclusively from such suburbs, thus preventing those living in the city of Sydney from participating. Portion of my electorate is in the city proper, have had; a particularly difficult time during the last four or five years, because the City Council of Sydney has confined its assistance to its ordinary employees, who have been paid from the ordinary revenues of the council. These workers have been in a much worse position than those living in the suburbs. The Water Board cannot possibly provide work for all the unemployed workers of the metropolitan area. Sydney .City Council live in various electorates. strengthens my case on behalf of the workers residing in places like Pyrmont and Ultimo. the honourable member's electorate have been built. member's interjection reminds me that the homes of a number of my constituents, honourable member for who previously lived at Milson's Point, were demolished in order that the Sydney Harbour Bridge might be constructed, but they were not given work either in the demolition of their homes or in the construction of the bridge. The workers for those jobs were drawn from all parts of the metropolitan area. City dwellers are carrying their share of the burden associated with the granting of assistance to primary producers, and therefore should not be penalized any further. Not only the workers, but also business people in the metropolitan area who depend on them will be affected by the preference The Minister given in this matter to rural districts. I ask the Minister to agree to the deletion of the clause. a.m.] I am not impressed by the arguments of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), because I reflect that, whenever money is made available for public works in country districts, large numbers of men from city areas are engaged on those undertakings. Country municipalities and other bodies in country districts are very short of cash, and find it most difficult to raise the. money needed to enable them to carry out necessary works. Therefore, I prefer and many workers there the clause as it stands. a.m.],-City municipal authorities have better opportunities to borrow for public works than have local governing authorities in the country. Therefore, I maintain that preference should be given to ruralareas. I hope that, in future, workmen will be called up in the country first If necessary, a further call-up can be made in the cities.

HILT,) proposedTliat the word *' rural"", twice occurring, paragraph (e), be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" extrametropolitan "". -Unde r the amendment suggested by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey), there is as much danger of injustice being done to rural districts as there would be if the proposed change were not made. ""Extra-metropolitan"" includes very large towns in the country, which are in a position analogous to that of a number of suburban municipalities. It would be advisable to leave the clause as it stands, for it would then give the government of a State some discretion as to whether a work proposed by a country municipality should have preference over that contemplated in a metropolitan area. "" Extra-metropolitan "" is a term rarely used in statutes, and I fear that it would cover large towns such as Bathurst, which, from a rating point of view, is larger than, say, the municipality of Cottesloe, situated midway between Perth and Fremantle. clause does not state that only works in rural districts shall be brought within the scope of the bill; it merely provides that these works shall have priority over others. I am not particularly concerned as to where the contemplated public works will be carried out, ""but I am anxious to know the conditions of employment and the source from which the labour will be drawn. shortage of labour in any particular part of the country in which work was being carried out, and it was necessary to engage city workers, I am not satisfied that they would be employed under acceptable conditions. No doubt these works will be carried out with sweated labour, and no provision will be made to cover the extra living expenses which a city worker incurs when he accepts a job in a country district. Therefore, members of the Opposition should weigh well any proposal involving the carrying out of works in an outlying part of a State. I hope that an assurance will be given that when labour is drawn from a city area, provision will be made to enable the employees to meet the additional expense which they will have to incur in living in the country while maintaining their homes in the city. The duration of work would not warrant the city worker taking his family to live in a country district. It would be necessary for him to maintain himself on the job, and keep his family in the city, and some assistance should be given to him to enable him to do this. Amendment agreed to. I move That at the end of the clause the following paragraph be inserted:"" [ i ) It shall be a condition precedent to any payment to a State that the legislature of such State shall have provided for the observance by each public authority of such State of the terms of any award of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration which may be applicable to the work carried out by such public authority."". I submit that, in view of what was said by some honourable members during the The second-reading stage of the bill, no injustice can possibly be done to States by the inclusion of the provision which I have moved. The committee has accepted the principle that there shall rest upon the Commonwealth Treasurer the obligation to decide whether or not a particular work is of type for which Commonwealth money should be allocated, and it should also be made clear that Commonwealth money shall not be made available for the prosecution of any work unless the men actually engaged npon that work If there happened to be a are employed at wages, and under conditions, laid down by Arbitration Court awards for the State.

I support the amendment moved by the contends that the laws of the country Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin). It is on the lines of one I forecast in my second-reading speech. In safeguarding the interest on borrowed money, we are also protecting those who loan money.

When money is made available for this purpose, we have a right to ask that the Government will adhere to its policy. Moreover, State governments which believe in the' payment of award rates should not object to the amendment. At Maitland, the Premier of New South Wales, the Minister for Industry, and the honourable member who won the seat from Labour at the previous election, definitely stated that the Government would pay award rates on the sewerage work then to be undertaken ih the Maitland district. That promise was honoured immediately after the election, but later the work was carried on by men who received only sufficient to provide them with sustenance. The amendment, which embraces the. policy of this Government, the New South Wales Government and the Labour party, should be The money to be accepted.

425,Mr Garden (Cook) [2.15 A.m.],"should be observed, but when we attempt to amend a measure to ensure that the workers shall derive the benefits provided in existing legislation it always refuses to assist. The Government has always insisted that it should not interfere with the awards of the Arbitration Courts, but when the workers are to benefit it says that their interests will be protected by some other authority. In this instance, it proposes to allow the States to do just as they like. The States, which are to comply with certain conditions, should also be compelled to ensure that reasonable wages are paid. In this instance, we are not suggesting something new, but are merely asking that the laws which already exist, shall be observed. If the Government believes in the arbitration system it. should ensure that the workers receive award rates of pay. Manufacturers, primary producers, and other sections of the community are always protected, but the claims of the workers are completely ignored. When the Leader of the Labour party in New South Wales said that interest rates should be reduced, this Government and its supporters held up their hands in holy horror, and said that interest rates were sacrosanct. So are the interests of the workers. I trust that the Government will accept the amendment, and thus ensure the payment of adequate wages by those bodies which are to benefit from the expenditure of the money appropriated under this bill. -The manner in which anti-Labour governments demonstrate their inconsistency is remarkable. This Government has always insisted that the workers should observe the conditions imposed by the Arbitration Court, yet when protecting certain sections of the community it definitely declines to prevent labour from being engaged at rates of pay lower than those awarded by the Arbitration Court. This amendment gives the Government an opportunity to demonstrate that it believes in the law being observed. This is not the only instance of unwillingness, on the part of the Government, to observe the law which it imposes on citizens. I , therefore, support the amendment moved by tbe Leader of the Opposition, which provides that award rates and conditions shall be observed on all works carried out with money that is made available under this bill. The committee should take advantage of this opportunity to insist on the observance of this principle. No reasonable argument can be advanced by members of the Ministry or their supporters against the amendment. That the question be now put. of the committee. Ring the bells.

433,Mr Curtin (Fremantle) [2.35 A.m.]. Realized That Industry Generally Depend.,"important subject that I introduced, and the failure of the Government to include in the bill a provision to protect the workers ia inexcusable. Our endeavour was simply to ensure that the minimum standards fixed by the appropriate arbitration tribunals of Australia should bo applied to the various -works put in hand pursuant to this measure. It was a particularly culpable error to omit such a provision from a bill which was envisaged mainly to stimulate employment. It was pointed out during the discussion of the measure that certain municipalities which desired to put public works in hand were unable to provide the debt services incidental to the capital requisite to carry out the works. In such circumstances, surely the Commonwealth Government, with all its taxing resources, should have had sufficient regard for the welfare of the workers to protect their interests, for they, after all, will be obliged to provide a Makin, N . J. 0. substantial proportion of the money needed to meet interest and sinking fund commitments on any loans that are raised. They pay heavy toll in excise duty on beer, and certain other commodities in common use, and it was not unreasonable to ask that their interests on the other side of the ledger should be considered. We ought to have insisted that the men engaged on the works should be guaranteed, not only payment of their wages,. but also a reasonable standard of wages. By that I mean, not necessarily the wages asked for by the trade unions, but those fixed by the Arbitration Court, and based on the merits of the claim. The absence of such a provision makes the bill inadequate, in that it does not treat the problem fairly.

If so, will he bring this matter before the Cabinet, with a view to (a) raising the amount of service pensions to at least the New Zealand standard, and (6) extending the benefit of service pensions to South African veterans ? honourable member's questions are as 'follows:1. In comparing the maximum amount of the allowance paid to veterans in New Zealand with the maximum rate of pension paid to service pensioners in Australia, it is necessary to bear in mind features of the respective legislation apart from the actual rates pay>able. 'It is true 'that the maximum rate payable in New Zealand is slightly higher than the maximum rate paid in Australia; but, as against this, it must be remembered that the total allowed income from all sources is slightly higher in Australia than in New Zealand. In addition, New Zealand pays only one class of pension, viz., to men who are permanently unemployable-whils t in Australia pensions arc paid to three classes, viz., men over 00 years of age, men who are permanently unemployable, and men who are suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. Australia also provides free hospital and medical treatment to the last class of service pensionera privilege which is not extended under the New Zealand Act. Pensions to dependants in New Zealand are subject to greater restrictions as to eligibility than is the case under the Australian act. 2. (a) The Government had the benefit of perusing the New Zealand act when framing its legislation on the subject, and is satisfied that, taken as a whole, the service pension provisions are wider in scope and more generous in their incidence than are the provisions of the New Zealand act. (6) Extending service pension benefits to South African veterans was considered by the Government at the time the Repatriation Act was before the House in December last, and upon several occasions since then. The Government, however, was unable to see its way to extend the provisions of the act to include veterans of the South African War. representing the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice1.
