His Majesty's Australian ship under your, command my appreciation of the way in which this duty was carried out. 2. The interception of the ship and the subseGovernment is in consultation with the quent embarkation of the personnel and stores, and their final disposal was. carried out in a most able and seamanlike manner which reflects great credit on all hands. 3. Subsequent to this, HMAS. Stuart has again shown her mettle in the way in which she brought help ""to the S.S. Troeas. In the weather conditions prevailing, this operation called for particular seamanlike judgment and it was' carried through with a determination for which there can be nothing but praise -' 4. I ' a m very i glad to have the Australian destroyers under my command, and these two incidents have shown, how ready they are to seize any situation and cheerfully carry it through to a successful conclusion. a.

Further, can he say whether these pits are worked by federation labour, and whether it is a'fact; as reported in to-day's press, that production at these mines is to be substantially increased ? moment, to supply the information contained in the first part of the honourable member's question.

I then promised I would have inquiries made into the Admiral. matter. I now desire to inform the honourable member that the form used in recording particulars concerning special peace officers includes provision' for a statement by them as to their religion. This follows the practice which prevails in most, if not all, of the States in connection with the engagement of members of police forces. The form is identical with the form that was in use in New South Wales when the first appointments of peace officers were made in 1925. It has continued ever since. There is ho discrimination against any religious denomination. I notice that the form for enlistment of members of-the Australian Imperial Force contains provision enabling any person who has conscientious objections to stating his religion to decline to do so.

Further, can he say why, having regard to the purport, and particularly the spirit, of section 116, any citizen of Australia should be asked, other than for statistical purposes, a question which conflicts with that section, and how it is that any candidate for employment, or any person whose services are sought for salary by the Commonwealth Government, shall have to indicate his religion ? honourable member at length would he to occupy too much time, and, therefore, I shall endeavour to deal with-the matter shortly.

As to the question asked of applicants, I remind the honourable gentleman that lie and I have been members of this assembly for some years, and that although this practice has heen going on all the time it has left him with an untroubled mind until this morning. The right honourable gentleman struck a similar question off the form of application for employment with Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited when I directed attention to it. usual in this procedure. Similar information-was demanded of every soldier during .the last war, and -that practice still obtains. Moreover, I understand that similar information is demanded of every police officer throughout the Commonwealth, although I am informed that in New South ""Wales there has been a modification, in that, although the question is not. now included on the application form itself, the information is supplied on the back of the form.

EMPIRE AIRTRAINING . SCHEME. for Air) -by leave-In response to the request made to.me yesterday by the honourable member for Wannon( Mr set up a vast training organization, which Scholfield),I have pleasure in making -this statement. A great deal of what I shall say has already been said by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) or imyself, but as there seems to be a great deal of misunderstanding about the undertaking, and ;as a number of points have not been"" emphasized to any degree, I think an elaboration of what has been said is justified. Honourable members will recollect that, -towards the end of September last year, the Prime Minister announced that it had been proposed that the Dominions of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand should co-operate with the ""United Kingdom in a scheme for training pilots, observers, and air gunners on a scale never before contemplated. I was sent to Ottawa with air force and finance advisers to discuss the proposal with representatives of the other three governments. Upon our arrival in Ottawa, Lord Riverdale, the leader of the mission from the United Kingdom, outlined the need for this great air training scheme and the lines upon which it should be organized. He explained that, in spite of the tremendous expansion of the Royal Air Force and of the efficiency of its personnel and aircraft, it was considered by the Allied leaders that, if an end were to be put to German aggression, it %vould be necessary to develop an air force on a scale that would not.only match the Ger; man aircraft numerically, hut also have such a superiority as would give the Allies a command of the air comparable to their command of the sea. It had been calculated that British and French aircraft production, plus the production of the United States of America, which would be available to the Allies, could produce sufficient aircraft, for this purpose. He went on to explain, however, that owing to the definite limits imposed by the size of the British Isles and the handicaps inseparable for haying to carry on .offensive and defensive operations in the air, it would'not be-possible to train, in the United. Kingdom, sufficient, air crews to man such. an aerial armada. .So it was suggested that., the three dominions, with their unlimited spaces, .ideal climatic conditions, and freedom from the handicaps imposed by air operations against a powerful enemy, should would supply rather more than half of the air crews that would be necessary. . . The original proposal .was? that thp dominions, in approximate proportions to their populations, should each set up training establishments to carry out the elementary training of their quotas, and that the more advanced intermediate and service training should be completed in a vast organization to be set up in Canada. It was at once agreed that each dominion should undertake its share, and the details of the necessary organization wer« then discussed. Australia's share in this original proposal was to establish nine elementary training schools for pilots, and a corresponding number of schools for observers and air gunners, who would complete their training in nine schools. A corresponding number of observer iand air gunner schools was to be established in Canada. While the mission from the United Kingdom was outlining the original proposal, I noticed that the aircraft to be used for the advanced training in Canada",16,Wages And Conditions
44,Sir Frederick Stewart,I,17,Wages And Conditions
45,Mr Fairbairn (Flinders,"^Ministerwere all to be supplied from the United ""Kingdom with the exception of one American type, which we happened to be manufacturing in Australia. I was surprised, as I had imagined the main -reason for concentrating the advanced training in Canada was that dominion's proximity to the aircraft factories of the' United States of America. I thereupon made a counter proposal. After a good deal of consideration and consultation with the Government, I proposed that, as the aircraft were all either to be sent from the United Kingdom or to be produced here, Australia might ""undertake seven-ninths of the advanced 'training with this country. This counter proposal, which was finally agreed upon, was, in several directions, a considerable improvement on the original proposal. The organization originally proposed might well have proved beyond the capacity of Canada, whereas the alteration has reduced it to manageable proportions, though it will still impose a tremendous -strain upon our sister dominion. ' The alteration will also effect a great .reduction of the dollar exchange. Under the original scheme, it would have been .'necessary to find, in-the first three years, revised scheme is ' that it will cost £51,000,000 worth of ^Canadian dollars, which would have meant incurring a -considerable debt in dollars and almost certainly most drastic reduction of our imports from Canada, thus causing great loss to the exporters of that dominion and '[considerable hardship to Australian industries and individuals requiring Canadian goods. ' Under the revised proposal it will only be necessary to find, in the first three years, £11,000,000 worth of Canadian dollars. In other words, the variation has effected a saving of approximately £40,000,000 worth of dollar exchange. Another point of very considerable 'importance to us is that, under the present scheme, we shall have concentrated in 'Australia more than 1,200 service aircraft with a very great striking capacity, in addition to our nineteen active service squadrons. Fecurity value of this force, I point out that 1,200 service aircraft are considerably more than double the number of seaborne aircraft of any navy in the world. So when we take into Mr Fairhmrn. consideration that only seaborne aircraft can come against us and are at a very considerable disadvantage when opposed to land based aircraft, it can be realized what a tremendous addition to local security the aircraft to be used in this training .scheme will give to the Commonwealth. These 1,200 aircraft, added to our existing squadrons, will give us a superiority of three to one over the aircraft carried by any navy in the world. be taken to any field? for service here, but would be available against any force that may attack the Commonwealth. strength a strength of-numbers or of striking force?"" of numbers. Its striking force would probably be very much greater, for aircraft which can: be -carried upon, and catapulted from, ships at sea are, generally speaking, considerably lighter types than the aircraft that will be used in connection with this scheme. Another not inconsiderable merit of the Australia more than £4,000,000 less than the scheme originally proposed, and that more than £30,000,000 which would have had to be spent abroad will be spent in and circulated throughout Australia, thus increasing our capacity to bear the financial burden of our war effort. Two questions will naturally arise in the minds of. members from the foregoing observations. First, why is training in Australia so much less costly than in Canada, and, secondly, if so much less costly, why are Ave not completing all of our training within the Commonwealth? The answer to the first question is that in Canada the great majority of the landing grounds will have to be prepared at an estimated average cost of about £50,000 each, whereas in Australia we already have more adequate landing grounds than will be required. Owing to To illustrate the climatic conditions, hangars and buildings will also have to be built on much more expensive lines in Canada. Hangars theTe. for instance, have to be centrally heated and' fitted with mechanically operated doors that can open and close very rapidly",17,Wages And Conditions

49,Mr Fairbairn,"It is a strengtheo as to minimize tbe intake of intense cold every time an aircraft is taken out Or brought in. Another additional cos.t is the necessity for the continual rolling of the snow during the winter to keep the landing areas consolidated. Let me add, by way of re-assurance, that apart from the cold adding to the cost for these reasons, winter flying conditions in Canada are very good. I make that remark because some people have certain misgivings about winter flying conditions in Canada. The fact is that, though the cold is intense during the winter in Canada, the weather, is crystal clear and very good indeed for flying. The reason why there is a definite limit to the amount of training we can do in Australia is that our supply of fitters is inadequate. great problems. Canada, however, has the great advantage of heing able to draw on. a vast reservoir of man-power from across its border in the United States. the Minister to justify his statement that there is a shortage of fitters in Austral i.a? honourable member that up to date we are receiving very few. applications from fully trained fitters, owing to the expansion of the aircraft industry in this country, and to other industrial expansion in connection with which the services of trained fitters are required. the Government is not offering decent wages. would be advisable to allow myself to be drawn off onthat point. I simply pause to observe that the wages offered by the Royal Australian Air Force have been calculated upon the wages paid in industry. Tho arrangement for sharing the cost of the scheme among the four governments is as follows:-Each dominion is to bear the cost of training its own quota of personnel, except that the United Kingdom is to make a very substantial contribution of aircraft and equipment to be used for training purposes. The estimated value of the aircraft and equipment to be supplied by the United Kingdom is £77,000,000. ' After the completion of training, the Government of the United Kingdom is to bear all cost of paying, equipping and maintaining the .personnel and squadrons, even to the 'extent of paying their pensions, though where the pay and pension rates of a dominion exceed those paid in the Royal Air Force, the particular dominion is to make up the deficiency. The cost to the Government of the United Kingdom of maintaining the squadrons that will be manned and reinforced by dominions' personnel trained under the scheme, will be £300,000,000 sterling per annum. The cost to the Commonwealth of the air training scheme for the first three years is calculated to be £54,890,000. Government meet those costs wherever tbe That will be one of our operations are being conducted? ment of the United Kingdom is bearing the complete cost except in respect to any expense.that may be involved in makevidence has ing up a ""higher rate of pay that may apply in a particular dominion. In such a case, the dominion concerned will be at liberty to increase the pay of the men. The Government of the United ;Kin^dom has even undertaken to pay pensions at the rate applicable to the Royal Air Force. If a pension scheme in operation in any particular dominion is more liberal than that applicable to the Royal Air Force personnel, the dominion concerned will be required to make up the difference if it considers .it desirable to do so. I do not think it Although all personnel,' on completion uf training, are to serve in RoyalA ir Force squadrons, every .effort is to be made to maintain their dominion identity. Australian personnel"" will remain members of the Royal Australian Air .Force during the whole of their service, and will wear the Australian uniform. They will also be grouped into squadrons, which will bear the name of Australia. For instance, a. squadron would be called No. 1001 Australian (Bomber) Squadron. It is planned to exehange Australian regular officers with Royal Air Force officers to enable' them to obtain experience of active service flying prior to the arrival of Australian trainees at the theatre of war, so ""that these officers, with the experience thug gained, may command the",18,Wages And Conditions

On being enrolled, air crew trainees will -be selected for training as pilots, observers or air gunners and will undergo their training as airmen. On completion of their training 50 per .cent, of pilots and observers will receive commissions and the remaining 50 per cent, will have the rank of sergeant. Air gunners, on completion of training, will serve as aircraftsmen, or. leading aircraftsmen, ""according to h6w they pass out'of their course, except for approximately 10 per ..cent., who will be granted commissions."" ! Apropos of air gunners, I should like to correct any erroneous impression that the air gunner is a comparatively unimportant member of an air crew. It is 'true that the air gunnerdoes not need quite such a high standard of education 1 as a pilot or observer, as he does not have to master the intricacies of navigation; but, as the war progresses, more and more importance is being placed on getting fighting men of the right type to fill positions as air gunners. Often the safe return of a formation of bombers is due even more to the skill and courage of the air gunners in fighting off the enemy than to the skill of the pilots and observers Conditions of service are' contained in pamphlets which I have circulated to honourable members and which are being circulated throughout the Commonwealth. I should be pleased at any time to discuss with honourable members points which may not be clear to them in these pamphlets. The two immediately urgent problems 'which have to be overcome, and in the overcoming of which all honourable members of this House may be able to help by explaining the true position as widely Mr Faiirbairn. as possible, are the need for young men with some mechanical experience to come forward and be trained as fitters, and to persuade men who. wish to .serve as air crew, members to possess themselves in patience until .such time as it is 'possible to call them up for training. The fitter -position is particularly urgent, as there are 'not sufficient trained fitters available in the Commonwealth to fill the requirements of the air. training scheme. If sufficient men with some mechanical knowledge are not forthcoming rapidly to be trained, it will not be possible to carry through theprogramme. Possibly many suitable young men are holding back because they do not feel that serving as ground personnel is a sufficiently combatant occupationto justify their giving up their civil employment. To them it should be explained that no war service can be more valuable than service as a fitter, because, if thefitters are not forthcoming, it will not be possible for the air crew personnel' to he trained. Here is awonderful opportunity for young men to perform'valuable war service for their country and at the same time receive training which will be invaluable for them in the post-war years. Already more than 2,00.0 men are in training as fitters iu engineering and technical schools at Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. Other schools are shortly to be opened in other State capitals. Men of a splendid type are at present in training in the schools, hut I cannot exaggerate the importance and urgency of obtaining many more of this type promptly to fill the schools to capacity. With regard to air crews, the problem is rather the reverse to the fitter problem, but it is equally important. Here the problem is to persuade men who have the qualifications and the inclination to serve as air erews to be patient until such time as it is possible for them to be taken in for training. If we could take all who wished to serve into training, immediately, I have no doubt that we could get the 30,000 men who will be required during the first three years of the scheme to come forward within a few weeks; but. owing to the fact that there is already a waiting list of more than 2,500 who have been selected, and another list of some thousands awaiting selection, many are apt to become so impatient and disheartened by the delay that they enlist to serve in some other capacity. If some thousands should do this the result will be disastrous, as the 30,000 men needed io undergo training within three years must approach the Commonwealth's capacity of young men who have both the qualifications and the inclination to serve as air crew, and there may well be difficulty later in getting a sufficient number of men of the type required* soma of them have to take other service because they are unemployed to a certain degree that may be so. Although a waiting list of 2,500 seems formidable at present when, only 380 are to commence training during May, the intake will increase every two months as new schools are ' established, according to programme^ until the full capacity of the organization is developed. The intake will then be 1,148 every four weeks.. It will be realized how necessary a big waiting list will be later on to provide for such colossal; requirements. I am not so much worried .about those jvhp.,.jhave already been; selected and are on the. waiting list, because waiting is never so bad when one. knows that one is definitely, to be called up and knows the date,, as I . am about those who are waiting .to he interviewed and examined. Everything possible is being done to expedite the interviewing and medical examining of candidates, but it is a most complicated business. Interviewing candidates, deciding on their general Suitability and their particular suitability to serve as pilots, observers or air gunners, and the complicated medical, dental, and optical examination take more than an hour. with those who have to undergo this ordeal of waiting and. uncertainty, Well remembering my own concern and impatience when I had to wait only a few weeks 'to be called up for training in the flying corps during the last war. I express appreciation of the way in which honourable members on both sides liave refrained from carping criti: cism' of our recruiting officer's, who are 'straining everynerve and working long hours and Saturdays and Sundays to overcome the difficulties. I should also appreciate very much anything that hoii6rable members can do to explain the difficulties to prospective candidates and the importance of patience* Into 'this (bald, dry statement of fact I enf Use the spirit of the Empire air training scheriie by quoting an extract from' a remarkable speech made at the"" Opening' 6f thd Royal Canadian Air Force recruiting campaign by Air-Marshal Bishop, V.C., the famous Canadian fighter pilot of the last War, who by shooting down between 70 and 80 German aircraft proved himself I realize that one of the greatest individual fighters iri history.

If not, why not? propriate action has been taken to ensure that ample supplies of aluminium and other products neeessary for the fabrication of aircraft will be available in Australia, having regard, of course, to the fact every State where technical schools have that there is a world shortage of 'iluminium. for Air apparently failed to appreciate the point of the question that I addressed to him earlier this morning, I mention for his information that I have received a letter from a garage proprietor in Lismore. New South Wales, who employsseventeen men, of whom ten have enlisted for service in the Royal Australian Air Force and seven are being called up for compulsory service with the Militia, and will join infantry battalions. My informant states that the latter men are taking courses in engineering subjects at a technical college. In view of the statement by the Minister regarding the shortage of fitters and others with engineering knowledge, is it not incumbent on the Government to see that the technical training of these young men is not interrupted ?

104,Mr Beasley (Iwest Sydney,"Leade rdecided in 1931 to convert Government loans at a lower rate of interest, the belief was held, and rightly so I believe, that this action should be taken because the Government was not in a position to pay the higher rates of interest, and this notwithstanding the terms upon which the loans had been issued in the first place. The position is worse now than it was then. At that time our difficulties were economic only; now the country is fighting for its life. Therefore, I cannot aecept the statement of the Treasurer that it would amount to repudiation to depart from the terms of the prospectus issued at the time of the loan conversion. These bondholders should be required to pay tax at the same rate as every' body else. In any case it will not be long forced into this position by tlie demands of other classes of taxpayers who are taxed at the full rate. Those who draw income from Government bonds do not run the same risks as those whose money is invested in business and commercial undertakings. edged securities, and those who hold them run no risk so long as the system' of government remains unaltered.. Those who invest their money in ordinary commercial undertakings, however, may have the value of their investment depreciated, or even wiped out altogether, by changes of public taste, business competition or international disturbances. Section 45 of the Income states that, where a company has paid a proportion of its dividend out of bond interest, this proportion shall be taxed at no more than the 1930 rate. This seems to me to be an extraordinary concession, and I ask the Treasurer whether it is proposed to allow it to continue. Banks and insurance companies are large investors in government loans, and a considerable proportion of their dividends, are, therefore, paid out of bond interest, so that those dividends will be taxed at a lower rate than income derived from other sources. I can see no reason why interest derived from these Government bonds should be treated differently from that derived from mortgages, loans and other investments. Even if the argument of contract is advanced in respect of interest on bonds, Mr Beasley. it could equally be advanced in respect of mortgages contracted at the time. In both instances the transaction represents a contract, although in one instance the contract may-he with the Government, and in the other instance it may be with private citizens. vital distinction. contracts,whoever the partiesto them may be. reason why one contract should be more sacred than another.'

The Government has taken no steps to see that thab is done. It apparently intends to leave interest payable on £500,000,000 of investments entirely apart from interest derived from other sources. In these circumstances the Treasurer will have the greatest difficulty in justifying the increases provided fori n various taxation measures which -will be discussed at a later stage, and in convincing the wage earners, who will be called upon to pay a large proportion of the increased taxation through indirect channels, that the Government's proposals are equitable.

I contend that my argument is sustained because it is just a matter of the groups with whom you are dealing. If it is a question of a financial arrangement, then it is repudiation, but if it is a question of the economic welfare of people, such as its own servants, then it is an entirely different matter. Mr .SPENDER -It all depends on the terms of the contract. if the circumstances of the country are such that the conditions under which we live are no longer practicable, right, or just, it is no longer right or just to continue those conditions. If we reach the stage within the next few months that we are unable to deal with all of the matters at our disposal without making further inroads on our financial resources, will the Minister then say to the enemy, "" We are not in a position to resist your aggression. We have not the means to do so, because we have u lot of contracts which we have entered into with bondholders and we cannot repudiate them "" ? honourable member suggest? securities and bonds should be called upon to pay the same increases of taxation as nil other taxpayers have to pay.

Its attitude is even less understandable after the remarks of the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) last . night, when he appealed for equality of sacrifice in facing the difficulty now encountered by our country, which is directing every nerve to a development of its war strength. When appeals are being made for sacrifices by the seriousness of the present position, how can the Treasurer justify the exemption of this class of investor ?

No doubt the Treasurer has opportunities to meet the poorer classes of the community and I do not claim to understand their position better than he does; but my constituents include many of the poorer people. Hundreds of them visit me almost -weekly in order to secure assistance. It would be impossible for me to convince them that there is justice in the arguments of the Treasurer. It would be equivalent to telling them that I would rise in my place in this House and give the investors an open order for all sorts of privileges, such as the tax exemption which the Government now proposes to grant. Eveni f the Treasurer cannot understand my line of argument and can see legal objections to the terms which I have used, it must be obvious to him that psychologically it would be a bad move to grant tax exemptions to a particular section of the investing public. The Government would never be able to justify its action to the people who have to struggle to secure the bare necessaries of life. Sitting suspended from 12.48 to 2.15 p.m: surer) [2.15] -in reply-In concluding the debate my first observation is that the the official view of Labour, because I fear comments which have come from the Opposition benches have, with few exceptions, revealed an extraordinary diverto occupy the treasury bench in a time sity of views and complete barrenness of ideas regarding the financial problems confronting Australia. I should like to know-althoug h I doubt that I shall be told-wha t is the official view of Labour? with the honourable member is that he hag I invite the members of tlie Labour Opposition who have spoken on the financial statement, to compare their remarks, and to attempt, by some process of mental legerdemain, to reconcile them. The paucity of the criticism which has come from the Opposition benches is a clear indication that the financial policy of the and also by the Leader of the Opposition Government cannot be severely criticized. varying degrees; some of it is not worth anything, whereas criticism like portions of that of the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), are valuable. I suggest that most of the criticism of the Government's policy by honourable members opposite comes within the first category. Both the right honourable member for Yarra and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) recognize, however, that the problem to be solved is how to raise £70,000,000. It was conceded by the Opposition Leader that that sum had to be raised by loans and taxes, but there was not one word from him or the right honourable member for Yarra to suggest that, at this stage, further credit should be injected into the community. The obvious reason for that is that both men have a sense of their responsibility. But other Opposition members spoke differently. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) said that a limit could not be placed on the expansion of credit. If I were to attempt to express my conception of the honourable gentleman's ideas I should say that, in his view, the limit is the skv. The gentleman with the prophetic political name, who represents the district of Corio, also spoke. As I see it, his way to solve the financial problem is to expand until we burst, tax until we burst, and after that, the deluge. That seems to be not an unfair commentary on the views expressed by the honourable member for Corio( Mr Dedman). I sincerely hope that he did not present for the future of this country if , by mischance, the Labour Opposition were of crisis and gave effect to the views expounded by him. been to Hogan's Crossing. tleman from Corio has imbibed at the wrong well.

I again invite honourable members opposite r,o try to reconcile the views expressed by the honourable member for Corio, who, I assume, speaks with some authority for the Labour party, with the remarks of the right honourable member for Yarra. It may be assumed that the right honourable member for Yarra was chosen to lead die Opposition's attack on the proposals of tbe Government; because of his considern hie experience in financial matters; and it may also be assumed, I suggest, that the financial statement was subjected to the most minute scrutiny before he spoke on behalf of his party. What has emerged f rom the discussion ? No honourable member opposite has denied the need to impose further taxes. Neither the right honourable member for Yarra nor the Leader of the Opposition denied the need to impose indirect, as well as direct, taxes, except insofar as the latter was sufficiently definite in his financial ideas as to suggest that all income above £5,000 -should be taken by the Government. It is generally agreed that a sound principle of taxation is that there shall be no discrimination between classes, and that the burden shall be in proportion to the ability to bear it. Yet the Leader of the Opposition said that all income in excess of £5,000 per annum should be taken by the Government as one means of idialing with the financial problems of this country. to confiscation. honourable members opposite advocated repudiation. Had the Leader of the Opposition taken the trouble to ascertain what would be the yield from the implementing of that policy, he would have 'earned that the total income in these groups would be only £12,000,000 after the States had taken their share. Of this only £4,000,000 to £5,000,000 would be in excess of £5,000, and it is only this residue which would be available to the Commonwealth under the plan suggested. unemployment. ->pposite, who continually profess to be desirous of maintaining employment in this country, should realize that that result cannot be achieved if the financial system be broken. Notwithstanding that the Government is faced with a task of tremendous magnitude in financing both the claims of peace and the needs of war, it has succeeded in not only maintaining, but also increasing, employment. Since August last 80,000 additional workers have found employment in Australia. Moreover, despite rising expenditure, it has maintained the f u ll programme of works, both governmental and semi governmental, for this year in all of the States, and has reduced substantially the burden on the community by reducing interest rates. These matters are not referred to because for them at least the Government is entitled to credit. BeforeI dissect the views expressed by the right honourable member for YarraI shall deal with those of the leader of the other Labour party in this House. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) devoted well over 40 minutes to one theme. I assume it to be the only theme upon which he considered that the Government could reasonably be criticized. He said that there is £500,000,000 of loans which is free from taxation over and above the 1930 level. My first comment in respect of that is that the position arose out of the conversion operation effected by the Scullin Administration, for which I give all credit to the right honourable member for Yarra. It has been of tremendous value to this country, having resulted in the saving of millions of pounds to the national exchequer. Bondholders were asked to convert holdings carrying a certain rate of interest, into new bonds carrying a lower rate of interest, a quid pro quo being protection from increase of taxation beyond the 1930 level. tions justify the alteration of that position! in good time.

The right honourable gentleman dealt first' with the profits of the trading banks. There is a marked tendency on. the part of some honourable members opposite to refer, on every conceivable occasion, to the report of the Royal Commission onBanking, and Monetary Reform, and, in particular, to paragraph 504, which seems to be the-only one that some of them have read.. gentlemen opposite have done so, and I assume that they represent the views of the.

The object of the Commonwealth Bank at present is to expand credit, through the trading banks, to the trading community, but if , at the same time, the trading banks were compelled to deposit a certain proportion of their assets with the Commonwealth Bank the attempt to expand credit would be neutralized to that extent. It may be taken for granted that this Government is as much concerned about our financial structure as the honourable members, of the Opposition pretend to be. The! Government is watching the whole situation' very carefully, and.if it thought that an undue use was being made of the credit being made available to the trading banks, it would not hesitate to interfere. Until that time arrives, it will seek to obtain the maximum benefit from the expanded credit.

Referring to London funds, the right honourable .member for Yarra said that the Government was not yet facing the problem. was said ;about it in the Treasurer's financial statement. t he right honourable member's remarks was that the Government was not facing the position. A reference to the financial Statement will reveal that it was pointed out that since the outbreak of the war there had been a substantial increase of imports, and that there had also been a measure of control of those from nonsterling countries. It was made perfectly clear, too, that the volume of those imports was such as to indicate the need for further restrictions years before the war? years the average annual value of the be assumed 'that we have now reached a imports to this country has"" been situation when it -should not be done ? £96,000,000. In the depression period, to which the right honourable member for Yarra referred, our imports reached a value of £140,000,000 in one; year. The increased value of the imports into this country during the last six months has been due in the main to fortuitous circumstances. It is true that prior to that time our trade balance was being adversely affected, but surely no responsible person would suggest that because of an adverse balance over a period of two or three years due to seasonal or temporary factors the Government should adopt an increasingly drastic .policy of restriction. If that course were adopted serious difficulties would fall upon certain classes of the community, particularly employees. What is necessary, of course, to enable moneys to be paid from any London funds to meet overseas commitments is not only tlie building up of such overseas funds, involving any necesr sary restriction of imports, but also resort to taxation or .borrowing"", within this: country. ' The Government is watching the whole situation very carefully, and will take such action as it deems -necessary to preserve our stability. No one can deny that our present financial action is advisable at the moment in respect of imports. If any such drastic action were taken many people would be plunged into unemployment It is becoming increasingly difficult to correct an adverse balance of trade by even drastic restriction of consumable goods. Further, it is commonly recognized that a considerable volume of .our goods imported is required for the development of our industries. Nevertheless, the Government is doing its utmost, bearing all the facts in mind, to restrict imports from nonsterling countries. That must surely be apparent to all honourable members.

211,Mr Spender,"Apparently ' it is toreference to action now. the right honourable gentleman was referring to two years ago. Let me point out to him the exact position. There was a fall-of our London funds from £89,000,000 in June, 1937, to £55,000,000 in June, 1939. That fall was due to the fact that our London funds were being used for the purpose for which such reserves are intended, owing to temporary circumstances, mainly a reduction of the export value of our wool and primary production generally and a fall in wool production in the season 1938-39. If it is urged that every time the prices or volume of wool and wheat fall the Government should proceed to restrict imports correspondingly [ say frankly that I am not prepared to adopt such a policy. The results of the operations of the last two years have, as I have pointed out, been due to temporary factors. It would be a hopeless procedure to restrict imports whenever a temporary fall of the price of our export commodities occurred. It is perfectly clear, also, that the extraordinary increase of the value of imports since the outbreak of the war is due substantially to' the action of people who are endeavouring to stock up for the years ahead, so that they may-Jbe able to maintain their industries if it becomes more difficult to secure supplies. have prevented the speculators from stocking up. word "" speculators"". There is no evidence of speculation. All of the evidence points rather to prudent business management. The control of prices' is, moreover, adequately provided for. Because imports have increased substantially since the outbreak of wara fact which the Government has admitted-the right honourable member blames the policy of two years ago. What matters now is the policy of to-day. The Government is fully seized of the problem before it, and the country may rest assured that it will -deal with that problem as urgently as circumstances demand. I indicated in the financial statement that it would become :more and more urgent to restrict the goods coming from sterling countries, but that raises a problem which is not capable of easy solution. to be built up unless, by restricting iin-:. ports from sterling countries? that we shall probably be forced to do that, but we cannot restrict in the drastic way which the right honourable gentleman suggests. not meet the position that now exists. 1 shall come later to the question of our immediate overseas requirements. It is the ultimate satisfaction of these requirements which has relation to the state of the London funds. No one would suggest that by any form of restriction of imports we could meet our needs from London funds at present. The right honourable member for Yarra invited me to say what we are doing in the meantime. I direct his attention to the various controls which I mentioned in the financial statement-contro l of the overseas position and the prevention of capital from fleeing the country. We have kept capital locked in Australia. We are restricting, .imports from non-sterling countries, not in any drastic way which would unnecessarily reflect itself in employment, but, as any sensible government, would do, by adjusting the restrictions to meet the circumstances of the country. One can readily understand the difficulties that will be heaped on Great Britain by having its export trade cut down, but we may be forced shortly to restrict substantially imports from sterling countries. In the meantime we are arranging to borrow overseas. How otherwise can we finance our overseas obligations except at the expense of employment in this country ? left it too late. gentleman's interjection is a good example of the fallacy of reasoning backwards. restriction of imports could be counterbalanced by credit expansion in this country.",37,Financial Statement

I point to the liquidity of the trading banks as reflecting the benefit of this Government's financial policy. [Leave to continue given.] The liquidity of trading banks and the resultant increase of employment, are to the credit of this Government. When the war broke out, the Government was faced with a recession of employment, and diminishing liquidity of the banks. The policy that the Government has applied since the war has resulted in the liquidity of the banks heing higher than at any other time for many years. If one looks at the ratio of advances to deposits and at the composition [20] of the deposits, it will -be found that this country is, by virtue of the Government's policy, in the best possible position to develop industry during the war, and at the same time to expand our war effort.

I summed up his policy as "" expand till you burst, tax till you burst, and after that the deluge"".

I impress upon the party opposite that, if any regard is to' be had for the working man, his employment and conditions, the worse possible thing to do would be to inflate.

With one exception, no honourable member of the Opposition offered any suggestion as to how otherwise we are to raise the additional £20,000,000 that is required. They know that if they themselves had to go into the minutiae of raising more revenue they could not avoid imposing indirect taxes.

We must have regard to the burden already carried and its proportion to the exrtira burden being imposed. Nobody with a sense of fairness, who was' not seeking merely to make political capital out of this financial statement, could say less than that it is designed to protect industry and employment, to relieve the family man, and to throw the burden on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. I submit that the Government has done that with great courage. skipped over unemployment. I shall return to that subject. When the Avar broke out, employment was diminishing. tremendously increased expenditure and added problems. I suggest that two factors have directly contributed to our success in dealing with the heavy problem of financing our war expenditure whilst at the same time assisting industry and providing employment. One. is that tlie Government has adopted a liberal financial policy by using central bank credit to the extent advisable, and the other is that it has deliberately set out on a policy of reducing interest rates. The result of this policy is that employment is now greater than it had been since last August. The net increase of the number of men employed throughout the Commonwealth is, as I have already remarked, 80,000, or about 4 per cent, of our working population. When we are asked where this improvement is to be seen, I point out that it is to be found in the official statistical records. Whilst avoiding inflation on the one hand and on the other using central bank action within safe limits, the Government has shown a determination to pursue a policy directed to assist the working man and the family man, and to impose the burden of taxation on those shoulders which are broad enough to bear it:' mous additional expenditure in connection with the war, and the large number of men absorbed from the labour marcritics say that the man ket for defence purposes, what is left of the Government's so-called achievement in having put more men to work ? elaborate my argument in respect of the subject-matter of the interjection""T would willingly do so. Time after'time the suggestion is madethat only the ""Labour party thinks of the welfare of the working man.

' Their wageswould lag behind costs,and would have a diminished purchasing power; unless, of course, we accepted the The Treasurer policy of the right honourable member for Yarra and provided ""for some kind of price control, which would be no different from that of Germany, involving iron regimentation of the whole of the We were then faced with community. to my question. up to date has been pursued by this Government of the use of credit within proper limits, and the reduction, of interest rates, will enable industry to increase its investments, and in that way to absorb men in employment.

In addition, it must be remembered that if in another year the company rate is reduced, the shareholder's rebate should, if the criticism is valid, be limited to the lowest company rate of the current year and not as calculated at the higher rate of the previous year.

280,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [3.25],"of the criticism of that regulation was that it was altered recently. As now amended, the British regulation 39 ( A ) provides1. No person shall(a) Endeavour to seduce from their duty persons in His Majesty's service or engaged under any public authority in the performance of functions in connection with the defence of the realm or the securing of the public safety, or to cause among such persons disaffection likely to lead to form, it provides for the punishbreaches of their duty. Obviously the English regulation, as amended, is much narrower and much more limited in scope than the corresponding regulation in Australia. The next regulation to which I should like to refer is our regulation 42, which corresponds' to the English regulation 39 (.B). In connection w i th this regulation Mr Dingle Foot saidX pass to 30 [IS), which contains one of the most remarkable regulations that can ever have been laid on the table of the House. . . The cautious and conservative Law Journal went further in its condemnation of that regulation, whose provisions it described as ""intolerable"". These"" in tolerable "" provisions are still in our regulation 42. This still provides as followsA person shall not(o) Endeavour to influence public opinion (whether in Australia or elsewhere) in a manner likely to be prejudicial .to the defence of the Common. wealth, or the efficient prosecution ' of the war . . . When, a person has been convicted by a j u r y of an offence under this regulation, the court may forbid him to publish any newspaper again in Australia. British criticism of the regulation was that it prevented not merely untrue statements of fact from being made, but also the expression of opinion. Mr Dingle Foot referred to the distinction drawn by Sir John Simon when he was AttorneyGenerali n the Asquith Government in 1914, between mis-statements of fact and statements of opinion. Sir John Simon saidTo prevent mis-statements of facts which are prejudicial and injurious to our cause is a thing about which nobody will dispute, but statements of opinion, however foolish they may be and however far from wise in judgment, are a very different thing from misstatements of facts and a hope that in any regulations we make and iu any amendment of ""them we shall always draw that distinction most sharply. That distinction was not drawn by regulation 39 ( B ) as originally adopted in England, and it is not drawn in our regulation 42 as it stands to-day. As the result of the discussion in the House of Commons, regulation 39 ( B ) was amended and, in its new ment of those making false statements, uttering false documents or false reports. It further provides, however, that the person who is prosecuted may defend himself by claiming that, although what he said was false, he reasonably believed it to be true. That regulation does not provide for the punishment of a person making a statement of opinion, whereas in Australia a statement of opinion is punishable. In England, the clause which provided that an editor who was convicted under that section could he forbidden to publish a newspaper, has been deleted. As we originally endeavoured to make our regulations uniform with those in England, I submit that we should also make them uniform with amendments of the English regulations. Sir Stafford Cripps has saidWhat we must bear in mind is that it is far easier to throw liberty away casually than it is to get it back afterwards, once it has been destroyed. And againWhat is the minimum of special regulations which will accomplish tlie legitimate purpose of protecting the country against its enemies? Anything that goes beyond that is an unnecessary attack against the liberty of the subject and ought not to be tolerated by those The who should specially be the guardians of the liberties of the people. That is different from the problem of what is convenient for the administrator and the bureaucrat who promises not to misuse the powers even though they are admittedly too wide. The last sentence clearly sets out the position taken up by this Government, which in effect says that, although these regulations are in wide terms, it is promised that they will be administered in a generous and liberal way. To a large degree that promise has been kept. to interpret what Sir Stafford Cripps means ?",44,Adjournment National Security Regulations

He said that it is necessary to find out. what is Tequired for the protection of the community, and, having done that, to frame suitable regulations. ficulty arises. It is all a question of interpretation. is that, as the Government followed the original British regulations, it should be consistent and follow the amendment of those regulations made in November last. I point out that any problems and difficulties, due to Nazi propaganda, pacifist propaganda or Communist .propaganda that arise in this country, are much less acute here than in GreatB ritain because that country is so much closer to the main theatre of war. Organizations of pacifists, Nazi sympathizers and Communists wield much more influence in GreatB r it a in than they do in Australia. Therefore, if the British.
