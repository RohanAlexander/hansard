180,"In My Electorate Of Moncrieff, And That Is The Mr Mcgauran To Present A Bill For An Act","Wednesday, 24 March 2004 ----Indigenous Affairs digenous Australians within our society today. There is often much public comment about the circumstances facing Indigenous Australians, and often that comment is characterised by a great deal of ignorance and sensationalism, so I thought I would take some details from a recent story that ran on the wire services, regarding the results of the Australian Bureau of Statistics yearbook for 2004. It points to a range of interesting comparisons regarding the circumstances of Indigenous Australians versus the rest of society. I will go through some examples. Indigenous Australians tend to die younger, smoke more and earn less than the national average. The average life expectancy of Indigenous men is 56 years versus 77 years for those in general society, and for women it is 63 years versus 82 years. We are also looking at a situation where only three per cent of Indigenous Australians are aged over 65 years, against the national average of 13 per cent. Lifestyle probably affects mortality. Indigenous Australians were more than twice as likely to smoke and were significantly more prone to being overweight or obese. Interestingly, on the other hand, heavy drinking and lack of exercise were around the national average, which, again-certainly on the heavy drinking aspect-tends to fly in the face of popular perceptions. Indigenous workers earned much less. The estimated one-person household income was $364 a week versus the national average of $585 a week. Their jobs are disproportionately low paying; that is, of course, if they have a job-not to forget that we are talking about an unemployment rate of some 20 per cent versus the national rate of seven per cent, with some 48 per cent not in the labour force versus the national position of some 37 per cent. Education is also a key issue when we look at this area. Indigenous attendance at government schools declined gradually through years 1 to 9 and the decline accelerated through years 10 to 12. Retention rates have risen by 5.9 per cent through secondary schooling over the last five years, through to 2002. This occurred across the nation, except in the Northern Territory, but Indigenous students in higher education in 2002 totalled 8,871-up 2.4 per cent in a year. Indigenous prisoners, totalling some 4,494, made up 20 per cent of Australia’s prison population. They are in prison for mainly short sentences, most commonly for crimes like assault. Only two per cent were sentenced for drug offences. All this points to the fact that there is a range of misconceptions out there in the community about what is actually facing Indigenous Australians and those perceptions need to be addressed. This sort of data does, I think, address some of those issues. (Time expired) Environment: Green Corps Administration) (9.43 a.m.)-It was my great pleasure recently to launch officially a wonderful new Green Corps project that will continue the environment protection work being done in the Sunshine Coast hinterland.

183,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance andGreening Australia and Barung Landcare, which is an active group that has been working very hard to protect the fragile environments on the Sunshine Coast for many years. The aim of this project is to protect, enhance and link important remnant vegetation in the Upper Mary River catchment. As part of the project, a buffer zone along Obi Obi Creek will be created to improve water quality in the creek, which is the tributary for Lake Baroon, the Sunshine Coast water supply, and the Mary River. In addition to the environmental benefits, the project will give practical and hands-on experience to the 10 participants involved. They are Christopher Beavon, Ben Burnett, Liz Capelin, Kia Nieminen, Tahnee Sabina, Alex Skinner, Hannah Smith, Jake Smith-Moloney, Amber Starr-Wilkins and Amy Wearne. Participants will benefit from the vast knowledge and experience of a variety of people involved with such a very respected organisation as Barung. Participants will also have the opportunity to undertake elective training units, dealing with subjects ranging from basic first aid to different aspects of horticulture. As part of the 10,000 youth around Australia who have volunteered to join this Australian government program to fix our natural surroundings, participants will also receive an allowance of up to $361 per week, which is just part of the $69 million the Howard government has committed to the Green Corps program until 2005. The project, which has already begun and will run until July this year, also has the support of landowners whose land borders the proposed corridors, including Pacific Plantation. This means the Green Corps participants have easy access to the sites, and it will also allow the corridor to be widened in some areas to add additional protection to the catchment. The project also has additional sponsorship from organisations such as Powerlink, Greenfleet and the Caloundra City Council, who are providing funding for the maintenance of the area for three years. This is a vital aspect to the project, because without it the tree seedlings planted would become overgrown with weeds and ultimately die. Lake Baroon Catchment Care Group has also been providing seed funding. I am very proud of the federal government’s Green Corps program, Barung Landcare and everyone involved. In the two weeks before I officially opened the project on 24 February, more than 1,500 trees had already been planted. The aim is that more than 10,000 trees will be established as part of the project and that all Green Corps tree planting records will be broken. The project will include: 500 metres of creek rehabilitation; two hectares of remnant regeneration work; 200 metres of track construction; 500 metres of fencing; seed collection; propagation and nursery work; and three hectares of site maintenance and weed control. Talking to the participants and Barung members about their reasons for being involved in this project, it was heartening to see so many people who care enough about our beautiful Sunshine Coast environment to put on their boots and get involved. This project is not just about beautifying a small area of the Sunshine Coast; it is about protecting remnant vegetation and our water supply to ensure they are there for future generations. I have seen a lot of great work carried out by Barung during my years as a parliamentary representative, and now that Maleny has returned to the electorate of FisherI look forward to seeing this project and many others being completed in what is a beautiful part of the Sunshine Coast. (Time expired) Capricornia Electorate: Air Services Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (9.46 a.m.)-I would like to bring to the House’s attention a matter that is raising ire amongst the constituents of Capricornia. The city of Rockhampton is the largest population centre in this electorate and it is an important regional city MAIN COMMITTEE which acts as a doorway to the Central Queensland region as well as being the hub of this area’s economic activity. The population of the area is approximately 159,000, with an area of around 600,000 square kilometres-or about three times the area of Victoria. This area is of vital importance to the economy of Australia, with mining and primary production making significant contributions to our national economy. For many years, the people of Central Queensland have been well served by Qantas and its predecessor, TAA. In fact, as would be known to all members of the House, Central Queensland is the birthplace of Qantas. The Central Queensland community was delighted with the news of the introduction of Jetstar to Rockhampton with its low fare structure. However, the local community has not been so delighted with the new Jetstar schedule. It is obvious that Qantas has simply flown away from its community service obligations to regional Queensland. Qantas is replacing itself with its cut-price Jetstar, but it has decided to ignore the scheduling demands of the local market and is seeking to force the local community to travel at times that suit Qantas. It is currently possible for residents of Central Queensland to leave Rockhampton at 6.10 a.m. and fly to Brisbane where they can conduct their business and return that evening at 7 p.m. While these services are being used to good effect by the local business community, they are also used by the local population to access medical specialists in Brisbane. Qantas has determined not to have an aircraft overnight in Rockhampton, thereby saving itself some money, which I concede it will pass on to local travellers through the lower air fares. But the point is that these local people will now have to overnight in Brisbane and any cost advantage from a cheaper fare is more than lost by the costs of overnight accommodation. The Central Queensland community relies on its air links to build its business and trading relationships with Brisbane and to service its medical needs. It is sad to say that Qantas have unilaterally decided to abandon the Central Queensland community. I have written today to Qantas management and requested they immediately revisit this decision and consult with the Central Queensland community about the schedules for their new services before they introduce them-and before Qantas do irreparable damage to their 75-year association with Central Queensland. Herbert Electorate: Yabulu Extension Project and Tim Netscher of BHP Billiton for the magnificent work that they have done in guiding the Ravensthorpe nickel and Yabulu extension project through BHP in the face of tremendous demands for capital for other projects in that organisation. The Yabulu extension project, which will take place in Townsville, will create something like 900 extra jobs, both directly and indirectly, in the economy in Townsville. It secures the future of the Yabulu Nickel Refinery for the next 25 years. It is a major coup for our region, and our community was very pleased to hear the announcement yesterday that the project will proceed. The project will increase nickel production capacity from the expanded Yabulu refinery by more than 140 per cent, from 31,000 tpa to an estimated 76,000 tpa, with the life of the refinery being extended by approximately 25 years. This is a partnership project involving the development of laterite nickel ore in Ravensthorpe in Western Australia and the back-end part of the project, the refining project, in Townsville.

It is terrific to see BHP Billiton having the confidence to develop that ore body and have it processed in Townsville. Construction is expected to commence in Ravensthorpe and Yabulu by late 2004, with the first nickel metal production from the expanded Yabulu refinery expected in late 2007. A little understood fact is that the Yabulu nickel refinery is the largest importer of water in Australia. You may ask: why is a nickel refinery importing water? It currently gets its feed stock from New Caledonia, the Philippines and Indonesia in the form of lateritic earth imports, and they contain 35 per cent water. So we are importing all this water into the country to get some nickel. Congratulations to the staff at BHP Billiton who have guided this project through the involved company process. pleased to see that going ahead. It has confirmed the viability of Yabulu for 25 years. Mareeba Wild Animal Park wonderful Mareeba Wild Animal Park, is probably the most important man-made tourist attraction in Queensland. In North Queensland, of course, we have our magnificent Barrier Reef; we have our jungles; we have our waterfalls; we have whitewater rafting; we have the wind farm-an international tourist attraction at Ravenshoe; and we have Mick Tobone’s croc farm at Innisfail. We have Trevor Allwood’s wood factory at Tolga; we have the Fascinating Facets Rock Shop at Atherton; and we have the Wait a While Art and Craft at Malanda-three of the best value for money gift shops in Australia, and maybe anywhere in the world, although that may be going too far. We are about to build the canopy walkway between Innisfail and Atherton. These are world-class attractions. The Mareeba Wild Animal Park will give us lions, tigers, white rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, monkeys and various other species that can be seen in very few parks in the entire world. David Gill, the founder of this park, which he started last year, has had 10 years experience running his own zoos in England. I have personally, and I think everyone else has, checked out his bona fides. He has a very outstanding background. He has come to Australia and we are very honoured to have him. The opening ceremony was attended by a state member of parliament and a minister of the state government, Dr Lesley Clark; there was a federal member of parliament, which of course was me; and there was the Chairman of the North Queensland Government Association, Mick Borzi, who is probably the most famous man in North Queensland-the road to the international airport in North Queensland is named after him. All of these people were there and it was a very great event in the history of North Queensland. I also attended the rodeo last year in Mareeba with Tom Braes-one of the leading lawyers in North Queensland and president of the local Chamber of Commerce-and David Gill, the founder of this zoo park, although we did not see much of David as he was playing with his little baby son.

(Time expired) Gilmore Electorate: Sports Awards content categories to see where the main interests lie in a community. What section carries the most stories? It is the sports pages. That is because somebody who knows somebody else is going to get a mention. The stories cross the whole spectrum of age groups and gender. In fact, sport dominates the minds of many Australians, whether as participants or as spectators. We see ourselves as a sporting nation and we are proud of our achievements in that field. Many lasting friendships are formed on the field and sport plays a role in social bonding and providing a common area of interest. It is an area where a great deal of energy, commitment and dedication is invested. Such an investment should be recognised by community leadersand who better than their representative in parliament? Two years ago I did just that by instituting the Gilmore Sportswoman Awards, thanks to the initiative of Mrs Betty Berg OAM. On 12 March last year I delivered a speech to the House explaining how we ran the award. WhatI wanted to do was extend recognition right across the board not only to the athletes but also to the very large group of people that makes these achievements possible-the administrators, the coaches, the first aid attendants, the judges, the referees, the volunteers and even the little boy who carries the oranges to the players. They all play a role and they all have contributed in their small way, even though there may not be any medals or trophies for their efforts. The inaugural presentations were specifically female orientated, and at the final presentation I assured them that 2003-04 would see a sportsman’s award. No-one believed this, but the sportsman’s award was run on the same lines as the women’s award in all of our regionsMoss Vale, Huskisson, Ulladulla, Kiama and Nowra. At the same time we repeated the women’s Gilmore awards as well. Now the awards are firmly established on the local sports calendar for both sportsmen and sportswomen. This year we were privileged to attract the services of the Minister for the Arts and Sport, the Hon. Rod Kemp. His presence added substance to an already credible ceremony and I am grateful for his support. So far in Gilmore we have had 2½ thousand people from the sporting community participate in the awards and each year there are more waiting in the wings. I have met so many interesting and committed people that represent an almost typical cross-section of the community. What thrilled me was to see the junior athletes-the young adults who may possibly be tomorrow’s leaders-rubbing shoulders equally with the fit and wizened old hands, listening to their stories and getting caught up in an atmosphere which I can only describe as giving them a sense of community and belonging.

Second Reading Administration) (9.58 a.m.)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill, the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003, contains amendments to the Australian Crime Commission Act 1987, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and the Australian Postal Corporations Act 1989. In April 1992 the Commonwealth and the states and territories agreed to replace the National Crime Authority with a new body with a strong focus on national criminal intelligence needs. The agreement recognised that serious and organised crime cuts across jurisdictional boundaries and needs to be addressed at a national level. The new body, the Australian Crime Commission, was established by Commonwealth legislation on 1 January 2003. Since then practical experience and the drafting of corresponding state legislation have revealed a need for some minor adjustments to the Australian Crime Commission Act. This bill will address this need so as to ensure there is a fully workable legislative framework in place to enable the Australian Crime Commission to effectively combat serious and organised crime across Australia. The bill adds provisions to the current legislation to ensure that state laws can more effectively enable the Australian Crime Commission to deal with state offences. The bill also facilitates an effective transition from the National Crime Authority to the Australian Crime Commission by addressing transitional issues that have arisen since the establishment of the Australian Crime Commission. The bill demonstrates the continuing commitment of the government to combating serious and organised crime in this country through cooperation with the states and territories. This legislation has already been through the other place. I am particularly pleased to be able to commend it to the chamber. I present the explanatory memorandum and also a correction to the explanatory memorandum. MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Statements By Members
189,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance andment Bill 2003 is not controversial and is fully supported by the opposition. The Australian Crime Commission commenced operations on 1 January 2003, bringing together the former National Crime Authority, the Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments. We agree the bill largely addresses technical issues identified during the establishment of the ACC. A number of amendments rectify issues identified by the states, in fact, during the preparation of the complementary state legislation under the cooperative scheme which underpins the ACC. For example, the bill would enable state laws to confer functions, powers and duties on the intergovernmental committee of the ACC and members of the ACC board. The Main Committee will recall that the board-made up of the Commonwealth, state and territory police commissioners, five Commonwealth agency heads and chaired by the Australian Federal Police Commissioner-can authorise the use of the ACC’s special coercive powers of investigation, and the intergovernmental committee, made up of police and justice ministers, oversees the board’s authorisations. This bill would, for instance, enable state and territory legislation to give the intergovernmental committee power to revoke a board determination to use those powers. Also in this area, the bill would repeal section 15 of the ACC Act which deals with the conferral of powers by state legislation on examiners who are independent statutory office holders responsible for exercising these coercive powers. The repeal of section 15 will leave this matter to be governed by section 55A of the act, which contains greater safeguards in fact than the former section on the kinds of functions, powers and duties that can be conferred on examiners. The bill would also insert a definition of ‘relevant act’ to include corresponding state and territory acts, which is relevant to several provisions of the ACC legislation-namely, the offence of recording, divulging or communicating information acquired in the course of ACC duties and the privilege against producing such information in court. Lastly in this area, the bill would allow information and documents to be passed by current and former employees of Australia Post to the ACC where this disclosure is required by corresponding state law. In a different vein, the bill would give the minister the power to suspend the chief executive officer of the ACC while allegations of misbehaviour against the CEO were investigated. We understand the omission of this power was an oversight in the 2002 legislation rather than, of course, any reflection on the competence of the current CEO, who has the support of both sides of the House. The power will complement the existing power of the minister to suspend the CEO for unsatisfactory performance should that arise in the future. The bill also includes a new transitional provision to address gaps in the existing transitional provisions identified since the establishment of the ACC. Finally, the bill would amend the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act to clarify that there is no obligation to give reasons for a decision regarding intelligence operations carried out by the ACC or a decision in connection with investigations of state offences that have a federal aspect. Currently the exemption from this obligation only covers decisions linked to investigations of offences against a law of the Commonwealth or a territory. Clearly, it is appropriate to rectify this anomaly. After more than a year of operation, the ACC has commenced special investigations or operations which may involve the use of coercive powers in a range of areas, including firearms, MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003
190,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (10.00 A.m.),"The Australian Crime Commission Amendtrafficking, amphetamines, money laundering and identity crime. The opposition certainly welcomes these activities and the cooperation between the federal and state authorities that they involve. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to meet with the CEO, Mr Alastair Milroy, late last year to discuss the work of the commission. As I indicate, Mr Milroy certainly has the full support of both sides of the House in the important work undertaken by the ACC. We live in a dangerous neighbourhood-that is unquestionably the case-and it is vitally important that Australia has a strong criminal intelligence capacity to fight organised criminal networks that extend not only within Australia but also beyond our shores. I should observe that the integration of policing and intelligence in the ACC makes a nonsense of the Prime Minister’s recent attempts to argue that these functions are discrete, in the context of his attacks on Commissioner Keelty. As the chairman of the ACC board, Commissioner Keelty has a key role in determining criminal intelligence priorities and the dissemination of criminal intelligence assessments. The criminal intelligence assessments may include, at the most grievous end of criminal conduct, terrorism activities. To pretend, as the Prime Minister did, that Commissioner Keelty has no competence in intelligence matters is, quite frankly, insulting not only to the commissioner but to all Australians who understand the value of intelligence led policing and, indeed, the valuable role undertaken by the ACC. Having made that point, I can reaffirm that the opposition’s support of this noncontroversial piece of legislation is straightforward. Again we congratulate and underline the importance of the work being undertaken by the ACC in making Australians safer from organised crime of all descriptions. Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003. The bill is noncontroversial and of a technical nature. It supports the work of the Australian Crime Commission, which continues to do an excellent job under Alastair Milroy, the new head of the Australian Crime Commission. Its track record has been impressive. The cooperation that it receives from the various state governments around Australia is excellent. I believe that we are involved in a new era of cooperation of the states with the Commonwealth. They are sharing resources in terms of personnel and intelligence gathering, with the aim of making Australia a safer place. They are sharing intelligence in relation to some of the criminals who operate in the areas of drug trafficking and people trafficking. One of latest areas that they have become involved in is sexual servitude. The indications to date are that they are doing a very good job in that area. Using people from the various state areas to supplement the staff of the ACC is a good step forward. I hear very positive comments on the ACC by the various police forces around Australia. In terms of hearings that we have had in relation to the Australian Crime Commission, it is good to see that the state police forces are looking to the leadership of the Australian Crime Commission in a number of areas. This bill makes some technical amendments to enable them to operate more effectively. The first item is the repealing of section 15 of the ACC Act, which empowers ACC examiners to conduct functions under state laws, in cooperation with their responsibilities under the act, with the consent of the Minister for Justice and Customs. This section of the act was made redundant by the ACC Establishment Act 2002. The repealing of the section will avoid any inconsistencies in the performance of state powers. The other changes to the ACC Act include an amendment to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. This means that MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003
191,Mr Baird (Cook) (10.06 A.m.),"It is appropriate that this House supports the Australianexemptions can be provided where examiners are meant to provide full reasons as to why they made a decision. I certainly remember, in terms of the recommendations of the committee that looked at the original legislation, that we thought this was an appropriate way to go, but I see that they are outlining where it is not necessary in certain situations. In terms of assisting with the overall administration of the ACC, that is a wise step forward, and I certainly support that change. The other change is also a technical one. It relates to the Australian Postal Corporation. It will enable staff of the Australian post office to provide information and documents which they obtain during the course of their employment with Australia Post to the Australian Crime Commission under state law if required to do so. The need to tie that up in legislation is obviously important as much of the material examined by the Australian Crime Commission is sent via the post. The change in terms of this section of the act will be significant. These are technical amendments. They address some of the problems that have been highlighted in the operation of the ACC in working through the legislation at the moment. It is an organisation which continues to perform well in maintaining law and order in Australia. The relationship with the state and territorial police services continues to improve under Alastair Milroy. Its mission to enhance Australia’s law enforcement capacity to counter serious and organised crime by providing quality intelligence and investigative services is working and growing. The organisations that are involved-the police force and other organisations around Australia, the Attorney-General’s office, ASIO, ASIC and the Australian Customs Serviceare all working together well. The parliamentary committee, which I chair, is satisfied to date with the performance of the new organisation. We will continue to monitor it, but we are certainly encouraged by the performance to date. The importation of illicit drugs, the investigation of crime groups in the region, money laundering, tax fraud and violence are some of the areas that are being looked at. The money laundering aspect in relation to illegal operations, firearms, the trafficking of amphetamines and other synthetic drug importation and manufacture has been a significant part of the ACC’s work and is ongoing at this point in time. While there have been some criticisms relating to civil liberties, I do not believe that they are valid in terms of the current context of the act and the operation of the ACC. We need to ensure that the Australian Crime Commission operates at its full potential without hindrance from unnecessary legislative requirements. I believe that these technical changes will meet this requirement. I commend the bill to the House. in every survey that is conducted by members of parliament, the media and professional market researchers. Crime is the major concern of people at the grassroots level. You cannot underestimate the importance of the link between organised crime and crime at the local level, especially as it is related to drugs, home invasions and home break-ins. The purpose of the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003 is to make some minor technical amendments to the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 to ensure that the authority established under that act-the Australian Crime Commission-is able to deal with organised crime across state and territory borders in the way intended under the act. While these amendments are part of the government’s stance on both its law and order and national security agenda, they in no way alter the focus or intent of the original act. If we establish an authority and confer on it certain powers to fight crime, we must also ensure those conferred MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003
192,Mr Somlyay (Fairfax) (10.12 A.m.),"Crime at the local level is a top-of-the-mind issuepowers are not inadvertently distorted or diminished by technical errors in the drafting of the legislation. This bill is designed to overcome technical shortcomings in the practical operation of the ACC Act which became obvious only after the commencement of the act. To understand why these amendments are necessary, let me give a brief background to the ACC. Its establishment was a key initiative from the Commonwealth-state Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Transnational Crime, held in Canberra in April 2002. As members know, each state and territory makes its own criminal laws, but the 2002 summit resulted in agreement between all partiesthe Commonwealth, states and territories-on a series of federal arrangements to support a new national framework for dealing with terrorism and transnational crime. Serious criminals and organised crime do not care about borders, states or even laws. Australia needs a serious body with the powers to deal with crime and terrorism across state borders. To meet the threats posed by nationally significant crime, the ACC replaced a number of existing bodies. It replaced the National Crime Authority-and I was a member of the National Crime Authority committee of this parliament-the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments. The ACC is empowered to conduct criminal intelligence operations and to investigate federally relevant criminal activity and serious offences under state laws. The ACC Act provides for functions, duties and powers to be conferred on the ACC under state legislation to enable it to investigate and conduct intelligence operations in relation to serious organised crimes that are offences under state law-that is, the act enables the states and territories to confer functions and powers on the ACC as part of the cooperative legislation scheme that arose from the 2002 Commonwealth-state summit. This ability to legislate cooperatively is the key to the summit’s scheme to fight transnational crime. This ability to legislate cooperatively against organised crime and terrorism, regardless of the politics of the federal or state government, must be good for Australia-and it is-and hopefully very bad for transnational crime. However, there were a couple of minor technical problems. For instance, item 1 of this bill repeals section 15 of the act because another section of the act does the same thing-and does it better. The existing section 55A of the act already provides greater safeguards than the repealed one on the powers, functions and duties that can be conferred on the ACC under state laws. The Howard government believes that, in good government, when you confer the power you also need to balance that power with safeguards. This bill retains the section with the greater safeguards and deletes the redundant, less effective section. Along the same lines, the CEO of the ACC can currently have his or her appointment terminated if, in the minister’s opinion, the CEO has behaved or performed unsatisfactorily, but he or she cannot be suspended pending an investigation. This bill allows a minister, with advice from the board, to suspend the ACC CEO while any allegations of misbehaviour are investigated. This is a further safeguard because the government believes in empowerment with responsibility and accountability. It also believes in safeguards to ensure that balance works. The bill addresses a range of transitional issues by inserting a retrospective amendment that ensures that the National Crime Authority is taken to have continued in existence with its name altered to the Australian Crime Commission. This is a case where retrospectivity is definitely warranted and essential. This means that any references in legal instruments or proMAIN COMMITTEE ceedings to the body under its old name, the NCA, will be construed as referring to the same body under the new name of the ACC for continuation of duties, investigations and court cases-that is, if there is provision for something to be done under the NCA and there is corresponding provision under the ACC Act, it can be done as if the NCA continued in existence with an altered name. The bill also ensures that an authorised function or direction can still legitimately be carried out, even if it has been reallocated to a different position or if hierarchical changes have been made under the ACC Act. That is why this item of the bill will apply retrospectively from the date of establishment of the ACC-to ensure a smooth transition between the NCA and the ACC, especially as regards legal proceedings which may already have been under way at the commencement of the act. The other amendments in this bill relate to the divulging of information. Section 51, covering the secrecy provisions of the ACC Act, prohibits the making of records, disclosure of information or producing of documents in court, except for the purposes of the act or in connection with duties under the act. This bill allows those disclosures to be made under a relevant act-a state law under which the ACC performs a duty or function or exercises a power in accordance with section 55A of the ACC Act. It is common sense, really. If ACC personnel are empowered to investigate under a state law, they should also be able to give evidence in ensuing court proceedings regarding those investigations. As other speakers have said, this is not a controversial bill. It has the support of both sides. It does not confer any extra power on the ACC but simply removes some technical anomalies inadvertently included in the original act. I therefore commend the bill to the House. Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003. This bill again underscores the support and diligence that the Howard government shows towards putting good legislation into effect for the Australian people-in this case, in the area of law and order, which is so important to so many Australians. I am a member of the Joint Statutory Committee on the Australian Crime Commission that sits in this parliament, and we were charged with the responsibility for drafting legislation for the transition of the NCA into the Australian Crime Commission. From the time that the Prime Minister made the decision that the Australian Crime Commission should be formulated, it had at its very base the view that the new body would bring together a number of other bodies, including the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the National Crime Authority and a number of other intelligence agencies. The Prime Minister at that time, I know, had the view that if we were to combat transnational crime and the very serious drug syndicates that operated both in Australia and internationally then we needed to equip a new body, in the form of the Australian Crime Commission, with up-to-date legislation and technologies and provide up-to-date benefits for the Australian law enforcement and intelligence agency bodies to combat these evils of crime. The main objectives of this bill are largely uncontroversial. While it might be said that the powers of the ACC impinge on some civil liberties, and certainly some people hold that view, the amendments largely are really only to give the ACC powers it already has or was intended to have either under state law or in its former guise as the NCA. MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003
193,Mr Dutton (Dickson) (10.20 A.m.),"It is with pleasure that I rise today to support theItem1 of schedule 1 repeals section 15 of the Australian Crime Commission Act. Section 15 currently provides that examiners may exercise functions and powers under state laws concurrently with their responsibilities under the ACC Act-that is, provided that the intergovernmental committee consents and that the Minister for Justice and Customs: ... is satisfied that those functions or powers may conveniently be performed or exercised in conjunction with the performance or exercise by the ACC of its functions or powers under this Act ... I think the section probably would have been repealed when section 55A was amended by the ACC Establishment Act 2002, and it is now effectively redundant. Section 15 was part of the earlier NCA regime, in which the intergovernmental committee had extensive powers of the sort currently exercised by the board of the Australian Crime Commission. The intergovernmental committee now only has a general oversight role, rather than a role in authorising specific operations as it did in the past. The repeal of section 15 may avoid inconsistencies in the performance of state functions and powers under sections 15 and 55A. There are a number of other amendments, essentially of a technical nature. Item 17, I suppose, would appear to be the most substantive of all the proposed amendments, because it is intended to act and operate retrospectively. However, its purpose is to insert a new section 55D into the ACC Act to provide further transitional arrangements for the transfer of power and operations from the NCA to the ACC. This provision is deemed to have commenced on 1 January 2003, when the ACC was established. It invokes the operation of section 25B of the Acts Interpretation Act-which deals with the alteration of names and constitutions-to provide that, where the NCA Act empowered the NCA to do a thing or deal with a matter and there is a corresponding provision in the ACC Act for the ACC to do such a thing et cetera, then the NCA may do the thing under the ACC Act. In other words, section 25B of the Acts Interpretation Act operates to provide that the NCA continues in existence under the new name of the ACC so that its identity is not affected. Certain paragraphs, including 25B(1A) and 25B(2), operate to provide that the alteration of the NCA’s constitution does not affect any legal or other proceedings brought against the NCA before its name change. Also, the alteration does not affect any investigation or inquiry brought or proposed to be brought by any tribunal, authority or person, such as the Ombudsman, into the NCA. According to the explanatory memorandum, item 17 also honours an undertaking given by the Minister for Justice and Customs to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to address, through amendment to the ACC Act, the transition of the ACC telecommunications warrants issued to the NCA. This bill provides some further refinement of the establishment of the ACC and the legislation under which it operates. It certainly provides for a better basis for the ACC to go forward. It would have been ridiculous had there been legal problems with investigations that were carried over from the NCA to the ACC. Although many people have problems with retrospective legislation-and I know that the Senate committee did have some issues with that proposal-it would have been an unenviable position for the ACC to have been placed in to have serious investigations compromised simply because the body had been taken through a transition into a new and better organisation called the Australian Crime Commission. It is timely to look at some of the successes that the Australian Crime Commission has already had to date. There have been many. The Australian Crime Commission, as this House knows and as my constituents in Dickson know, works well with the state law enforcement MAIN COMMITTEE authorities. It has stated publicly that it is working on firearms trafficking, which is a special investigation that it is undertaking. There is a special investigation into South-East Asian organised crime, as there is into established criminal networks. It is also investigating matters concerning money-laundering and tax fraud on the Commonwealth. There are investigations into amphetamines and other synthetic drugs, vehicle rebirthing and identity crime. I am aware that it has done a considerable amount of work in relation to credit card skimming and a number of other investigations which are unable to be made public at this point in time. The debate today gives me the opportunity to express to the parliament the very serious concerns that my constituents in Dickson have about the issue of law and order. In particular, the elderly residents in my electorate have grave concerns about safety in their own homes. I say to them today that the Australian Crime Commission works very well with federal and state bodies to try to stamp out crime whenever it can. Certainly, it deals with the larger issues, particularly in relation to drug importation and trafficking. We know that many local crimes are caused by people who need the money to buy drugs from the people that the Australian Crime Commission and other law enforcement agencies are trying to tackle. I want to commend the Australian Crime Commission on the work that it continues to do. I also commend the Australian Federal Police, who have a joint role with the Australian Crime Commission and work hand in glove with it. Each complements the work of the other. The liaison, the professional behaviour and the contact between each of the organisations and agencies has never been as good as it is under the Australian Crime Commission. I want to mention today an operation that led to a massive drugs seizure back in September. It was the culmination of a considerable amount of work by the ACC, the AFP and indeed the Cambodian national police. It resulted in the largest seizure ever in Australia of pseudoephedrine, with a wholesale value of $40 million. The haul was disguised in decorative wall plaques which weighed approximately 750 kilograms and was discovered by Customs officers during an examination of a shipping container in Sydney on 4 September. Four Australian residents were arrested on trafficking charges. The Chief Executive Officer of the ACC, Alastair Milroy, said: A lengthy and proactive operation mounted by the ACC has led to this excellent result. Ongoing surveillance by ACC officers detected the container and with assistance from Australian Customs, the container was searched. He went on to say: The success of the operation has required the effort of the ACC, AFP, Customs and the Cambodian National Police which demonstrates the necessity of law enforcement agencies, both nationally and internationally, working together. The seizure of the pseudoephedrine is the third stage of a joint operation between the ACC, the AFP and the Cambodian National Police who previously arrested an Australian national, four Cambodian nationals and others in connection with 24 kgs of heroin at an estimated street value of AUD24 million ... The reason I raise that particular issue today is that the very real outcome of this matter, had those people not been arrested and the drugs seized, would have been that those drugs would have filtered their way down to the streets and houses in electorates like mine in outer metropolitan areas of Australia. One of the great afflictions of Australian youth and Australian society in this day and age has been the terrible and treacherous effect that drugs have on young people. In commending MAIN COMMITTEE this bill to the House today, I also want to take the opportunity to congratulate Alastair Milroy and all the officers and support staff within the Australian Crime Commission on the fine work they have done over what I know and acknowledge is a difficult transition period. These sorts of major transitions are always difficult for staff, because people do not know what the outcomes will be. But we know in hindsight what the outcomes have been, and we know that, through the Howard government’s formulation of and support for the Australian Crime Commission, as well as the ongoing support given by this government to the law enforcement agencies of this country, the ACC is providing on a regular basis tangible and decent outcomes for the people of Australia. It is with great pleasure that I support this bill before the House today. tralian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003. This bill is ultimately about helping the Australian Crime Commission in its work to combat organised crime and the outcome of organised crime-that is, the spread and scourge of drugs throughout Australia. Overnight, we saw the death of another member of Melbourne’s underworld. By some accounts, that killing represents the 23rd recent killing of an underworld figure in Melbourne. It shows that there is a significant organised crime network in one city in Australia. This network is at war with itself. It is real, established and involved in activities such as drugs, prostitution, the illegal importation of substances throughout Australia and standover activities. It is also having a deleterious, destructive and cancerous effect on our society. In focusing on the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003, let us not forget for a moment that it is about the good of society. It is about dealing with these things that strike at the very notion of everything that we believe in and which reach into and rip apart lives of ordinary citizens. That is what the Australian Crime Commission is about. It is about breaking down organised crime in Australia. Organised crime, in turn, is about widespread drug use, preying upon those who are most vulnerable-and in addition to that widespread drug use it is about other associated activities, be they organised prostitution, illegal import and export, standover tactics or any of the other elements which are associated with organised crime. The effect on society is to break down certainty for people in their own homes and to break down the capacity of businesses to go about their affairs without feeling threatened or intimidated. That is why this bill is important. One thing we have seen is a significant decrease in the quantity of heroin used over the last five years in Australia. That comes from the work of the National Crime Authority and its successor, the Australian Crime Commission, and the Australian Federal Police and the respective state jurisdictions. There has been an extraordinary decrease in the use and level of heroin and related opiates in our society over the last five to six years. That is a breakthrough, but it is still a problem so you can never ever be complacent. That is the heart and soul of what this bill is about and it is what the Australian Crime Commission focuses on. Very briefly, I support this bill because it has a simple proposition: it helps the Australian Crime Commission to establish itself in its transition as the successor to the National Crime Authority. The Australian Crime Commission was established on 1 January 2003. It was the culmination of a decade long process to bring together a series of bodies. In April 1992, the Commonwealth, states and territories agreed to replace the National Crime Authority with a new body with a strong focus on national criminal intelligence needs. The agreement recogMAIN COMMITTEE",174,Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003
194,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (10.32 A.m.),"I am delighted to rise to speak in support of the Ausnised that there is a level of serious and organised crime in Australia, that it cuts across jurisdictional boundaries and that it needs to be addressed at a national level. That is where the Australian Crime Commission fits in, so it was established on 1 January 2003. As a consequence of its establishment, there are some minor amendments. But what is the Australian Crime Commission? It is a body which was established as the successor to the National Crime Authority, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments with a vision of reducing the incidence and impact of serious and organised criminal activity. That is a clear and simple vision. Its specific mission flowing from that vision is to enhance Australian law enforcement’s capacity to counter serious and organised criminal activity by: (1), providing quality intelligence and investigative services; (2), responding effectively to the needs of the relevant police and jurisdictional bodies throughout Australia; and, (3), working with those agencies. The Australian Crime Commission has six core functions: firstly, to collect and disseminate criminal information and intelligence; secondly, to provide the ACC’s board with strategic criminal assessments based on that intelligence; thirdly, to advise the board on criminal intelligence priorities; fourthly, to undertake criminal intelligence operations-so to get out there and do the work; fifthly, to investigate matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity; and, finally, to report to the board on the outcomes of intelligence operations and investigations. So those elements-intelligence collection, operations, and monitoring and reviewconstitute the essence of what the Australian Crime Commission is about. In that context, this bill helps facilitate the transition from its forerunners. I want to conclude with a reference to local policing and community policing concerns within my own electorate. Whilst we are fortunate not to have a major organised crime problem in the electorate of Flinders, we are not free of it-not for one moment do I think that. In the large and growing town of Somerville, the residents, which include young families and retirees, are seriously concerned that there is no police station. The area has a consistent lowlevel problem with criminal activities and with law and order, particularly on the streets late in the evening and on the weekendsfor his remarks. We have made it a specific policy to fight for and deliver a police station for Somerville. We made it a specific policy to fight for and deliver a secondary college for Somerville, against the wishes of the state government. Now, having won that battle, the next battle is to deliver a police station for the people of Somerville. refrain from interjecting. mentary to the concept of national policing and national investigation contained within this bill. I commend the National Crime Authority on its work while it was in existence and I commend the work of the Australian Crime Commission, as its successor and the body that now brings together Australian criminal investigation activities in relation to organised crime.

There is a very high level of cooperation between the Commonwealth on the one hand and the various states and territories on the other. Our community understands that governments are required to cooperate to get the best possible outcomes to make sure that as a nation together we are able to fight organised crime. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the shadow Attorney-General and honourable members on this side who have spoken for their contributions and support for the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003. Those honourable members who spoke covered the individual aspects of the bill, and some honourable members touched on other matters not directly relevant to the bill but certainly relevant to their own electorates. The member for Flinders, I think, is widely recognised in his own community as a very strong fighter for the people whom he represents in this place. I am constantly impressed by the way that he has been prepared to take the fight up to the state Labor government. Even when it is not a federal issue, the member for Flinders is prepared to stand up-as he did in this place a moment ago, to fight for a police station in the Somerville area. If the member for Melbourne Ports has any influence with his colleagues in the state Labor government, maybe he might be able to put a good word in, because it is pretty clear that the member for Flinders was speaking from the heart. He knows how important this police station is for his local community and he knows how important the secondary college is that he spoke about. SoI just want to commend him and applaud his representations on behalf of those people he is privileged to represent in the federal parliament. He also spoke up for Port Nepean. He was a very strong advocate for the community there. I have to say that he is clearly recognised by his constituents as a person worthy of ongoing support. I would also like to commend the members for Cook, Fairfax and Dickson for their contributions to the debate on this bill. The member for Cook has taken a great interest in this area of the law over a very long period of time, as has my colleague and parliamentary neighbour, the member for Fairfax, who together with me is privileged to represent, in the Australian parliament, the most beautiful part of Australia-namely, the Sunshine Coast. The member for Dickson is something of an icon because he ensured that his predecessor, Ms Kernot, retired. In relation to law and order issues and crime, the member for Dickson is someone who has not hesitated to speak out on a whole range of issues. I was particularly pleased to listen to his contribution on the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003. The member for Dickson speaks from the heart. He is an excellent local representative-as the member for Petrie well knows. She of course is a parliamentary neighbour of the member for Dickson and she works very well on behalf of her community and his, particularly in the area of fighting crime. This bill will make some minor adjustments to the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989. The need for these amendments has been revealed through practical experience since the establishment of the Australian Crime Commission on 1 January 2003 and through MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003

Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. ASIO, ASIS and DSD Committee Report Debate resumed from 11 March, on motion by Mr Jull: That the House take note of the paper. on the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD entitled Intelligence on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. I was saying that I believe the government insulted the Australian people by not levelling with them about the real reasons that they saw fit to commit our young personnel to an invasion of Iraq. I notice that on a number of occasions when our personnel have returned to Australian shores the Prime Minister has said, as he said on 16 June 2003: We went to war in a just cause, on a proper legal basis, to liberate an oppressed people … He also said, on 13 March 2003 at the National Press Club: WellI would have to accept that if Iraq had genuinely disarmed, I couldn’t justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime. I’ve never advocated that. On 18 March 2003, the liberation of the people of Iraq from the tyrannical government of Saddam Hussein was seen as a benefit of an invasion of Iraq, not as a major cause for the invasion, yet thereafter it has allegedly become the primary reason that Australia joined with the so-called coalition of the willing to invade Iraq. The report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD has made a number of claims concerning what can only be termed as exaggeration or omission, in not taking into account qualifications made by our intelligence agencies-intelligence agencies, we would have to say, which were greatly underresourced when their information and their assessments were taken into account by the government in going into Iraq. I notice that this government, belatedly, has now made a great public fanfare of increasing resources and finances to our intelligence agencies-something that we should have been doing long before the decision to go into Iraq. I think everyone on all sides of the parliament would agree with that, because intelligence is the key to carrying out a successful war on terrorism. The conclusion I make about Australia’s involvement in Iraq is that, in many ways, it was a diversion of important resources that should have been directed to the war against terrorism. WhatI would say since-and what Commissioner Keelty has said since-is that our involvement in Iraq has made Australia even more of a potential recipient of terrorist activities. That is known by 99.9 per cent of Australians who think about this-it is just common sense. Commissioner Keelty was remonstrated with by the Prime Minister and other senior ministers MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2003

The member for Braddon will withdraw those offensive remarks. will withdraw them unreservedly. The member for Braddon will proceed. equated the comments of our highly reputable commissioner to the continuing propaganda of al-Qaeda. What an insult! He labelled anyone who opposed this war as an appeaser and anyone who argued against Australia’s involvement in that war, once more of the truth became obvious about why we were in there, as a supporter of Saddam Hussein. That is the type of nonsense that the foreign minister has been involved with in this debate, and it is a pity he debases this debate so much by those accusations. The report clearly demonstrates that our intelligence agencies needed more resources, and it is good to see that those resources in part will be forthcoming. Of course, the report also talked about our intelligence failure. It concluded that 78 per cent of the intelligence material on which the Office of National Assessments relied in the lead-up to the war was from untested sources; that ONA used this intelligence despite doubts expressed at the time about its trustworthiness; and that Australian intelligence agencies relied heavily on US and UK documents which were apparently flawed. On the exaggeration aspect, the report details at least 12 instances where the Howard government overstated the pre-war WMD threat to the public based on the information at its disposal at the time. Let us work our way through some of these. For example, the report says: ... the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and to the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq’s WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations. Indeed, that is the highlight of the Prime Minister’s speech to parliament on 18 March 2003those very claims. But the report continues: This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia’s two [intelligence assessment] agencies. That is in paragraphs 5.16 and 5.17 in the report. Statements by the Prime Minister were more strident ‘than most of the Australian intelligence community judgments’. This was in part because they quoted directly from UK and US agencies. The conclusions by those agencies the committee described as: ... an exaggeration of the available intelligence, since established as an exaggeration of the facts. This is in paragraph 5.20 of the report. Mr Downer warned of the immediate threat posed by Iraq’s WMD; whereas the report concluded that Australia’s intelligence agencies: MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Committees

205,Mr Sidebottom,"The foreign minister, in his usual over-the-top performance,... provided hardly any explicit assessment on the question of the immediacy of threat posed by Saddam Hussein. That is in paragraph 2.40 of the inquiry’s report. The Prime Minister’s statement that Iraq’s WMD threat was ‘real and unacceptable’: ... was not a judgement that DIO would have made. That is paragraph 5.21. Finally: ... Australian agencies did not think the amounts of WMD to be large ... and the Defence Intelligence Organisation always expressed doubts about any production of biological or chemical weapons beyond 1991. Whereas, the report unanimously concludes: The presentations by the government seemed to suggest large arsenals and stockpiles, endorsing the idea that Iraq was producing more weapons and that the programs were larger and more active than before the Gulf War in 1991. That is paragraph 5.32. The parliamentary report clearly indicates that there was exaggeration. Subsequent events in Iraq and the failure to find weapons of mass destruction merely demonstrate again to the Australian people that their intelligence was insulted by this government’s failure to give the true reasons for invading Iraq. (Time expired) when my learned colleague the member for Melbourne Ports pointed out that there is not one coalition member speaking on this report this morning, as I understand it. This is staggering. I wanted to start my remarks by saying how much I welcomed the initiative of establishing the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. I would have thought that this is part of an initiative of the Howard government that you should be proud of. The fine balance between the need to have matters of intelligence kept tightly and the need for appropriate and proper parliamentary scrutiny is a difficult area. Here we have probably one of the most important reports that committee has brought down. This is not a Labor Party report-I do not want to speak to a Labor minority report-this is a unanimous report of the committee on a most important subject: intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. It is very critical, and they have done a very good job. It pains me, and I am sure it pains you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, that this is the most leaked report of any parliamentary committee. Why do I say that? It had but three recommendations. The most important recommended a further inquiry, and that was totally leaked before the tabling of the report. I know the members of that joint committee and I have absolutely every confidence in each and every one of them, and I am confident that not one of them leaked that report. We know where the report leaking came from. It is a requirement of the heads of the committee to give an advance copy of the report to relevant ministers so that they can ensure that nothing is disclosed publicly which should not otherwise be disclosed. In fact, that happened. I think a word is blacked out in the report so we know that it could not have come from the committee-but it came from ministers of state, or their staff, responsible, on behalf of Australia, for intelligence matters. I want to express my profound disgust and dismay that such a parliamentary report should be leaked out of ministers’ offices. That is terrible. It is shocking. It is a precedent that I hope is never followed by any government. It was a good initiative to set up this committee. We MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Committees
206,Mr Price (Chifley) (10.56 A.m.),"It is a privilege to speak on this report. I was surprisedneed to explore the limits of what their jurisdiction should be. Indeed, in the report they say that there are areas they were not able to examine. So, to that extent, the report is incomplete in their minds. I and those on the Labor side hold the idea, notion and practice of parliamentary accountability to be of absolute and paramount importance. It is fundamental to our democracy. In this area we have been pushing the envelope quite successfully, I think, but, in the case of this excellent report, it was with dramatic and unfortunate results. It was not the committee that people believed would be irresponsible and unable to handle confidential information. It was not the committee members or the committee that leaked this report. We know and are fairly confident that it came out of ministers’ offices. But not one inquiry has been commissioned about the leaking of this report. I just wonder why. As I said, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who takes a great deal of interest in matters of intelligence, has told me that there is not one coalition member speaking. If there had been, I would have had to say: ‘Please don’t accuse us, as has repeatedly happened in the House, of somehow wanting Saddam Hussein still as leader in Iraq. Don’t try and justify what has happened in terms of Australia’s intelligence and the execution of that intelligence by saying that the opposition side is comfortable or uncomfortable that there has been regime change.’ I want to point out that the Prime Minister himself, on 13 March at the National Press Club, said, ‘I am not committing troops to Iraq to achieve regime change.’ He said he was not doing it for that reason, even though, day in and day out in question time, we have the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs saying: ‘That’s what we’ve achieved. We’ve achieved our objectives and you, the opposition, would have been happy to see Saddam still there.’ What a lie. What a falsehood. What a misstatement of the truth. What dissembling on the original objectives of sending troops there, based on intelligence, to what has happened now. I think the Australian public is starting to wake up about it. I also wanted to put on the public record that one of the key figures in the intelligence community has been badly traduced by the government. I know a number of people in the intelligence community. I had the opportunity in a different role to work very closely with the head of ASIO. I have a profound respect for the head of ASIO. I have been briefed by DIO. I have a respect for what DIO does and produces. But I am not talking about DIO. I have been briefed in a different role by the head of ASIS and I was very indebted for that briefing. Up to that point, I had no idea of the effectiveness of that organisation, its reach or what it was capable of producing. But I am not speaking about that; I am of course speaking about the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mick Keelty. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, have a profound respect for the profession of law enforcement. You would understand how shocking it was that when the Federal Police Commissioner went on to national TV and said that he felt that, because of our involvement in Iraq, Australia had a greater threat of attacks by terrorist organisations he should be heavied by the office of the Prime Minister and forced into issuing a humiliating press release backing down from a statement that, by the way, 65 per cent of Australians believe is utterly accurate and utterly unremarkable. Worse than that, for 24 hours he considered resigning after the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has direct responsibility for ASIS, said that the commissioner was making statements similar to the propaganda being spread by al-Qaeda. What a shocking accusation to make about a police commissioner! No wonder he thought about resigning. As the Leader of the MAIN COMMITTEE Opposition has said, this was a low blow from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It was low. It was cheap. It demeaned the high office that he upholds not only as Minister for Foreign Affairs, directing the diplomatic activity between Australia and the countries of the world, but as head of the portfolio responsible for ASIS. What is national security coming to? What is the intelligence of Australia’s organisations coming to when we see the head of an organisation like the Australian Federal Police being heavied in the cheapest, most demeaning way by the office of the Prime Minister-not the Prime Minister himself-and when we have a question time where for question after question the Prime Minister utterly refuses to say what his own direct involvement was and what the involvement of his staff was in contacting the head of the Australian Federal Police and in dictating the press release that was released subsequently under the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police? What are we coming to? I can say this: no-one can foretell the future. But we will be relying on our intelligence organisations to provide the best information. This report does not say the minister lied to us and does not say that the Prime Minister lied to the people of Australia, but it does suggest that they did not fully tell the truth. They did not paint the picture and were happy to exaggerate the intelligence we received. We cannot trifle with terrorist organisations. It is too serious a business. They are unlike traditional enemies or other states, which one can identify. One can see the build-up. One can recognise the danger. But terrorist organisations, of themselves, are opaque. They are hard to identify, difficult to locate and almost impossible to trace. We must be reliant on the best from our intelligence organisations. Last but not least, this is not a report about whether it was right or wrong for us to go to war in Iraq. But I do want to make one point. That is that, whether we were right or wrong to go into Iraq, we seemed to take our eye off the terrorist game. We seemed to lose focus in Afghanistan, where al-Qaeda had based themselves. It is only now that we are searching for the key people in the mountains of Pakistan and on the borders of Afghanistan. We cannot rest easy about hunting down terrorists and terrorist organisations. No country is immune from them. If we think that we are immune because we are Australia, located away from so many other countries, we are deluding ourselves. I want to commend the report. I think this is an excellent report. I hope I am never in this place again complaining that a report by this joint committee is leaked by ministers. I hope the Australian people understand and will judge the government by the fact that they have so poorly treated this committee and its worthwhile recommendations. and a half is the failure of intelligence on Iraq, as identified by the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. As the member for Chifley has just emphasised, the members and senators on this committee produced a non-partisan report, which includes many important recommendations that need to be taken up from the point of view of the non-partisan concern that this parliament has for the security of the Australian people. The great mystery as far as Iraq is concerned was best identified in the writings of Mr Ken Pollack in the January issue of the Atlantic monthly. Mr Pollack, who wrote The Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq, has subsequently amended his stance outlined in the January issue of Atlantic called ‘Spies, lies, and weapons: what went wrong?’ Pollock argues in that very profound article that we had an ongoing informed misperception-I think that is the phrase he uses-by the intelligence serMAIN COMMITTEE",182,Committees
207,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (11.10 A.m.),"One of the great mysteries of the last yearvices of the fact that Saddam Hussein had previously had a build-up of weapons of mass destruction and that after the inspectors left in 1998 this had continued. The important intelligence failure identified by this very important joint parliamentary committee is absolutely crucial in these days, when threats of a mega attack on civilians throughout the world are being made, because if we have a repeat of this failure of intelligence, as Senator Ray has said, this will potentially lead to great danger to our citizens. As to the government’s attitude to the crucial nature of weapons of mass destruction providing a causus bellum for the war in Iraq, the members for Braddon and Chifley, speaking prior to me, have properly identified the fact that the Prime Minister said that this was the primary reason for intervention in Iraq. The government might have said that Saddam Hussein is an evil dictator who killed over 200,000 of his own people in political repression over the last 30 years, invaded two of his neighbours and used chemical weapons against his own people and that he should therefore be removed from power in order to liberate the people of Iraq from his oppressive rule, but this is not the case that they made as the primary issue. I heard the foreign minister of East Timor, Jose Ramos Horta, make precisely such a case in a brilliant speech, saying that he had supported the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia to prevent the genocide of Pol Pot, that he had supported the NATO intervention in Bosnia to save the Albanian or Kosovar Muslim people and that he had supported UN intervention in Somalia because humanitarian intervention, according to Mr Horta, is one of the primary reasons that the UN should act in these kinds of situations. But unfortunately this was not the case. I do sympathise with Iraqis, including Iraqis living in Australia, who do point out that, with the removal of the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, things have improved. Seventy per cent of people respond that the situation is preferable to what it was. This is in the Oxford Research International poll, published last month as an authoritative overview of current Iraqi attitudes. According to 56 per cent of Iraqis, life is better than it was before, and 71 per cent said that life in Iraq is overwhelmingly positive now. A letter from an Iraqi citizen, Riadh Al-Mahaldi, in the Melbourne Age last weekend said that, whatever Australians’ views are of the motivation and the politics of the war in Iraq, we should continue to bear in mind the situation of the Iraqi people when we do look at these situations. I think there is a great deal of concern for them across all sides of politics, and we ought to keep them in mind when we are making future decisions on Australian involvement in that part of the world. I also sympathise with the Iraqi Governing Council, which claims that there have been oceans of ink spilt over the issue of pre-war intelligence but that virtually no-one is looking into the scandalous oil for food program and the corrupt-and that is the only way of describing it-and gigantic scam that appears to have been run in that program. Apparently, KPMG and the international law firm Freshfields Brookhouse Deringer are now investigating this. It seems that billions of dollars were put through a French bank and have been misappropriated, people paid huge service fees and various people who were supporting Saddam Hussein’s regime were paid off in this ostensibly humanitarian program that was exploited to sustain a bloody dictatorship. All of these things are true and should be considered as well. It does not mean that the Australian government should get off the hook for their failure to properly identify intelligence on MAIN COMMITTEE Iraq. In my view, the government should have said: ‘We do not have specific intelligence now that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction, although we know that Saddam used them on the Kurds in Halabja in the past. Nevertheless, Saddam Hussein has not met the UN obligations he entered into after the war in 1991-in particular, an obligation to give an account of what happened to those weapons. In the context of the global war against terrorism, this is not acceptable. Unless Saddam immediately complies with the requirements, we will take action against him.’ That was a ground, but it was not the primary ground. As with the issue of humanitarian interventionism, as it is described by Jose Ramos Horta, the government should have given that higher priority. The government might have also said, ‘We have no firm evidence that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. We have evidence from the Iraq Survey Group that Saddam’s regime retained the desire and the ability to re-acquire such weapons. This is not an acceptable risk in the post-September 11 world.’ In a brilliant speech to his constituency a week and a half ago, Tony Blair explained this best. He said that this is: ... not a time to weigh the risks to an infinite balance; not a time for the cynicism of the worldly wise who favour playing it long. Their worldly wise cynicism is actually at best naivete and at worse dereliction. When they talk as they do now of diplomacy coming back into fashion in respect of Iran or North Korea or Libya, do they seriously think that diplomacy alone has brought about this change? ... Libya has taken the courageous step of owning up not just to a nuclear weapons program but to having chemical weapons, which are now being destroyed. Iran is back in the reach of the IAEAthat is, the International Atomic Energy Agency. Blair went on to say that North Korea is in talks with China and the group of six over its WMD and, above all, for this part of the world, that the A.Q. Khan nuclear proliferation network, which was operating out of Malaysia and manufacturing nuclear components in Malaysia, is now being shut down, its trade slowly but surely being eliminated. All of these reasons were important reasons for intervention in Iraq, but the government said that its sure knowledge of weapons of mass destruction, based on the information from the intelligence services, was the key and primary reason. As this non-partisan report of the committee-chaired by Mr Jull and including various other people, such as Senator Ray and the member for Brand-has shown, this was, as Ken Pollack described it, ‘informed misperception’. This misperception is a very important issue for this chamber and for this parliament because of the implications that it has for the safety of the Australian people. Many people might still have opposed the Australian government if it had identified that it was taking military action against Iraq on the basis of humanitarian intervention or on the basis that we did not know what weapons of mass destruction Iraq had but that there was some potential for it to use them. The government would at least have been telling the truth in those circumstances. As we now know, the government did not possess sufficient specific intelligence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. This is a very sorry situation in a world where we are increasingly reliant, as the member for Braddon said, on the intelligence services to prevent a mega-attack-as happened in Madrid or in the United States on September 11-from happening again in this part of the world. We Australians know, with nearly 90 dead in Bali, that this is a very real and important issue. Such a mega-attack on Australian civilians will be prevented only if there is sufficient, comprehensive and thorough work being done by the intelligence services. MAIN COMMITTEE I thought the member for Braddon, like the shadow spokesman for homeland security, identified a very important issue when he said that it was very good, now that the intelligence services are being beefed up, to be able to consider these things in the light of this non-partisan report. As Senator Ray said repeatedly in media interviews after the release of the report, that is the important thing that this parliament has to consider, even above our partisan views on the war in Iraq-and particularly the opposition’s view that the government exaggerated its specific knowledge of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. I want to elaborate a bit on my concerns. I am not convinced that the intelligence services have all the people they need-people who work in a calm, rational way and who have a profound understanding of foreign languages, including Arabic and Indonesian. They need people who not only know how to translate those languages but also have a deep understanding of the mentality and modus operandi of the various franchises of al-Qaeda, such as Jemaah Islamiah, and who know in a profound way what they are up to. Only now are we seeing an increase to these agencies that will perhaps prevent such attacks in the future. In my view, a good case could have been made for the removal of Saddam Hussein from power: he was an evil dictator and he was in violation of a series of UN resolutions. But this case was not made by the Australian government, which relied on a grave misperception, from existing intelligence at the time, about the nature of weapons of mass destruction. We did not know that, because the inspectors were out of Iraq. Some people have said that the government resorted to scare tactics. This report does not specifically attack the government for those scare tactics. The report may well do the government some political damage, but that is not the real issue. The real issue is the failure of intelligence and its potential to damage Australian national security by fostering the belief that the war against terrorism was somehow advanced by us going into Iraq to destroy weapons of mass destruction that it now seems Iraq did not possess. David Martin Jones, a senior lecturer at the School of Political Science and International Studies at the University of Queensland, concluded an important article he wrote in the Financial Review by saying: Events since 2001 have certainly amplified the risk of mass casualty attack globally, in Australia, Europe and the US. To allow such heightened risk to give credence to the Chomskyite fallacy that it is all our fault anyway would only reinforce al-Qaeda’s belief that democracy is frail and a hideously fragmented enterprise. We don’t do that. We say that the government’s views on WMD were fundamentally(Time expired) must say that it seems the Prime Minister’s staff have had to work overtime in the last few weeks to ensure that the government’s line is preserved. We have had the exhibition of the Minister for Foreign Affairs publicly attacking the Federal Police Commissioner as essentially being a mouthpiece of al-Qaeda-a person pushing their propaganda!-to the point where the commissioner was on the point of resignation, and yesterday we had another example from the government. Late yesterday the Minister for Defence had to come out clarifying a doorstop he gave earlier yesterday in which he said-and it is pretty clear: MAIN COMMITTEE",184,Committees
208,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (11.25 A.m.),"In speaking to this committee report, IYes, well I just said that we went to war in Iraq to support the Security Council which had to be assured that Saddam Hussein had got rid of his weapons of mass destruction. Now we are confident that there are no weapons of mass destruction and there is no dictator that will use them against his own people ... You can issue 25,000 clarifying points, but that wording is emphatically clear. Early yesterday the Minister for Defence said that there were no weapons of mass destruction. After Arthur Sinodinos-or a nun or somebody-got on to him yesterday afternoon, the minister came out with the following comment concerning Saddam Hussein: ... we can be confident that there are no weapons of mass destruction related to the removal of a threatHe did not say anything about ‘removal’; he said there were none. That is emphatically clear. I do not blame the minister for moving towards a bit of veracity and truth in this matter. We even had this comment from the Prime Minister of Australia on 3 February: ‘In the fullness of time it might be demonstrated that the advice was inaccurate.’ So that was the beginning of the possibility that the government would come clean on these matters. The government has made a lot of comments in the last week or so about politics in Spain-the foreign minister has been frothing at the mouth, frantically running around the place trying to tell the Spanish government what to do. Each week for 20 years, I have read the Guardian Weekly as a kind of Bible, and I was particularly interested in last week’s edition, which had a comment that perhaps the foreign minister of Australia should listen to, rather than giving advice to the Spanish electorate. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said, ‘ Mr Blair and Mr Bush must do some reflection. You can’t organise a war on lies.’ I think that is interesting on a number of points. The new leader is saying, as the Spanish people did in many public opinion polls over the war period, that essentially he does not believe in the position of the United States and Britain. What is interesting is that he did not even mention the Prime Minister of this country. The Prime Minister was running around Crawford, Texas, buying 25 mugs, if he could get hold of them, of him, Aznar, Bush and Blair. He was being slapped on the back at the barbecue at Crawford, trying to make it appear as if he was a person of some international substance. But there we have the Prime Minister of Spain not even mentioning this fourth important coalition leader, as the Prime Minister would picture himself. He was not even mentioned. The same edition of the Guardian Weekly had a cartoon by Steve Bell that showed a fearsome bull having chucked Aznar on the ground, while the Prime Minister of Britain and the President of the United States were still on it. Once again, there was no mention of the Prime Minister of this country, the man who essentially has tried to indicate to the Australian people that we have somehow enhanced our importance by being such an obsequious, obedient slave of US foreign policy. It reminds me, and I have referred to this previously in the parliament, of when we saw the Prime Minister running around Washington, doing his jogging, at the time of the bombings in New York. He was on national television every five minutes. In the United States, one of the major television stations said, ‘We’re now crossing to the only world leader here in the United States at the time of this bombing.’ I guess the coalition members thought, ‘They’ll have the Prime Minister of Australia on there now.’ No. The only world leader they put on TV was the President of Lithuania, a country of 3.7 million people. I have no disrespect for Lithuanians. I have a lot of time for them. I enjoy the cuisine at their club in Sydney and have reasonable MAIN COMMITTEE contact with them. But that is the kind of level that this country has reached. The supposed prominence we have due to our servility is not reflected by even European interest in us-nor by US media coverage of our leader. Previous speakers have referred to the lack of speakers from the coalition on this matter. The coalition have a view that essentially this is irrelevant, that the Australian electorate does not care and that it will not matter. Well, I think they have got some problems. We are seeing that in the aftermath of the attacks on Keelty for saying a realistic thing-that security problems have probably increased as a result of Iraq. He was disciplined for telling people the way he saw it. Whether he is right or wrong, he has a position, he has authority, he has advice, and that is the way he judged it. Unfortunately for this government, 67 per cent of the electorate thinks the same way. Increasingly, despite the fact that the government did have broad public support for its original engagement in this war, this is a political problem for the government. As many people have said-and I notice the member for Chifley referred to this-the report was leaked. I agree with the member for Chifley about that issue: if you look at the personnel on this committee, on either side of politics, you see that they are people of high repute. One must question how aspects of this report were leaked and the lack of interest of the government in pursuing the source of those leaks. Fundamentally it is clear that leaks that occurred in relation to this matter were from government ministerial sources. The other thing that the government have put on the agenda in a big way in recent months is that the supposed justification of Iraq is now that Saddam Hussein was a tyrant and that anyone that opposed the war is a friend and supporter of his et cetera. The Prime Minister himself was emphatically clear about this on 13 March 2003: ... I couldn’t justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime. That is what he said. These are not words that we put in his mouth. That was his clear, emphatic statement-that justification for the war could not be based on regime change alone. No-one disputes that it is clearly a change for the better that that regime has gone. I note very clearly that many people on this side of politics were far more critical of Saddam Hussein’s regime over many decades-for its activities against the Kurds and Shiites and other religious minorities-than many coalition members. It really is stomach-turning to see these people coming out now and saying that Saddam Hussein was the worse thing in the world and that basically we intervened to get rid of him. It is not true historically-they were not interested. This is essentially an excuse after the event. Internationally, there is mounting questioning of this. We have had Richard Clarke, the former counterterrorism coordinator of the United States government, and Paul O’Neill, the former United States Treasury Secretary, both saying that the Bush administration was obsessed with Iraq and that it failed to really understand the far more fundamental international danger that was presented by militant extremist Islamic groups. Romano Prodi, the European President, said last week: I don’t think that in reality the situation in the fight against terrorists is better because of the war in Iraq, clearly it’s not. So a wide variety of people internationally are saying that we are not in a safer world because of what is happening. We are clearly in a worse situation. For all of its evil treatment of its people, its aggression against Kuwait and its other acts, historically Iraq was not on the IsMAIN COMMITTEE lamic fundamentalist bandwagon. By Middle Eastern standards it was essentially secularist. The government has failed to understand that what we now have in Iraq is a very difficult situation. The Shiahs have essentially been forced at gunpoint to go along with the making of the constitution-we all know that that is not going to be a good enough long-term result for them-and the Kurds have grave concerns that they will be left on the bench in the long term. There is an interesting film out at the moment called The Fog of War, with Robert McNamara talking about his experience in the Cuban crisis and in Vietnam. The Americans are now in a quagmire in Iraq. They have grave difficulties extricating themselves from a situation where, daily, police are killed; where people at training bases are attacked; where bombings are occurring; and where terrorist organisations are attempting to increase the hostility between Sunnis and Shiahs. All of these things are not advancing the struggle against terrorism. We have a situation here where essentially there is no predictability about what is going to occur in Iraq, and there is great interest by the Iranian authorities-they have extensive influence over the Shiah leadership-so the so-called undermining of the terrorist threat is indeed extremely doubtful. I want to turn to another aspect of this, which is the question of the way in which the United States and Britain essentially seem to have discussed the possibility of bugging other members of the Security Council. The Guardian Weekly of 4-10 March said: Yet both Ms Short’s allegations and Katherine Gun’s leaking of a US invitation to Britain to eavesdrop on the six “swing” nations on the UN security council in the run-up to war underline the fact that a level of reassurance is needed that the existing structure does not supply ... Lord Butler should be asked to investigate Ms Short’s claims. In the longer term, a case for a proper parliamentary committee, chosen by MPs rather than the prime minister, hearing evidence in open session from MI5 ... and MI6 ... is surely now unanswerable. So we have questions about the way these countries have operated to try to push this war along and that is now under extreme pressure in the UK. I heard the other day in parliament selective quoting of David Kay, the CIA’s on-the ground person with regards to weapons of mass destruction. He said quite a few other things that are of more interest to the Australian electorate than the selective references given the other day, I think. He has very much stated emphatically that he doubts the weapons will be found, because they simply were not there. I have a report here that states he welcomes the creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate pre-war intelligence on Iraq and has said that the wide-ranging US investigation was more likely to get to the truth than the Butler inquiry in Britain. He, of course, resigned from the Iraq Survey Group, which the CIA appointed him to lead in the hunt for weapon stockpiles, saying that resources had been diverted in the fight against Iraqi insurgence. He said: I was more worried that we were still sending teams out to search for things that we were increasingly convinced were not there ... His call for a frank admission is an embarrassment to the White House. He goes on to talk about coming clean with the American people. So the person that the Minister for Foreign Affairs conveniently tries to bring in as a person endorsing part of his position has essentially said that the Bush administration should come clean in regards to the intelligence manipulation that occurred before the war. MAIN COMMITTEE On 23 January, in an interview with Reuters, he was asked about what happened to the ‘stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons that everyone expected to be there’. His reply was, ‘I don’t think they existed.’ He was also asked: ‘You came away from the hunt you have done believing that they did not have any large stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons in the country?’ His answer was, ‘That is correct.’ He was asked about the destruction of the weapons: ‘Do you think that they destroyed them?’ He replied: ‘No, I don’t think they existed’. This is the person who was appointed to lead the US examination of stockpiles. So overall we have a situation where a report has come down and it has clearly said that there are matters of massive concern with regard to intelligence, the way it was used, its provision et cetera. The government has clearly changed its position. It has moved away from ridiculous propositions, which were exposed very early on-such as that there had been contracts with Niger for the purchase of uranium. Within days they were exposed. The minister who had supposedly signed the contracts had not been in the administration of the country for quite a number of years. Internationally, they were exposed at that stage. We have had a situation since then where the Israelis have said that they knew that Iraq was incapable of-that major allegation-delivering within 15 minutes. The Israelis said, ‘We knew all along that that was preposterous and wrong, but we did not tell the US or Britain.’ Why would they? Quite frankly, if I were the IsraelisI would not make that clear to them either, because Iraq does of course present a major problem for Israel. So we have a government that is in retreat. We have a situation where the defence minister yesterday went on the record saying that there were no weapons of mass destruction, we have a Prime Minister who admitted-a year ago even-that it was increasingly doubtful that those weapons would be found. He is still hopeful that they might find something, but it appears they will not. tatives against the Prime Minister’s motion on Iraq. I said then, speaking for the fourth time against the Howard government’s plan to involve Australia in a pre-emptive strike on Iraq, that the terrible division in Australia over fundamental issues like international and national security was caused by the government’s failure to be open and honest with the people of Australia. It is now obvious that the Howard government committed Australia to support a US attack on Iraq when the Prime Minister met with President Bush in July 2002. The government did not take the Australian people into its confidence on this issue and it then did not bother to properly argue the case for the war. The government shamelessly accused anyone opposed to war in Iraq of America bashing, of supporting Saddam Hussein and his horrendous regime and of not supporting Australian troops. All these accusations are offensive, to say the least. I argued that it was not acceptable for the government to commit Australia to war and place the lives of Australian service men and women under threat and their families under terrible strain without first exhausting every diplomatic option and without providing any evidence of a link between the Iraqi regime and the terrorists that committed the terrible crimes in New York, Bali or anywhere else. The Prime Minister told the Australian parliament and the Australian people that the invasion of Iraq-an invasion that did not have the support of the United Nations; an invasion supported by only a small coalition of the willing which supported President Bush-was necessary to eliminate stockpiles of completed biological and chemical weapons and the reconstitution of Iraq’s nuclear weapons capability. MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Committees
209,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (11.40 A.m.),"Almost a year ago I spoke in the House of RepresenThe Howard government committed Australian troops and put the lives of Australian service men and women at risk, making the most serious and important decision any Prime Minister can make, in order to remove stockpiles of weapons so that they could not get into terrorists’ hands. In addition to insisting that there were stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, for months before committing Australian troops the Howard government claimed that Iraq’s weapons posed an immediate threat to global security. Foreign Minister Downer said publicly on 18 July 2002: ... I don’t think there’s any doubt about Saddam Hussein having stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons. For months, this assertion was repeated over and over again. The Prime Minister said on 6 March last year, two weeks before finally committing Australia to war, inter alia: ... why we are concerned about Iraq is that she continues to have chemical and biological weapons ... And there is always the danger that those weapons will get into the hands of terrorists ... In addition, on 13 March 2003, the Prime Minister told the National Press Club: ... our interests and the interests of a stable peaceful world require that Iraq be disarmed. The parliamentary joint committee report on Iraq’s WMD that we are considering today confirms that, at best, this series of Howard government assertions are fairly described as exaggerations. This report contains at least 12 examples of exaggerations of the Iraqi WMD threat. For example, we now know that the Office of National Assessments report of 6 September 2002 admits that intelligence on Iraq is ‘slight on the scope and location of Iraq’s WMD activities’. We now know from the joint report that the Australian intelligence agencies: ... provided hardly any explicit assessment on the question of the immediacy of threat posed by Saddam Hussein. When does a series of exaggerations become so constant that they are more fairly or more accurately described as lies? I believe it is when they are used for a base political purpose and risk the lives of Australian service men and women. The Australian people now know this is what has happened here. The Australian people know because, as the war in Iraq progressed and then after the war, the search for weapons suddenly changed to a search for ‘weapons programs’. As my colleague the member for Griffith and shadow minister for foreign affairs, Mr Kevin Rudd, has correctly said, there is a world of difference between an arsenal and a whiteboard. In an attempt to defend the indefensible, the Howard government is now arguing that the end justifies the means-that is, the invasion of Iraq was designed to eliminate a dictator so this justifies Australia’s participation in the pre-emptive strike. I do not accept this, and I believe Australians deserved to be told the truth about the regime change motive prior to Australia’s commitment. Instead, before committing Australia to war, the Prime Minister said that if Iraq had genuinely disarmed, he could not justify an invasion on the basis of regime change. Removing the dictator did not feature once in the formal government legal opinion tabled in the parliament outlining the government’s case for war. The government continually accuses the opposition of supporting Saddam Hussein’s regime. Australians understand how offensive that argument is and they also understand that there is the basic argument in democracy that if a government is taking the grave decision of taking the nation to war, the government should be truthful about the reasons for going to war, MAIN COMMITTEE not invent fresh legal justifications after the event. Recently, the Howard government has claimed that the invasion of Iraq was an integral part of the war against terrorism and that the invasion was necessary to reduce the terrorist threat to Australia and the world. Australians know, and the Howard government knew, the Iraq regime had nothing to do with September 11, Bali or Madrid. All three, and other attacks, were the work of al-Qaeda. One of the key pieces of intelligence advice the government did not pass on before the war was from the British Joint Intelligence Committee. One month before the war, it asserted that the threat posed by al-Qaeda and associated groups, ‘would be heightened by military action against Iraq.’ We are now slowly learning the full extent of the political cynicism involved in President Bush’s decision to focus on Iraq, instead of concentrating all American efforts to combat al-Qaeda, who we know are principally based in Afghanistan. It is obvious the Howard government never bothered to even question the validity of the United States desperately focusing on disarming Iraq instead of facing the more difficult but more urgent task of tackling al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. Yesterday, the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, admitted there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which I believe confirms that the Howard government simply accepted the more politically saleable option of taking out a dictator instead of seriously focusing on alQaeda. Through media reports made this week, we now learn that Mr Richard Clarke, President Bush’s counterterrorism coordinator at the time of the September 11 attacks, was concerned that the Bush administration was ignoring the threat from al-Qaeda prior to those attacks. In a Sunday Age article last Sunday titled, ‘Rumsfeld pushed Iraq as “good target”’, Ted Bridis reports that Mr Clarke said: ... Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld complained on September 122001after the Administration was convinced that al-Qaeda was to blame-that, ‘there aren’t any good targets in Afghanistan, and there are lots of good targets in Iraq’. … … … He told CBS News he believed the Administration sought to link Iraq with the attacks because of long-standing interest in overthrowing Saddam Hussein. ‘I think they wanted to believe that there was a connection between Iraq and the al-Qaeda attacks in the US’ ... Mr Clarke also explains: ‘There’s no just connection’ ... ‘There’s absolutely no evidence that Iraq was supporting al-Qaeda.’ The base political reaction from the Bush administration that this represents was obviously accepted by the Howard government to its eternal shame. The Howard government now expects Australia to believe that Australia’s participation in the war against Iraq has not increased the terrorist threat against Australia. Australians have seen in recent weeks that the Howard government does not like senior security policy professionals like the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Mick Keelty, or Australia’s leading terrorism expert, Dr Clive Williams, or the world’s leading authority on al-Qaeda, Dr Rohan Gunaratna, stating the obvious or telling Australians the truth. After all, one of the Howard government’s supporters-US Ambassador to Australia, His Excellency Mr Tom MAIN COMMITTEE Schieffer-has suggested the recent Madrid train bombings were probably carried out in reprisal for Spain’s support of the Iraq war. The Howard government prefers to play political word games and, at its worse, savagely rebuke and humiliate-in the case of AFP Commissioner Keelty-anyone who tells the Australian people the truth about the threat to Australia’s security. This joint committee report on Australia’s pre-war intelligence is a damning indictment of the Howard government’s handling of this critical international and national security issue. I believe this is a shameful way for any government to handle issues of national security. I do not believe that Australians can trust the Howard government with Australia’s national security. The Howard government is always playing politics, putting narrow political interests above the national interest. It is evidence that the Howard government is tired and arrogant and has been in power for far too long. You only need to look at Senator Hill’s honesty this week-although once again he is retreating and backtracking because doubtless there is pressure from the Prime Minister-with regard to his admission that he does not believe that weapons of mass destruction will be found. I think it is refreshing that Commissioner Keelty was able to come out and tell the truth. Most people, as verified by the Newspoll this week, believe that we are at greater risk of terrorist attack following the tragic events of Madrid. I must also say that I do not think General Peter Cosgrove did himself any favours by coming out to try and effectively neutralise the honesty of Commissioner Keelty. The government have a lot to account for. We went to war on a false premise. We were fed the argument that there were weapons of mass destruction-nuclear, biological and chemical-and we now know there are not any weapons to be found. Yes, on this side of the House we are glad that the brutal dictator Saddam Hussein has been removed, but we have to live with the consequences of being linked to the coalition of the willing, and who knows what the future holds for Australia as a result of our participation in the war in Iraq. Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD into the nature and accuracy of intelligence services relating to Australia’s involvement in the war in Iraq. The main reason given by the government for our involvement in the war was that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and therefore there was a threat to the outside world. The Labor Party agreed that Saddam Hussein should be removed but believed that this should have been achieved through the United Nations. No weapons of mass destruction have been found and in hindsight what is critical whenever Australia takes military action, particularly in support of another nation in a faraway country, is that the Australian public at least know the real reasons for our involvement. The people of Australia deserve the right to know. This was never going to happen in the case of Iraq. In the chairman’s foreword to this report, reference is made to the limitations imposed under which the committee conducted its inquiries: The Committee’s conclusions, therefore, must be qualified. The Committee recommends that a more comprehensive inquiry should be conducted by suitable experts into Australia’s intelligence sharing and intelligence liaison arrangements. The Labor Party has called for the next inquiry to have royal commission status because of the committee’s agreed position that it had limited access to intelligence assessment on this MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Committees
210,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (11.53 A.m.),"We are debating here today a report from theparticular occasion. It stands to reason that, because of Australia’s limited intelligence capacity compared to the United States and the United Kingdom, we would have to rely on the intelligence provided by these two nations and, to some extent, we would be led by the nose by this foreign intelligence. To support that position, I want to refer to two quotes. One is from Hans Blix, who, of course, has deep knowledge of these particular issues, being a United Nations weapons inspector. The other is from Mr Pritchett, who was the Secretary to the Department of Defence. I will first refer to Hans Blix’s comments on the issues that we are debating here today. I refer to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of Wednesday, 10 March. The article is headed, ‘Stand apart from US, Blix urges’. It says: The former chief UN weapons inspector, Hans Blix, has called on Australia to be more independent from the US when deciding ‘questions of war and peace’. The article goes on, again quoting Hans Blix. It says: Much of the intelligence supplied to Western leaders had been based on information supplied by Iraqi defectors who ‘often come up with things interrogators want to hear’ or satellite images subsequently shown to have ‘weaknesses’. ‘Perhaps the regret they [coalition leaders] have now is they did not let us continue with inspections for some months,’ ... ‘We would have gone to even more sites given by intelligence, and since there weren’t any weapons of mass destruction we wouldn’t have found any. They would have realised the intelligence they had was not good.’ ‘It seems they paid too much attention to what [Iraqi] defectors were saying.’ That is a fairly damning statement, I believe, by Hans Blix, relating to whether there were weapons of mass destruction there in the first place. To back that statement up, I refer to a comment on page 42 of the report. The report quotes Mr Pritchett, former Secretary to the Department of Defence. It says: Mr Pritchett ... argued that there was an inbuilt imbalance in our relationship with our allies and that as a result ‘our understanding and our policy can be, or is, already largely shaped’. Independence was, he believed, an unrealistic expectation. He warned that there was a need to be sensitive to any ‘unconscious bias in Australian intelligence advice supportive of US and British plans. Quite clearly, Mr Pritchett is saying that we were unnecessarily influenced by the information supplied by the intelligence people from the US and the United Kingdom. It has been suggested that Saddam Hussein was trying to convince the world that he had weapons of mass destruction. This was hardly a good enough reason to go to war. The Australian government and the Australian people needed to know exactly what weapons of mass destruction Saddam Hussein had, not what deception he was trying to impose on the rest of the world. I would like to refer to page 88 of the report where, in paragraph 5.4, the Prime Minister is quoted as saying: ‘Our goal is disarmament.’ ‘I couldn’t justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime. I’ve never advocated that.’ Central to the threat, hethat is, the Prime Ministersaid, was Iraq’s ‘possession of chemical and biological weapons and its pursuit of nuclear capability’. MAIN COMMITTEE So, using the Prime Minister’s own words, the military invasion was unjust because all it did was change the regime, which on its own, as the Prime Minister himself said, did not justify military invasion. The report also refers to comments made by the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who supported the Prime Minister’s position. The minister is quoted as saying: Locating, securing and disposing of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction capabilities must and will be a major objective for the coalition. We must achieve the disarmament of Iraq. The focus will be on weapons and delivery systems, biological and chemical agents, weapons and dual-use infrastructure, and Iraq’s technical and scientific expertise. So the major objective of going to war in Iraq disappeared into thin air as there were no weapons of mass destruction found by the United Nations weapons inspectors before the invasion and none found by the United States forces after the invasion. There may have been good reasons to believe that Saddam Hussein did have weapons of mass destruction. As the report said: History informed the expectations of Saddam Hussein’s behaviour: he had used the weapons before, so he would use them again. Iraq had a ‘record of aggression and a willingness to use weapons of mass destruction … He has used them against his neighbours. He has used them against his own people.’ ‘Militarism and aggression are the foundations of his empire.’ So, hypothetically, it could be said that he had weapons of mass destruction but in fact he did not, and that is the big difference. That is really what our intelligence agencies are there to advise us on-what is the hypothetical position and what is the true position? This is where our intelligence, which was supplied by the United States and the United Kingdom, possibly fell down. It could be said, therefore, that the Australian government sent Australians to war in an area outside our sphere of influence based on what was clearly only circumstantial evidence. One of the good outcomes of the inquiry is that the next inquiry should focus on how to improve outcomes of Australia’s intelligence agencies. This would be in Australia’s best interest. This inquiry established that the government was loose with the truth on national security. The report highlighted intelligence failures and that this government was selective in its use of this intelligence. This government decided to go to war without concrete evidence about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. This report proves that. The joint parliamentary committee, which included government members, found that the government’s claim that Iraq ‘posed a grave and unacceptable threat’ was not backed by Australia’s spy assessments. I will quote from an article in the Financial Review on 2 March entitled ‘Howard fails intelligence test’, which claims that the government is in deep denial over the intelligence it received in the lead-up to military action. The article begins: ‘Denial or deception? Or both?’ It then states: The Prime Minister, John Howard, and Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer led the charge, with Downer telling parliament the inquiry had shown the government did not “sex up” intelligence or the threat from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. Downer made this claim despite the plain language of paragraphs 5.16 and 5.17 on page 93 of the committee report. The article then quotes those two paragraphs: MAIN COMMITTEE “5.16: Therefore, the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq’s WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations. “5.17: This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the committee by Australia’s two analytical agencies [the Office of National Assessments and the Defence Intelligence Organisation].” The article itself then says: Make no mistake; this is a very damaging report for the government. It is also damaging to the Office of National Assessments, which is shown, after mid-September 2002, to have been “inconsistent and changeable” on critical questions and to have become increasingly assertive under the influence of claims being made in Britain and the United States. So the joint committee’s report clearly highlights some serious problems. The government was selective in the use of its intelligence. This government grossly exaggerated Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction for its own political gains. This is again spelt out in paragraph 5.20 of the report: The statements by the Prime Minister and Ministers are more strongly worded than most of the AIC judgements. This is in part because they quote directly from the findings of the British and American intelligence agencies. In particular, in the 4 February 2003 speech to the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister quoted the findings of Joint Intelligence Committee of the UK and the key judgements of the National Intelligence Estimate of the CIA. In both of these documents the uncertainties had been removed and they relied heavily on the surge of new and largely untested intelligence, coming, in the US at least, from Iraqi defectors. Clearly we see once again where Australia’s government used information provided by the intelligence agents of these other organisations-information that, in fact, was not factual. The report specifically warned about the dangers of policy driven studies where analysts are indirectly pressured to make their assessments conform with policy decisions taken by governments. The committee unanimously goes on to say that mere weapons programs alone are not sufficient to provide a basis for justifying a war. As I mentioned earlier, the Prime Minister, in his own words, stated that he could not justify military invasion solely on the basis of regime change-he never advocated that; his goal was disarmament. So quite clearly, based on his own words, the decision to go into Iraq was incorrect. Finally, we talk about disarmament, but disarmament of what? There was no real evidence that Iraq possessed these weapons of mass destruction. Maybe they had them at some stage in the past but certainly not at the time of the invasion. The Prime Minister joined the coalition of the willing to change the regime in Iraq, even though, in his own words, he could not justify it. He sent our troops off to war without solid evidence of these weapons of mass destruction, so he misled the Australian people. Labor believes that any independent inquiry should not be led by a recent head of an intelligence agency, nor should it be headed by anybody without sustainable intelligence expertise. Especially in this current climate, the Australian people deserve to have first-class intelligence agencies. They should be able to feel confident that these agencies are fulfilling their duties to the Australian public and are free from political interference-such as telephone calls from the Prime Minister’s chief of staff. Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (12.08 p.m.)-The unanimous all-party parliamentary report on pre-war intelligence makes very compelling reading. The government should take no comfort MAIN COMMITTEE from its findings. I think it is a very damaging report for the Howard government. The report exposes the deception and the spin that was used by the government when it agreed to follow the United States into a pre-emptive military attack on Iraq. The Australian people will not be fooled. Sending people to war, putting lives at risk, is a decision that transcends party politics, and people expect and should be told the truth. This report exposes just how loose with the truth this government was in the lead-up to the war on Iraq. In the many months preceding the war, we heard the government repeat their arguments in support of joining the coalition of the willing. Essentially they had four main arguments to defend their position. The first was that Iraq’s possession of chemical and biological weapons and its pursuit of a nuclear capability posed a threat to the security and stability of the world and Australia. The second was that, despite the efforts of the UN, Iraq had held onto its WMDs and that our goal as a nation was to join to disarm Iraq. The Prime Minister consistently indicated that the imperative was disarmament and not regime change, although I note that now the defence has changed somewhat. But he did say that on numerous occasions, and I will quote just one example from the Prime Minister: ... I couldn’t justify on its own a military invasion of Iraq to change the regime. I’ve never advocated that. So the goal essentially was to disarm Iraq and the argument was advanced that Iraq could potentially pass on its WMDs to terrorist organisations. If you look at the report, these constant themes are repeated in speeches made by both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. That weapons of mass destruction existed is really taken for granted in all the government’s statements in the lead-up to the war. For example, in February 2003 the PM stated: ... Iraq must not be allowed to possess weapons of mass destruction ... it must be disarmed. Similarly, he said: The Australian government knows that Iraq still has chemical and biological weapons and that Iraq wants to develop nuclear weapons. So from the beginning this government was always definitive about the existence of weapons of mass destruction. The report of the parliamentary joint committee shed some interesting light on how the government came to these conclusions. How was it that the government could be so definitive? Page 89 of the report states: The evidence evinced in support of these arguments within the government’s speeches was not merely a matter of quoting intelligence. The arguments were based on a mixture of historical experience, first principle hypotheses, deductive logic, assumption and assertion, as well as specific intelligence. Therefore, the committee argues, the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction might be passed on to terrorist organisations. But in the very exact next statement, the committee concludes as follows: Thisthat is, the government’s conclusionMAIN COMMITTEE is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia’s two analytical agencies. That in itself is an amazing statement, for the committee is saying that the government’s public utterances and their rationale for war on Iraq went well beyond the assessments being provided to them by Australia’s intelligence agencies. Australia went outside the framework of the UN Security Council because we were told that intelligence had revealed that Iraq continued to possess and indeed was increasing its store of weapons of mass destruction. The consequent danger that Iraq posed, we were told, was considered to be serious enough to warrant a pre-emptive war in order to forcibly disarm Iraq. We could not even wait for the weapons inspectors to finalise their work. The coalition of the willing rejected the case put by Hans Blix and others for more time to conclude the task that the UN had given them. And yet I again repeat the committee’s conclusion that the picture that was presented by the government did not conform with an ‘examination of all the assessments’ being provided by Australia’s two analytical agencies. The report notes, at page 54, that changes occurred in the nature and tone of some assessments and that the sudden variation in the assessments provided from ONA between 12 September and 13 September is, in the words of the committee, ‘difficult to explain’. They go on to say: It is so sudden a change in judgement that it appears ONA, at least unconsciously, might have been responding to ‘policy running strong’. What do these words-‘policy running strong’-mean? The best explanation is provided in Hansard by comments made by the shadow minister for foreign affairs and international security. He says ‘policy running strong’ means: … an intelligence community which sees the fact that government, to all intents and purposes, has made an internal decision to go to war-a policy and political decision already taken-and then subtle, indirect, covert influence being exercised on the intelligence community to shape their analyses in a manner which fits the policy and political decision already taken. If you look back at the chronology of 2002, that is precisely what happened. The intelligence community is made up of intelligent people. They saw a government whose Prime Minister and foreign minister went to Washington in the middle of 2002. They saw a Prime Minister address the US Congress and come back. Internally, the debate then began in Canberra as to what quantum the Australian military commitment would be to Iraq-not whether there would be one but what quantum it would be. The internal debate began about whether there would be an Australian battalion committed to Iraq, and we all remember that debate well. It surfaced from time to time in parts of the Australian media. The intelligence community, therefore, by September 2002 had gotten the message loud and clear that this government was taking us off to war. DIO retained sceptical views throughout the period under examination. As I said earlier, according to the committee the ONA assessments changed at about 13 September and they became more assertive and less qualified in their advice. The assessments provided to the government, together with the response to the Prime Minister’s visit to the United States, make it very clear that ‘policy running strong’ meant that the intelligence agencies knew full well what the thinking and commitments were on the part of the Prime Minister. Now the world has heard from the Iraq Survey Group and it is now unchallenged that this group is the final arbiter on the accuracy of the pre-war intelligence. Its MAIN COMMITTEE head, Dr David Kay, reported to the US Congress on 1 October 2003. He reported that the team had found no evidence of actual weapons of mass destruction or of recent weapons of mass destruction related production. This committee report found that insofar as Australia’s intelligence assessments are concerned: … the pre-war assessments that now appear to be most accurate are those that were most sceptical. These were, after September 2002, largely the assessments provided by DIO. So the government’s emphatic claims about the existence of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction have now been totally exposed. Just as importantly, on the question of the immediacy of a threat from Iraq the committee found there was a ‘gap’ on this matter. The report states: Assessments by Australian agencies about possible degradation of agents and restricted delivery capability cast doubt on the suggestion that the Iraqi ‘arsenal’ represented a ‘grave and immediate’ and a ‘real and unacceptable’ threat. The report of this committee confirms for me that my opposition to a pre-emptive military intervention and war on Iraq was the correct position. Peaceful and diplomatic means to compel Iraq to comply with UN Security Council resolutions had not been exhausted before preemptive military action was taken. The hawks in the US administration were always about regime change and it is of no surprise that they continued to exaggerate Iraq’s capabilities and to inflate the risk. Our Prime Minister, while arguing that Australia’s intervention was not about regime change, conveniently uses that as a justification for his own position now that weapons of mass destruction have not been found. The committee rightly ask, at paragraph 4.77: Did wethat is, Australiatest the US motives and intentions and make an analysis against our own interests? By that they mean, I think: ‘Did at all times the government put Australia’s national interest at the fore?’ The report states: None of the assessments presented to the Committee contained any assessments of US motives. Some discussion occurred at the hearings. DIO said that such assessments were made. Beyond the following comment, however, the Committee saw no such assessments. The comment the committee draw on was made in transcript by DIO and it is, I think, a very critical comment. DIO said: We made a judgement here in Australia, too, that the United States was committed to military action against Iraq. We had the view that that was, in a sense, independent of the intelligence assessment. Having read the report and carefully considered its contents, I think it is reasonable for me to conclude that the Howard government acted in a precisely similar manner-that it was committed to support its ally the United States in a pre-emptive military attack on Iraq and that the government’s decision was in a sense independent of the aggregated intelligence assessments it was receiving. I want to conclude by quoting a comment made in the report by the US deputy commander in Iraq on 26 June 2003. General Abizaid said: MAIN COMMITTEE Intelligence was the most accurate I’ve seen on the tactical level, probably the best I’ve seen on the operational level and perplexingly incomplete on the strategic level with regard to Weapons of Mass Destruction. He continues: It is perplexing to me ... that we have not found weapons of mass destruction when the evidence was so persuasive that it would exist ... I can offer no reasonable explanation. On that, I rest my case. Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (12.22 p.m.)-The report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD asks the basic question: was the intelligence dodgy or did the government just make it up as it went along? I think the answer, if you read report, is: it was a little bit of both. The government response to the intelligence that it was receiving was selective at best. It is very important, as the member for Throsby has pointed out, that the report looks at the issue that it was not just the government responding to the intelligence but also the intelligence responding to the government-the report points to the issue of policy running strong. Why does this matter? It matters for a very important reason. We have put Australian men and women, our soldiers, in harm’s way on the basis of misinformation, mistakes and dodgy intelligence. It matters also because the cost to Iraq has been enormous. The Prime Minister gets up day after day and the Minister for Foreign Affairs gets up day after day and they say that any opposition to this war in Iraq is the same thing as supporting the regime of Saddam Hussein. It is not the same thing at all. When we send troops to war they should be sent on the basis of sound logic, sound reasoning and established international principles. This has just not been the case in this instance. It has been made very clear to us, now that there have been no weapons of mass destruction found, that really the government was concerned all along about Saddam Hussein’s human rights record. I think it is fair to say that there has been no concern about his human rights record for decades and that this is an ex post facto excuse to explain the fact that the government’s stated reasons for going to war have been unfulfilled. This is important, not just because of our soldiers and what the people of Iraq have suffered but also because we cannot run international relations in this way. We cannot make it up as we go along-invade a country and then say afterwards, ‘It wasn’t an imminent threat we were worried about; it was their human rights record.’ That is not a way for us to behave in the world. It is pretty clear-from Clarke’s book, as well as all of the information that we had during and even before the war-that President Bush saw an invasion of Iraq as finishing the job that his father had started and that there was an obsession within the Bush administration with going to war with Iraq. This is not something that I am saying; this is something that people who are experts in American intelligence are saying and have said all the way along. It is clear that the disarmament and inspections regimes were never going to be allowed to do their work properly, because if they ran their course and Iraq was effectively disarmed then whom would President Bush have gone to war with? What is particularly concerning about this is that the government is saying in this report, ‘Oh well, I suppose maybe we did get it wrong. Maybe the intelligence that was coming to us was not 100 per cent.’ The report says in particular that the Australian agencies claim that they did not know until very late that there were dissenting views within the US agencies on issues like uranium from Africa because the classified US national intelligence estimate was not supplied to them for four months after its US release in MAIN COMMITTEE 2002. But you did not need classified information to have doubts about the intelligence that we were basing our decision to go to war on. There was a great deal of information in the public domain that made people sceptical about the decision to go to war. I know that you, Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, along with the member for Throsby, the member for Oxley and many others-the vast majority of people in the Labor opposition and the minor parties-were very sceptical about the information that we were receiving from the Australian government and about what was coming out of the UK and the US. It is not that we have any particular access to any information that the Australian intelligence agencies did not have access to; on the contrary, we were just looking at what was available on the public record. If you look at the information contained in the Hans Blix reports of 27 January 2003, 14 February 2003 and 7 March 2003, it would lead you to say that verification was proceeding pretty much according to plan and that, given enough time, the United Nations would be able to be confident that there were not weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, in his report dated 19 March, Dr Blix outlines his: ... sadness that three and a half months of work carried out in Iraq have not brought the assurances needed about the absence of weapons of mass destruction or other proscribed items in Iraq ... So he says that, no, there are not assurances, and: ... no more time is available for our inspections and armed action now seems imminent. From his earlier reports and from that comment you can see how Dr Blix was eager to have further reporting time. In the report given to the UN Security Council on 27 January 2003, Dr Blix says: In the past two months during which we have built up our presence in Iraq, we have conducted about 300 inspections in more than 230 different sites. … … … By the end of December, UNMOVIC began using helicopters both for the transport of inspectors and for actual inspection work. We now have eight helicopters. They have already proved invaluable in helping to ‘freeze’ large sites by observing movement of traffic in and around the area. … … … We have now an inspection apparatus which permits us to send multiple inspection teams, every day, all over Iraq, by road or by air. In his report of 14 February Dr Blix talks about the build-up of inspection capability. He says that they have got eight helicopters and 400 inspectors, all without notice to the Iraqis. He says that they always have had access promptly given, that they have been given access to a wide range of sites, that they have obtained a good knowledge of the industrial and scientific landscape of Iraq, that more than 200 chemical and 100 biological samples have been collected at different sites and that the results to date-and I stress this-have been consistent with Iraq’s declarations. Dr Blix also said: ‘We’re fully aware that many governmental intelligence organisations are convinced and assert that proscribed weapons, items and programs continue to exist. Governments have many sources of information that are not available to inspectors.’ He said: Inspectors, for their part, must base their reports only on the evidence, which they can, themselves, examine and present publicly. Without evidence confidence cannot arise. MAIN COMMITTEE So Dr Blix is saying that, with fairly good access, they-both UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency-are fairly confident that the period of disarmament could be short. There was also, a great deal of information from alternative sources. There was an excellent book by Scott Ritter, the American assistant to Mr Richard Butler, who was the head of the first UNSCOM team. The book by Scott Ritter, War on Iraq-What Team Bush Doesn’t Want You to Know, was written before the pre-emptive strike on Iraq. It pointed out, on the very good basis of Mr Ritter’s own research and inspection experience in Iraq, that the reasons that were given for going to war were thin. Mr Ritter pointed out that, in relation to nuclear weapons, in 1998 the infrastructure and facilities were 100 per cent eliminated, although the organisation of scientists remained. He said in his book: ... for Iraq to re-acquire a nuclear weapons capability, they would have to basically build from the ground up, enrichment and weaponisation capabilities that would cost tens of billions of dollars. They also would have needed electrical production much in excess of their capability, and what they would have produced and used would have been easily detected. In relation to chemical weapons, which were originally produced at the Muthamama state establishment, that establishment was bombed during the first Gulf War. Its total destruction was supervised by the United Nations after the war. Any hidden chemicals would have been, to quote Mr Ritter, ‘harmless goo’, because the shelf life of most chemical weapons is about five years. So his conclusion is that the talk of Iraq having chemical weapons was no longer valid. Mr Ritter also talked about biological weapons in much the same way. He said Iraq had no biological weapons because both the anthrax and botulin toxin are useless. He said: For Iraq to have biological weapons today, they’d have to reconstitute a biological manufacturing base. Remnant quantities of these substances would have been useless after three years. Further, in relation to a delivery system, in 1998 Iraq was, according to optimistic estimates, five years away from having a delivery system, even if the sanctions had been lifted-that is, a delivery system that would have threatened the United States and its interests. The bottom line is that Iraq does not have the capability to fire long-range ballistic missiles. Finally, the fallback position that the Bush administration used and that John Howard was happy to support was that Iraq had terrorist links. There are probably more terrorists in Iraq today than there were before the war. Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator, but at least he was a secular dictator. When it comes to linking him with fundamentalist organisations like al-Qaeda, there is no proven evidence of such links. Indeed, there is evidence that Osama bin Laden has called Saddam Hussein an apostate and suggested that he was not hardline enough about the radical Muslim cause. So the idea that somehow going to war with Iraq was going to help fight terrorism has, I think, been pretty firmly knocked on the head. It is interesting to look at what people were saying overseas. In 2001 Colin Powell declared this about Saddam Hussein: He has not developed any significant capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction ... our policies have strengthened the security of the neighbours of Iraq ... Tony Blair told the House of Commons in November 2000: We believe that the sanctions regime has effectively contained Saddam Hussein ... MAIN COMMITTEE That seemed to be the view of the overseas intelligence services and weapons inspectors of the time. It seems that most of the intelligence that has been marshalled to justify the case for war comes from untested sources. Our own joint committee report says: Only two in 10 reports came from tested sources and it was not clear how many actual sources were involved in this increased reporting. The Committee was unable to examine the quality and clarity of this information received from overseas. The problem is that our intelligence organisations were not examining that either. A lot of the reports seemed to come from Mr Chalabi’s Iraqi National Council and its paid sources. The idea that Australia would make decisions about putting our troops in harm’s way and going to war against Iraq on the basis of untested intelligence information-much of which was paid for, with the middleman being the person who stood to gain the most from the US attacks on Iraq-to me seems like a case of incredibly sloppy decision making and our country has certainly been the worse for it. (Time expired) ing on the report produced by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD entitled Intelligence on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. This gives us a chance to not only reflect upon what the committee looked at but also to take into account the fact that the committee undertook the task of looking at these issues because there were a series of fundamental questions about the accuracy of the intelligence before the war and there were related questions about the government’s use of that intelligence, however accurate or inaccurate it was. I think at the outset I can say that, if you want to have a war and if you want to go to war, it is often best if you can actually organise and marshal your arguments and organise and marshal agencies to give you a set of reasons for going to war. We know that prior to going to war with Iraq the one fundamental, simple, direct position put by the Australian government was that Iraq, under the despotic leadership of Saddam Hussein, had a massive program of weapons of mass destruction and Australia’s participation in the war was bent towards stopping the dangerous things that would occur in the region and the world because of the existence of that pile of chemical, biological and-potentially-nuclear weapons. That justified Australia’s part in being one of the members of the troika that went to war with Iraq, with some attendant assistance. So, joining the United States and Britain, that was Australia’s fundamental reason. We know that there have been investigations in the United States as well. They are referred to in the back of this report. There is an appendix on judgments made in the United States in 2002 and 2003 on the accuracy of intelligence that the United States relied on. We also know in fact that the United States had not one but about five reasons to go to war, and one of the reasons that they had five reasons instead of one is that the executive government in the United States could not come to a final and determined position in relation to the question of what to do with Iraq. The executive government was split. On the one side we had Colin Powell, the former commander of US forces-directly involved in prosecuting the original Gulf War against Iraq in 1990-91-effectively taking a dovish position on the question of what to do in relation to Iraq. On the other side were the real military hardheads-Wolfowitz and others-who were bent upon building the case for war against Iraq, for a range of reasons. The first reason was the supposed existence of massive arsenals of weapons of mass destruction, and the second was the fact that regime change was needed and demanded in Iraq. President Bush, in arguing his case, fundamentally argued the MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Committees
211,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (12.37 P.m.),"I am happy to join my colleagues who are speakhardline approach of Wolfowitz, Perle and others of his advisers-and of Vice President Dick Cheney-and they eventually took that road. The approach was based more on their preconceptions than on the intelligence they had received. What is dealt with here in this report in terms of the adequacy of Australian intelligence is an astounding story of just how poorly our intelligence agencies coped with the task they were given of trying to work out whether or not Iraq had a weapons of mass destruction program. In part you cannot blame them, because this was a relatively closed society with a past history of weapons of mass destruction programs. We know that in the war between Iraq and Iran the United States actively supported Iraq logistically. They did so because Iraq was a secular state fighting against a state that had undergone a fundamentalist Islamic revolution. That was an eight-year war in which more than one million people died, and the logistic support from the United States and the training of Iraqi troops helped Iraq to fight more effectively against the United States in the Gulf War of 1990-91. We also know, from what was uncovered as a result of the Gulf War, that there were stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons. We know that they had been used against the Kurds. We know that they were used against the Marsh Arabs and the Shiah in the South. We know that the world effectively turned a blind eye to that, as it turned a blind eye to the use of weapons of mass destruction during the Iraq-Iran war. In that long period after the Gulf War the world did not go in and intervene because inappropriate weapons-chemical and biological-had been used or because there was a great threat of their use. Instead, the world attempted to use the sanction regime against Iraq and tried to screw down Iraq’s inappropriate behaviours. We also know that part of the background to this report, in terms of the intelligence, was Richard Butler’s work in attempting to do what Hans Blix later tried to do, which was to verify whether there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or not. The great fundamental lesson to come out of this is that intelligence agencies and governments reliant upon those reports that come through need to take into account the fact that they can have the wool pulled over their eyes by someone who has not got the resources. In this case it was someone who, prior to the Gulf War, presented himself and his government as pretenders to regional power. The Syrians wanted to be a regional power in the Middle East, and Iraq had a much greater pretension to that role. When it went into Kuwait, it sought to establish its hegemony over the area, not just in words but in deeds. There was a lot of bluff and bluster. That was actually matched by weapons of mass destruction in the Iraq-Iran war and the existence of those prior to the Gulf War, but the great thing that has been uncovered finally after this last war is the fact that Saddam Hussein was tremendous at bluff and bluster. You would have thought the intelligence agencies should have been able to carve their way through that bluff and bluster to get some idea of the fact that this bloke did not have much at all-that all of the attempts to frustrate the work of Richard Butler and others, four years before this last war, constituted a mechanism to hide the fact that this was an emperor with no clothes when it came to weapons of mass destruction. I cannot blame the agencies for being so deluded or governments around the world for being so deluded, but it is something we need to take into account when assessing the perils that face us. If we do not have a much better intelligence assessment of what is going on-if we do not have people on the ground or people from within those communities and countries, closed as they might be, to get an intelMAIN COMMITTEE ligent assessment of what we are actually facing-then we cannot take the appropriate responses. Iraq was one of three countries that the Bush regime identified as posing a fundamental threat to world order and peace. We know that the two other identified countries-North Korea and Iran-really do have weapons of mass destruction programs. We know that they have nuclear programs. It is demonstrable in relation to North Korea and it has also been demonstrable in the past in relation to Iran. They are countries which have not been taken to task for the possession of weapons of mass destruction when we know that possession of such weapons is palpably the case. But one of the lessons from this report is the fact that, if you base your approach to these countries on a moral or ethical ground and you determine-whatever the source of intelligence available to you-that you are going to go to war with those countries or that you will disarm them and break their weapons of mass destruction programs, then maybe you had better have some really decent intelligence to start off with. If you do not know what you are fighting, you can get yourself into a total quagmire. It is one of those instances in terms of openness and accountability, as I spoke of yesterday, where you can say that there is a whole series of problems. If the intelligence agencies have been deficient then one of the reasons they might have been deficient is that the government really did not want to know the answers anyway. In the Yes Minister program-which is instructive in a whole range of areas, including this one-we could look at cabinet secretary Sir Arnold, Sir Humphrey Appleby’s friend. In the opening episode of the series, I think, he said, ‘If people don’t know what you’re doing, they can’t know what you’re doing wrong.’ So if you do not ask the questions of the intelligence agencies that would lead to sensible answers, if you pretend that you have not had information presented to you which in fact you have or you deny knowledge of it, or if you try to build a case without an adequate foundation, then you can attempt to get away with just about anything and everything. We have seen that over the past year or so and it worries me. The sensible thing would be to say that the government have a difference of opinion with some of their agencies, some of the people who work for them, people who are commenting or the opposition. They have a different point of view. They thought we were justified in going into Iraq, and that was on the single basis of the expectation that there were weapons of mass destruction. What is wrong with the government just coming forward and saying, ‘The intelligence might have been a bit faulty, but we didn’t expect this bloke to be all bluff and bluster’? Basically, they have not found any of those weapons yet because there are not any. Saddam seems to have done away with most of them after the Gulf War. He said he had, but no-one believed him, because you could not believe this bloke anyway. You are left with a situation where the government is now making a great show of the fact that weapons programs were discovered. Those issues are dealt with in this report as well, but the shadow minister for foreign affairs and international security has been quite correct in saying that there is a whole world of difference between an arsenal and a whiteboard. An arsenal is going to do a great deal of damage; a whiteboard will not do much damage, except to selected ministers in past governments and maybe future ones. The question of how reliant we should be on our intelligence agencies is always a fundamental one for any government. Playing politics with how you get information out of those agencies or with what they give you-in this case, in trying to justify what I think was an unMAIN COMMITTEE justifiable approach in terms of the government’s reasoning behind why they went to war-is unacceptable. They could have said, ‘It’s not just weapons of mass destruction.’ There are four other instances where one of the coalition partners stated a whole range of other reasons. Ex post facto, the Prime Minister has laid a great deal of stress, as has the foreign minister, on regime change as being the fundamental reason they have gone in. The fact of Saddam Hussein’s regime having fallen justifies everything else, even if there were not too many weapons of mass destruction to be found. The core issue here is a disjunction between intelligence agencies and the work they have done-however well or poorly they have been able to operate-and the fact that the government really were not concerned about finding out what the core realities were, because what they may have found out would have been uncomfortable for them. They wanted to proceed to war without knowing too much about what might be problematic. Case after case in what the parliamentary committee has looked at shows you that, if you blunder ahead with a war purpose in mind, you can get yourself into a hell of a lot of trouble. In particular, this government, in trying to explain itself out of the situation afterwards, has found that it is not really a great idea to overbuild a case and, in overbuilding that case, to say that you were then reliant upon the intelligence information that you got. It is exactly the same problem that the Blair government faces. Overbuilding and overselling on the basis of an inadequately examined series of postulates can lead you to an unfounded reason for doing the most important thing a government can do-that is, put the lives of its citizens at risk in sending them to war. I am grateful that this report has been done so well by both sides of the parliament. I am happy to comment on it, because we should learn a great deal from it. (Time expired) upon the inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD into the handling of pre-war intelligence on Iraq. I agree with many of the comments made by Labor members in commending the members and the secretariat of the parliamentary joint committee. It is important to note that this report is a great example of the parliament operating effectively and in a non-partisan way to try to elicit the facts from what is a very blurred subjectthat is, what did go on and what intelligence was being received and handed to our government before the decision was made by the Prime Minister and the executive to embark upon a war without the sanction of the United Nations and, as we know now, without the main justification for embarking upon that war? It is incumbent upon parliamentary committees to inquire properly into these matters. There can be no greater decision for any government of any nation than to prosecute a war against another sovereign state. Therefore, it is critical that we analyse dispassionately any deficiencies and commend any strengths of our processes in making such important decisions. I think it is fair to say that, notwithstanding the fact that the report was handed down unanimously, there are some clear concerns that have to be raised in this forum and in the public domain at large. The fact is that, firstly, it is clear that the evidence upon which the Prime Minister relied to embark upon a war was not unequivocal and was not certain. Indeed, it is important to note that the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other members of the government made comments prior to going to war that exaggerated or contradicted in some areas the intelligence they were receiving from our agencies. That is not to say MAIN COMMITTEE",204,Committees
212,Mr Brendan O’connor (Burke) (12.52 P.m.),"I too rise to make some commentsthat the agencies’ conduct was perfect or that the system that we have in place is by any means perfect. But I think if we are to blame anybody for some of the deficiencies that led to the reasoning behind the government’s decision, we have to look at the way in which the Prime Minister chose to use information that he was receiving and that his cabinet were receiving to make these decisions. I think that, as members have already indicated, it is fair to say that we have had the Prime Minister revise history since the official end of the war. We have had the Prime Minister shift fundamentally from the need to remove so-called weapons of mass destruction from the hands of Saddam Hussein, from his regime-because, in the Prime Minister’s view, it posed a threat to our nation and our citizens-to the need for regime change. It does not take a scholar to glean from all of the public comments by the Prime Minister, either in the parliament or elsewhere, prior to making the decision to send our young men and women to war, that regime change featured very little in his consideration. That may well be because he did not believe he would be able to convince the public at large that we should send thousands of our young men and women so far away to fight in a war, prosecute a war, on that basis. There is no doubting that the regime that has come to an end was an awful, autocratic, violent regime. I think all members of the House are happy to see that regime come to an end. But there is a question of accountability. I think there has been a failure on the part of the Prime Minister to properly deduce from the information received and then to properly deliberate upon this matter. In the short time. I have before this debate is adjourned, I would like to point out some of those failures that were recorded in the report. The report says that there are four intelligence issues-uranium for Africa, importation of aluminium tubes, mobile biological laboratories and UAVs for biological weapons programs-that were considered fundamental to the existence of weapons of mass destruction and the capacity of Iraq to use them. The first three issues were used at various stages by the Howard government-the Prime Minister in particular-to establish his case for weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, the report says in sections 1.38 to 1.49 that these issues were either wrong or disputed or both. And the fourth issue remains unproven. So it would appear that the Prime Minister had already failed to have proper regard to the caveats placed by the intelligence agencies on those matters before using them as some of the reasons at least for this country embarking upon a war. I would like to proceed with some other matters which go to further intelligence failuresthat is, between the agency and the government, and indeed some of the areas where I think the government misled the parliament and the Australian people-but I am mindful of the time. I do not want to be cut off mid-sentence, but there are a whole host of things I wish to comment on once this matter returns to the House. I therefore seek leave to continue my remarks when the debate is resumed. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m. MAIN COMMITTEE The following answers to questions were circulated: Aviation: Airservices Australia (Question No. 2069) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 25 June 2003: (1) Is he aware that a meeting was held in Parliament House on Thursday, 15 May 2003 between Airservices Australia and Members representing electorates affected by Sydney Airport. (2) Can he say whether the meeting was convened by Senator Marise Payne in her capacity as Chair of the Sydney Airport Community Forum. (3) Has he been informed that the Members were unanimous in their opposition to the consolidation of the Sydney Terminal Control Unit in Melbourne. (4) Will he respond to this community opinion by directing Airservices Australia to drop this proposal. (1) Yes. (2) The meeting was not organised by Senator Payne in her capacity as Chair of the Sydney Airport Community Forum. (3) I have not been notified about the outcomes of the meeting by any of the attendees. (4) I can advise that the Board of Airservices Australia has approved TCU integration, to occur not earlier than 2008 and to be finalised by 2012, on the basis that a range of savings will be realised in situ in the short term. However, the Board will consult with the Minister prior to any TCU integration being concluded. Australian Taxation Office: Garnishee Orders (Question No. 2832) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 2 December 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1653 (Hansard, 8 September 2003, page 18973), for how many (a) barristers, (b) other legal practitioners, (c) directors and shareholders of bodies corporate known to be phoenix companies, and (d) other taxpayers has the Commissioner of Taxation used his powers under paragraph 260-5(b) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to obtain money held for or on account of a debtor by a third party. (2) What proportion of all taxpayers are known by the Taxation Commissioner to be subject to the provision of paragraph 260-5(b). The Australian Taxation Office does not maintain records of the number or proportion of taxpayers who have been subject to the provision of paragraph 260-5(b) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953. Taxation: Income Tax (Question No. 2835) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 3 December 2003: Further to the answer to question No. 1587 (Hansard, 15 September 2003, page 19411), can he arrange for, or direct that, the Business Industry Code for (a) 78410 barristers, (b) 78410 solicitors, (c) 78420 accountants, (d) 86392 specific occupations under ‘Health Services’, (e) 86210 general practice medical",207,Committees

214,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:practitioners, (f) 86230 dental services, and (g) 86320 optometry services be amended to provide for ‘own account’ recognition. As explained in my response to question 1459, the Australian Bureau of Statistics maintains the four digit Australian and New Zealand Standard Industry Classification system. For its own purposes the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) adds a fifth digit to create an ATO business industry coding regime to meet business requirements which require finer breakdowns of certain industries. The ATO decides the merits of each proposed business requirement to change the ATO industry coding system subject to the constraints of taxpayer compliance costs and ATO administrative costs. The ATO does not currently have a business requirement to change the above industry codes to allow for ‘own account’ recognition. Taxation: Bankruptcy Laws (Question No. 2837) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 3 December 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1596 (Hansard, 12 August 2003, page 18281), in relation to the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) Seminar Program, which components of the listed seminars specifically promote compliance among barristers and discourage the use of instruments such as bankruptcy and family law for illicit ends. (2) Where in the syllabus of the seminar program does it support compliance with taxation legislation to ensure that instruments within bankruptcy and family law are not used to avoid or evade taxation, or otherwise place a debtor’s assets out of the reach of the Taxation Commissioner. (1) to (2) All education programs for barristers promote good tax compliance behaviour. Taxation: Bankruptcy Laws (Question No. 2856) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 December 2003: Further to the answer to question Nos 1433 (Hansard, 2 December 2003, page 23135), 1592 (Hansard, 2 December 2003, page 23135), 1593 (Hansard, 2 December 2003, page 23136) is he able to say what powers the Commissioner of Taxation is considering using in the recovery of unpaid tax from (a) Mr Somosi, (b) Mr Wardell, and (c) Mr Baffsky. Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 prevents the Commissioner of Taxation from discussing the affairs of individual taxpayers with others except when expressly empowered to do so under the Act. Taxation: Bankruptcy Laws (Question No. 2860) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 December 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2406 (Hansard, 2 December 2003, page 23140), for the years (a) 2001, (b) 2002, and (c) 2003 what are the aggregate party-party and solicitor-client costs of debt recovery by the Commissioner of Taxation for all tax debt recovery actions against defaulting barristers who were found to breach Australian taxation law.

217,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is unable to provide this information at this point in time. (2) The ATO is actively monitoring the behaviour of barristers and solicitors who have previously defaulted in order to ensure these taxpayers meet their obligations in a timely manner. Transport and Regional Services: Conclusive Certificates (Question No. 2913) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 10 February 2004: (1) How many conclusive certificates has the Minister issued under each of sections 33, 33A, and 36 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 in each of the last six financial years. (2) In each of the last six financial years, how many appeals against those certificates were (a) lodged with the AAT, (b) successful, and (c) unsuccessful. (3) What are the case names of all the appeals lodged with the AAT in each of the last six financial years. (1) to (3) I have not issued any conclusive certificates in each of the last six financial years. International Maritime Organisation: International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (Question No. 2962) 10 February 2004: (1) Has Australia implemented all necessary measures to ensure compliance with the International Maritime Organisation’s International Ship and Port Facility Security Code; if not, which measures remain to be implemented. (2) What is the estimated date at which all outstanding measures will be implemented. (3) Are there any required measures that will not be fully implemented by 1 July 2004. (1) The Maritime Transport Security Act 2003 (the Act) and the Maritime Transport Security Regulations 2003 (the Regulations) were drafted consistent with Australia’s obligations under the amendments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and PartA of the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. The Act and Regulations require maritime industry participants to be compliant with the maritime security regime by 1 July 2004. (2) 1 July 2004.

221,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Will the Minister explain what the Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF) is. (3) Will the Minister explain how the ANEF is measured. (4) What is the ANEF’s noise level for the FA-18s. (5) What is the expected FA-18 flyover ANEF for the Grand Prix and is it within usual noise guidelines. (6) Is the Minister aware that the National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) confirmed that ‘equal energy’ indices such as ANEF were more highly correlated to community reaction than any other indices. (7) Is the Minister aware that this form of measurement was endorsed by the Government as the technique to be used for the determination and evaluation of the impact of aircraft noise on communities in the vicinity of Australian airports. (8) Is the Minister aware that the acceptable ANEF level for flyovers in school and hospital zones is 25 ANEF according to the investigation undertaken by the NAL in 1980. (9) Is the Minister aware that at 25 ANEF, 18% of people will be seriously affected and 57% of people will be moderately affected and at 40 ANEF 55% of people will be seriously affected and 85% of people will be moderately affected. able member’s question: (1) The plan is for the F/A-18 Hornet aircraft to hold to the South and West of the Cerberus reporting point (Cerberus Wreck), over water and above 2000 feet altitude. The aircraft is planned to transit from Cerberus to the Albert Park Grand Prix track over the suburbs of Sandringham, Hampton, Brighton, Brighton East, Elwood, Balaclava and St Kilda. The aircraft will follow a direct track from the holding area that effectively follows the Port Phillip Bay coastline. The aircraft is planned to remain within one nautical mile of the waterfront during this transit. The aircraft is planned to descend from 2000 feet at medium power to not below 1000 feet over the suburbs and to be 500 feet overhead the Grand Prix track. The aircraft will then operate in the display profile overhead the track at heights from 500 feet to 750 feet Above Ground Level, with repositioning turns over water towards Williamstown at 1500 feet. During the display the aircraft may overfly South Melbourne and Port Melbourne. (2) Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF) is a single number index for predicting the cumulative exposure to aircraft noise in communities near aerodromes during a specified time period. (3) The ANEF index is not measured-it is computed. The computation of this index includes: (a) data representative of the noise generated by aircraft types which take account of the spectral, temporal and spatial aspects of the noise; (b) estimates and generalisations of aircraft type groups and mix, number of operations, runway utilisation, flight paths and operational procedures; and (c) time of day, for example, whether daytime (0700 hours to 1900 hours) or evening/night-time (1900 hours to 0700 hours). (4) There is no single “ANEF noise level” for any particular aircraft. (5) The ANEF contours describe the cumulative impact of aircraft noise on people. The impact of a short duration event, such as that to be conducted at the Grand Prix, can not be adequately described using the ANEF technique. (6) Yes.

222,Mr Brough,"The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourAustralian Noise Exposure Forecast system is the most appropriate system for use in Australia. In September 1990, in its response to the HORSCAN recommendations the Federal Government stated that “The Government will adopt the land use compatibility advice of the Civil Aviation Authority, the Federal Airports Corporation and the Department of Defence.” The Standards Association of Australia incorporated the land use compatibility advice in its standard AS2021 in 1985. (8) No. There is no “ANEF noise level”. The NAL study was not dealing with these details. (9) Yes. Defence: Antiballistic Missile System (Question No. 3049) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 18 February 2004: (1) Can he confirm that during eight tests of the United States anti-ballistic missile defence program since 1999 that (a) the interceptors travelled much more slowly than they would in a real attack and so had much more time to distinguish between the mock warheads and the decoys launched with them, (b) the spherical balloons used as decoys in the tests did not resemble the warheads, (c) the infrared radiation signatures of the balloon decoys were either much brighter or dimmer than the infrared radiation signatures of the mock warheads, (d) radar beacons were placed on the mock warheads to aid in tracking, and (e) despite these measures, only five out of eight interceptors managed to hit their targets; if not, why not. (2) Can he confirm that it would normally be a requirement to thoroughly test such a system before deployment but that, in this case, the Pentagon asked the US Congress to waive this requirement; if not, why not. (3) Can he confirm that many American defence analysts believe that it is not feasible at this time to build an anti-ballistic missile defence system that would not be easily outwitted by clever decoys or other countermeasures; if not, why not. (4) Can he confirm that the US is currently spending $15 billion a year on the anti-ballistic missile defence program; if not, why not. (5) What funds has the Australian Government committed for participation in an anti-ballistic defence program. (6) Can he confirm that it would be easy for countries such as North Korea or hostile groups such as Al Qaeda to smuggle a weapon into Australia in a shipping container; if so, can he also confirm funding to Commonwealth agencies, such as customs and related law enforcement agencies, will be maximised before public money is allocated to an anti-ballistic missile defence program; if not, why not. able member’s question: (1) I understand that the Honourable Member is referring to intercept flight tests of the Ground-based Midcourse Defence System (GMD). This is only one element of the developing US Ballistic Missile Defence System, and the whole program involves an extensive range of flight and ground tests – over a hundred in the last two years and as many over the next two years. Some details of this testing remains classified. However, unclassified information is available in press releases on the website of the US Missile Defense Agency, at www.acq.osd.mil/bmdo. (2) Questions concerning US Government policy and administrative processes should be addressed to the US Government.",212,Questions On Notice
223,Mr Brough,"The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honour(3) There is public debate in the US about several aspects of the US Ballistic Missile Defence System (BMDS). We share the US Government’s confidence that a reliable and effective missile defence system is being developed. (4) According to publicly available figures, US expenditure on BMDS is approximately USD 7-8 billion annually. Questions on details of US Government programs should be addressed to the US Government. (5) The Australian Government is negotiating a Memorandum of Understanding with the US on cooperation in Missile Defence. Funding pursuant to such a Memorandum has not yet been committed. (6) Ballistic Missile Defence is only one aspect of efforts to counter the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The Government will continue to ensure an appropriate mix of strategies across all relevant areas of Government to counter the threat of WMD. Environment: Coastwatch (Question No. 3124) February 2004: Did any agencies within the Minister’s portfolio, during the course of calendar year 2003, have cause to correspond with a representative of Coastwatch about the tasking of aircraft or marine vessels for services provided by Coastwatch; if so, what was the nature of that correspondence. Yes. The correspondence was about surveillance, the provision of transport and other support, and the performance of environmental management functions.
