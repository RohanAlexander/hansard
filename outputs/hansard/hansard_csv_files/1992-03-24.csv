Of course, the main aim of mark, we could well see some of the Hawke with Solo and with Bourke's was to American mega-carriers getting in there, as get some price competition.

As I say, while the amendments to more efficient transport of people in that this particular Act are only the very beginning domestic passengers will be allowed to travel of some of the major changes that I think we on internal legs-for example, Melbourne to will probably have to make, I am sure that Sydney, Melbourne to Perth and Perth to people of good spirits and open minds would Sydney-and also Qantas will be free to be prepared to look at just how we can get operate domestically. So these are great into that common ASEAN aviation regime, to moves, great changes that are happening. It lift the shackles of the past and to make sure took too long to happen, but it has happened that we go into that brave new world so that and it did so under the present Government.
