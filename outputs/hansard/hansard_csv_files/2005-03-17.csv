Thursday, 17 March 2005 ----Hinkler Electorate: Education praise some of the outstanding educators based in my electorate of Hinkler. At the top of the list is Avoca State School principal, Brian Ralph, who recently was awarded a highly commended certificate in the 2004 National Awards for Quality Schooling. He was one of only six school principals to receive the NAQS award, and he secured it on the basis of his outstanding work in making his former school, Thabeban State School, a positive learning environment for both teachers and students. As a school principal, Mr Ralph has made a tremendous contribution to the community by improving the quality of schooling for local students. I was delighted to see him receive the recognition he so richly deserves. Hinkler’s teachers and principals have recently been earning themselves quite a reputation as quality educators. In the 2003 National Awards for Quality Schooling, three schools in my electorate won prizes across several categories. Bundaberg’s Walkervale State School, whose principal Michael Fay and deputy principal Mark Craswell lead a highly focused team, won highly commended awards in the literacy and numeracy and school leadership categories. St John’s Lutheran Primary School, lead by Ralph Zapart, won an outstanding achievement award in the literacy and numeracy category. Gladstone’s Rosella Park State School, which caters for disabled and challenged children, won an award in the safe school environment category, indicative of the caring nature of the principal and his staff. Important awards like this allow us to celebrate the excellence of our schools. But this government knows it is important for all our schools to achieve to the best of their abilities, particularly in the basics of literacy and numeracy. To that end, the government has recently announced that more than 5,500 Queensland students will be able to receive one-on-one reading tuition under the pilot tutorial voucher initiative. Although at times we have our tiffs with the state government, this is one area in which we have worked together for the benefit of students. In conclusion, I would like to pay tribute to our local Education Queensland executive director, Denis James, for his exemplary leadership in education. Melbourne Ports Electorate: Glen Eira City Council Melbourne Ports-one being the City of Port Phillip, which is remarkably well governed, and the other the City of Glen Eira, which covers the eastern end of my electorate, including the suburbs of Caulfield and Carnegie. This month, the ratepayers of Glen Eira have been subjected to the spectacle of their elected councillors pushing and shoving each other in the council chamber. At one point, the police had to be called. One councillor said he will boycott meetings. Another said that the council is not capable of governing. One councillor likened her colleagues to ‘overgrown school kids in the sandbox’. I have had numerous complaints from Glen Eira residents about this episode-and about many others, including the nonprovision of services like child care that were previously provided or that should be provided by the Glen Eira City Council.

182,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (9.43 A.m.),"I have two municipalities in my electorate ofWhat has happened in the City of Glen Eira? The majority of the nine councillors are Liberals, and it seems that relations between various factions of the Liberal majority on the council have broken down. The Liberals in Glen Eira have the attitude that they are born to rule. They think that their own brawling is more important than providing good government for the ratepayers. I am disturbed by reports that the council will not release an independent audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers detailing alleged abuses of expense entitlements. This suggests the audit contains information about the councillors that they do not want the ratepayers to know. There is another issue I want to raise in relation to the Glen Eira City Council and its nonprovision of services. On9 May this year, it is the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. My electorate is home to the largest population of war veterans from the former Soviet Union. These elderly men and women of the Association of Soviet Jewish Veterans of World War II, made an enormous contribution to defeating Hitler and liberating Europe from fascism. A group of them want to erect a modest memorial in Caulfield Park to the millions who died whilst serving in the Soviet armed forces. There are already several war memorials in Caulfield Park. These Jewish veterans from the former Soviet Union wanted to pay for the statues themselves but, amazingly, the Glen Eira City Council has told the veterans that their application will be refused, apparently on the grounds that it would involve ‘too much maintenance’. For a council that supposedly represents thousands of these people, and which like many other councils should be sympathetic to this, this is a shocking, insulting and disgraceful decision. I call on the Glen Eira City Council to get over its internal faction fighting and get back to serving the people who have elected it. I call on the Liberal councillors to stop brawling and bringing the Glen Eira City Council into disrepute. I will be asking the state government to give the Glen Eira City Council the option of anger management courses and to give them some mediation. If that fails it would seem that, unfortunately, the Victorian Minister for Local Government will have to intervene by sacking the Glen Eira City Council and holding an inquiry into its internal affairs and the conduct of its councillors, or, indeed, to hold fresh elections. La Trobe Electorate: Detective Senior Constable Lance Travers ate, Detective Senior Constable Lance Travers, who retired from the Victorian police force on 31 December 2004. Lance joined the Victorian police force as a cadet on 7 March 1966. He worked at various police stations, including Russell Street, Camberwell, Malvern and Elsternwick. Importantly, in 1978 he transferred to the Ferntree Gully criminal investigations branch and subsequently worked in the local area at Knox CIB and, finally, at the Boronia criminal investigation branch, from where he retired. I had the privilege of working with Lance Travers. When I was a constable at the Boronia Police StationI was seconded to the Knox CIB. I remember my former detective senior sergeant explaining that he would get me to work with Lance Travers. He said, ‘Lance is a very methodical, thorough and knowledgeable detective,’ and he was right about all those attributes. Lance really did put the victim first. In these days when policing is all about getting the job done quickly, Lance would step back and take the time to ensure that the victim was the most important person in the world.

On 20 December 1966 as a constable Lance was commended for firmness and determination when he intervened on an occasion when a girl was molested by two men and, although meeting strong resistance, he was able to apprehend both offenders. In 1983 Lance was seconded to perform special duties with the bushfire investigation team responsible for representing the coroner after the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires. In recent times Lance performed an outstanding job as the lead investigator in Operation Carousel, which involved the Johnson Tiles raid in Bayswater in 2000 and resulted in Craig Johnston subsequently being convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Again in his own time, Lance was involved in the Ferntree Gully Blue Light Disco. Lance was the longest serving detective in the local area. He is a true gentleman and I wish him all the best in the future. Parramatta Electorate: Sudanese Women’s Welfare Organisation Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (9.48 a.m.)-I rise today to bring to the attention of the House an extraordinary group of women in my electorate that have come together to work for their community. The Sudanese Women’s Welfare Organisation is a brand-new organisation formed out of the needs of the new migrant community from the Sudan. I met them recently for the first time and was impressed by their commitment and focus. They are bright, intelligent women who are committed to improving the lives and well-being of the new Sudanese migrants, particularly women. With the help of the Holroyd Parramatta Migrant Services, the organisation has already organised a number of events to help connect Sudanese women. The first of these was a forum to discuss the problems faced by New South Wales Sudanese women. It was a successful event that provided a great deal of information to those of us working with the community for their advancement. The group has also organised a series of picnics and lunches for the women and their families. I attended one of these picnics recently, in Parramatta Park, as their guest. The day was a chance for the women to come together and socialise, and it gave their children a chance to play and enjoy their newly found freedom. It was in fact a Mother’s Day picnic, and it was quite wonderful to see so very many young children from a ravaged country playing in safety and to see their parents relax as the day progressed, knowing that their children were safe. Our newer Sudanese arrivals have some particular difficulties in settling into our communities, coming as they do from one of the most traumatised regions of the world, often having spent years in the camps. Many arrive traumatised and with limited understanding of Sydney. On top of that, most of these women have lost their husbands and arrive here alone with their children. Families are large in the Sudan, and many arrive with six to 10 children to look after. Isolation for these women is a real problem. Language difficulties, a lack of understanding of the workings of the city and sole responsibility for several children all combine to keep these women isolated from each other and from the community. Their children have also learnt a way of life suited to survival in the camps and have considerable difficulties settling into the local schools. These women who have formed the Sudanese Women’s Welfare Organisation are a real example of the commitment that so many of our new migrants have to making Australia their home, to finding solutions, to supporting each other and to making this country work for them. I cannot name them all, but I would just like to mention Victaria, their chairperson, and MAIN COMMITTEE Fatima Elzibar, their secretary, who have done a great job in setting up this organisation. They are a welcome addition to the community groups in Parramatta. They have already enriched the area, and they provide a new dynamic to the multicultural mix in Western Sydney. Regional Services: Program Funding der the Regional Partnerships program for a sum of $500,000 for the Sunshine Coast Helicopter Rescue Service to construct a new helicopter hangar to house and service the three rescue helicopters which service a large area of south-east Queensland. The $500,000 represents 30 per cent of the total project cost, which is $1,692,000. The board of the service will fund the remaining 70 per cent through a bank loan of $1,192,000, which has already been secured through the Westpac bank. A partnership has been formed with the Queensland government, which has agreed to fund the recurrent operational costs of $1.32 million per year. This is a vital service for the region. It is a service I greatly admire-a service which has been around for very many years and which is absolutely essential. The rescue service has outgrown its existing hangar facility at Maroochydore Airport. It urgently needs a completely new facility designed to comfortably accommodate the operation over the next half-century and provide for future growth. The RPP funding will be instrumental in the construction and completion of the hangar. An extra hangar is needed because of the increased demands on the service-it continues to service even greater areas of south-east Queensland-and because of space requirements. This is a really important project. This service is well managed and supported by the community. Over its years of operation, many hundreds of lives have been saved and many people have been able to be taken to medical attention, when previously they would not have had that opportunity. The isolation of distance for country people can be compensated for by a quick helicopter response when search and rescue or medical evacuation are required. The new hangar will help to upgrade this rapid response service and is vital to improving timely support to the community. The service should be able to provide people who live in country areas and on isolated farms and properties with the best possible support and the new hangar will assist in providing this. The increase in the population in south-east Queensland is catered for in the provision for community needs for the future. With security in relation to external and internal threats becoming more important in the national interest, services such as the helicopter rescue service can be the first to respond should something occur in our local region. Helicopters are vital in this scenario. The community would know that their local counter-disaster organisers have the best possible equipment available should the need arise and that the federal government is assisting a service to provide for their needs and ensuring quick response in times of trauma. The Sunshine Coast Helicopter Rescue Service provides vital support to rural and regional people on the coast, in the country and in the more isolated areas of south-east Queensland. Increased efficiency by the service would lessen the stress of isolation. This is a worthwhile project. Most of the money has been raised from other sources. The Commonwealth has only been asked to contribute a small amount. It is a particularly worthwhile application, and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to seriously consider it.

184,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (9.51 A.m.),"I rise in the House today to support an application unHunter Electorate: Dementia Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (9.54 a.m.)-I would like to draw the attention of the House to a new report commissioned from Access Economics by Alzheimer’s Australia. The report is called Dementia estimates and projections: Australian states and territories. It estimates that nearly 52,000 people will be newly diagnosed with dementia this year-1,000 people every week. The new national state and territory data indicates that in 2005 the total number of Australians with dementia will pass the 200,000 mark-one per cent of our total population. By 2050, however, this total will approach almost three per cent of the population. Those projections are 25 per cent higher than were anticipated in 2003. Obviously, it is going to require a major response. I congratulate the government on making dementia a national health priority. Now we want to see funding to match that national health priority. The other areas, of course, are support to local communities, which I want to speak more about, and research. I would urge the government to commit at least $50 million-that is what Alzheimer’s Australia is asking for-every year towards research. TodayI particularly want to draw the House’s attention to local activities in Newcastle and the lower Hunter to support fundraising for an Alzheimer’s resource centre. It is estimated that there are more than 10,000 dementia sufferers in the Hunter, with many more cases undetected. Five years ago the local Rotary group, Rotary District 9670, and the Hunter Network of Alzheimer’s Australia joined together to fundraise for a local Alzheimer’s resource centre in the lower Hunter. They have now raised $260,000, an extremely wonderful effort. Approximately $78,000 was raised by the Hunter network alone. It has been a wonderful effort by ordinary members of our community and businesses. It has been a great achievement. At the Rotary governors’ conference last Saturday, Alzheimer’s Australia announced that it would match that $260,000, which now gives that activity $520,000 to go straight ahead and start the process to deliver the resource centre. The centre will provide support services to people all over the area and will help to run programs like Living with Memory Loss. We hope it will become very much like the centre in Sydney, which is held in high regard and is seen as best practice. As the government has a commitment to dementia, I would like to suggest that it could support this venture. I will certainly be asking for support at state government level as well. The local community has raised $260,000 and Alzheimer’s Australia has matched it. The government should contribute to this wonderful project. I put on the record my support for those activities, my appreciation to Alzheimer’s Australia on behalf of the people of Newcastle and the Hunter, and I urge the government to match the money raised so far. the time for members’ statements has concluded. Health and Ageing Committee Report Debate resumed from 16 March, on motion by Mr Somlyay: That the House take note of the document. report, Future ageing: report on a draft report of the 40th Parliament: inquiry into long-term MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Statements By Members
185,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),"In accordance with standing order 193,",133,Committees
186,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar) (9.58 A.m.),"I rise with pleasure to address thisstrategies to address the ageing of the Australian population over the next 40 years. I note from previous speeches that this was the work of the previous committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Ageing, and it has come via the existing committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, so that it can be commented upon. In the report’s list of conclusions, I am particularly interested in conclusion No. 2, ‘Ageing with dignity’. It reads: The Committee concludes that in further developing the National Strategy for an Ageing Australia, the Australian Government should include a statement of the underpinning the Strategy. In the first instance, the values would promote a basis for debate. Subsequently as a goal/vision against which further development should be tested and measured. The Committee concludes that in further implementing the National Strategy for an Ageing Australia, key messages and information must be developed in such ways as to engage people of all ages, of different backgrounds and relevant to the contexts in which people are living and working. I am particularly proud of the National strategy for an ageing Australia, a document I produced whilst I was Minister for Aged Care. It was the culmination of a series of background papers which commenced in April 1999 with a background paper on what we were hoping to develop in the national strategy. We had five such papers. We had a working group of various ministers and the various papers were sent out to the community to many interest groups. There were many discussions held, input was received and the strategy was developed over a period from 1999 to 2001. In the same period, because I knew that in the International Year of Older Persons we were going to be looking for mature age workers to be playing more of a role in our society as the years went on, I commissioned Access Economics to do some basic research for me in 1999, which resulted in a document entitled Population ageing and the economy. That is still a very good basis of research to see what the ageing of the population means to the economy. It is an issue that I think had been in the background before the International Year of Older Persons, and it was that year that focused attention on the need for us to value the contribution that people will make in an ongoing way. In the foreword I wrote to the National Strategy for an Ageing Australia, I pointed out: Australia’s population is ageing. That means that people are living longer and healthier lives and fewer babies are being born. The full impact of this change will become apparent over the next four decades. The initial effects will be felt as early as 2002 when the first of the baby boomers may consider retiring. The peak of the baby boom, being those born in 1947, will turn 55 years in 2002. By 2010 the number of people reaching 55 will be the same as the number of people turning 15. The baby boomer generation and those that follow are better educated, have better health and more financial capacity than has ever been experienced before. Labor and capital markets will need to respond to the effect of the population ageing. The supply of mature age workers is likely to continue to grow and better utilisation of the skills and experience of mature age workers will be important to sustained economic growth. Increasing numbers of older Australians will drive consumer demand for a different range of goods and services. Businesses that recognise the changing nature of the market and act on it early will benefit enormously. There will be a major change in cultural attitudes as more active older Australians drive a move away from the myths and stereotypes of dependency of older people. I believe that the national strategy for an ageing Australia sets the agenda for many of these changes. My thanks go to the colleagues in the Ministerial Reference Group for their constructive contributions to the development of this strategic framework. As well, I wish to recognise the expert advice we received from the Multidisciplinary Expert Advisory Group and the Business Mature Age Work Force MAIN COMMITTEE Advisory Group. Contributions from the business sector, industry bodies, academia, community organisations and individuals also helped to inject valuable community debate into the national strategy development process. We cannot afford to waste the valuable contribution that older Australians continue to make in our economic and social life. This government will continue to encourage and support the collaborative approach to ageing policy represented by the national strategy and to work with all stakeholders to achieve a better outcome for the whole nation. I still think that what I said in the foreword expresses the way that I thought the debate would go. Along with the Intergenerational report that the Treasurer subsequently brought out, it has meant that there has been a real engagement with these topics and with these discussions. I commend the report for stating in its conclusion that it would be excellent for the government to include a statement underpinning the strategy and to work to promote many aspects of it. I thank the people who worked to produce the body of evidence that backs up their conclusions. More able mature age workers are going to become dominant in economic activity. Back in 1979 I said that I looked forward to seeing lots of advertisements on the television and in magazines that no longer reflected only the younger side of the market but the mature age worker in a way that showed them as being active people who still enjoyed glamour and activity. It is starting to happen, because that is precisely where the disposable income is. As I said in the foreword to the national strategy, it is the people and the firms who wake up to the fact that it is the mature age workers or the older Australians that have that disposable dollar and pitch to it who will be successful. The corollary to all of that is that we have to start looking at young people in their 20s and 30s-people who have burdens of their own. I am delighted that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services that I now chair is conducting an inquiry into what the impediments are to young people having children; why we have a birthrate of 1.7 per female, which is not replacing ourselves; and what difficulties they are finding which cause them perhaps to have no children at all. It is predicted that one-quarter of young women will not have children at all and that others will limit the number-whereas they may have had two they instead have one. We want to examine those issues and look at all the things that impinge upon that decision-making process so that Australia’s future will be looked after not only by older Australians who continue to contribute but also by younger Australians who do not feel they have to be a supermum or superdad in order to have a family and a fulfilling life. though the Future ageing report contains no recommendations-which makes it easy for the government to escape accountability and having to respond to this body of work-it does contain conclusions. Those 17 conclusions indicate that this federal government needs to take urgent steps to address the needs of older Australians right now and to ensure that the situation does not worsen in coming decades as the demand for aged care services rapidly multiplies. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I am disappointed that there will not be a formal government response to this 200-page report. In producing it the committee has considered 192 submissions and heard evidence from 88 organisations. There were public hearings across the country and I am most concerned to ensure that neither the committee nor those who gave evidence and made submissions wasted their time. It is important that this report be responded to-that it does not simply end up on the minister’s bookshelf. MAIN COMMITTEE",133,Committees
187,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (10.06 A.m.),"The first point I wish to make is that alThe electorate of Hindmarsh, which I represent, is the oldest electorate in the country. Twenty per cent of residents are aged 65 or over. That compares with the national figure of about 13 per cent. As such, the electorate is something of a microcosm of the future. The ABS predicts that 25 per cent of Australia’s population will be aged 65 or over by 2042. So, 37 years from now, Australia will look very much like the suburbs of the federal seat of Hindmarsh. That means we will need greater community connectivity, more carers for older Australians and more support for those carers. We will need better dental and health services and more home visiting support services to help people stay in their own homes. For the elderly living in Hindmarsh the toughest thing, apart from social isolation, is the need for much more help at home. Many people I see receive help to shower once or twice a week. They cannot shower themselves and they tell me that the four days between showers go far too slowly. I do not believe that my parliamentary colleagues would find showering just twice a week satisfactory. I am very glad that they shower more regularly than that! A good number of us can expect that our twilight years will not be so comfortable and yet we are doing little to alleviate the pressures of today’s elderly Australians or to make the dramatic improvements that are required so that the situation does not continue to worsen. There are currently around 2.5 million Australians aged 65 or over. By 2042, there will be 6.2 million people in that age category. For those aged 85 or over the increase is even more rapid, going from around 300,000 in that age category now to 1.1 million in 2042. Furthermore, there are currently about five people of working age for every person aged 65 or over. By 2042, that will halve to 2.5 people in the paid work force for every person in aged retirement. This is a crisis that has to be responded to, but I do not agree with the Treasurer that working beyond retirement is a satisfactory solution. Another option flagged in the report is that of cutting the age pension to a basic needs level, but one wonders what there is to cut from an aged pension, especially given the increasing costs of medication and other things. Although the Future ageing report takes a close look at what needs to change over the next few decades if we are to create a future in which a quarter of our population enjoys a reasonable standard of living, I would like to focus on what needs to be done now, because in the electorate of Hindmarsh the future has already arrived and we are not dealing with it well. To start with, the rates of depression among the elderly are alarming. Something like half of the residents of high-care nursing homes are depressed. Around 30 per cent of those living in lowcare homes are depressed and about 20 per cent of older people living in the community are depressed. That is a terribly sad scenario and an indictment of our aged care system. It reflects very badly on us as a community. Our attitudes to the elderly cannot be separated from issues of health and well-being. Older people speak of being invisible to the rest of the population. We fail to capture or recognise the contribution of older Australians. While younger generations are caught up in lifestyles that leave little room for things like volunteering, many older Australians give of themselves and their time willingly. I am a strong believer that this sort of contribution to our society is the glue that makes a community. Whether it is picking up the grandkids-or, indeed, the great-grandkids-from school, spending an hour in the classroom reading stories, delivering Meals on Wheels or helping to run the local senior citizens club, all of these things have to be done and they help give us a sense that we live in a caring community. Too often we fail to recognise the vital importance of such contributions. Maybe if we reminded ourMAIN COMMITTEE selves of what it would cost to employ people to do these things, we would have a greater appreciation of the level of support the community receives from older Australians. Many of these people have gone through wars. They have worked all their lives, they have paid their taxes, they have paid their dues and they have contributed towards building this country. As a society, we cannot turn our backs on them and we cannot forget them. They deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, and as Australians we all owe them at least that much. They built the foundations of this great nation that we live in. Sadly, when people reach a stage where, because of their health, it is more difficult for them to make such a contribution, we do not demonstrate our thanks to them with high-quality health care. The need for nursing home care is so great that there is a nursing home bed shortage in Hindmarsh of approximately 430 beds. That is 430 elderly people who desperately need full time institutional care and cannot get it. Dental care is also a significant problem. The need for improved dental care was argued very strongly by both the Council on the Ageing and the National Rural Health Alliance. The alliance pointed out that poor dental health is closely linked with cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes and nutritional deficiencies, and yet the government cut funding to the Commonwealth Dental Health Program in 1996. Now people can expect to wait up to five years to see a dentist through the public system. Clearly that has to be addressed if we are serious about looking after older Australians. Respite services for older Australians who are caring for their spouse are also inadequate. The effect on their health of not being able to get respite care creates a situation where both people need to go into a nursing home. Once people are in nursing home care, their visits to hospital are poorly managed. They are often sent off to a hospital when, with the right skills and resources in nursing homes, they could have been treated there. When they are released by the hospital, they are often released before they have properly recovered and without adequate discharge planning to ensure that they continue to recover. The Future ageing report identifies the need for an increased focus on preventive health care and early intervention which could reduce the incidence of hospital admissions. Sadly, there is evidence to suggest that older people, especially those with dementia, may actually experience declining health as a result of time in hospital. Hospitals may increase a patient’s dependency, and hospital-acquired infection is obviously a greater risk for those who stay longer. Unfortunately the number of GPs continues to fall and, because the needs of older patients are often more complex, they often do not receive the time or attention that they really need. The skills shortage crisis is being felt very strongly in the aged care sector. There are not enough nurses, dentists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, pharmacists, pathologists or occupational therapists. Perhaps it is ironic that the aged care work force is itself ageing. Around 50 per cent of aged care professionals were aged 45 or over in 2001, and about 30 per cent of nurses currently in the work force will retire in the next 10 to 15 years. Many nurses, in particular, are working well beyond 60, but eventually they will have to retire and, despite attempts to increase nursing numbers, the aged care sector will not attract nurses while the wages remain between 15 and 26 per cent lower than the public service award rate in each state. This government could act right now to address wage parity in the sector, and that would make a significant difference to the care of older Australians. I am aware that increased payMAIN COMMITTEE ments to aged care providers have been made available, but it has been left up to the services to determine whether or not that funding increase is passed on to staff. I predict that places which already have a good standard of care will pay staff better, while others will continue to perpetrate lower quality care by failing to adequately address staff training and remuneration. Unfortunately, nurses are leaving permanent employment for agency work because the conditions are better. The Australian Nursing Federation, in its submission to the inquiry, called for the government to provide additional funding to the aged care portfolio in order to achieve wage parity between nurses working in the aged care sector and those working in the public sector. The Royal College of Nursing, Australia also prioritised nurses’ pay in its submission to the inquiry. Unfortunately, it highlighted the recommendations from the Senate inquiry into nursing and the Department of Health and Ageing report on recruitment and retention of nurses in residential aged care. It is unfortunate because it is hardly news to this government that something needs to be done as a priority and yet report after report goes unheeded. It will be important to monitor this issue to see how much nurses’ wages within the aged care sector improve over the next few years. It is clear that aged care services face a dramatic crisis point if this is not addressed, given that around 90 per cent of primary health services for older Australians are provided by nurses. If they continue to drop out of the sector, care will be provided by poorly qualified, low-skilled workers or it will not be provided at all. If left unattended, the health of older Australians will decline rapidly until there is a crisis which requires hospitalisation. That, of course, will lead to increased pressure on already overburdened hospitals. As well as a pay scale more commensurate with the work performed, the Australian Nursing Federation called for minimum education standards for all unlicensed nursing and personal care assistants in the aged care sector as a matter of urgency, as well as improved accreditation standards for the aged care sector. It is clear from all this information that there is much more work that needs to be done to improve our existing aged care system. There is also a great deal more that needs to be done to improve the quality of life for elderly Australians, whether they live at home or in formal aged care. It is frightening to think about how we are all failing older Australians today, because the demand for services will double or triple by 2042. So far, we do not have a plan for how we are going to address that, and yet it is very clear that we cannot continue on our current path. I urge the minister to read the Future ageing report thoroughly and to respond to each of the conclusions it makes. National strategy for an ageing Australia, which I developed as Minister for Aged Care. Leave granted. Dr EMERSON (Rankin) (10.17 a.m.)-It is a pity that the Future ageing report did not get to the point of producing recommendations-it did produce a set of conclusions. Since it has not produced recommendations, the government will not be responding to the report. That itself is a great shame, because the issues raised in the report about the ageing of the population and the capacity of Australia to pay for decent health and aged care for an ageing populaMAIN COMMITTEE",135,Committees
188,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar) (10.17 A.m.),"I seek leave to table a copy of thetion is a very important one indeed. Arguably, it is the most critical challenge facing this country in the next 40 years. The truth of the matter is that Australia’s natural rate of increase in population will be such that by the mid-2030s our country will not have an increasing population-it will begin to stagnate-and it will be only through a vigorous immigration program that we will be able to prevent the population from declining in absolute terms. So we certainly face the prospect of a stagnating population, but, in addition, the population will be much older than it is today. By the mid-2040s, the share of Australia’s population that is over 65 is projected to double from around 13 per cent in 2004 to 26 per cent. Indeed the official projections are for an increase of four million in the number of Australians over the age of 65 by the mid-2040s, compared with one million extra between the ages of 15 and 55, another million extra between the ages of 55 and 65 and 200,000 fewer children in Australia. Never will it be truer that our children are our future, because we will have a much older population and a scarcity of young people in this country by the mid-2040s. Associated with these developments is the fact that the proportion of the working age population in the total population will fall-that is, the overall dependency ratio of older Australians and younger Australians on the working age population will worsen very substantially. The Intergenerational report forecasts that in 40 years time only 55 per cent of Australians will be working-so that will be 55 per cent of Australians working to support 45 per cent of Australians who are either too young or too old to work or who, for some other reason, may be of working age but not participating in the work force. This is a lower ratio than Australia’s historically low point of the early 1980s recession, but it is expected to be a permanent feature of the Australian economy for the foreseeable future. Treasury has pointed to the ageing of the population as being the dominant cause of the expected slowdown in growth in gross domestic product per person over the next 40 years. It is worth reiterating those projections. It is projected in the Intergenerational report that from 2010 onwards Australia will experience its slowest rate of economic growth per person since the decade of the Great Depression. That is a very sobering thought, and governments need to be dealing with that challenge here and now and not put it off to the future, because it requires early action. Australia’s ageing population is the product of two forces: fewer babies and longer lives. Australian women are having fewer babies now than they were in previous decades. At present, Australian women are having around 1.75 children. That is down from 1.9 in the early 1990s, 2.8 in the early 1970s and a peak of 3.5 at the height of the baby boom in the early 1960s. So we have seen a halving of fertility from the peak of the baby boom through to the early part of the 21st century. Australia’s fertility rate fell below the replacement rate way back in the mid-1970s and continued to slide probably until about 2003. There is some early evidence that the fertility rate might have risen slightly from 1.75 to 1.8 in 2004. It is possible that women in their 30s may be coming to the conclusion that they are starting to have a family too late. There are some suggestions from Professor Peter McDonald at the Australian National University that there might be a mini baby boom going on amongst women in their 30s as they realise that perhaps they need to have their children now. So there are suggestions that fertility might rise slightly from 1.75 to 1.8. That can be achieved by just five per cent of women of childbearing age deciding to have one more child. That would be a good thing. MAIN COMMITTEE However, fertility among women under the age of 30 continues to fall, so it is quite difficult to envisage the overall fertility rate in Australia rising much above 1.8 over the coming decades. The Intergenerational report is more pessimistic than that. Its projections are based on a fertility rate of 1.6 by 2042. Australia is not alone in declining fertility. This is being experienced all around the Western world. So there will be a slowing of population growth all around the Western world. That itself has implications for skill shortages; for the dependency of older and younger people on the working age population; and ultimately for issues of great debate, such as international immigration-because there will be a shortage of young people around the globe. That will certainly be the case in the Western world but also in countries like China. The one-child policy in China is creating a situation now where the Chinese are realising that their population growth rates are falling away. It is probably not the problem in China that it is going to be in Australia, but this is a common characteristic all around the world. Even if Australia could somehow increase those fertility rates tomorrow, that would not have any positive effect on the ageing of the population for almost two decades, when today’s newborns begin entering the work force. Until then, the fiscal pressures, the pressures on budgets, would actually worsen as extra budget spending on those young people in the form of education, child care and related expenses would be unmatched by additional taxation revenue. Increases in the fertility rate would in fact increase the youth dependency ratio over that time. While it would be in Australia’s long-term interest to raise fertility rates, in the next 40 years that would increase rather than reduce the proportion of the population that is dependent on the working age population. If we are serious about dealing with the very long-term consequences of an ageing population, we must consider policies to halt the decline in fertility whilst also increasing work force participation, especially the participation of women. I have dealt with one aspect-that is, that women are having fewer babies. The other aspect contributing to the ageing of the population is that Australians are living longer, and that goes to the heart of the report. Australia’s death rate has fallen from 8.5 per 1,000 in the early 1970s to 6.9 per 1,000 in the early 1990s and to 6.7 per 1,000 in the early 2000s. Over the last century, male life expectancy has increased from around 55 years to 77 years, and female life expectancy has increased from around 59 years to 82 years. So the women are living longer than the men, and that is a good thing. It would be terrific if the men could catch up, but as Australians we should be happy to see any improvement in longevity in this country. The Intergenerational report forecasts life expectancy to continue to rise over the next 40 years, to 82½ years for males and 87½ years for females. So Australians will be living longer, and that would add around five years to the expected life of Australians born in 40 years time. The reality is that the die was cast half a century ago for the ageing of the population over the next 40 years. While I do not agree with the Treasurer on too many issues, when he says that ‘demography is destiny’ he is right-the die is cast in terms of the ageing of the population. In the coming four decades, ageing baby boomers born in the 1950s and 1960s will replace the small numbers of older Australians born in the 1930s and 1940s. But there is an alternative scenario which is also quite realistic-that is, that we have underestimated the increase in longevity, that there will be further marvellous technological and medical advances such that people will be living even longer than has been forecast. If that happens then all of the budgetary implications and projections and all of the impacts on Australia’s economic growth and MAIN COMMITTEE prosperity will be even more severe. If there is any risk to this, it is the risk that Australians will be living longer-which in fact is a good thing, because we are all here to improve the quality and length of life of the Australian people-and that would put even more pressure on budgets and pose even greater creative challenges in sustaining prosperity over the next 40 years. So how do we pay for an ageing population? There are two ways. One is to increase work force participation by working age Australians. Fundamental to that is increasing the participation of working age women while at the same time allowing them to balance work and family life. We want to maintain and, if we can, increase fertility a little, so we do want women to have babies but at the same time be able to balance work and family life so that they can participate in the work force. Here, the idea of coming back to work on a part-time basis some time after having a baby makes a lot of sense. But there are huge impediments to that. One of the impediments is the high effective marginal tax rates that women in those circumstances face. Another impediment is the relative cost of child care in Australia. There has been some analysis of the potential returns from increased child-care investment in this country, and those returns are large indeed. To take the polar example, if Australia’s public subsidies for child care were raised to the level of those in Denmark-which has the highest level-there would be a very large increase in work force participation on the part of Australian women, which would be good. Why do I focus on Australian women? For two reasons. One is the challenge of balancing work and family life. The other is that Australian women are much better educated now than they were 30 years ago. We have a highly educated group of women who, if they are in the work force, will contribute greatly to Australia’s productivity growth. The second remedy for dealing with the economic challenges of an ageing population lies in another ‘p’: productivity growth. Here the story is becoming more familiar. We need to ensure that productivity growth in this country is sustained; yet the Intergenerational report forecasts that it will slump back to its mediocre 30-year long-term average by the end of this year. Treasury must have had a crystal ball. Australian productivity growth has turned negative. It has not just slumped back; it is now negative, according to figures released by the national accounts. The OECD, in its latest country report on Australia, has warned about that. Rather than sitting on our hands saying, ‘This is too hard,’ we need to restore the productivity growth that was the legacy of the economic reform program of the Hawke and Keating governments. How do we restore productivity growth so that we can pay for quality health and aged care for an ageing population? By investing-by investing in intellect, ideas and infrastructure, the three i’s. We need to invest in the intellect and the skills of our young people; we need to ensure that our young people from disadvantaged communities can participate in our education system all the way through school and off into technical education and university. We need to ensure that Australia is an innovative nation so that we support research and development in this country, and we need to ensure that Australia has the infrastructure needed to sustain increased productivity growth-infrastructure that not only reacts to population pressures but anticipates them so that we have modern infrastructure as the source of productivity growth in this country. That is the basis of a plan to deal with the challenge of the ageing of the population. I hope the government will start taking notice of this problem. MAIN COMMITTEE Deputy Speaker McMullan. The report Future ageing, which is the result of an inquiry into long-term strategies to address the ageing of the Australian population over the next 40 years, is of particular interest to me, especially as the second half of the inquiry started to address problems in rural and regional areas. The opportunity to speak on this report also comes at a useful time, because last week I attended what was termed a ‘conversation’ under the auspices of the Council for the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, CHASS. CHASS is a new umbrella body, established on 16 June 2004, representing a range of interests of researchers, educators and practitioners working across associated disciplines. We listened to Professor Hal Kendig and Professor Sue Richardson discussing three questions on the topic of ageing, done in the style of a conversation between two people. It was a novel way of imparting information and was really stimulating for the small group that participated. The basis of the conversation was Professor Kendig’s paper explaining how Australia is undergoing a historical transformation to an ageing society. As with other developed countries, population ageing has resulted largely from the extension of life and the control of fertility, both of which are significant social achievements. We really have to reconsider the process of ageing and how it affects us now rather than when policies were written some decades ago. Let us face it: we are living longer. This has some surprising results. Thirty years ago, a working man would work for 40 years and then retire, and he would expect to live perhaps another 10 or 15 years at the most. Nowadays, if people retire at 60, they may have another 30 years of life. This has great implications for things like superannuation, the age of retirement, health and leisure needs and the role of families, and we may even have to change the definition of work. With the introduction of new treatments and better health care, many of those older people are still living very productive lives at over 80 years old. Both my mother and my mother-inlaw are cases in point. My mother still drives around the town in which she lives, looks after her younger male companion, cooks, knits and enjoys outings with her sisters. My mother-inlaw, who is 87, lives on her own. She just passed her driving test again and promptly drove a friend of hers up the east coast, some three hours drive there and back. She plays mah-jong, teaches students with literacy problems and is still involved in Riding for the Disabled. She goes to the University of the Third Age, and she is currently writing a memoir as well. Our generation wants to be able to be useful to and part of our communities. Resources need to be found to enable people to continue leading full and active lives, even after they have had some minor health or mobility problems. So there are many real challenges in this new Australia, as an ageing nation-but that does not mean it has to be negative. We need to reconsider our attitudes towards ageing in a much more positive light. Those who are fit may need to be active and involved so as to remain fit. They can obviously be involved in the economy in all sorts of ways. In the past, planning has only been involved in looking after physically elderly people, and otherwise they have not been part of our planning process. That is a pity, as many of them are capable of being part of the caring side of this equation and should be economically able to do so. MAIN COMMITTEE",138,Committees
189,Mr Adams (Lyons) (10.32 A.m.),"Thank you for taking the chair at the moment, MrOne of the barriers is that those on an old age pension are unable to share their home with another pensioner without losing part of their pension. This is a silly state of affairs. It lands many old people in lonely situations, when they could be sharing their houses and lives with others and being mutually helpful. As it is, only married or de facto couples are able to have any sort of companionship in life. These sorts of financial arrangements need to be reviewed, in order that those who are capable of living an independent and satisfying lifestyle can do so, with a little bit of assistance from a friend. Carer payments, too, need to be reconsidered, as not all older people want someone living in their space but may need daily assistance of some sort or another. Surely it is better to keep the person out of a home and have an official carer on a very small allowance than to pay for the cost of full-time institutional care. I believe this report is a good start in developing strategies, but dialogue should continue between those who are making a study of these issues and those who are attempting to plan for the future. An ideal way to do this is to set up avenues of dialogue or conversations between politicians and academics-to have the debates in a more informal style so that the discussion can go backwards and forwards, hearing people’s experiences and having them backed up by research that is currently going on. The most important of all the outcomes of this report is probably conclusion 11: the capacity of individuals and families to save for their retirements. This has been taken up in discussions on superannuation, but super is not going to be enough as it is currently constructed. As people live longer they may wish to work longer-or at least be seen to be part of the work force, in perhaps a less active role-and employers need to be encouraged to consider older workers as part of their potential work force. Thirty years of experience can be worth far more than three years of training in some areas. Conclusion 10 recognises this but, without a concerted effort to make it worthwhile for employers, it will not happen. We are talking about taking in more skilled workers in our migration program, yet we have a source of highly skilled workers available-except, they are old. These days, anything over 45 in the workplace seems to be considered old. We talk a lot about the shortage of skilled workers, but we have really to only look in our communities for that older resource. Mind you, many older workers will not be encouraged back to work, where one is looking for people to staff nursing homes and hostels, unless they are offered decent wages and conditions. The allocation of funds for wages is way under that for nursing staff and aids in hospitals. That needs to be addressed if some of the past staff are to be encouraged back. There is a prime area there that can be dealt with by government policy. While I think it is vital that we ensure that we keep people in their homes as long as possible, for those who have to find an alternative when they need some care, there needs to be good care and an ability for the various organisations involved in care for the elderly to employ suitable and trained staff. Money has to be found to ensure that people who have to go into homes get the best care and do not end up being lost and forgotten, which we hear about from time to time. So we need to keep our systems of accreditation and monitor the care levels of homes and institutions, whoever runs them. Computers have now arrived in some nursing homes and hostels, which adds to the modern activities and quality of the lives of those who are being cared for but who still need stimulus and access to the outside world. MAIN COMMITTEE I am glad also that the report recognises, in conclusion 13, the role that respite care plays in the community and that hospitals need to be resourced to ensure that they can give that care and also are able to move the patient from high care to low care-perhaps into another place-in order to free up urgent hospital beds. The way funding is structured, it seems that the ‘step down’ place is missing. I have heard of people being discharged without any backup care being in place, sometimes late at night-and, if they live in country areas, without any means of getting home. It makes it extremely difficult for them. We need that sort of thing to be sorted out so that there is funding available for the development of this sort of care. The direction we do not want to follow is the one that the federal minister has come up with this week-that is, for community care services for elderly and disabled Australians to be put out to competitive tender, with some services likely to close and others to be disrupted. The shadow minister, Senator McLucas, brought this to our attention only yesterday. Those community care services are built on the back of knowledge about client needs and local geographic issues, which could be lost if services are taken over by larger national or international operators. The relationship between community care providers and the many thousands of Australians relying on their services is very personal and is established over a long period. It is based on trust and an understanding of individual and local needs. This rushed tendering process could place at risk those essential personal relationships, and levels of care could fall. It is this sort of change that can cause chaos and result in the running down of services, as there is no continuity between the groups who lose and win tenders. So this is another area that needs to be looked at carefully when future directions are being considered. The Minister for Ageing should read this report and take particular note of conclusion 17 in relation to this last point I have made. The committee was concerned at the evidence of the inadequacy of education and training to fit health and allied health professionals for working with an ageing population. The tendering of positions will certainly get in the way of ensuring that suitable people are available in each community and have the community’s interests at heart. In conclusion, this report covers a lot of areas, including many that are of great concern to those in care. It is a start for a broader look at the long-term question of ageing in Australia. I am glad to see the parliament doing this work, and I hope the government takes some notice of the findings. Debate (on motion by Miss Jackie Kelly) adjourned. Iraq: Australian Task Group Deployment Debate resumed from 8 March, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the document. lem that arises from the recent ministerial statement on Iraq-and, in fact, the most fundamental problem that arises from the whole focus on Iraq, which is so central to the way in which the government deals with Australian foreign policy and security concerns-is that it is a misplacement of priorities. It draws significant resources from areas of much more pressing importance to Australia, whether in the direct security sense involving deployment of troops MAIN COMMITTEE",142,Committees
190,Mr Sercombe (Maribyrnong) (10.46 A.m.),"To my mind, the most fundamental probor other Defence Force personnel or through the sheer level of attention that Iraq requires from the Australian foreign policy and security institutions. We do have substantially more important issues on our agenda, and Iraq and the focus it requires is a fundamental distraction from those important priorities. That is indicated in a very good recent report produced by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. The executive summary of that report talks about Australia’s top three foreign policy challenges, and it is no surprise that Iraq is not in the top three. The top three challenges that this very highly respected think tank identifies are US-China relationships, the future of Indonesia and the problems of Papua New Guinea and, I would suggest, by extension the Pacific more broadly. The fundamental failure-the fundamental lost opportunity-that the government’s preoccupation with Iraq represents in Australia is that it distracts us from much more important things. Having said that, I think all people in Australian public life hope for the best in Iraq. For example, we hope that the place does not descend into a civil war involving the Shia majority and the Sunni minority. That would be catastrophic. In an international context, we hope that issues do not descend into conflict between Turkey and the Kurdish population of Iraq. There are also concerns about what Iran’s role may be in the future of Iraq. But all these things are not front and centre, mainstream concerns for Australia. They distract attention, and they are fundamentally things that we cannot directly impact on through our involvement. We are very much bit players in Iraq-and by that I mean no disrespect to the very courageous Australian service men and women who are involved there. We remain bit players in Iraq, whereas closer to home, on issues that are more fundamentally important to Australia, we can have a direct and positive impact, and we should not be distracted from those issues. If one looks at the Pacific, one sees a range of extraordinarily important challenges, and if Australia applies resources to them it can have a very significant impact and turn things around. When one looks through a list of issues affecting the Pacific, one notes the endemic corruption that affects a variety of Pacific island societies; one sees very deficient systems of governance in a range of areas and is aware that these inadequate governance arrangements generate the sorts of problems that we are sometimes needed to intervene in, somewhat belatedly, to contribute towards their resolution. The Solomon Islands is one example. There is a track record in some Pacific island societies of economic mismanagement and, in most of them, very low growth rates, which potentially produce very real problems in the future. There is a paralysis in some Pacific societies of the law and justice systems. There are chronic and terrible environmental problems in a number of Pacific island societies. Australia is in a position to help if it focuses squarely on, and puts its resources into dealing with, these problems. In our own right we can have a serious impact on such problems rather than being distracted by adventures supporting GeorgeW Bush in some other part of the world-areas that we are not going to have a major role in, because we are there simply as part of a support cast. If we focus on the areas where we can have a direct impact we can significantly enhance Australia’s international position and security position. There is another issue which is looming as a major challenge indeed. I do not think most Australians understand the extent of the health problems in Papua New Guinea. One of Papua New Guinea’s most pressing challenges in the period ahead will be arresting and dealing with the rapid acceleration of infection rates of HIV-AIDS. Tragically, MAIN COMMITTEE Papua New Guinea could well reach the level of infection rates of sub-Saharan Africa. Australia is in a position to apply resources to address this potential looming catastrophe. We are simply not doing enough. Fortunately, under continual prodding, this government is in fact looking at addressing some of the issues in Papua New Guinea-for example, through the enhanced cooperation package. We in the opposition have been supportive and wanting to strongly encourage this government’s engagement. But, as the ASPI-Australian Strategic Policy Institute-report on Papua New Guinea, produced at the end of last year, makes quite clear, a great deal more is needed to be done. For example, the ASPI report says: More importantly, by placing Australian officials into line positions in the Papua New Guinea police force and in government, the ECP reverses the trend of disengagement and marks the first decisive step back to deeper commitment in New Guinea. Moreover, it should have a positive, practical effect on policing and other areas of PNG governanceand here is the rubbut we need to be realistic. Despite its scale and cost, and while a good step in the right direction, the ECP is too limited in scope to have a substantial impact on the breadth and depth of PNG’s problems. This respected institution is making it clear that substantially greater effort is required from Australia and, I would suggest, a number of its Pacific partners, in addressing the potential catastrophic decline of conditions in Papua New Guinea. But our focus is on the Middle East. As I have said, the Middle East is important in a global sense and it is important to Australia. But we can only have a minimal impact in our own right on the Middle East, and a number of countries, particularly European countries, are now looking at disengaging from Iraq. Our foreign policy and security establishment is focused on issues which are in some respects peripheral to Australia. We need them to focus on the issues and regions we can have a core impact on, which are those issues and regions that ASPI refers to and particularly those issues that impact on Papua New Guinea and the Pacific. The war in Iraq is sometimes talked about as bringing democracy and combating terrorism. I would suggest there are some much more effective ways in which Australia can contribute to those objectives. There is a general consensus that poor governance and poverty are intertwined with threats to national and regional security. For example, at her confirmation hearing, the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, said, ‘Disease and poverty have the potential to destabilise whole nations and regions.’ At a launch of a UN report recently, the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, said, ‘We cannot treat issues such as terrorism or civil wars or extreme poverty in isolation.’ Even our own foreign minister, in his recent statement on Australian aid, acknowledged some of these points. Frankly, what I think we need is a far more resolute focus on some of these issues but somewhat closer to home in our own region. There are a number of serious deficiencies in Australia’s aid program that have a capacity to relate to Australia’s efforts on regional and global security. The most notable one is the inadequate scale of our involvement, despite the extreme generosity shown by individual Australians. For example, in the context of the recent tsunami in the Indian Ocean, even with the apparently huge undertaking that the Australian government gave of about $1 billion in aid and soft loans to Indonesia, the overall effect on Australian aid is a rise to 0.28 per cent of gross national income from 0.26 per cent prior to the government’s recent announcement. That is down towards the bottom end of the OECD averages. The OECD average of GNI contributed to overseas development is about 0.4 or MAIN COMMITTEE 0.41 per cent. We contribute somewhere between 0.26 and 0.28, and the international view is that the contributions of developed economies should be rising towards something like 0.7 per cent of GNI if millennium development goals, which our government nominally signs up to, are to be achieved. Instead, we are devoting resources in areas where we are not going to have a major impact and which, frankly, result in ignoring crucial issues such as contributing to development goals closer to home. Some of these points have been made by my colleague the member for Griffith in the recent debate on the foreign minister’s aid statement. I think it is worth referring here to a submission that has just recently been given to government by the Australian Council for International Development-ACFID, as it is known-for the 2005-06 budget. ACFID says: Whilst aid for governance activities has rapidly increased to ... one-third of all ODA, and is dominated by spending on law and order, less than 18% of the Australian sector allocatable program went to basic social services (basic health, education, water, and sanitation) in 2001 and 2002. The OECD’s Development Assistance Committee report makes similar points in relation to the balance and priorities within Australia’s aid program. In my view, we need a bigger aid program, one that is more broadly targeted to important objectives in relation to improving governance. I have referred to that as an important objective for Australia’s foreign and security policy as well as aid policy, but we should not be doing that at the expense of commitment to the provision of basic services such as health and sanitation and the like. As I say, there are really significant issues arising from an overview of our aid. For example, our aid program does not give enough priority, in my view, to the countries like Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands in assisting in managing important sectors of their economies such as their forestry. It is arguable that forestry, in particular in Papua New Guinea-and certainly the historic record shows this to be true in the Solomons-has been one of the underlying causes of poor governance and deteriorating standards of security because of inappropriate conduct within that industry. It is important for our aid budget to focus on ensuring that the forestry sectors in those countries are on a sustainable basis but also on a basis that does not lead to deterioration in governance standards. Another important point to make in relation to our aid commitments is that there should be some real commitment to Australia achieving the United Nations millennium development goals. The minister, in his recent statement on the overseas aid program, paid lip-service to one of those goals, but there are seven of them. As the ACFID report to the government says, fundamentally Australia’s aid for the basic services identified in the United Nations millennium development goals is stagnating as a proportion of aid funding. The United Nations is conducting a summit in September this year to review progress on achieving the millennium development goals. I hope that the Prime Minister will have the decency to reflect the importance that the international community places on the millennium development goals as a framework for addressing some of the core problems that lead to instability and global conflict, by attending that summit in September and committing Australia to a real and serious attempt to address Australia’s responsibilities in relation to international development and achieving sustainable development so that poverty in the world can be seriously tackled. Poverty, after all, is a fundamental source of international instability. It is a fundamental issue underpinning the capacity of terrorists to get an audience and to get their often obnoxious phiMAIN COMMITTEE losophies accepted in underprivileged or underdeveloped societies. We have a real obligation, if we want a more stable international community, to address that. That process, in my opinion, is not helped by Australia’s preoccupation with Iraq. As I keep saying, we are essentially-and I say this without any disrespect to the courageous Australian men and women who serve there-a bit player in Iraq. There are places in our own region where we can have a major and most significant impact. Those are the areas to which Australia needs to give its priority and its focus. Maribyrnong in relation to Australia being a ‘bit player’ in Iraq. Yes, that is true in the scale of things but, on the other hand, Australia has established itself as the littlest big country in the world-some might think of it as the biggest little country in the world-because the influence that we now exercise in so many international fora is out of proportion to the size of our population. The government can take great credit for building the influence that we now have right across the world. Many Australians have been uncomfortable with what Australia has been involved in, particularly in Iraq. I have had correspondence from Australians who say, ‘I feel like leaving the country because of Australia’s position,’ but I think that those people are coming to realise now that the decisions taken by the government in relation to Iraq were correct. It has in fact worked out, and it has worked out for the better-not only in our nation’s interests but also in the interests of the people of Iraq. I well remember the pictures of absolute joy when Australian Iraqis found themselves able to vote for the first time in an Iraqi election-in fact, they were the first Iraqis in the world to vote for the first time in an Iraqi election. It was wonderful, and I was mighty proud that our country was part of achieving that in such a sensible way. There are a number of Iraqi refugees in my electorate. They very much appreciate being able to live in Australia, but they also very much appreciate what Australia has done for the Iraqi people back in their homeland. I have been told first-hand of some of the awful things that happened in Iraq-things that those who make a lot of noise about Australia’s involvement do not seem to ever realise or understand. I have seen members of the Defence Forcelong-seasoned group captains-reduced to tears over what they have seen in Iraq, the atrocities that they have had to deal with. It was a very personal thing to see that happen, but it is important to understand and to recognise that Australia is helping to address those sorts of things. I think we all knew the latest commitment of 450 troops from the 1st Brigade would be unpopular. I think we also know that, deep down, the Australian public support the government in what it is doing because it is doing it for the right reasons. As the Prime Minister has correctly pointed out, this is a humanitarian move. It is to protect Japanese engineers. It is also to help retrain members of the Iraqi army. It is based in a relatively safe part of the country. Australia will go and do its bit in helping to rebuild Iraq. What is known is that the Iraqi people themselves very much appreciate the contribution that Australia makes. This decision was also unpopular for another reason-that is, Australia’s 3rd Brigade in Townsville did not get to go. When the PM made his announcement I rang the brigade commander to check if anyone from Townsville was going. He made it quite clear to me that his people would have liked to have been able to take part in Iraq, and I understand that. Townsville is the home of the ready deployment force, the members of which spend their entire serMAIN COMMITTEE",144,Ministerial Statements
191,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (11.02 A.m.),"I am interested in the comments of the member forvice life training and preparing to go at a moment’s notice. But, of course, every unit in the Australian Army cannot go. This time it was the turn of the 1st Brigade. I was very pleased to see that Lieutenant Colonel Roger Noble was appointed as the commanding officer. Roger was very well known in this place a few years ago as a liaison officer on the parliamentary Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee before he was transferred to 2 Cavalry Regiment in Darwin. He is a fine officer and he will do a great job, as our other officers do in Iraq, keeping our troops out of harm’s way and producing the results that we need. Wherever the Australian Defence Force goes-currently it is deployed all over the world; there are little deployments and fairly major deployments-it is so highly regarded. Lieutenant Colonel Peter Daniel, formerly from 3 CSSB in Townsville, now commands our detachment in the Sinai Desert. The Sinai Desert detachment is a peacekeeping force which is designed to keep cordial relations between Egypt and Israel. For many years now a detachment of Australian troops has been in the Sinai Desert between Egypt and Israel making sure that relations remain cordial. We have seen Australian troops go to the Solomons. Most recently, following the murder of Adam Dunning, a ready deployment force from Alpha Company of 1st Battalion went to the Solomons two days before Christmas last year. Just 18 hours elapsed from the time they received notice to the time they were on the ground in Honiara, which is a magnificent effort. The commander of 1st Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Chris Field, who went with Alpha Company, was two weeks ago awarded the American Bronze Star for his service in Iraq on a previous deployment. He is also a very fine officer. The troops look forward to overseas postings, just as they did when going to East Timor. It was Mick Slater, the current commander of the 3rd Brigade, who took the 2nd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment into East Timor in those dark days when all of that trouble came to a head. It is hard for families when the troops are deployed, but when I speak to the families their reaction is: ‘We’re happy to support our partner because that’s our partner’s job.’ It certainly works very well indeed. In relation to the role of the opposition in all of this, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has quite correctly pointed out that the Australian Labor Party has had many inconsistent positions on Iraq. One of the things that the Australian people most admire about our Prime Minister is that when he says something he means it. He is consistent in what he does. What he does may not be popular with the Australian people, but he follows through because it is the right thing to do. At the end of the day, the Australian people form the view that, yes, it was the right thing to do, and they like that kind of leadership. But we have not seen that attitude from the opposition. In fact, we have seen the national media, even as recently as a couple of weeks ago, editorialising that Kim Beazley’s argument that involvement in Iraq weakens us in the region ‘looks pitiful’. Greg Sheridan, the foreign editor of the Australian said: It is right in principle and it is effective globally, regionally and for Australiathat we send additional troops to Iraq. He continued: It is right in principle because only the terrorists-groups who wish our utter destruction-could benefit from the coalition of the willing abandoning Iraq before it can provide for its own security, and while vital and necessary reconstruction work is still undone. They were wise words from Greg Sheridan, and I hope they were widely read. I would also like to observe that Australia’s relations with Indonesia have been very significantly enhanced again with the help of the Australian Defence Force and the good work that they did in Aceh. MAIN COMMITTEE I think it is a long time since relations have been so good with the ADF and the TNI, and it is a long time since relations have been so well understood between the Australian government and the government of Indonesia. We look forward to the presidential visit that is scheduled shortly. It will only further enhance our relations with Indonesia. It should not be forgotten that we also have the ADF Reserves. The Reserve, through Townsville’s 11 Brigade, currently have troops in the Solomons doing their bit for peace in that country. They also have troops posted to Operation Relex, which is an operation that we do not particularly talk about. But they are away from North Queensland at the moment, also working in Australia’s interests, with Reserve soldiers doing a mighty job. I look forward to the ADF parliamentary program, which is coming up in July for me. I am going to join 51 FNQR on Cape York and do a patrol similar to the one that I think the member for Lingiari did a year or so ago. I am going to spend a week with those Reserve soldiers who are attached to 11 Brigade. I am looking forward to that, and my colleague the member for Leichhardt will also be participating. In conclusion, Australians are mighty proud of their Defence Force and will continue to regard it as the most professional and the most capable defence force of its size in the world today. with the views of those who have expressed their support for the Australian Defence Force personnel the government have deployed to Iraq and who they propose to deploy to Iraq as a result of the announcement made on 22 February by the Prime Minister to send an additional Australian task group to Iraq. That of course does not mean that we do not have severe difficulties with the decision taken by the government. We absolutely do. This mirrors the position I have adopted previously about Iraq. In my view we should not have been engaged militarily in Iraq in the first instance. I think the subsequent decisions taken by the government have been wrong. Nevertheless, given the government have made those decisions, have deployed to troops to Iraq and have announced this new deployment, it behoves all of us to ensure that we give our absolute support and commitment to those troops-not only Army troops, of course, but also those people from the Air Force and the Navy deployed within the region. It is possible to understand that we have policy differences with the government over Iraq, and I will come to those in more detail later. WhatI want to do at the moment is concentrate on this new deployment. This new deployment will comprise 450 personnel, the bulk of whom will be drawn from Darwin’s 1st Brigade, from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, and from 57RAR who will now provide infantry support to the cavalry regiment, who will take with them 40 ASLAVs to Iraq. They will be commanded by, as the member for Herbert just said, Lieutenant Colonel Roger Noble. Roger Noble is quite well known to at least some people in this parliament as he was a military adviser to the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and accompanied some of us a couple of years ago to the Middle East, Kuwait and Afghanistan to visit Australian Defence Force personnel in the region. So some of us in this place know him well. We know his competence, we know his professionalism, we know his friendship and we know his intelligence. What we do say about this man is that we all have absolute confidence in his ability to carry out the task which he has been given by the Chief of the Defence Force. That is important. It is good for us to know that we can give our absolute commitment to these people because we know the quality of the leadership they will receive. I have no doubt in my mind at all that Roger Noble will do absoMAIN COMMITTEE",148,Ministerial Statements
192,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (11.15 A.m.),"Let me first indicate that, in the broad, I concurlutely everything within his power to ensure that the task which they have been allotted will be carried out successfully and that he will bring his troops home safely. Their initial deployment will be for six months. As I understand, they will be heading to Iraq in the next few weeks. It is important to understand the context in which we provide that support. It is true-and the observation needs to be made, as the member for Herbert has just done-that people trained in our armed forces have a desire to use the skills which they acquire during their training and to be in an active unit. To be on active service in the way in which this new task group will be is the aspiration of all of those who serve in the Australian Defence Force, including soldiers, naval personnel and air personnel. Their aspiration is to use the skills that they have acquired during their training. It is no surprise, then, that those who have been deployed, despite the trepidation of going to Iraq, are confident in their ability, their training and their equipment and are looking forward to it. They know that their families will be nervous and that there will be trepidation. It is important, then, that they understand that, despite the political differences that we on this side of the parliament have with the government over their deployment, they have our absolute commitment and support in the task. Once deployed, they know that they can rely upon us to support them. We will ensure through our monitoring of the arrangements that their equipment is up to scratch so that they can have absolute confidence that the equipment they are provided with will, as far as possible, keep them from harm and allow them to do their task with confidence. Despite the fact that they are not going to the capital and that by and large where they are going there have been comparatively fewer incidents of the type we have seen in the capital and other regions, we should understand that this will not be comfortable and that this little exercise will be no picnic. These people will be in a very uncomfortable environment. They will be there in the peak of summer in extraordinarily inhospitable country. It will be very, very hot. We were in Kuwait at about the same time-July, from memory-and it was hellishly hot. I live in Alice Springs in Central Australia and I think I know what hot weather is like. The heat there will be oppressive. It is important that we understand that this will not be beer and skittles. This is a difficult task that they have been confronted with; this is a difficult task that they have been given. But they should know, as I am sure they do, that they have our support and that we wish them well. As these defence personnel come from the Darwin region and train at Robertson Barracks, I certainly know that they will have the support of the people of the Northern Territory, the Northern Territory government, and their families and friends. As someone who is generally opposed to war, did not support the initial deployment to Iraq and still does not, I say that it is remarkable the confidence you can have in your military personnel once you get to know people. This is a general statement, but I think it will bear very close scrutiny: to a person, the senior officers in charge of looking after our Defence Force are very capable and very professional people. They are able to make decisions and lead. We know that the training that they put in place is second to none. We also now know that the equipment that they are using is of the highest standard. What we need to ensure is that any upgrades to the equipment that need to be made are made in sufficient time to ensure that no-one is disadvantaged. MAIN COMMITTEE Having said all of that, I also say that it is important that we acknowledge that we may well be on the precipice of further deployments of Australian troops. We heard only yesterday that the Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, has decided to pull out their 3,000 troops. They are in the region close to where the Australian troops will be deployed. What we are seeing, of course, is the gradual disintegration of the great coalition. Under those circumstances, it is no surprise that the Prime Minister has been unable to make a commitment to the Australian community that we will not have further forces deployed to Iraq. It is worth reminding ourselves what the Prime Minister said in the parliament yesterday in response to a question from the Leader of the Opposition. He said: ... I repeat what I said when I made the announcement about the additional 450. We do not have any current plans to increase that number but I cannot rule out some changes in the future and I do not intend to do so. I think the Prime Minister has a responsibility to outline exactly to the Australian community what he intends to do. What are the plans for Australia’s future commitments to Iraq? What further deployments of Australian Defence Force personnel will be made into the region? He has an obligation to tell the Australian community what is going to be happening. I know what he must have at the back of his mind, and there is no doubt that increased pressure will come from other members of the troika-the United States and Great Britain. They will give John a ring and say, ‘Listen, John. The Italians have left; others are leaving. Do you think it’s appropriate for you to send some more troops to help us out?’ ask a question. Prime Minister has made it very clear. On 10 April last year he said, fairly emphatically: ‘We are not planning to send any more forces.’ We know from what he has said recently that clearly, in the back of his mind, there is a plan to send future forces. The Australian community needs to know whether or not this is true. He has an obligation to tell the Australian community what his real intentions are. He knows, of course, that this decision by him to provide the additional deployment has not been given a great deal of support by the Australian community. Indeed, we know that the Prime Minister, responsive as he is to polls, would be most concerned by the Morgan poll of 12 March. In that poll, 63 per cent of respondents said that they disagreed with Prime Minister John Howard’s decision to deploy an extra 450 troops to southern Iraq. I do not doubt that that is the case. We need to have some honesty from the Prime Minister. We need him to detail to the Australian community what his government’s future intentions are in terms of Australia’s defence deployment. I have a letter in front of me here. It is worth contemplating. I put out a newsletter on 19 March 2003, which I sent to the electorate of Lingiari, outlining my opposition to the decision by the Australian government to involve us militarily in that conflict. I made the point then, as I make the point now: However, as the government is determined that they are committed and will stay in Iraq we must give themMAIN COMMITTEE",150,Ministerial Statements

Territorians respect and admire the men and women of the ADF and their families for the sacrifices they make for us all. They must obey the orders of the government of the day. This is a major institutional strength of our democracy. And so it is. I know they have my support, but the Prime Minister does not. I know this is the case with a large number of the people in my electorate. They are most concerned about the dishonesty and the lack of integrity which have been exhibited by the Prime Minister over this and other issues. Importantly, to put our country in a position where we are in armed conflict is not something that should be taken lightly. Yet we have had a deployment of an additional 450 troops-and who knows how many more into the future? Heritage) (11.30 a.m.)-In rising to support the motion of the Prime Minister in relation to the Iraq task group deployment, I want to address three core questions. The first is the global challenge facing the world in terms of security and the question of terror and autocracy-twin issues. The second is the question of progress on democratisation and addressing those core problems throughout the Middle East. The third is the specific question of Australia’s role in Iraq, progress on the ground in Iraq and the deployment and role of Australian troops to date and going forward. In looking at the question of the global challenge which we face at present, we find that there are two core problems with which the international security community must deal. The first is in relation to the question of terrorism. It is the creation of what is called a Wahabist philosophy and the militarisation of that philosophy, most obviously seen through September 11, Bali and the tragedy in Madrid. But it was also evident in Afghanistan, where al-Qaeda, under the Taliban, had for itself a state based approach to the future. It had a state base. We were able to see, from one of the least developed countries in the world, what could be done for a state base for al-Qaeda. Against that background, we also see that al-Qaeda views the world in a century-long process. That century-long process is about trying to export and implant its ideology across the globe. Its primary target, its strategic goal over a 30-year period, was to do this by transplanting one of the existing key Islamic states, whether it was Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt or, within our own region, Indonesia. There are two tactics for doing that. The first is to breed fragmentation in any of those countries. The second is to break down the economic base of those countries by driving out Western engagement, which in turn would drive down the economies, which, according to this strategic approach, would break down domestic support for engagement with the outside community. That is the objective; that is the grand climate which we have to deal with. We recognise that there is a group of people at the heart of this ideology who have perverted it and used it as a domestic, internal, internecine conflict within Islam and who have no bounds, no strictures and no constraints on that which they wish to perpetrate. The objective is the maximum degree of human suffering possible. That is the objective and that is the conflagration with which we have to deal. It is not something which we sought; it is not something which in any way we hoped to face; but it is something which we can in no way ignore. That is the challenge facing all good people of all good intent throughout the world. MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Ministerial Statements
196,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andThe second great challenge that we have is in relation to autocracy. There is a fair argument here that, as a Western people, we have arguably been weak and complicit over the last halfcentury, particularly within the Middle East, in tolerating autocracy because it served some strategic purposes. That time is coming to pass, and I think that that is a good thing. It is a difficult process but it is a grand, historic process. The world is being democratised. Firstly, there were the early democratisations that came about as a result of the breakdown of colonialism within Africa and Latin America. Secondly, there was the collapse of the Iron Curtain and the Eastern European autocracies. We are now evolving into a third stage of democratisation, which is the process that needs to occur to break down autocracies within the Middle East. We are at the beginning-not even the middle, let alone the end-of that process. That is the historical context. Against that background, I want to address the question of progress. On the democratisation front, we are seeing early steps. Firstly, Afghanistan has made the most progress. There are still enormous challenges. Kabul, the capital of the country, has seen great steps forward; the Loya Jirga, which is the traditional parliament, has been brought into being; and the President, Hamid Karzai, has been selected. All of these things represent steps forward, but there is no doubt about it: it is imperfect. The alternative would have been to have left the Taliban in place. Mr Bevis interjectingthat view. Mr Bevis interjectingdemocratic process. Although voting put each individual’s life at risk, 58 per cent of the population turned out. It was higher than expected in a process that was more orderly than was expected. The result represented an extraordinarily diverse outcome. It may not have been the outcome that many in the West ideally wanted, but it was thoroughly representative of the will of the people. Is there much more to go on that front? Absolutely. We are in the formative processes of a new government. The third element here is that the Palestinian people, following the death of Yasser Arafat, have also been engaged in a critical act of self-determination in the appointment of the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. That result is again all about the process of personal engagement, of individuals having a stake in the future. Again, it is a step forward but there is much more to be done. It does provide the basis for a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian people. Having lived in that part of the world for a year of my life, I have maintained for over 20 years now that the only solution is a two-state solution that recognises the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people and the legitimate rights of the Israeli people. Going forward, we are now seeing the early stages of a move towards some sort of independence in Lebanon. The mass Eastern European style protests that have occurred in Lebanon following the assassination of the former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri are an extraordinary development. To see that sort of public participation on the streets of a Middle Eastern city, with up to half a million people involved, is unique, certainly within my knowledge. That MAIN COMMITTEE",153,Ministerial Statements
197,Mr Hunt,"If the honourable member wishes that the Taliban were still in place, I respect",154,Ministerial Statements
198,Mr Hunt,"There are differences of opinion. Secondly, Iraq itself has just been through as likely to lead to some sort of Syrian disengagement, but we do not know. There is big history to be played out there. There have been messages from Egypt and Saudi Arabia about possible steps forward. I would regard those with considerable scepticism until such time as we see practical action. Whilst this may not be a Middle Eastern spring yet, what we are seeing is the emergence of a trend. We have a role to play in encouraging that and also in saying that autocracy, as a system of government, is no longer acceptable. To a large extent we have, as a Western bloc, been complicit in accepting that over the past 50 years. What does that mean for progress in Iraq? In Iraq we see three things. Firstly, on the ground Australia has played a critical role, and the new deployment will play a critical role, in helping with security. We currently have 920 Australian defence personnel serving in a variety of roles, from classic security to assistance with training of security forces, which is the ultimate answer: creating an internal capacity to deal with security needs. In addition, as the Prime Minister has announced, we will now be deploying as part of the Australian task group an additional 420 Australian Defence Force personnel to the Al Muthanna province. Their role is a clear one, and that is to provide military backup, along with 40 ASLAV support vehicles, to the Japanese humanitarian presence. This is all part of the international role and the international coalition. From an Australian perspective, it is a critical commitment. It is a dangerous job; it is a difficult job. It is one for which we have the absolute highest regard for those defence personnel involved, all of whom are voluntary members of the Australian Defence Force and who go with our thoughts, wishes, prayers and absolute respect. We are playing that critical role, but the second thing that has been occurring in Iraq is considerable practical progress in the conditions on the ground. Australia’s own contribution has included $126 million to rehabilitation and reconstruction. We have deployed 30 technical experts since March 2003. We have committed $45 million to reconstruction priorities, particularly in agriculture and food, and we have directly assisted in improving all of the elements of water, sanitation and food distribution. Against that background, Australia’s role has been part of a broader international coalition which has seen five million children under the age of five vaccinated against diseases, all hospitals opened and fully staffed-whereas the figure was 35 per cent under the Saddam Hussein regime-110 health clinics opened, 2,500 medical staff trained, 2,500 schools rehabilitated and the teaching of over six million children; all of these things have occurred. Let us not at any point deny the difficulties and the enormous Hobbesian choice which we faced in identifying whether to take action or not. I respect the views of those who believe that the costs of action are greater than the costs of inaction. I respectfully put to them that my personal view is that the cost of inaction, of allowing Saddam Hussein’s regime-which was alleged to have been responsible for over a million deaths or disappearances during its course-to continue, was far greater than the very difficult choice and the very tragic cost of that which has occurred over the last two years. It was a difficult choice, and I respect the position of anybody who chooses alternatively, but neither side should deny the reality of these changes since 2003 or the reality of the task before us. This brings me to the final point I want to make in terms of Iraq itself. That is the question of the alternative. What is the alternative to where we are now and to the process not only of MAIN COMMITTEE committing humanitarian resources, such as Japan and Australia are doing, but of committing the military resources to back them up-to allow Iraq to establish an indigenous security capacity, to allow the Iraqi people to carry through the will that they expressed during the democratic elections of just over a month ago and to maintain their basic infrastructure? The alternative, much as some people would want it, is to let Iraq fall into a system of chaos and internal collapse. We must assist in this process of bedding down the will of the people, which they have expressed very clearly, by making sure that those who would seek to wreak havoc, to carry on the legacy of Hussein or to implant Wahabist ideology and practice are not able to succeed. Unfortunately, there is no basis for negotiations there. These are two groups of people who are set on physical destruction and who have used the Iraqi people as their primary weapons, targets and victims. As a result, the only thing that can be done is to support the international coalition, because not to do so is to allow the collapse of all that has been gained, leading to a humanitarian catastrophe and a security nightmare. For those reasons, we are engaged-if I can return to the beginning-in a grand, historical challenge. There are great security questions which we have to face, in terms of terror and autocracy. What we see is great progress on both fronts, but this is part of an ongoing challenge. For all of those reasons, and because of my coming to this House as a former human rights lawyer who was concerned about what occurred in autocracies, I support what the Australian government is doing, I support the motion and I support the Australian deployment to the Al Muthanna province and the role of the Australian Defence Force. makes than to commit its troops to a conflict situation. There is no more onerous responsibility than sending the men and women of our Defence Force into harms way as an arm of the government of the day. It should never be undertaken lightly or carelessly. It should never be undertaken by deceiving the Australian people either. Before the last election, the Prime Minister made clear on a number of occasions that deployments of this sort would not occur. Only a matter of a few short months after the poll was declared and the parliament resumed, we now find ourselves dramatically increasing the number of troops we have in country. In fact, most of the troops we have generally identified in the theatre of operations around Iraq are not in country. This is the first major deployment of Australian troops in country and is a monumental breach of trust and a breach of the undertaking which the Prime Minister and his Liberal colleagues made during the course of the last election. I want to briefly make some comments about the circumstances in Iraq and why we are in this position in the first place. I do not propose to go over the details of a number of speeches I have made previously citing my concerns about this, but I do want to cite one source and one source only-the editorial of the New York Times. If there are any people on this earth who have a concern in the war on terror, they are the people of New York who suffered during the September 11 2001 tragedy. On June 17 last year, following the report of the commission investigating these matters in the United States, the editorial of the New York Times said this: It’s hard to imagine how the commission investigating the 2001 terrorist attacks could have put it more clearly yesterday: there was never any evidence of a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda, between Saddam Hussein and Sept. 11. It is worth pausing there: never any link, and yet that was the basis upon which this entire invasion escapade was launched. The editorial went on and said: MAIN COMMITTEE",154,Ministerial Statements
199,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (11.45 A.m.),"There is no more important decision a governmentNow President Bush should apologize to the American people, who were led to believe something different. Of all the ways Mr Bush persuaded Americans to back the invasion of Iraq last year, the most plainly dishonest was his effort to link his war of choice with the battle against terrorists worldwide. While it’s possible that Mr Bush and his top advisers really believed that there were chemical, biological and nuclear weapons in Iraq, they should have known all along that there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda. No serious intelligence analyst believed the connection existed; Richard Clarke, the former antiterrorism chief, wrote in his book that Mr Bush had been told just that. There are some startling assessments the New York Times made about the invasion of Iraq that has set us on this course, and I must say the phrase ‘war of choice’ sends a shudder down my spine. This was the war of choice of George Bush, and we now find ourselves intricately involved in it. Originally, the government said we would have no part in the occupation; we would play a part in the invasion. Of course they reneged on that. Then they said we would commit no further troops; they have reneged on that. Yesterday, in the parliament, the Prime Minister refused to give any commitments about additional troops in the future. The Australian people have been badly deceived by this government in the way it has handled this sorry affair. In the early days it spoke about weapons of mass destruction, which it no longer discusses. It would now have us believe the original reason to go to war was regime change. Look through the record. I challenge Liberal members to find, in the debates leading up to our participation in the invasion, a commitment to regime change. In fact, the opposite was the case: government ministers hopped up and said, ‘We’re not concerned about regime change, we’re just concerned about the weapons.’ There is now a rapid rewriting of historical being undertaken by the conservatives in this country, but no amount of that rewriting will change history. This has been one of the most despicable ventures of foreign affairs in the course of Australia’s international life since Federation. Fast forward to today and the situation in Iraq. Barely a month ago, on 16 February, the Director of the US Defense Intelligence Agency, Vice Admiral Jacoby, gave evidence before the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence about the war on terror and the situation in Iraq. Some startling assessments were provided, and I want to read a couple of the comments. Bear in mind that this is the official testimony of the US Defense Intelligence Agency, whom one would expect to be conservative but accurate. They said: Our policiesthat is, America’s policiesin the Middle East fuel Islamic resentment ... Usama Bin Laden has relied on Muslim resentment towards US policies in his call for a defensive jihad to oppose an American assault on the Islamic faith and culture. The point is that what the West has done since September 11, 2001 has in fact exacerbated the threat of terrorism in many respects. It has indeed made it easier for extremists to recruit fellow extremists. These are not my assessments; these are the assessments of the Defense Intelligence Agency of the United States in testimony just four weeks ago to the US Senate. Elsewhere in the same testimony they made this observation about Iraq: The insurgency in Iraq has grown in size and complexity over the past year. I will pause there. We keep getting told that things are getting better. We just heard speakers from the government side tell us that things are getting better. But the US Defense Intelligence Agency say that over the last year they have got worse. I again quote: MAIN COMMITTEE Attacks numbered approximately 25 per day one year ago. Today, they average in the 60s. Someone tell me how that is an improvement in the situation. Again, that is not my testimony, not my view and not some journalist’s view. It is the view of the Director of the US Defense Intelligence Agency on 16 February. Perhaps one of the most telling points in the report, which does impinge directly on us as we deploy 450 brave Australians to that theatre of operations, is: Confidence in Coalition Forces is low. Most Iraqis see them as occupiers and a major cause of the insurgency. If that does not ring some alarm bells amongst people on the other side of the House, they are brain dead. There are going to be potential threats to the Australian troops who will be going to Iraq as a result of the government’s decision. Let me say at the outset that I have nothing but the greatest respect for our Australian defence forces, particularly those people who find themselves in harm’s way as a result of government policy. I strongly believe they should be supplied with all they need to do their jobs, and then some. We should make sure that we look after their health and the welfare of their partners and spouses left behind. We truly wish them a safe deployment and a speedy and safe return. I want to make some comments about a couple of the things they will confront. A cavalry unit is going, taking about 40 ASLAVs. Only some 12 to 15 of those 40 ASLAVs have remote fire capability. Remote fire capability enables the vehicle commander to stay completely protected within the vehicle. We have already suffered injuries in Iraq because of the problems of the vehicle commander being exposed, sitting at the top of the turret with half their body out of the vehicle. Unfortunately, most of the vehicles we are sending do not have that protection, so the commanders of the vehicles will be required to travel with half their body exposed on most occasions. I regard that as unacceptable. We decided to upgrade the ASLAVs that were previously there because there was a threat and we wanted to protect our troops. We are now throwing that protection to the wind and exposing a number of brave Australian troops to a danger they should not be exposed to. I only hope that they are not, in the end, exposed to a danger to their health or life as a result of this. I ask the government, very sincerely, to as a matter of urgency upgrade the ASLAVs, provide the remote fire capability and progressively ship those upgraded ASLAVs to the theatre of operations in Iraq so that all of the ASLAVs that we send on deployment have that protection. Someone said to me the other day when I raised this, ‘But it is not a problem because it is a low threat environment and they will basically be transporting people around.’ You know what? If it is a low threat environment and they are transporting people around then they use Humvees and trucks. The reason they are using lightly armoured vehicles, which are the there. That is why some of them do have remote control fire. The only reason we are sending the rest is that this government has not put the proper procedures in place to guarantee the safety of those troops before departure and is knowingly exposing them to a risk that it should not. In addition to those conventional problems that they will confront, there is another major consideration-that is, in the area of operations in Iraq there were a number of serious battles MAIN COMMITTEE during the war in which depleted uranium munitions were used. When those depleted uranium munitions are deployed they literally shower the surrounding area with radioactive material. There are a number of reports now identifying the threat that that poses. It has been a problem with troops in Bosnia, Afghanistan, and in Gulf War I-and it is a problem in Iraq today. I was concerned when I read the account of a US colonel who is a doctor and medical officer who was involved in looking at those problems in a letter that he wrote to the President back in 1997 dealing with the earlier Gulf War. He said: In the Persian Gulf War some veterans were exposed to radioactive contamination with Depleted Uranium. I personally served in the Operation Desert Shield as a Unit Commander of 531 Army Medical Detachment. After the war I was in charge of Nuclear Medicine Service at Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Wilmington, Delaware. A group of uranium contaminated US Veterans were referred to my attention as an expert in nuclear contamination. I properly referred them for the diagnostic tests to different Institutions dealing with transuranium elements. All of the records have been lost in this Hospital and in referring Institutions. Only a small part of information was recorded in Presidential Advisory Committee report on Gulf War Illnesses. RecentlyI received an order by the Chief of Staff of this Institution to start the veterans examinations again since all of the records have been lost. TodayI was informed in writing that my job was terminated as a reduction in force. I have been at this position for over eight years with an outstanding job performance and I am convinced with certainty that my elimination from the job is a direct result of my involvement in the management of Gulf War Veterans and discrimination for raising nuclear safety issues. The lost records, lost laboratory specimens and retaliations which are well documented point to no less than conspiracy to terminate my efforts of proper management of Gulf War Veterans. You will find similar stories in other defence forces. There is also no doubt whatsoever that exposure to some of the high radiation levels left after the use of these munitions is health threatening. Our Australian troops are going into an environment which has not been decontaminated, which has not been cleaned and which still has a number of areas where this is a problem. Yet the government refused, as I understand it on the basis of answers given in the Senate in the last week, to provide baseline medical tests for all troops going over against which they could subsequently be measured. The government refuse to require everyone when they return to go through a return test. Instead the government put the onus on the troops. The government say, ‘We will provide a test for those troops who ask for one when they come back.’ That is not good enough. This government are quick to send troops away when it suits them. Ministers and the Prime Minister are quick to get a photo opportunity waving the troops off or standing next to the people in khaki uniform. When it comes to looking after their interest, they are quite happy to send them over there with ill-prepared ASLAVs that do not provide protection for the entire battalion going over. They are quite happy to send them over there without ensuring that their exposure to depleted uranium radiation levels is not going to be life-threatening. They are quite happy to send them over there without bothering to guarantee them a test or require them to have a test so that everybody is treated the same. They are quite happy to do all of those things-none of which help our troops on this deployment. This government have repeatedly been quick to behave in an aggressive way in international affairs and to deploy our troops to places of conflict, but they have treated our troops with contempt and a lack of care and consideration that any reasonable person in Australia would have expected. MAIN COMMITTEE I ask the government to take heed of those concerns. I hope that, as a bare minimum, the government urgently upgrades the fire systems on the ASLAVs; ensures that we have more remote fire ASLAVs available for deployment in Iraq, and that, as they come on line during the 12 months, they are made available; and requires a baseline test of all troops when they are deployed and a subsequent test on their return. Finally, I repeat my very best wishes to those troops who are being deployed. I hope they avoid any serious difficulties and that they return soon in good health and in good spirits. Debate (on motion by Mr Ticehurst) adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Vietnam Veterans’ Memorial Project Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide) (12.01 p.m.)-I rise to speak on a matter of great importance to South Australia. ANZAC Day is drawing closer, and our minds are turning to those who have fought for their country, especially those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. I wish to inform the House of a South Australian initiative: the Vietnam Veterans’ Memorial Project. The project, due for completion later this year, has drawn together all groups that represent Vietnam veterans in South Australia: the Returned and Services League of Australia, SA Branch; the Vietnamese Ex-Servicemen’s Association; the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia; and the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia. I understand that this is the first time these groups have come together in this way, and they have done so to build a Vietnam veterans’ memorial, to be situated in the Gilles Plains and Hampstead RSL Gardens. The plan was officially launched on ANZAC eve 2004 and, over the last 12 months, many people have undertaken a great deal of work to see the planning proceed with the speed and attention to detail that it has. I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the work done by all those involved with the project. The prime focus of the memorial is to remember the 61 South Australians who lost their lives on active service during the Vietnam War. Their names will be affixed to the face of the memorial on a bronze plaque. The memorial will also remember all those South Australians who served during the war. It will be the first significant memorial exclusively honouring Vietnam veterans in South Australia. The memorial will consist of a life-size bronze sculpture of two soldiers, which will stand on an imposing granite plinth. As previously mentioned, a bronze plaque will be attached to the granite, bearing the names of the 61 South Australians who did not return from Vietnam. Surrounding the granite plinth and bronze statue will be pavers, laid to represent, from above, the Cross of Valour. These pavers are to be engraved with the names of donors and are being used to raise funds for the project. One thousand pavers at the base of the memorial have been reserved for personal dedication, and it is hoped that they will be purchased by veterans, their families and friends, and South Australians wishing to honour the service of those in Vietnam. I certainly encourage South Australians to support this cause. I note with appreciation the support the South Australian government has given to the project. Premier Mike Rann recently wrote to the Vietnam Veterans’ Memorial Committee informing them that his government will be contributing $21,000 to the building of the memoMAIN COMMITTEE",156,Ministerial Statements
200,Mr Ticehurst (Dobell) (12.00 P.m.),"I move:rial. It is recognition of the uniquely South Australian aspect of the memorial, and I know that the Vietnam Veterans’ Memorial Committee greatly appreciate the funding. On the issue of government funding for the project, I recently wrote to the federal Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, urging her to provide funding for the memorial. I hope that she will bear in mind the great importance of the memorial when considering the issue of funding. In particular, there is great meaning attached to the memorial for the Vietnam veterans community, and the memorial will be a great monument to their service. Perhaps at this moment in time it is poignant that there should be a movement to build such a memorial. It is a time when Australians are serving overseas. It should give us pause for thought. I hope that a government which expects such generosity from the troops it has sent overseas will show the same generosity of spirit to those who have already served and have returned. The memorial will be dedicated later this year and the people’s gaze will fall upon the bronze soldiers atop the granite plinth. It will be a reminder to all who view it, and it is important that we remember. It is important that we reflect on the experiences of those who served, those who did not return and those who still bear the scars of conflict. In summary, I would like to place on record my appreciation as a South Australian for the RSL of South Australia, the Vietnam Ex-Servicemen’s Association, the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia and the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia. Youth Suicide Heritage) (12.05 p.m.)-I want to talk about the problem of youth suicide and the tragedy involved with it, particularly in relation to my electorate of Flinders but also in relation to the nation more generally. I want to outline in three stages the problem, one of the local solutions adopted and the national approach. Over the 13 years from 1990 to 2003, figures show that 47 young people within the electorate of Flinders have taken their own lives. Of those 47 young people, in a pattern which has been fairly consistent over that 13-year period, 42 have been males and five have been females. We are clearly talking about a problem which affects both genders, but in particular we are seeing that suicide affects young males, by a ratio of more than eight to one. Of people between the ages of 15 and 24, 42 out of 47 who have taken their own lives over the last 13 years have been young males. In that context, we have to ask ourselves why this occurs. What leads to this sort of tragedy? Suicide is a result of depression for the main part. That in itself can be clinical, but it can be triggered by a series of factors. Those factors can include alcohol and drugs. In addition to that, there can be underlying concerns, whether it is the breakdown of the family environment; a breakdown of a relationship, which is a more temporary question; or confusion and frustration about one’s sexuality. Amongst the 15 to 24 age group, people who are gay have a six times greater likelihood of suicide than those who are not gay. That is a very powerful figure, and one which I was not aware of until I did the research for this speech. In that situation, I want to recognise the work done by Good Shepherd Youth and Family Services on the Mornington Peninsula through the Kaleidoscope program. The Kaleidoscope program deals with the fact that there are young people who are either determining whether or not they are gay or have made up their minds about it-people going through the identity isMAIN COMMITTEE",160,Adjournment
201,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andsues and the social challenges and dealing with the facts that school can be a cruel place, that youth groups can be difficult, that parents may not understand and that other family members or friends may not understand. The Kaleidoscope program, which is Commonwealth funded, allows young people to have a network and a place where they can be supported. It deals with the reality of their situation and it tries to provide non-judgmental understanding. It is an absolutely critical resource. As I say, we have seen that 47 young lives have been taken over the last 13 years. Each of those is a tragedy in itself and a tragedy for all of those associated with the person who has committed suicide. In that context, the work of Good Shepherd Youth and Family Services is tremendously important in providing the resources, the understanding and the ability for people locally on the Mornington Peninsula to find support. Good Shepherd Youth and Family Services have received $261,000. When the time comes, in the coming months, I will be giving them my full support for any renewal of the Kaleidoscope program, which is about giving young people support and preventing future tragedies. I also want to say that at the national level the Commonwealth has been very involved in a $66 million National Suicide Prevention Strategy. That is about dealing with and recognising some of the causes of suicide-alcohol, drugs, depression-and also providing as supportive an environment as possible. When the time comes, I will also be working to ensure that that program is continued, maintained and, if necessary, expanded. Lastly, I want to recognise the sadness and the tragedy that has occurred with youth suicide and to understand that families who remain have a heavy burden to bear-but, above all else, to look to the future as to what we can do through programs such as Kaleidoscope and nationally through programs such as the National Suicide Prevention Strategy. Student Unions discuss some issues around student unionism and the recent announcement by the government that it is once again going to proceed with an attempt to abolish compulsory student unionism and in that way fundamentally undermine the fabric of our tertiary education institutions throughout the country. The Minister for Education, Science and Training has made a number of points in the House with respect to this issue, and I would like to pick up on a couple of them. He talks about choice and the need for an approach much more around the issue of user pays. That is the thing about this government: it is user pays when it suits; it is choice when it suits. In the recent debate around super choice, it was choice provided you choose a fund that the government thinks is okay. When it comes to the issue of user pays, what about rates and taxation? The fact of the matter is that there is a whole range of situations in society where people are required to pay for services that they do not use specifically themselves. It is about crosssubsidisation and providing a basic fabric for society. When you look at what student unions provide in terms of welfare services and a range of other support services within university campuses, particularly catering for disadvantaged groups, minorities and overseas students, there are services that are very important. Another issue that is sometimes raised is the issue of freedom of association. Again, it is an absolute furphy for the government to argue that. The government knows that most universiMAIN COMMITTEE",161,Adjournment
202,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (12.10 P.m.),"I would like to take the time of the House today toties today have a clause on conscientious objection to membership of student organisations which students can sign when enrolling. In addition, the government knows that several court cases have found that universal membership of student organisations does not conflict with freedom of association. In the case of Clarkv the University of Melbourne, the full court of the Supreme Court of Victoria held that the essence of the universities’ powers is self-government, affecting only those who choose to become members by enrolment. In early 2003, the ACCC upheld the universal membership of student organisations in a case regarding James Cook University Student Association. The James Cook University Student Association was formally challenged under the third line forcing rule in relation to the Trade Practices Act. The ACCC ruled that universal membership of student organisations should continue as they were public organisations that performed public functions. The issues that the government has been putting forward on that point do not stand up to any proper scrutiny. Moreover, there has been a lot of concern about this in the community-and there was when this matter was introduced previously. This is not just historically a situation where it is Labor or the vice-chancellors or non-political or apolitical organisations. It was also often members of the Liberal Party. Back in 1999, the then Liberal controlled House of Assembly in the South Australian parliament passed a motion which said: ... this house ... is committed to ensuring that South Australian university programs and students are not disadvantaged and is therefore opposed to voluntary student unionism. In the chamber yesterday, there was some mention of the Treasurer and his views on this issue many years ago. The Treasurer shares a number of traits with the minister for education. At various times in their lives, they have both had illustrious involvements with our side of politics in some respects. ism and success in the circumstances that made them switch from what they thought in the first place. Back then, in an article in Lot’s Wife, the student newspaper of Monash University, Comrade Costello, as he sort of was back in those days, spoke of the essential nature of universal membership for student organisations. He said: ... the facilities of student unions are only practicalby their correct title. … the facilities of student unions are only practical on the basis of compulsory contributions … The member for Deakin, who represents an area where there is a significant tertiary student population, ought to know this and ought to understand this, rather than putting up silly interjections and silly points of order with respect to an issue that is actually important to a range of people within his electorate.

(Time expired) Deakin Electorate: Blackburn Lake Sanctuary Mr Erwin Kastenberger a couple of issues that have generated a widespread and emotive outpouring from the Blackburn community within my electorate of Deakin. The Blackburn Lake Sanctuary is a wonderful public area that encompasses public land and diverse gardens that are frequented by the public and native wildlife. The sanctuary typifies the unique relationship that many residents within the area have with the environment. As you drive through the local streets around the sanctuary, it is easy to develop an affinity with the area and with the importance of local flora and fauna. Only last week I participated in a very successful Clean Up Australia Day activity at the lake, along with a number of locals, followed by the opening of the Indigenous Garden. Over the past months, local residents have been united in their concern about a proposed redevelopment on land owned by the Victorian Deaf Society which is adjacent to the sanctuary. The sanctuary land was acquired in the late 1970s and early 1980s through the cooperation of the federal, state and local governments, and 5.8 hectares of this land was acquired from the Deaf Society in 1975. Until late last year, the Deaf Society ran a deaf-specific aged care facility-I understand it is the only one in Australia of its kind-next to the sanctuary. Planning matters in the Whitehorse municipality are a huge issue. This was demonstrated ever so bluntly last year by the Bracks Labor government’s refusal to intervene in the proposal to build a 16-storey high-rise tower in Mitcham. In the case of the Blackburn Lake Sanctuary, the newly acquired owner of the Lake Park Aged Care Facility, the Regis Group, is proposing to build a multistorey aged care facility. In its initial proposal, it was planning a five-storey complex with around 267 beds. This was rejected by Whitehorse City Council, and rightly so. The community has been so concerned and outraged that Regis has had to submit a revised proposal for approximately 190 beds in two storeys, with a dementia-specific wing going up to a third floor. I understand this variation will be considered by the Whitehorse City Council on Monday, prior to a VCAT hearing in April. I urge the Whitehorse City Council to heed the call from the community and ensure that whatever development takes place in the Blackburn Lake region conforms to the community’s expectation. I met with the Regis senior management prior to the public announcement of the proposal sometime last year. I was struck by the extensiveness of the development right next to the pristine environment. I forewarned the group that such a proposal would create a great deal of community concern. I also encouraged it to engage the community in the planning process. The resulting community backlash demonstrates that the group has been far less than effective in this process. Regis assured me at the time that it has successfully developed in sensitive areas before.

Many in the Blackburn community would like to see this site acquired for the purpose of additional parkland. I know this is a great notion to have, but there are complications. The Whitehorse City Council has indicated that this would be cost prohibitive. From my perspective, I am generally supportive of the Regis facilities in the Deakin electorate-it runs an excellent facility in Ringwood-but being a good aged care provider does not mean that it should run roughshod over community concerns. I urge it to continue to keep the dialogue going and develop its new facilities in line with the community’s expectations. Regis has been successful in the latest round of additional aged care places, and I appreciate its valuable work in this sector. There is another matter I want to address today. The people of Blackburn and Melbourne in general have been outraged and shocked by what took place last week with the senseless killing outside the Blackburn North shopping centre. I would like to pass on my condolences to the family of Mr Erwin Kastenberger, who was a security guard with Chubb. The centre is a vital retail hub for the area and contains a community venue that is used by many local groups. Across the road is the well-regarded Blackburn High School, and many of the schoolkids were out of school at the time. It is a wonder that other innocent victims were not caught up in the incident. Blackburn is a tight-knit community, and the resilience to come together in the face of this tragedy will be there. Full praise goes to the social workers who have helped witnesses deal with the event. My sympathy and thoughts are with all those who were affected. (Time expired) ANZAC Cove to raise the issue of ANZAC Cove. The government requested last year the massive roadworks now occurring in an area that is not just a heritage site but a sacred site for all Australians. The result of that appears to have been disastrous. Mr Les Carlyon, Australia’s best-known historian on Gallipoli, has stated that someone in the government seems determined to turn Gallipoli into a circus. He goes on to say that apart from damaging the world’s best preserved World WarI battlefield the work was likely to disturb the remains of soldiers. The ABC has reported that Ms Bernina Gezici, an Australian who operates tours in Turkey, said the following: But what they’ve actually physically done now, is actually cut into the cliff face itself. So where you have the natural cliff, where you could stand on ANZAC Cove and look up, and see exactly what the ANZACs saw in 1915-that no longer is there. The Australian people deserve answers as to how this occurred. In a briefing yesterday, the shadow minister for veterans’ affairs was shown a letter from former Minister for Veterans’ Affairs Dana Vale requesting the roadworks. There was no mention in that correspondence and request about the need to protect the heritage, the integrity and the sanctity of the site. It is beyond belief for most Australians that this could occur, and a number of questions need to be answered.

In late February and early March 2005, the head of the Office of Australian War Graves, retired Air Vice Marshal Gary Beck, was in Turkey and inspected the work at ANZAC Cove. Air Vice Marshal Beck then wrote a report on the work for the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Ms De-Anne Kelly. Is the government going to make this report public? Why did the Prime Minister state that one of the fragments of human remains found at the site had disappeared and the other had been covered up when, in fact, according to Bill Sellars, the bone was still there? Did the Australian government approve the plans to widen the road above ANZAC Cove and to excavate back into the hills to a depth of 20 metres? Was this work originally requested by the government on this scale? Does the Australian government have any knowledge of further plans to widen the road that runs between the Australian memorial at Lone Pine and the New Zealand memorial at Chunuk Bair? How does the Prime Minister reconcile his claims that a thorough archaeological study of the area to be excavated was conducted with statements in the Daily Telegraph on 12 March, by a Turkish expert who took part in one of the surveys, that the study was neither thorough nor scientific? Why did the Prime Minister say in December 2003 that the ANZAC Cove site would be the first placed on the National Heritage List, when it still has not occurred-seven sites have been listed, but it has not. The fact that this has been left vulnerable by a complacent government is a concern to all Australians. As historian Ross McMullin stated in yesterday’s Sydney Morning Herald: Fancy authorising-not just authorising, but initiating-unnecessary changes to a unique place ostensibly to make it more comfortable for visitors. When those changes irretrievably damage what the visitors have come so far to visit that’s not pragmatic. It’s preposterous. has sought to gag debate and has even said it is regrettable that Labor has raised this issue. (Time expired) Moncrieff Electorate: Gold Coast Broadwater important to constituents in my electorate of Moncrieff and more broadly to the Gold Coastthat is, the beautiful and serene Gold Coast Broadwater. The Gold Coast Broadwater is a tourist attraction in its own right, as well as being an aquatic playground and a particularly beautiful part of the Gold Coast. It is an area that I know many locals and, indeed, people from Brisbane visit. The Gold Coast Broadwater is an important part of the Gold Coast because it is such a focal point. When people travel from the north, it is one of the first things they see. It certainly has a significant amount of development to its south, with Main Beach, as well as the developments of Southport and Labrador to its west. On the eastern side is the Main Beach Spit, or MAIN COMMITTEE",165,Adjournment

213,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (12.25 P.m.),"I rise today to speak about an issue which is verythe Southport Spit as it is sometimes referred to, which is one of the last remaining areas of coastal vegetation. I raise this today because it is high time Gold Coast City developed a forward-looking plan to enhance the Gold Coast Broadwater. I propose that it is high time our city looked at redeveloping the western side of the Gold Coast Broadwater. This is not redevelopment of a commercial form in terms of new apartment buildings or anything like that; it is about redeveloping the western side of the broadwater to magnify the beauty of the local area. I propose that the western side of the Gold Coast Broadwater be redeveloped into a beautiful parklands area-something akin to Brisbane’s South Bank or, indeed, other natural parklands throughout Australian capital cities. The Gold Coast sorely lacks a beautiful park like this-the closest we have is Rosser Park-and the development of a parkland on the western side of the Gold Coast Broadwater would provide a magnet for local residents to go and enjoy the beauty of the Gold Coast Broadwater. I also envisage a sprinkling of cafes and restaurants, which would enable people to enjoy a family outing-perhaps a picnic, a coffee or something like that-while they look over the Gold Coast Broadwater and, at the same time, would provide a small and limited income flow to the council, which I hope would offset any of the increased costs the council would face in needing to maintain this new parklands style development on the western side of the Broadwater. In summary, such a development could be done in an environmentally sustainable way and in a way that is good for Gold Coast families. It would certainly take into account the fact that at the moment all that really exists on the Gold Coast Broadwater is a massive car park with some of the best views in this country. It is a great shame that in a city like the Gold Coast we have a situation where the only real use for the western side of the broadwater is for people to park their cars before they walk across the road into Southport. I stress that the development of the parklands would incorporate very limited commercial development, only to enhance the amenity of the area and to provide a revenue stream to council to ensure that the parklands remain beautiful and sustainable. Further, the current local pool could certainly remain and should be incorporated into the master plan. In addition, there has been much public debate recently about the Beattie state Labor government’s proposal to put a cruise ship terminal onto the Spit as a way of improving tourist facilities on the Gold Coast. I certainly support the introduction of a cruise ship terminal provided that, and I absolutely underscore this, it can be done in a way that does not degrade our local environment. I am firmly and totally opposed to such a cruise ship terminal being built on the Spit. The Spit is one of our last remnants of natural dune vegetation. To place a cruise ship terminal on the end of it would be a great shame, and I certainly remain totally opposed to that. I would contend that it is a far more feasible option-and again I stress provided it can be done in an environmentally beneficial or indeed an environmentally neutral way-for a cruise ship terminal to go into the Gold Coast Broadwater. It is my observation that the only reason the Beattie state Labor government is proposing putting a cruise ship terminal onto the Spit is that the two state Labor members in the area have flatly refused to support any development inside of the broadwater itself. This knee-jerk, short-sighted political reaction by the Beattie government is a pathetic attempt to try to prop up the state Labor members Peter Lawlor and Peta-Kaye Croft. It should be opposed. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Calwell Electorate: Broadband Access Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (12.30 p.m.)-TodayI rise to talk about the impending upgrade by Telstra of the Bulla telephone exchange in my electorate. This upgrade will mean that, finally, residents of the small Bulla community, which is only a stone’s throw away from Tullamarine airport, will be able to surf the internet with a high speed ADSL connection. This upgrade was made possible through the Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme, a program that sought to give regional, rural and remote communities access to broadband technologies at prices comparable to those available in metropolitan areas. Bulla is a small community in my electorate with approximately 400 residents. Many of these residents are young families living in a town where access to essential government services is not readily available. Their nearest Centrelink, for example, is 20 kilometres away in Sunbury and the nearest full service supermarket is 15 kilometres away in Gladstone Park. Like other residents in smaller towns across the country, the internet has become an invaluable tool that residents of Bulla have come to rely on almost daily. Whether using the internet to pay bills or to look for jobs-or whether students use the internet to do research for school projects-this is an essential service that the residents of Bulla need to access to. As we all know, the internet has delivered immeasurable benefits and services to the Australian community such as delivering comprehensive news, health information, transport information, weather reports, family and property information, and a plethora of other information and entertainment sites. For many students and businesspeople, the internet has become an essential tool for their work. Access to broadband ADSL-generally available within a few kilometres of Telstra exchanges-has for too long not been available to residents in the town of Bulla in my electorate. This is a concern often raised with me by these residents. Whilst Bulla residents can access the internet via the more conventional technologies such as dial-up access, the costs of dial-up can be steep and the slower speeds can be quite prohibitive. Had the Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme not been available, Telstra would not have reduced the customer demand levels required in order to upgrade the exchange and the Bulla community would have continued to miss out on this far more efficient technology. This situation begs the question as to whether a fully privatised Telstra would have upgraded the Bulla exchange given that the town has such a small customer base. Whilst the Bulla community have been fortunate to have their exchange upgraded on this occasion, there are still hundreds of small towns across Australia that do not have access to broadband. One such small town is Kalkallo, which is also in my electorate. It does not have access to broadband. The debate about the proposed sale of Telstra often raises the very serious concern that a fully privatised Telstra may not be as responsive to the needs of smaller communities with low customer bases. The government has on many occasions stated quite firmly that it will not proceed with its full sale of Telstra unless services, particularly services in rural and remote communities, are up to scratch. We know that many are up to scratch, but there are many others which are indeed not up to scratch. Certainly the two towns of Kalkallo and Bulla in my electorate are an example of towns that do not yet have access to broadband technology. I want to make the point that, at present, the major shareholder of Telstra is the Australian people. We are the major shareholders and, as such, Telstra has both an incentive and an obligation to be responsive to the needs of all Australians. The full privatisation of Telstra will MAIN COMMITTEE remove this incentive and it will remove the obligation, potentially, on Telstra to provide adequate telecommunications to all Australians anywhere throughout the country. My constituents often express their deep concern that, should the full privatisation of Telstra occur, those who would be most detrimentally affected are the people living in small towns and in regional and rural Australia. If and when the full privatisation occurs, I certainly hope that a privatised Telstra does not ignore those customers in small towns like Bulla and Kalkallo. I hope that services in such small towns are not sacrificed for the sake of profit. I share the concerns of my constituents regarding the full privatisation of Telstra, as it is vital to Australia that we all have access to adequate telecommunications technology and services. On this occasion I am very happy that the residents of Bulla will be able to enjoy broadband access. (Time expired) Gilmore Electorate: Land Tax an article that said: ‘Under the laws announced in the New South Wales government’s minibudget, hundreds of thousands of landlords with properties on land worth less than $317,000 will pay land tax for the first time.’ Hundreds of property owners in my electorate of Gilmore have objected to the valuations. They have 95 days to pay their liability. The number of land tax payers is expected to rise from about 140,000 to 500,000 in New South Wales. Only the principal residence is exempted, and there is no tax-free threshold under a new regime that came in last year. It does not matter if the second and subsequent properties, such as holiday homes or vacant land, are not rented out. The impact of this latest tax imposition by the Carr government means that landlords will be putting up rents, and that will feed into the consumer price index. As sure as night follows day this input will be transferred to the consumer. Unscrupulous landlords will use this as an excuse for increasing rates well beyond the actual quantum. The Sydney Morning Herald article alluded to such cases in Sydney, and in some cases tenants have effectively been driven out. Despite falling property prices, the valuations have gone up. Along the South Coast and in my electorate of Gilmore, many people have holiday homes or undeveloped properties. The valuation placed on these homes impacts on the rates they pay, and now on the land tax. Given that my electorate is a tourism destination for holiday-makers, the double whammy of increased land valuations followed by a tax for the first time will make them reconsider the worth of having a holiday home along the beach. Some will just shrug it off, but those living a fine line will be forced to seriously consider selling off their property, and many are doing so or have done so. If they do, that means they will be hit with an exit tax or a capital gains charge. Either way, they are going to be losing money. Individuals with waterfront properties will be feeling the pain because they will each be liable for a payment of $1,600 plus 0.4 per cent of the value over $400,000. Many of these people have nothing more than a basic cottage, but the land that it sits on has been inflated by the recent property boom in New South Wales. These are not liquid assets, and many owners have been described as asset rich but income poor as a result. The high valuation on their holiday home also means that any pensions they are getting may be jeopardised as it can take them over the allowable limits for a claim. I think this latest innovative tax courtesy of the Carr government is stupid, and many of my constituents think so as well. But many are concerned because they are of limited means, and MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Adjournment
214,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (12.35 P.m.),"The Sydney Morning Herald recently put it plainly inif they sell where do they go? How do they assist their own families? I cannot believe the greed of the Carr government. Why do they want to penalise those that work to look after themselves? They boast that, until this year, their budget has been in the black. This is not because of good management; rather, it is because they have increased their rate of revenue collection and decreased outgoings. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I can tell you that more and more New South Wales residents are waking up to the realisation that they have been duped over the years by the Carr government. How are we fighting back in Gilmore? Both the state member and I will be organising a rally to collect opinions from the landowners, the Mr and Mrs Average of coastal suburbia, and from the many businesses that will be affected by this unfortunate brainwave of the ex-Treasurer of New South Wales. We will make sure that our feelings are known in no uncertain terms, and I will take great delight in delivering that message on behalf of the constituents of Gilmore. This is an unfair imposition, based on what now appears as an ambitious assumption. Mr Carr, the property boom has slowed, values are falling and costs are going up. Get real. Collections from the GST which go directly to the states have exceeded forecasts, and the state governments have benefited from this. Yet every day we hear reports of inadequate funding for hospitals, schools, roadworks, education and services. It is a litany of mismanagement offset only by massive tax collections. In other words, they have been paying for their incompetent management with our money. Where do you stand on this, Mr Matt Brown, member of parliament for Kiama? Your silence on this matter that affects many of your Kiama residents has been deafening! I hope to see you at our rally. Cyprus Hindmarsh Electorate: School Visits President of the House of Representatives of Cyprus, Mr Demetris Christofias, to Australia. As many members will know, Cyprus has a colourful history and over the centuries has been claimed by nation after nation. In 1960 Cyprus was finally granted independence by the UK. Sadly, that was not the end of the story. Since 1974 Cypriots have fought for freedom from Turkey, which invaded the north. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is not recognised by any country in the world except Turkey. The Australian Labor Party has taken a strong stand against occupation, and I am proud to say as both a South Australian and a Greek Australian that the South Australian branch of the Labor Party in particular has led the way on this issue. Labor supports total demilitarisation of the Republic of Cyprus. It has called upon all of the concerned parties to resolve the problem in a way which would guarantee all Cypriot people the three freedoms of movement, settlement and ownership. Such a resolution must also ensure the right of refugees to return safely to their homelands and to establish a unified, independent and non-aligned Cyprus. Sadly, the so-called Annan solution failed to do that, and I applaud the decision of Cyprus to reject the plan. The Labor Party deplore the fact that Cyprus remains artificially and tragically divided, and we recognise the great humanitarian cost this continued division imposes on the communities MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Adjournment
215,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (12.39 P.m.),"I rise to acknowledge the visit of theof the island. It is time for a peaceful solution for Cyprus, and it is a great privilege to be visited by a representative of the Cypriot government, which is fighting so hard for the rights of the people of Cyprus. Such a struggle makes my daily fight on behalf of constituents pale by comparison. Living day after day amid a war is a horrific thing to contemplate. Just today I had the privilege of accompanying students from St Michael’s College in my electorate of Hindmarsh to a wreath-laying ceremony at the Australian War Memorial. St Michael’s is one of the many great schools in Adelaide’s western suburbs that encourage reverence to those Australians who have given so much for this great country. The War Memorial not only recognises the incredible stories and experiences of Australians who have served in wars but also teaches our young people a little bit about what it would be like to go to war. The Australian War Memorial provides us with an excellent insight into what it must have been like, especially in World WarI and World War II. The lessons that our fallen soldiers have taught us must never be forgotten. There are 102,000 names inscribed on the walls of the Australian War Memorial-the names of those who died in battle. These 14-year-old students from St Michael’s contemplated the 60,000 Australians who lost their lives in the First World War and the 40,000 who died in the Second World War. It appeals to egalitarians such as me and my Labor colleagues that no mention is made of the rank of these soldiers, because no life has greater value than another. I believe it is important that younger Australians understand why we have the Australian War Memorial and why ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day are important. It not a celebration of war; it is a recognition of the enormous sacrifices Australians have made in war. I explained to the students today about the symbol of the red poppy which comes from the First World War, when hundreds of thousands of soldiers died on the Western Front. I think it is a touching story that, when the fighting finally finished, poppies grew where there had been a muddy battleground and that it was said that the red poppies were the colour of the blood of those who had fallen there. I also spoke with the students about the massive casualties of World War I. Eleven percent of France’s entire population were killed or wounded, eight percent of Great Britain’s population were killed or wounded and nine percent of Germany’s pre-war population were killed or wounded. The students from St Michael’s College, which is an excellent school, took in all of the information and laid a wreath in recognition of the thousands of Australians killed in war. It was a touching ceremony. I have to admit that facing 50-odd 14-year-olds was a bit daunting, but this group of students was extremely well behaved and not frightening at all. BeforeI finish up I would also like to comment on another school in the electorate of Hindmarsh that visited Canberra recently, Lockleys North Primary School, which has introduced an award-winning antibullying and harassment project. I am pleased to say that it won them $20,000 in the National Awards for Quality Schooling. I had the pleasure of attending the presentation ceremony with the principal, Sue McDonald, and the project leader, Josephine Serentis. I was fascinated to hear them talk about how important it is for student learning that students feel safe and comfortable at school. I would like to congratulate Lockleys primary school. It is a national leader in developing a community of students that emphasise respect for one another. I think it is such a basic assumption that we have too often overlooked the importance of being very active in creating such an environment. The award demonstrates the high quality of the education at our local MAIN COMMITTEE schools and recognises that bullying and harassment are not acceptable and children will not learn effectively if they are worried about being bullied. Other schools around the country will be able to learn from the strategies that have been put in place at Lockleys North Primary School, and I commend the school for its contribution to improving education. Herbert Electorate: Medical Practitioner Shortage believe, been widely accepted by the public and by the medical profession alike. I have had great feedback in my electorate, but I have found that those medical practices wishing to pick up the bulk-billing ball and run with it are having problems in providing the level of service that they want to. I have three forward thinking and dynamic medical practices in my electorate who have all approached me because they are having difficulty with the fact that Townsville is not classified as an area of work force shortage. These practices-the Hermit Park Medical Centre, the Aitkenvale Family Health Centre and The Doctors in Townsville cityare all operated by go-ahead practice managers but have had constant problems in getting timely approvals, if in fact they do get approval at all, for overseas trained doctors to fill the vacancies in their practices that Australian trained doctors are just not willing to fill. The government has made tremendous headway in working towards ensuring that all Australians can access affordable, high quality primary care when and where they need it. But the time has come to look at the current system of classifying areas of work force shortage. The three practices in my electorate that I mentioned offer bulk-billing and extended opening hours, but they are having increasing problems maintaining this level of service due to the lack of doctors. Hermit Park Medical Centre is open from 7 am until 6 pm Monday to Friday and from 8 am until 1 pm on Saturdays. Aitkenvale medical centre is open from 8 am until 8 pm Monday to Thursday, 8 am until 7 pm on Friday and from 8 am until 5 pm during the weekend. The Doctors in Townsville city is open extended hours, and is ready and willing to offer a totally bulk-billed service 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The problem is, however, that they have restrictions on the hours that their overseas trained doctors can work. I am advised that there have been occasions when their Australian doctors cannot make it to work for family reasons and the practice has had to open its doors with no doctor in attendance. In these cases, the overseas trained doctor is available, and sitting in his particular surgery, but unable to work because he can only work out of hours. He sits in his office and is just there on stand-by in case an emergency occurs. That is a terrible situation. I know that it is possible to declare specific areas or suburbs a temporary area of work force shortage in order that an immediate problem can be solved. But this is just patching up an impossible situation for practices which are trying to provide good service with extended hours and have high medical staff turnover. I do not think anyone would disagree with me when I say that overseas trained doctors generally fit in well in regional areas. In my experience they quickly become accepted as members of the community. The time has come to look at the restrictions imposed on the provision of overseas trained doctors to regional Australia so that we can have the same level of service, bulk-billing and otherwise, that is available to people living in the cities. As the local member, I should not have to make special arrangements to keep a totally bulk-billing clinic open over the Christmas-New Year period. It should just be automatic that a clinic with doctors willing to work can in fact provide the services that patients need at the time that they need them. While in this instance I was not prepared to see that happen and I MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Adjournment
216,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (12.44 P.m.),"The government’s MedicarePlus initiatives have, Imoved heaven and earth, we should not be running a firefighting service and we should not be running a system where the federal member has to intervene and work very hard to make sure that clinics stay open. I am pleased that the minister for health has indicated that he is reviewing the RAMA classification system. That will go a long way to helping the city of Townsville, because currently RAMA 2 is the classification of the city of Townsville and that is just not appropriate for the current patient demand. So there is a light on the horizon, but I have made this statement to the parliament today to indicate to all those in the department, the minister’s office and the parliament more generally my concern that we are in this situation. I certainly hope we can get an early and speedy resolution to this. Capricornia Electorate: Television Services and Roads Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (12.49 p.m.)-I wish to support the Aussie Rules players and supporters in Central Queensland who were unable to watch a live broadcast of the Wizard Cup final on free-to-air television on Saturday night. The AFL executive has a responsibility to grow the game, and it has a real opportunity to do that in a non-traditional state like Queensland thanks to the Lions recent successes, but how can that happen if the main games are not shown live and free to air in places like Central Queensland? I am aware that Imparja Television in the Northern Territory broadcast the game at 6.30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Saturday. In fact, I am aware of one fan who drove 200 kilometres to be able to watch the game live on Imparja. For those who do not know, Imparja Television is Australia’s only truly independent television station and is broadcast from Alice Springs. My understanding is that Imparja Television provides a much better sporting service to outback residents than channels 7, 9, and 10 combined do to the rest of Australia. This is the second occasion in a matter of weeks that I have made the point in this House that the people of Central Queensland are being underserved by the national commercial channels. I suspect this has something to do with the main commercial channels having a vested interest in pay television and, as such, wanting to keep major events off the free-to-air channels. It seems that the main commercial networks are ignoring the substantial AFL viewing audience in Central Queensland, just as they were uninterested in the very large cricket viewing audience in Central Queensland. It was just weeks ago that I raised in the House the failure of the free-to-air commercial networks to bid for rights to broadcast the forthcoming Ashes tour from England. I have today written to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts asking that the area Imparja Television is allowed to cover be extended to cover all of Central Queensland, thereby enabling better coverage of major sporting events to all Central Queenslanders. I have previously raised in this House the problems associated with the access to the Shoalwater Bay military training facility. Prior to the last federal election the Australian Labor Party committed $15 million to upgrade the roads leading into this training area to accommodate the extra demands being put on the region’s infrastructure due to the joint training agreement with the United States military. I have written to the minister involved lobbying for this work to be done and explaining the needs of the military and local residents, but regrettably the government has not yet accepted its responsibility in this area. MAIN COMMITTEE The Mayor of Livingstone Shire, which covers the Shoalwater Bay training area, had what he described to me as a positive meeting with the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, just last week. Following that meeting, I urged the Minister for Defence to look favourably on this proposal to upgrade the roads servicing this major defence facility at Shoalwater Bay. Having spoken about the Shoalwater Bay road, it is important for me to also point out that it is not just the roads servicing this major defence training facility that have been ignored by this government. It has just become apparent that the Curragh mine at Blackwater intends to move 10,000 tonnes of coal a day 180 kilometres along the Capricorn Highway to the Stanwell power station just west of Rockhampton. This will mean a triple-B truck running along that section of the Capricorn Highway every 30 minutes carrying coal. The road simply will not stand up to this type of use. It was never designed to carry this volume or weight of traffic. These huge trucks will be a serious hazard to the people of central-western Queensland who use the Capricorn Highway to travel to and from Rockhampton for business, medical or family reasons. In addition, the Capricorn Tourist Organisation has put a lot of time and effort into promoting the central highlands as a tourist destination for caravan travellers. We love to host the southern visitors who come to our region in their caravans every winter, but you have to wonder just how the drivers will cope with B-triples bearing down on them and trying to pass them on the highway. This is another example of the Howard government’s failure to invest strategically and adequately in the infrastructure needs of regional Australia and Central Queensland in particular. Australian Greens finding by the Australian Press Council regarding media commentary on the Australian Greens which appeared in the Melbourne Herald Sun. If you were to believe Senator Brown and the Greens, you would have to believe that statements that they wanted to decriminalise drugs, raise taxes, ban farming and make us all ride bikes were all an evil invention and conspiracy by the journalists who wrote those comments, in particular in the Melbourne Herald Sun. For some bizarre reason, the week before last the Australian Press Council suspended logic and agreed with that proposition by Senator Brown and the Greens. In doing so, in my view they have made a monumental error and unwittingly assisted Senator Brown to cover up one of the biggest acts of political dishonesty in recent memorynamely, the Greens denial of their own published policy agenda. Nothing the Herald Sun published was invented. All of it came from the Greens own web site, where it had been posted for months and, in some cases, years. Senator Brown’s defence seems to alternate between two desperate propositions. The first is roughly along these lines: ‘Our policies do not mean what they say they mean.’ The second is: ‘That policy no longer applies because we have taken it off our web site.’ How convenient. No major political party or leader would get away with that. The Prime Minister would not; the Leader of the Opposition would not. But, because Bob Brown represents a minority party, he thinks different rules apply to him. MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Adjournment
217,Mr Anthony Smith (Casey) (12.54 P.m.),"This afternoon I want to address a recentA cursory glance at what was on the Greens official web site exposes this sham, and this is what the Press Council have failed to look into. The Greens policy on ‘society, drugs and addiction’ originally said: The regulation of currently illegal drugs should be moved outside the criminal framework. And: In a democratic society, in which diversity is accepted, each person has the opportunity to achieve personal fulfilment. It is understood that the means and aims of fulfilment may vary between people at different stages of their lives and may, for some people at particular times, involve the use of drugs. Perhaps Senator Brown assumed that the party’s policy would only be read by people on drugs. It certainly seems to have been written by them. But, once that policy began to be questioned, a mysterious thing happened. The first sentence quoted was altered to limit decriminalisation to personal use, and the other passage disappeared from the web site completely. Senator Brown was also alarmed that voters might be misled into believing his party wants to compel us into vegetarianism. Here is what his party’s policy on ‘care for the earth’ originally said, before it was taken from the web site: ... the ... Greens consider it environmentally and ethically essential to decrease all production of animal food and other animal products. But, again, a mysterious thing happened. What was ‘essential’ policy became so non-essential that it disappeared altogether. Are you starting to see the Greens priorities? Decriminalising drugs while banning the family barbecue is, I think, kind of the wrong way round for most Australians. The Press Council and Senator Brown railed against the claim that the Greens favoured a 49 per cent corporate tax rate. But, again, that is precisely what the Greens originally had on their web site and on their policy agenda. It was only when the heat came in the lead-up to the election campaign that they altered it and reduced that rate in their policy. Senator Brown and the Greens may have escaped scrutiny in the past, but that does not give them an exemption or a discount from democratic scrutiny, either in the parliament or in the Australian electorate. No-one but the Greens wrote their policies and published them, and it was only when those policies began to be debated that Senator Brown and the Greens tried to hide them and deny them-not the brave conviction politicians that they would have us believe. I believe the Press Council have seriously erred; I think they have made a major misjudgment. I think they should re-look at the matter and look at the Greens policies, which were long standing before they started to tear them off their web site as the election approached. This is certainly part of a well-worn strategy by the Greens, but they should not escape the democratic scrutiny that major political parties have to endure, and I think the Press Council should look at this again as a matter of urgency.

219,Mr Vaile,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:swer to the honourable member’s question: In preparing this answer, it was necessary to obtain input from the portfolios of the Attorney-General, the Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister. (1) The PCSS is established under the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948 (the Act). The current PCSS pension reduction provisions applying to holders of offices of profit under the Crown were inserted in the Act in 1983. Similar provisions that reduced a beneficiary’s superannuation pension were contained in the Act between 1948 and 1973. (2) A reduction is made in all cases where the recipient of a PCSS pension or annuity becomes the holder of an office of profit under the Commonwealth or a State as defined by section 21B of the Act. The offices of profit covered by section 21B include a range of Commonwealth and State public office positions, for example the Governor General, State Governors, Departmental Secretaries, ambassadors and other heads of missions overseas, judges, public offices for which the Remuneration Tribunal sets a salary and appointments by State Ministers. Section 21B does not apply to appointments to academic positions, Senior Executive Service positions or engagement as an employee within the Australian Public Service and private sector appointments. (3) A PCSS pension or annuity is reduced by 50 cents in the dollar for each dollar that the office of profit remuneration exceeds 20 per cent of the basic salary payable from time to time to a Senator or Member (ie based on the current basic salary of $106,770, the reduction would be 50 cents for each dollar that the office of profit remuneration exceeds $21,354 per annum). The maximum reduction is 50 per cent of a PCSS member’s pension entitlement before any commutation and 50 per cent of an annuity. Where a member has commuted the maximum 50 per cent of his or her pension to a lump sum benefit, remuneration received from holding an office of profit could reduce the level of pension or annuity to zero while the office is held. (4) No similar arrangement applies to reduce benefits of beneficiaries of the Commonwealth’s superannuation schemes for its civilian employees or the military superannuation schemes. The Judges’ Pensions Act 1968 (the Judges’ Pensions Act) provides that a pension payable under that Act for a person who becomes a judge within the meaning of that Act is reduced by the amount of any pension received in respect of prior Commonwealth, State or Territory judicial service. A judicial pension would cease to be payable if a retired judge was re-appointed as a judge. (5) A person entitled to a pension under the PCSS and a pension under the Judges Pensions Act would receive both pensions. These arrangements are no different to arrangements in the private sector where employees are able to retain the superannuation benefits accrued in respect of various periods of employment. In this way, former parliamentarians who are appointed to the judiciary are treated no differently to former parliamentarians who work for a bank, law firm, trade union or as a university lecturer. (6) The Governor General Act 1974 provides that the basic rate of pension payable to a former Governor General is to be reduced by the amount of any pension or retiring allowance payable to that person whether by virtue of a law or otherwise out of money provided in whole or part by Australia, a State or a Territory. (7) The benefits payable under the Commonwealth’s main civilian superannuation arrangements, the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme and the Commonwealth’s superannuation guarantee minimum arrangements that are provided under the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988 are not reduced where the beneficiary is in receipt of a State or Territory parliamentary, judicial, governor/administrator or public service pension of annuity. The same rationale applies to not reducing these pensions as that which applies in respect of question (5) above. As set out in the answer to question 4 above, a retired State or Territory",176,Questions In Writing

Coastal Acid Sulfate Soils (Question No. 597) Ms George asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, in writing, on 16 February 2005: (1) Can the Minister outline the extent of the problem of coastal acid sulfate soils in Australia. (2) What action has the Government taken to address the problem. (3) Is the Minister aware that the Victorian Department of Primary Industries has identified acid sulfate soils in key development areas on Victoria’s coast, in particular, on the Bass Coast at Venus Bay and Anderson’s Inlet. (4) What action will the Federal Government take to ensure drainage or excavation work at popular coastal development sites, such as Venus Bay and Anderson’s Inlet, does not cause significant negative environmental externalities for the indigenous ecosystem (such as disturbances in water quality) and to the built environment. (5) Are any species of flora or fauna located at Venus Bay and Anderson’s Inlet listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). (6) Is the Government aware of any species of flora and fauna located at Venus Bay and Anderson’s Inlet that potentially could be subject to the conservation provisions of the EPBC Act. (7) What action will the Federal Government take to ensure any species located at Venus Bay and Anderson’s Inlet, already identified or potentially subject to the EPBC Act, are protected from the disruption of coastal acid sulfate soils. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Coastal acid sulfate soils are potentially located Australia-wide, however the problems associated with soil disturbance and discharge of acidic leachates are limited to areas of agricultural and urban development. (2) and (4) The Australian Government has pursued a range of measures to improve the community’s awareness of coastal acid sulfate soils and to develop and demonstrate effective management strategies. This has been principally through (a) supporting the development of the National Strategy for the Management of Coastal Acid Sulfate Soils, (b) implementing under Australia’s Oceans Policy the Coastal Acid Sulphate Soils Program, and (c) ensuring coastal acid sulphate soil management is addressed in Natural Heritage Trust regional natural resource management planning and investment strategies. Since 1997 the Australian Government has committed approximately $1 million to fund projects related to the management of acid sulfate soils in various locations around Australia. More than $293,000 has also been allocated to improving the quality of water flowing into Anderson’s Inlet. (3) Yes. (5) and (6) Yes. (7) In general, developments in areas subject to disturbance of acid sulfate soils would require approval under the EPBC Act if they were likely to cause a significant impact on a matter of national environment significance.",178,Questions In Writing
