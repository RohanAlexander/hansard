The man who sits in a newspaper back parlour, with comfortable surroundings, and who, possibly, is quite unknown to the outer world, but who pens an article which, by reason of the advertising value of the newspaper, obtains a very wide circulation, which, probably, cannot be contradicted, no doubt exercises an influence beyond any politician.

I was disappointed in the attitude which the Prime Minister assumed with regard to the division the other evening. I had had no interview with him in regard to the amendment. But I heard the honourable member for Mernda say in this chamber that he had consulted that honourable gentleman from time to time over the amendment, and that his reason for proposing to omit the first word of the clause was, not because he thought that would be effectual in altering its senseI think he said that it would be an idiotic proposal-bu t because, with the approval of the Prime Minister, it was intended to usher in one of a more substantial character, which could be better understood, and which, if carried, would have a better effect. sion the honourable member read the amendment which he has since moved, and he stage bf the proposal is carried, and that is stated that he had interviewed the Prime the stage which, if carried, the Prime MinMinister from time to time, and that the ister said he would consider as indicating latter had desired the amendment to take that the will of the House, and that it might form, because the omission of the first word lead to him being able to obtain a modificaI understood him to say, would not throw tion of the agreement. any serious responsibility upon the Government. that if the amendment were carried, it member said that it became law. might, by indicating the opinion of the Committee, lead to steps being taken to kind, i said it was such a carriage of that obtain a modification of the agreement with particular stage of the Bill as would, at the Premiers of the States.

I was disappointed, because I thought from the way in which the honourable gentleman's attitude was explained, that he was prepared to go to the Premiers, remembering that the agreement had been approved of by them and himself subject to the approval of this Parliament. Does the honourable gentleman say that that division indicated the approval of Parliament? Was it not rather a failure to secure the approval of the Committee? And. that being so, was there not cast upon the Prime Minister an obligation to go to the Premiers of the States and to say to them, "" The approval which was a condition precedent to the acceptance of this agreement has not been secured"" ? and say that the Premiers should have gone to the Prime Minister. far as that. I go only so far as to say that the Prime Minister would have taken a more judicious step had he gone to. the Premiers and said, "" I cannot obtain the consent of Parliament to this agreement, which is contrary to the Fusion arrangement.

72,Mr Bruce Smith,"Yes. When thehad been impliedly assented to by this party, the Prime Minister addressed this letter to Mr Wade, in which he reminded him as late as 30th June last that, to paraphrase his letter, the Fusion could consent to only a temporary scheme for the distribution of the Customs and Excise revenue until some wider arrangement was made for dealing with the whole financial question. Again, the Prime Minister, writing on 9th July, in reply to a letter from Mr or political purposes I have come to the Wade, statedThe propositions to be submitted to our electors will consist of a general statement in our platform of the views of this Government in respect to what may be termed a permanent settlement of the future financial relations of the States to the Commonwealth. Should the preliminary financial arrangement for a term of years-allude d to in my last letter-fai l for any reason to pass this session, that also would be submitted, and in a precise shape As you are avyare, neither one nor the other need be ingrafted upon the Constitution in order to come into f u l l effect. That discloses an extraordinary position. Here we find the Prime Minister, who is leading a party, 'some members of which are twitting five of their number who happen to have differed from them over this matter, proclaiming in June, not only that an arrangement with regard to the distribution of revenue should be of a temporary character, pending a settlement of what I in my previous speeches spoke of as the big outlying problems between the States and the Commonwealth, but that it need not be ingrafted in the Constitution ! Honourable members will recollect that f gave as one of my reasons for objecting to a permanent settlement of trie question that we had in this agreement a. statement of what the Commonwealth was going to give, but that what it was going to get in return had never been defined. The Premiers of the States, under this .agreement, have consented only to an investigation with regard to the transfer of certain of the State debts, and honourable members will doubtless recall my comment, that to ""consent to an investigation "" is about as vague as a promise by a Minister to a deputation to "" take the question into consideration."" We thus find that the Prime Minister not only informed the Premier of New South Wales, when inviting him to attend the Conference, that any arrangement made must be of a temporary character, pending the settlement of the bigger problems, but that he also said that there was no reason why the arrangeMr Bruce ment should go into the Constitution. to that agreement to be found on this side of the Chamber. Minister come to his party and said, "" Gentleman, I ha.ve declared myself in favour of a limited arrangement. It is an arrangement that need not necessarily be embodied in the Constitution, but for party conclusion that it is desirable to make a permanent adjustment of the financial relations of the States to the Commonwealth, and to embody it in the Constitution; "" and if his party had then discussed the matter and consented to the adoption of that course, the position would have been different. But the recent Premiers' Conference which was attended by the Prime Minister was a secret meeting. Its proceedings have never been published. It is true that a document has been published, which, if my memory serves me accurately, is called The Proceedings of theConference. But I have read that document from beginning to end, and from the first cover to the last it does not contain the slightest indication of what took place at that Conference. The press have not been vouchsafed even a summary of its proceedings, such as even the most secret Conferences in England are accustomed to supply to it. Honourable members will recollect that when the Imperial Conferences are held in London, a sort of -precis is handed tq the press, which contains the substance of their deliberations. But nothing of that sort has been vouchsafed either to the press or the people, or to the members of the party who are now asked to be bound by its conclusions, quite regardless of the contrary principles to which they have alreadv acceded. Honourable members must recognise that at more than one Conference of Premiers the principles for which I am contending have been contended for by the Prime Minister, and by his Treasurer. Sir George Turner's name stands very high in the estimation of Victorian people, and I propose to quote what he said at the Premiers' Conference in 1904 as throwing light on this problem. Honourable members' will recollect that over and over again the Premiers of the States have urged that the control of the Customs and Excise revenue should be taken out of the hands of the Commonwealth, or that that revenue Smith. should be allocated in such a wav as would very much modify, if not entirely abro-",20,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta

Upon the occasion in not be altered without another appeal to the question, Sir George Turner saidButI cannot go to the Federal Parliament That is the Number two situation which the and say"" I want you to extend the Braddon Prime Minister slid over so skilfully last section for all time.""

VVe all recognise that Sir George Turner's name is a power in Victoria, because he is credited with having extricated this State from a position of very great nnancial difficulty. I come now to the principles which but were enunciated at the same Conference by thin ice. When Mr Kidston, in his anxiety the Prime Minister. He saidThey (the people) have two agencies.

He saidThey (the people) have two agencies.

The Prime Minister continued. where the politician comes in. Your proposal amounts to this : that we should amend the Constitution in order to give a sanction in it to any agreement arrived at now in regard to the disposition of the Customs and Excise revenue, requiring that alteration to be hereafter When the Prime Minister had reached this point, Mr Kidston completed the sentence for him by adding the word ""ratified.""

78,Mr Bruce Smith,"The honorablemay say at once, on behalf of the Commonwealth, that it seems to us to be an unreasonable provision, and one that we could not under any circumstances agree to. It seems to me that it shows a disregard for the Constitutional position. It seems to show distrust of the Commonwealth, and to place the Commonwealth in fetters which are not in the Constitution. Sir John Forrest who was the Prime Minister's colleagueButI intend to quote still more matter of equal interest if the Committee will grant me their indulgence. At the same Conference the Prime Minister saidNo, it was decided by the votes of the people of Australia that this should be the Constitution, and it would be a strange idea for the Parliament of Australia to say to the people"" We ore not competent to handle this great power you have given to us, and we want you to take it back and hold it again. Hold it for us so that we shall not do any mischief with it . "" We, who represent the same people and the same electors; we, the Commonwealth Parliament, say-""Tak e back this power; we are not worthy to hold it, and we are not worthy to do justice in the way you desire."" Is there any alteration in the logic of the situation in 1909 as compared with 1907? wrong both as to the person and the dates. by Sir Jonn Forrest and myself. In the view I did not attend the Premiers' Conference of the Commonwealth, not only the considerain 1907. Several Honorable MEMBERS the Treasurer. have quoted from the Treasurer inyou look at the proposals altogether as in everv stead of the Prime Minister. rate, the quotation seems to me to express exactly the principles' for which the Prime Minister contended two years ago. It was then recognised that this question is a complex one, and that the people are busy. It is an easy matter for honourable members to exclaim, "" Trust the people."" But those who urge that, do not speak of supplying them with a copy of the Constitution, or of taking them away from their ordinary avocations, and of -instructing them as to the meaning of all this mass of technical verbiage, and as to what its effect is likely to be on the politics and finances of the States. They do not do that, but they repeat, in a general ancl advertising manner, "" Trust the jpeople! "" local politician, in a country town, will reply, "" That is the man for me; he wishes to trust the people."" But that type of local man has probably never looked at the Constitution in his life, and, if he did look at it, he would in some case's not understand it. I should think he would be foolish to leave his business in order to engage in a study of it , unless he had some political ambition. But that is not the whole. I now desire to show that the interpretation which the words in the Fusion compact unmistakably bear, is the same interpretation W h o said that? which the Prime Minister has always conT h e identical tended for. The words arePending the preparation of a complete scheme adjusting the future financial relation of the Commonwealth and States, an interim arrangement to be proposed under which the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth shall be dealt with. At the 'Conference of 1906, when. Mr Evans was Premier of Tasmania, the Prime Minister had something to say in answer to that gentleman. He observedThat is one arm of the subject complete in itself, but tliere is another arm; both are essential. What the Federal Parliament desires, su far as I understand, is, if possible, to clear up all the unsettled financial problems between the States and the Commonwealth. The taking over of the debts of the States is one of thc most important provisions in the Constitution. HutI can set Captain Evans' mind at rest the purport of the remarks that have been made tion of the debts question, but its final deterI t was mination, is the essence of the contract. To use Captain Evans' own words, it is an imperative part of the scheme, and I do not think he needs I see I should any explanation from me to tell him why. If A t any other take. negotiation, it is a question of give and I ask the Committee to listen to these few words in particular. The honourable gentleman continuedNow, so far as you ore concerned, the proposals relating to the Braddon clause and your future revenue from Customs are all "" take"" on your part, and "" give"" on the part of the Federal Parliament. It is only when you come to deal with the debts question that you balance it. You have to ask yourselves the question what you will give up on that point, and what the Commonwealth can fairly take in the interests of Australia as a whole. Honourable members will see that the Prime Minister was here recognising what he indicated in the Fusion, agreement,' aiid ivhat most of us understood by it, namely, I have no doubt that the that "" all "" these financial questions must ultimately be dealt with, and that until they were embodied in some scheme for a final -settlement, the allocation' of the Customs and Excise revenue should be for a limited time, or, as said in the agreement, there should be "" a n interim arrangement.""

84,Mr Bruce Smith,"Furtherthe Prime Minister, to the effect that there was no need to put the agreement in the Constitution; and the honourable member for Swan, at the Conference in Brisbane, in 1907, saidNow we have had four previous Conferences, ancl at all of them the representatives of the people of Australia have said they believed the States debts should be taken over, because they believed, and the framers of the Constitution also believed, that a great saving to the people of Australia would result. I fear that Parliament will not do anything in' these great financial matters unless we do it as a whole. They will not do it piece-meal. Do honourable members note that ?To deal with one-half of the financial problem, and leave the other half, will not commend itself to them. The two matters cover the whole of the financial problems . . . and in the opinion of the Government and the Parliament they should be dealt with together. The Prime Minister saidThe point I wish to make at the outset, is 'hat, looking back, one is struck by the repeated references made during the course of the Convention debates, at which the present Constitution was shaped, to two things which were always considered together. One was the revenue derived from Customs in the Commonwealth, and the other was the interest on the debts which had been incurred by the States of the Commonwealth. . . . Speaking not so much legally, as generally, it appears to me that the clear meaning of the Constitution is that these two matters should be dealt with together. Even before that Convention, if I remember aright, Sir Samuel Griffith had dwelt upon the necessity of considering these two factors together. The first suggestion I wished to make this morning, was that, at this Conference the time has arrived when the question should be approached from the other side-whethe r certain difficulties would not be removed, the intention of the framers of the Constitution better fulfilled , ancl other useful objects achieved, by considering once moTe the two questions together, that is the repayment of a portion of the Customs duties to the States and the obligations already incurred by the States in regard to their borrowings. In other words, one side of those questions having been frequently considered, and very f u l l y considered, has not the time arrived when some stressa great deal more stress than in the past-shoul d be laid on the debt side, and its connection with the problem? Personally, I have been putting that forward, and so has my honourable colleague, the Treasurer, almost since the commencement of the Commonwealth. These quotations, and many more which I could give, should satisfy the Committee that the meaning to be attached to the Fusion agreement is clearly that for which I have contended. a Minister in tlie Chamber-no t one is present. how the Ministry show respect to a supporter who does not agree with them; but I am quite reconciled to the position. It will have its effect, on honourable members, who will see how much the Government's regard for honourable members depends on the support that they give. r get the third reading through ! not, though, of course, the absence of Ministers may be an accident. many engagements in the morning. asked us to meet in the morning. plaining. I . only know that the extracts : before me show the opinions held by. Sir George Turner, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, Mr Peake, Premier of South Australia, and Mr Davies, Attorney-General of Victoria. There is also an expression by the Argus, whicb is an interesting journal, or claims to be. In August of this year, after the editor of the Argus had read the Fusion agreement, and before the Conference of Premiers, an article appeared. Of course, the Argus knows nothing of what took place at the Conference, or we may be sure it would have been published, because if a newspaper be given useful information, that information appears. What the Argus, whicli is now red hot in desiring a permanent allocation, then said ago. months ago, the Argus saidThere is no reason why this Conference should not agree to a division of the Customs and Excise revenue which will provide for the needs of both States and Commonwealth, but which might be regarded as experimental for the three years following the next general election. Then, with such modifications as experience might suggest, it could be embodied in the Constitution. So we see that the gentleman in the back parlour, who writes these articles-if it be the same man-the n admitted that a little experience would be useful at the end of three years, whereas to-day he does not care a snap for experience, but says/ in effect, "" Let things come, and never m in d ;",23,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta

93,Mr Bruce Smith,"Less than threewe should do it for all time without any further experience."" And we are supposed to bow meekly to this sort of guidance.! I desire the Committee and the public to know this fact-that three months is quite sufficient time for even a great organ of this character to completely reverse its attitude on these two questions-o n the placing of the agreement in the Constitution and on the enactment of it for all time. I now desire to read a most valuable and practical utterance by Sir Joseph Carruthers, who was present at the Brisbane Conference in 1907. which the Prime Minister skimmed over so skilfully, though I have endeavoured in a logical sense to put him into the ice. Now, there is no more accomplished politician-and I use the word advisedly-tha n Sir Joseph Carruthers in Australia; and what he says is worth hearing as from a State politicianIt is a very serious thing to ask the Commonwealth of Australia to commit itself irrevocably to a scheme of finance between the Commonwealth and the States, the result of which no man here can forecast. Just look at our revenue for last year. It is beyond the expectations of any man in Australia. The PRESIDENT -It is not irrevocable at all. The Hon. J. H . CARRUTHERS -Not irrevocable; but we know how every few alterations have been made in the equally irrevocable Constitution of the United States. We know how difficult it will be if anything is put in the Constitution to get it amended under the complicated process provided by the Constitution. The PRESIDENT -It would be very easy to amend it if it were causing nnancial dislocation -! made 30s. for a limited time. The mover That has been said here, ancl also by many people, namely, that if we have financial dislocation, the public and the States will come forward, with flags flying, and say, "" We wish to alter the Constitution in order to convenience the Commonwealth Parliament."" Sir Joseph Carruthers, who is a practical man, ancl has had to do with the needs of the interior of a great State, saidTake this contingency-that it is found that this arrangement works harshly and unjustly to two States, but works favourably to four States. That is not an unfair proposition, because we have been told that the population of seme of the smaller States is going to increase in a phenomenal way. We do not able member put that provision into the know whether the population of all the Constitution ? States is going to run parallel; but, at any rate, Sir Joseph Carruthers saidMr Bruce Smith. You have then to ask for an amendment of the Constitution against the interests of the people of four Stales and against the interests of the Treasurers of four States, and you have to get that amendment carried by a majority of the people in a majority of the States. You cannot do it. It will be far easier in dealing with a question of this character to get an amendment made by the Federal Parliament than it will be to' get an amendment made by the Federal people, because if you have got four States who are perfectly satisfied with the arrangement, and have only to appeal to their sense of honour to give up something for the benefit of others, it w.ill be very difficult to carry the amendment, especially when Sir Joseph deals with a matter some people may think that they would have to give up a certain amount of revenue over and above what they are justly entitled to surrender. It will be very difficult to get people lo do that in a young country where expenditure means everything-wher e a settler looks upon expenditure as meaning a road to his land, where expenditure means to another man the keeping up of the rate of wages or of keeping him in employment. It will be very hard to get people to set personal honour against personal interest, and that is what will be involved in an amendment of the Constitution. So that, Mr Chairman, we see that this little party which favours the amendment has on its side Sir George Turner, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, Sir Joseph Carruthers, and the Argus of only a short time ago. What does this amend1 ment involve? I think that the honourable member for Mernda very wisely and discreetly claimed that he was entirely in favour of the principles of the agreement. So we are. Personally, I went so far as to say that I should not have minded seeing the amount of the fer cafita payment of the amendment says, in effect, "" We thoroughly approve of the agreement, as it has been assented to by the Premiers of the States and by the Prime Minister, but we object to it for all time. We say that if it be limited to an amount which will be equivalent to the aggregate interest on the debts existing at the time of Federation, say ^7,500,000-the exact amount is about ^£7,300,000, but let us put it in round figures-the arrangement should last until the population of Australia has reached 6,000,000. So that the amendment is one approving of the agreement in every particular, but limiting it to a period when the population becomes 6,000,000. fectly agreeable to its going into the Constitution.",24,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta
94,Mr Mcwilliams,Would the honor,25,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta
95,Mr Bruce Smith,"We are permember does not mind anything that he approves of going into the Constitution. member will be generous enough to admit that I have said, over and over again, that I should prefer the provision not to eo into the Constitution. Let us be fair to each other in this matter. I went so far as to say that I thought there was a medium course between merely passing an Act and putting the provision into the Constitution ; that we might have adopted the method of passing an Act embodying an agreement such as we agreed upon in regard to the Naval Agreement, or as we propose to do in the case of the Northern Territory. far better-it would have been more consonant with the views of the Prime Ministei: expressed at the Conference to which I have referred-that the arrangement should not be embodied in the Constitution. I quite agree with Sir Joseph Carruthers that we must assume that this Parliament in the future will consist of honest and honourable men, who will recognise the primary purpose of the Braddon section to give to thu States a fair and proper proportion, having regard to their needs, of the taxation collected through Customs and Excise. That is what we are contending We even go so far as to consent to an alteration of the Constitution, although I have shown a way of avoiding that difficulty. We give up our objections on that score. But we say, "" Do not let us bind ourselves for all time; do not let us, as the right honourable the Treasurer said, run contrary to the basic principles of the Constitution "" ; which is also what Sir George Turner said, and what the Prime Minister said at the last Conference. Therefore, we say, "" We give you everything, only limit the time."" The Prime Minister has admitted in oneof Ins utterances, and the Argus admits, which is perhaps more significant, that in the three years which would elapse between the time at which we enact this agreement and the time of the election after the next one, we should have much more experience to guide us. I have put in the two previous speeches which I have made. We have gained so much experience between 1901 and 1910 that we cannot arrogate to ourselves that our minds are finally closed to the reception of further data, and honourable that we shall not be wiser in 1920 than we are to-day. We have gained so much experience between 1901 and The honourable 1910 that I should like to know of any member of this Committee who is so hidebound as not-to admdt that his views have not been modified by the added knowledge. We all know the relationship between the States and' the Commonwealth far better than we did, and we shall know them far better in 1920 than we do to-day. We shall know what the history of this young country has been in the meantime. Some people say that the younger States will remain stationary in population, and that their advance will not be in the same ratio ns it has so far been. We have other I think it would have been honourable members on this side of . the Chamber who say that there is going to he an abnormal development in .some of the Stales, and that this abnormal increase in population will make a great difference. We do not know what w ill be the actual state of Australia, in ten years from now. We are embarking upon a most comprehensive system of immigration. 'We have not been doing that for years. We do not know exactly where the people who come to us will settle. They will not settle where they are told to settle; of that I have always been convinced. They will choose for themselves, and we do not for. We endorse the agreement. know how they will choose. The future is, therefore, an algebraical X , and the problem has to be solved by time and experience. Therefore, I maintain the wisdom of the proposal of the honourable member for Mernda, that when the population of Australia has reached 6,000,000 we should have an opportunity of again looking round and seeing how it has placed itself -wher e the people have gone, what they are doing, what our Customs revenue is, what our Commonwealth needs are, what the needs of the States are; and out of the wisdom derived from that addition to our knowledge we shall then have an opportunity of making a fresh arrangement. If I have demonstrated, as I have tried to do, that our Fusion agreement was in accordance with the amendment which the honourable member for Mernda has moved, then I want to say that the only men in That is an argument which this Committee who are steadfast to the F'usion agreement are those who voted for the amendment of the honourable member for Mernda last week, and those who propose to vote for the amendment now before the Committee.

107,Mr Dugald Thomson,"N O suchlanguage already cited from the Prime Minister's former speeches, the settlement of :the State debts question. The other point is that the words "" pending the preparation of a complete scheme,"" appearing in a ' documentof that kind, which embodies the terms of agreement between various sections of the House which were coming together to form one party, must mean the preparation of a formal scheme by the party, and not by the Government for the party. -reading something into it that is not there. Mr W. H . IRVINE -other meaning, for this reason : The gentlemen who came together to form the basis -of that Fusion agreement knew the conflicting views of several of us with regard to the financial question. They knew also that there were wide discrepancies with regard to other matters, such as new Protection, 'the Tariff, ancl naval and military defence, dealt with in the same agreement, but on the Tariff, on the question of new Protection, and on the defence question they did come to an agreement together which was to bind every memher of those three sections who became a member of the new party. to those questions we all became bound by the agreement, but on the finance question those who framed the agreement could not, and did not, come to any agreement to bind any of the members of the party, except that: they should agree to an interim arrangement until the party, as a party, ' could adopt some general scheme. That is the only meaning which in reason and fairness can be attributed to that sentence in the document, when we consider the circumstances under which the agreement was entered into. There is another matter. has been stated by the honourable member for Mernda, and admitted by the Prime Minister, that the amendment, upon which a vote which was taken the other day was submitted to the Committee in "" the form in which it was submitted as a test, the result of which the -Government were prepared to accept and act upon as an indication of the opinion of the Committee. -carried by a majority of two, or even one, . without the Chairman's casting vote, I think the Prime Minister himself would have admitted that he was bound not to ignore it. But I claim that, as it stands, ' it is in exactly the same position as if it had been carried by a majority of one vote, with one exception, and one exception only. Where the Chairman records his vote in order that the matter may be further considered, the vote of the Committee remains exactly . in the same position as any other vote given by a Cornmittee of this House, with the exception that the Government have a right, which If u l l y admit in this case, to again test the opinion, of the Committee if they choose to do so. party do not take the same view. Mr W. H . IRVINE I suppose the It can have no honourable member is entitled to make the kind of insinuation which is implied in the term "" your party,"" but I think the honourable member ought to deal with the matter, as other members ought if they desire to remain loval members of the party supporting the Government, in the same spirit as the Prime Minister did. We have been invited to consider this question. We were entitled to raise it , as loyal members of the party supporting the Government, and I ask the honourable member to accept the same position. The Prime Minister has said that he intends practicallv to ignore the vote of last week, With regard or, at all events, not to take any action upon it . Then the position comes to this: Another amendment has now been moved, and, even if that amendment be lost, still the previous vote stands, which, in effect, indicated that the majority of the Committee are not in, favour of the agreement in its present unrestricted form. A t a very early stage of the discussion of this matter I gave my friends -wisel y or unwisely-to understand that, provided that we, who dissented from this B ill , had an opportunity of testing the It opinion of the House in Committee upon it, I , for one, for ihe purposes of the passage of the B ill through this Parliament, should accept that decision, and record my vote for the third reading. The matter has now been fairly submitted to the Committee in a way which was laid before the Prime Minister, and accepted by him as the proper wav of testing the opinion of honourable members. The'GoI f that amendment had been vernment chose their own battlefield, and their own time to press for the division.

It is, however, I admit, always open to the Prime Minister, after a vote of that kind, to re-test the matter. should have no right to complain that there was the slightest departure from the understanding. There is another matter, personal to myself, which I am rather reluctant to deal with. Charges of inconsistency have been made against me in connection with my present attitude, by people outside this chamber, and also in the press. I have never made it a practice to There is, however, a balance reply to such charges when made in the press or by people outside, but when they are made by my honourable friends inside this House, and, if not met, may have some influence upon them, I may be permitted to say a word in reply to them,. It is perfectly true that when I was Premier and Treasurer of -VictoriaI took part in a Treasurers' Conference, which I attended for, I think, a week, although it lasted longer. I was then retiring from the Government, and my duties were continued by my successor. At that Conference, I put forward a proposal for the continuation in the Constitution permanently of the Braddon section. Nobody, I suppose, for a moment, dreamt, nor did I myself, that there would be the slightest W ill not this vote decide chance of carrying such a proposal. My action at the Conference does, however, No . We have involve this, that I was at that time prepared to advocate, by a Constitutional amendment, a Constitutional security or guarantee to the States of something whicb they did not then possess, namely, an assurance of the fjermanency of the Braddon section. fairer proposal than is the present agreement. Mr W. H . IRVINE W h a t I desire to say with regard to it is that, with all its No t by the event defects-and , of course, it would have the extremely serious defect which has often section, if we want to raise £ 1 , we musti impose taxation sufficient to raise £ 4 t h a t proposal for the permanency of the BraddonI do not want section would have been free from some of the most serious defects of this agreement. I , for one, would not dream now of advocating the permanency of the Braddon section. A great deal of water has passed under the bridge since the time of which I speak. I do not think that one of the State Premiers would dream of advocating such a proposal now, but that is the widest admission which can be charged against mc. As against that, I must say that from the moment I thought of entering If he does so, I for one, Federal politics, and in the first speech I made on the hustings, as well as in every speech I have since made ih this House and the country, I have taken up a position which is entirely consistent with that which' I now hold.

118,Mr Deakin,"Of the electors in themy mind that is the source of all the trouble. Parliaments come in? They are not the States? Mr W. H . IRVINE -The real trouble would arise from another cause. In all political institutions-and this applies esargument, I should like to ask honourable pecially where, as in a federation, political members to consider what is-likely to be power is vested in more or less competing authorities-the power of government ultimately depends on public opinion. It rests on public attention. The particular body which can succeed in gaining public interest, time should this agreement be carried out. and in concentrating public attention upon its operations, is the body which steadily and perpetually increases in influence and power. The body which is unable to do so becomes atrophied and paralyzed. If we place ourselves in a position in which we give up a large part, not of our money, but of our financial power, and place the State Parliaments in control of much greater financial powers than they have had before, and the right to continue the exercise of them-and this is in reply to the interjection of the Prime Ministerthen, assuredly, the State Parliaments and the State Governments will steadily arrogate and attract to themselves continually a larger comparative share of public opinion, and will concentrate to a greater degree public attention upon their operations, while we shall correspondingly sink to a lower plane. picture; it pleases the people opposite. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The honourable member says that I have painted a splendid picture. Let me say that the Prime Minister accused us of taking too black a view of the progress of Australia. I do not take by any means a dark view of that progress. I say that, whether the Parliament of the Commonwealtb or the Parliaments of the States are the dominant authorities of the future, Australia will continue its progress. Its progress cannot-be prevented. We are invested with a country the very nature of which is such that-unles s it were in the hands of a people without energy and without resource, and I should not care to say that about the inhabitants of Australia at the present time-it must forge ahead. Its resources are enormous. It is gradually attracting the attention of people in other parts of the world, and i l must continue to progress, and to progress rapidly. I take no dark view pf the future progress of Australia; but what I do take a dark view of is the probability under this agreement of a decline in the future of the Commonwealthauthority and usefulness as compared with the State authority and usefulness. That is what I fear. Though it may be, to some extent, repeating one portion of my, the comparative, position in regard to their financial resources and powers of the Commonwealth and the States ten, fifteen., or twenty years hence, or even before that In the first place, the States would have a first charge of .ess. per head on the Customs and Excise revenue, which at the present very high rate of return per capita from Customs and Excise. would involve 50 per cent, of the total revenue from this source. In addition, they would have what they have secured already, a primary position and a first lien on all, or nearly all, the great sources of direct taxation. We have land taxation in. some form in, almost all of the States. We have taxation on incomes in, I think, all of the States. There is very heavy taxation in the form of succession and probate duties in most of the States. I am putting the position fairly, when I say tliat the State Parliaments have already a first footing. They have fenced the ground, and are in possession practically of nearly all the ordinary sources of direct taxation. If the Commonwealth authority desires to occupy that position we shall have to appeal to the people who will be asked to submit to the extra taxation on grounds sufficiently strong to justify us in asking that we should be allowed to duplicate this kind of taxation, to impose it in addition to that imposed by the State authorities. We should! bave the State Parliaments possessed of these two powerful and growing sources of revenue. In addition, the States would have another power which is very seldom referred to, but which is one of the most important considerations affecting the progress in econom'cs of other countries, and especially of the TJnited States, ancl one of the most important sources of financial power in the world. Each of the State Parliaments would be in the position of the owner and controller of a monopoly of the transport services of the whole country. They already derive enoromous revenues from this source. They have been able to defray the greater portion of the cost of construction, and the moneys still",30,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta
119,Mr Deakin,But where do the State,31,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta
120,Mr Tilley Brown,"That is a splendidpayable out of capital always assume smaller proportions to the original indebtedness on this account. from this source is perpetually increasing. The State authorities would be in possession of all these sources of nnancial power, and what would be the position of the Commonwealth? The Commonwealth authority would be in possession of what remained of the Customs and Excise revenue after 25s. per head had been returned to the States, and I have previously endeavoured to show that in all probability that would be a diminishing amount. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. Mr W. H . IRVINE ask the people to return the power which it is now proposed to voluntarily relinquish, the Governments and Parliaments of the States will have been for years in possession of sources of revenue of great magnitude. receiving a large and fixed percentage of the Customs and Excise revenue levied by the Commonwealth, they will have practically the first claim in respect to direct taxation, and they will have large and increasing returns from their railway systems and other reproductive public works. It has been said, more than once, by the honourable member for North Sydney, that the creditors of the States expect to be repaid the sums which they have advanced, and the interest on their loans, out of the Customs and Excise revenue.

Mr W. H . IRVINE Prime Minister's figures are correct j I am surprised to learn that not more proportionately has been borrowed for railway construction. [200] * case in regard to the smaller States, I think I am right in saying that the revenue from The revenue railways and other reproductive public works will pay the interest on the greater part of the money borrowed by them. When we come to ask the people to give back to us the powers which it is now proposed to relinquish, our prestige and authority will have been weakened. We shall be practically in the position of mendicants, and the people will have become accustomed to the expenditure of huge sums by the State Governments. In this way various interests will have been created which will milita'te against the granting of When we our request, while we shall have the united forces of all the State authorities in opposition to us. It is a negation of all that we know to be true regarding the evolution of politics to affirm that we shall be able to get back these powers, except at a time They will have been of extreme national emergency. Should a. war break out, making it necessary to spend an enormous sum on defence, the people would, no doubt, submit tofurther taxation in any form, and under such circumstances-thoug h only after a terrible internecine conflict between the authorities of the Commonwealth and the States-w e might get back the powers which it is proposed we should surrender. TJnder ordinary circumstances, what we give away now we shall give away finally. The' Prime Minister said-it was not the weakest part of his speech-that I dispute that. In this matter must come before the electors at one time or another, either by way of referendum, or at the next election as the proposition* of the Government. I say, let it come before the people in the ordinary constitutional manner, so that every candidate for election may be free to advocate what he thinks best, untrammelled by party influence or prior commitA great deal ment. What would it matter if the settlement of the question were postponed for another year? The Braddon provision will I think that operate until Parliament otherwise provides.

It was thisI may say that in addition to those whorecorded their votes for the amendment divided upon the other night, there are at least half-adozen honourable members on this side, some of whom have spoken to that effect. By"" spoken,"" I meant, of course, publiclyand some of whom have privately intimated their entire approval of a limitation of the operation of this agreement. I did not mean in private conversations, but as honourable members know, men talk about their opinions openly, and I made an impersonal statement to that effect. I stick to that statement now. There were certainly in my mind three honourable members who had spoken in the House against the agreement being unlimited, and who had not voted for my amendment. the private statements. privately expressed the same opinion. The honourable member for Franklin tried to entrap me into making it a personal matter by interjectingIt would be better for the honourable member to give the names of the honourable members to Whom he refers I repliedI mention no names, but if I were to mention the names, I do not think 1 should mention the honourable member for Franklin. I repeat, and I challenge contradiction of the statement, thai at least half-a-dozen honourable members on this side, in addition to those who have already voted At that stage the honourable member for Grampians interrupted me, and as the result of his interruption I said distinctly that I did not refer to him, that I did not know his opinion, and that consequently my remarks were not directed to him at all. I ,was simply making a general statement such as is made every day in the House, and which I have heard the honourable member for Franklin' make in connection with honourable memberson the other side. WhatI resent is the. charge distinctly made by the. honourable member that I revealed private conversations. I did nothing ot the kind. I alluded simply to a fact, based, on the public utterances of a certain number of honourable gentlemen, and. on statements which were made by others at various times, although not in the Chamber, but which were well known. I mentioned no names, and simply stated, a fact which I Forwas quite entitled to state so long as I did not point to any individual. honourable member for Franklin endeavoured to reply to the arguments adduced by the honourable member for Mernda in moving the amendment and supported by the honourable members for Flinders and Parkes, ( but he did not touch, one of those arguments.. He simply repeated what has several times been said by way of interjection with the object, if possible, of discrediting all those who do not agree with the Government in regard to the agreement, to the effect that they are afraid to trust the people. The honourable member, who, I am sorry to say,, is leaving the Chamber, is no novice, and knows as well as any honourable member in the Chamber that not one of those who sit on this side is at any time afraid to trust the people. He knows also that the combination which has been formed between the Federal Government and the State Governments in order to carry this amendment of the Constitution at a referendum could never be got together again to take it out of the Constitution. The honourable member in the latter portion of his remarks did allude for the first time to the fact that a majority of the States, as well as a majority of the people, was necessary to secure an alteration of the Constitution. The trouble is not the getting of a majority vote of the people, but the question of getting a majority vote of the States. It has been shown that 900,000 people may be defeated by 80,000 people at a referendum of this kind. That is not trusting the people.. Those who support the Bill want to trust the 80,000 people and to defy the will of the 900,000. are not correct. figures, but it will be sufficient for my argument to say that if this alteration is put in the Constitution, and the people see afterwards that a grave mistake has been made> and want to take it out again, the great majority of the people who reside in. the three larger States of Victoria, New",37,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta

Assuming that every one voted, and taking the relative strength of the people in each of those sets of States, the fact remains, and will always remain, that the majority of the people can be defeated by the minority. member think it likely that such a thing would happen? I should not have the same objection to the Government's proposal. The Constitution provides that the National Parliament, after ten years' experience of the requirements of the States and of its own requirements, shall have the sole right to determine the future distribution of Customs and Excise revenue between the States and the Commonwealth upon an equitable basis. It does not give the States that right, but this Bill will have the effect of depriving the National Parliament for all time of the power to review the position if a mistake has been made. It is easy to do evil at all times, but it is difficult to undo that evil. Prevention is better than cure, and we have the means of prevention in 'our own hands. If we use those means we shall in no way derogate from the real rights of the States, but at the same time we shall maintain the rights of the people, because no one will attempt to deny that if the people are represented by one Parliament more fully than by another, it is by the National Parliament as compared with the State Parliaments. This Parliament is elected on the broadest franchise, and the will of Ihe people is fully represented in it. Every man and every woman has and can exercise the right to say who shall control their destinies in this Parliament, but my honourable friends know as well as I do that that is not true of the State Parliaments. No more important matter than this was ever brought before the National Parliament. There should be no question of political parties in this case. There should be only one party, and that is the party which stands for the maintenance of the people's rights in the only Parliament that has been properlv constituted to safeguard those rights. We who are taking the National side in this matter see the danger ahead. We see the necessity of preserving the paramountcy of the National Parliament, but we are asked to degrade and disrate and decrease the powers of this Parliament by our own act. The views whicb I am expressing have been held by the leading members of this Parliament from the time when the question was first brought forward. No one will dare to say that the first Federal Government and those who supported them were not patriots. The first pronouncement on the subject was made by the honourable Sir George Turner when he occupied the position of Treasurer. He laid it down clearly that there ought to be a distribution of the finances as between the Federation and the States, but only on condition that the States handed over to this Parlia : ment full control of future borrowing. That was followed up by the right honourable member for Swan, when Treasurer previously. He made at that time no proposal for referring the question to the people. He claimed that this Parliament' was specially deputed by the people to deal with the matter, and prepared to settle it on an equitable basis. On that occasion again the Federal Government and their supporters stood firm. Next the honourable member for Hume, as Treasurer in the Deakin Government, I presume with the full concurrence of the Cabinet, and I know with the concurrence of those who supported that Government, laid down the principle that there should be a redistribution of the finances, but no surrender of the powers of the National Parliament. Not very long before the last Premiers' Conference, where this agreement was arrived at, the present Treasurer, the right honourable member for Swan, voiced exactly the same views in an interview. Therefore, in the course of a few years we have had all the Federal Treasurers, all the Governments, and all their supporters saying, ""We recognise our responsibilities and our duty to the people; we are going to discharge those responsibilities honestly and truly."" Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Franklin -has said about trusting the people, no one has attempted to deny that what the honourable member for Mernda proposes is merely a limitation which will give an opportunity for the gaining of further experience.

Mr Deakin would have us believe that the Commonwealth Constitution is vague on this .point, but, in our view, nothing could be plainer..

To use Mr Deakin's own words : "" That 10 years was intended to be a term of probation inquiry and experience which should .fit the representatives whom I have the honour to address for the task of re-shaping the partnership according to the knowledge gained in the interval."" Has not every honourable member who has supported the amendment 'asked for more experience, so that ultimately the matter may be dealt with in a manner equitable to the States, without depriving the Commonwealth Parliament of its due powers? Whether the Deakin-£«»»-Cook fusion is a tribunal honestly representative of the people, and to whom Mr Deakin's appeal can alone have been intended, is a moot question. But this we do know, that it is the duty of the Federal Parliament before swallowing Mr Deakin's nnancial proposal to cause a strict investigation to be made as to the determination of the Sydney Government to so entirely ignore the Western half of this State as they have done during the last ten years. orable member will recognise that a question of local politics has nothing to do with the matter now before the Chair. posed to quote only three or four lines more, but I shall not do so.

204,Mr Chanter,"No. My constituentsthe National Parliament being able to do for the people what they hope and expect. It is proposed that we shall return to the States for all time 25s. per head of the population, leaving 25s. per head for our own use. Of that amount 22s. 6d. is already allocated: ios. per head being required for the payment of old-age pensions, and 12s. 6d. per head to provide for the Government scheme of defence. leaves a balance of 2s. 6d. per head to provide for the cost of administering the affairs of the Commonwealth. I "" appeal to those with whom I have worked for years in the cause of Democracy and Protection not to support this agreement. They must know in their hearts that if the agreement is accepted we shall soon reach the stage at which it will be absolutely impossible for the Commonwealth to obtain from Customs and Excise sufficient revenue to enable the proposed payment to the States to be continued, unless we so recast the Tariff as to secure larger returns, and at the same time destroy the industries of Australia. aspect of the position. vite the supporters of Protection to consider. clusively that wherever a truly protective policy has been established there has been a decline in the Customs revenue. as a protective Tariff becomes effective, and leads to the creation of new industries, the Customs revenue must decrease. That is the experience of Germany, the United States, and other nations. I quoted recently a long statement showing how the Customs revenue of various nations had fallen as the result of the imposition of protective duties. In only three cases was the per capita return from Customs and Excise over 25s. per head; in all others it was below that amount. The Commonwealth can afford at the present time to make the proposed return to the States, for the reason that, as yet, Protection here is only in its infancy. The industries that we hope to see created as the result of the existing Tariff have not yet been f u l ly established. We have consequently a large Customs revenue, but, if Protection is maintained, that revenue must decrease vear by year. From what other sources are we to obtain more revenue to meet the demands made upon the Commonwealth Government ? We can raise revenue only by the imposition of Customs and Excise duties, or by direct taxation. Do honourable members desire to save Protection at the cost of the imposition of direct taxation, or by going to the pawnbroker and loading posterity with a national debt, for which they will curse us? here to hear their curses. That As trustees of the people, we have a right to consider those who come after us, just as we consider the future of our children. We ought not to impose on posterity burdens that it will be found very difficult to remove. never built up a heritage only to have it squandered ? from the people of Australia a goodly heritage. Can it be said that we haw squandered it? Have we squandered the millions that we have received from Customs and Excise during the last few years ? Has it not gone back, for the most part, to the States, only, to be absolutely squandered by some of them? It is our duty It is one that I into protect the people, not only in their National, but in their State capacity. In The statistical returns prove conpre-Federal days, my own State could get along very well with an annual revenue of between £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £10,000,000. This Parliament has relieved it of an exEvery one knows that penditure of about ,£3,000,000; yet, although having regard to the comparatively small increase in population, the ordinary expenditure of the State should not have been increased, we find to-day that it amounts to about £14,000,000 and that the State Government have gone into the market for about £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year. New South Wales is in a position different from that of ' t h e other States. Having a fiscal policy different from that of the other States prior to Federation, it did not derive from Customs and Excise anything like the revenue they secured from that source. Its Customs revenue before Federation amounted, roughly speakingj to about £1,000,000' per annum. It now derives from that source over £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. Why should the Government hesitate to give the people an opportunity to consider this question before they are called upon finally to decide it ? It is not absolutely necessary that this Parliament should deal with it . The Braddon section will not expire until the end of next year, and before then there must, irany case, be an appeal to the people. A t the next general 1",41,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta

It is easier to commit evil than to undo the. effects of evil j and, to put it mildly, there is a suspicion that evil will be done if this agreement be adopted -> Why not, in the name of common sense, afford the people a few months for consideration, so that they may arrive at a verdict, not by a majority of the States, but by a majority of the electors, and thus determine their own destiny. Sydney) [4-0] I have listened to the extraordinarily inconsistent speech of the honourable member for Riverina, and whilst I do not intend to attempt to follow all its -devious courses, I may deal briefly with one or two of his statements. First of all he has complained that in the settlement of this question there have been some refusals of pairs, and he calls that sharp practice. Yet the honourable member is one of a party who adopted that very sharp practice as one of its principles, for the first time in the history of this Parliament. He actually attempts to twit honourable members on this side, even if they did refuse pairs, w th adopting a system of sharp practice, : which he, by his decision and by his action, has been endorsing in this Parliament. is absolutely wrong. I gave the Postmaster-General a pair on several occasions. honourable member and those associated with him adopted the plan of refusing pairs. He now makes the insinuation that there has been a refusal to pair. Where is that refusal on this side? Let hirri instance one case in this division.. happened last n'ght. speaking of the coming division. There ave honourable members on that side paired now.

265,The Honourable Member For West Mr Dugald Thomson,"If theber think that pairs are to be given without an indication of the desire of the honourable member concerned, especially when he is in the Commonwealth ? for Eden-Monaro sent word to us to instruct the Government Whip not to pair him with the Government. position is that an honourable member is absent who may be looked upon as voting for the Government, and those who say that he should be paired on the other side cannot produce a single document to show that he desires it . The honourable member for Riverina also asked if those on this side, with whom he had been associated for many years, were going to vote for direct taxation if they afterwards found that this agreement made that necessary in order to preserve the policy of Protection, indicating thereby that direct taxat on was : against their policy. The honourable member himself has joined another organization one of the planks of whose platform is a progressive land tax. He accused the members of the party to which he previously belonged of being associated with Free Traders, while he claimed that he had never touched that unclean thing. Yet he has himself joined a party which has Free Traders within its ranks. What consistency is there in that sort of argument? of a progressive land tax. why did the honourable member taunt his old associates on this side with doing what would not te in accordance with, their policy if they had in the end to resort to direct taxation? forced to do it. orable member taunted those who had been associated with him for so many years, and asked if they were going to impose the taxabeen known that it was to be only tentation. Coming to the arguments used by previous speakers in favour of the amendment, I would deal with that one on which great stress has been laid, to the effect that the proposal of the Government is not in accordance with the Fusion agreement. While it differs in some ways from the Fusion agreement, it is not inconsistent with it. That agreement said that, failing the preparation of a complete scheme, a temporary system should be adopted. Further, as the honourable member for Wilmot pointed out, the Prime Minister elaborated that question when he brought the matter before Parliament, and indicated that steps were being taken for the preparation of a complete scheme. Some have said that the Prime Minister and the members of his Government who,went into the Conference with the State Premiers ought not, in view of the Fusion arrangement, to have conwith the members of their party. Just expand that argument. If the Ministers representing the Commonwealth in the Conference, and every Minister representing the six States, although they went there to strive to arrive at an agreement, were to do nothing without consultation with and approval by, not their Parliaments, for that had to follow as a matter of course, but also their own parties, what would be the position? Nothing more absurd could be put forward. Members on this side of tbe House, as well as those on the other side, knew that when the Prime Minister and those associated with him entered the Conference, it was with the desire and intention, if possible, of arriving at an agreement. They arrived at an agreement, and I have shown the absurdity of proposing to submit that agreement to the members, of the parties supporting the Governments in the six States and in the Commonwealth. It is too ridiculous to be worth consideration. sulted them about the permanency of it ? That is the one point in dispute. tation with the supporters of the Federal Government would involve also consultation, by the State Premiers with their own parties. have involved that. Do honourable members think that there would have been any chance of coming to an agreement if it had tive, and would have to go to seven bodies ot Government supporters throughout the Commonwealth? The Conference would 1 never have dreamt of coming together, and.' could not have beeni brought together, under those conditions. The only conditions that could bring them together were those that existed-that those present were prepared, as the Prime Minister said, to put their political lives behind the agreement arrived at, and to stand or fall by it.

There has been no attempt to do so. The honourable member, and others who support his views, are perfectly right in maintaining that, as there has been some departure from the arrangement outlined in the Fusion agreement, they are not entitled to be dragged at the chariot wheels of the Government. The Government recognised .that fact fully and generously, and gave -those honourable members, Avithout cavil and -without dispute, the liberty which . they sought of recording their, votes .with their views.

No re-flecticn has been cast in this Chamber on lthe free action of honourable members who differ from the rest of the party, and I shall not assist the Opposition by using -language which might be offensive to them. The silence of honourable members opposite is ominous. They recognise that a family difference often leads to a family quarrel,' and that words spoken in heat may accomplish what they desire, the severance of the Ministerial party. They -have endeavoured to further that by ap-plause and interjections, which, I am sure, -will be appreciated at their full value by .those who have received them. The utmost freedom has willingly been conceded to those who have differed from the majority of the party. The honourable for Batman did not say so last night. accept the honourable member's word as to whether party pressure was brought to bear on him at these meetings, or in any other way. I do not take into account conversations between members. Warm things are sometimes said between friends. Argument does not always lead to agreement, but frequently ends in a heated passage-atarms which the parties would not afterwards justify.. I am not speaking of such matters. We have no right to recognise them here. I am speaking of official actions of the party, and no one can contradict my statements. Two or three honourable members have said that most of those who support the agreement are doing so against their convictions. That is a All consultations have, been constatement which should not have been made, because it is absolutely incorrect. Were ii justifiable it would apply to both sides. . Some of those who support the agreement .would like it amended in detail, but they recognise that there will always be differences of opinion in regard to a matter of this sort. Their position is this : "" An opportunity now presenrs itself to come to an agreement. We wish for a settlement. We would prefer an agreement for a period, or one differing in some other particular ' from that put forward by the Government; but we recognise that we cannot get unanimity, that what one would consider a sufficient period, another would think too short; and, therefore, to proposal of the Government, as the best possible under the circumstances."" If , to take that attitude, is to depart from one's convictions, the same thing may be said of the attitude of those who are supporting the amendment. Some years ago, the honorable member for Mernda proposed a financial scheme, the adoption of which he has since frequently advocated. He deserves credit for the interest and trouble that he has taken in the matter. But his present proposal differs from that scheme. given up his scheme. departure from his convictions? call it a departure from the honourable member's convictions.

To secure unanimity amongst themselves, those who are opposing the ratification of the agreement are departthe burden of interest had been so transing from proposals which they previously favoured. But it would not be fair to charge them with deserting their convictions freed from its existing debts. Queensland because they are doing so, finding that they was to be freed of nearly £ 8 0 a head, cannot get exactly what they desire. The honourable member for Parkes said that the Fusion agreement provided for the transfer of the State debts and the sharing of the revenue to be dealt with together. That 'is what the Government proposes. It has introduced a Bill to provide for the sharing of the revenue, and another to provide for the transfer of the debts, or any portion of them, to the Commonwealth. He also said that the attitude of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and others now is inconsistent with their attitude in 1907. But the Conferences of 1907, and former years, had for their object the division of the Customs and the Excise revenue between the Commonwealth and the States. This differs entirely from the proposal now before us, which provides for the pavment to the States of 25s. per capita, all,, or none, or only part, of which sum may come from Customs and Excise revenue. Surely 'different opinions may be held regarding proposals which are so different! An hon.crable member might see good reason why a mere allocation of the Customs and Excise revenue should not be permanently provided for in the Constitution, but might not object to the amendment of the Constitution so long as the Commonwealth was not bound to make payments to the States out of any particular revenue fund. The apply, because the whole field of taxation remains open to the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Mernda charged the Premier of Queensland with being inconsistent in agreeing with his scheme and opposing his amendment. was inconsistent. honourable member apparently referred to the attitude of the Premier of Queensland towards his scheme by way of showing that he is inconsistent, but I accept the honourable member's denial. It would be astonishing were the Premier of Queensland to be opposed to the honourable member's scheme, because what the honourable member suggested was that the interest on the debts, up to nearly £9,000,000, should be put on the shoulders of the Commonwealth, and that the debts carrying that interest should cease to be charged against the States when ferred. There was to be practically a wiping of the slate. Each State was to be Victoria of only. £ 4 2 a head, and Tasmania, of, I think, about £ 4 5 a head. A gigantic premium was offered to Queensland.

301,Mr Dugald Thomson,"I amto repeat some arguments that I used on a previous occasion, but 1 shall briefly summarize them. I tried to show that even if this per capita allowance were to be provided entirely from Customs and Excise taxation we should only be carrying out the intention of the Federal Convention that we should allocate to the States some permanent share of the Customs and Excise revenue. On the question as to whether a sufficient or an insufficient proportion was being granted, I pointed out that the proposed distribution to the States of 25s. per head of the revenue financed the States only in respect of their present expenditure, whereas it financed the Commonwealth in respect of not only its present expenditure, but the cost of old-age pensions and its anticipated increased cost of naval defence. I urged, beyond that, that if the States and the Commonwealth entered upon other enterprises, as both will probably do, it would surely be the responsibility of those who did so to find the means of providing the necessary revenue. velopmental expenditure rests certainly with the States. I gave the particulars before, and shall not repeat them. The States are also responsible for a larger proportion of the expenditure, which must increase with population, than the Commonwealth is. It has been urged that if this agreement were carried and placed in the Constitution there would 'be no power to excise it, if circumstances rendered it necessary. no power to excise it. will accept the honourable member's correction and say that it is urged that there orable member knows that there is no point would be enormous difficulty in removing in his question.

Any Parliament, if it finds that it has a fund to draw freely on, will gradually annex the whole of it for its own expenditure. know of, has ever long resisted the temptation. orable member has? a fear, but a certainty; and the States recognise the danger of depriving them of such a large source of revenue, and feel that it must certainly lead to unification. There are certain honourable members who have unification in their minds, and every move they make in this House has that motive, though I am not accusing the supporters of the amendment of that. On all occasions, we should try to look at both sides of the question-the Commonwealth side certainly, but also at the State side. -Some of the leading Ministers were those who took the greatest interest in, and had more to do with bringing about Federation than probably any other members of the House; and it seems to me that, by this proposal, they aim a severe blow at the very thing they brought into existence. I should like Ministers, before they press their supporters too strongly, to consider carefully whether it is advisable to make this agreement permanent. I could understand members of the Labour party opposing it, seeing that they have for a long time been bringing pressure to bear on the Federal Parliament to impose a land tax. If the agreement is carried, it seems to me that the Federal Parliament will have to impose both a land and an income tax, in addition to the land and income tax of each State. It is quite evident that we shall not, in time to come, have sufficient revenues from our present resources to meet the whole of the engagements of the Commonwealth. It has been clearly proved, I think, that as population increases, the per capita return from Customs and Excise will f a l l ; and yet it is proposed for all time to give a permanent grant of 25s. to the States. I could understand a sliding scale, by which the proportion paid to the State rose or fell with the revenue. I have no objection personally to the present proposed grant, provided there be a limit of time; and I think that has been the view of every honourable member who has opposed the proposal of the Government. It has been stated that those who oppose the agreement are supporting the Labour party; but it appears rather that the Opposition are supporting members on this side, probably because they regard the position they take up as fair, or, it may be, for some other No Parliament I reason. It is easy for us on this side to sit on a bed of roses, and agree to the proposals of the Government; but many of us are, I think, making ourselves unpopular with our constituents, though our action shows the consistency of our views, and that we are not afraid, even just before an election^ to do what we honestly believe is the correct thing. There is one argument I have not yet mentioned, namely, that if we make the agreement permanent, it can never afterwards be altered. It is a contract between the Commonwealth and the Governments of the States, that this sum shall be paid for all time; and it is quite certain that many of the. States will increase their borrowings, because they will have a fixed income. They will be able to say to their creditors, "" We are assured of s:> much per annum from the Customs and Excise in perpetuity."" heard what Mr Kidston and other Premiers have said. . States once start borrowing, we shall not be able to help ourselves. Further, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent a State mortgaging its share of the Customs and Excise revenue under the contract, because it will be as safe to them for all time hereafter, as was the payment of the three-fourths under the Braddon section. What would have been said if the Commonwealth, pressed for money, had asked the people to vary the Braddon section? Supposing, at the end of five years, we had said: "" We wish the section altered, and we ask you to amend the Constitution so as to give",50,Thomson Th E Sented To Anything Without Consultation

Would they not have urged that it was absolute repudiation? Ancl so it would be if we were to ask them to vary the contract that is now proposed. It is just as much repudiation to alter a contract made in perpetuity as to ask the people to vary a contract made for ten years. I do not think that the Commonwealth Parliament could at any time, in honour, ask the people of Australia to vary the agreement into which we are now entering. The States might double their indebtedness by borrowing another £200,000,000 ; and we know that they have security sufficient to pay the interest on such a debt. The railways are an ever-increasing revenue producing property, and just about pay the interest on the present debts. If we double the income of the States by granting 25s. per capita, we virtually authorize them to pledge the State assets to the extent of anwhich are at their own doors, and when the other £100,000,000, or £200,000,000. Ancl this can never be undone; we cannot say to the State creditors: "" We are going to ask the people of Australia to vary the contract."" I am sure that the members of this Parliament would never dare to ask the people to vary the agreement, seeing that it had been solemnly entered into, and that the States had in consequence pledged themselves to pay interest on largely-increased loans. The Commonwealth has no assets on which to borrow. We have extensive powers of taxation, but, with the exception of duties of Customs and Excise, our powers are hardly worth the name. Each State has a land and an income tax, and the income tax in Victoria is probably one of the heaviest in the world. I do not think that the Commonwealth Parliament would dare to impose on the people of this State a super-income tax; and, in any case, there is a certain limit to the paying power of the taxpayer. land tax are made too heavy, the income tax drives capital out of the country and the land tax drives people off the land, and the revenue instead of being increased is decreased. What would State politicians say .if we attempted to ask the people to vary the agreement now proposed? They would say to us: "" Did you not enter into the contract with us for all time, with youi eyes open? The State Premiers pressed for this agreement, and the Prime Ministei agreed to it ; the Federal Parliament, byAct, assented to it, and the people \vere asked to confirm it .

There are about 600 State politicians, as against in members of the Commonwealth Parliament.

The people will say that they must consider the interests of the States Federal Capital is established at Canberra, what interest will the people of States other than New South Wales have in the Commonwealth Parliament? land, Western Australia, and other States take an interest in Commonwealth affairs at the present time. You will see in each of the State daily newspapers about half a column regarding what is going on in the Commonwealth Parliament, as against columns and columns referring to what is taking place in the State Parliaments. Take Victoria as an example of what will happen. When the Federal Capital is established at Canberra, and Victoria is receiving £2,000,000 or more out of Customs and Excise revenue, will the Victorian people give that up in order to allow the greater part of it to be spent, perhaps, in New South Wales? The fleet If an income tax and will be there, the docks will be there, the shipbuilding yards will be there, and the people of Victoria will say, "" Why should we give up £2,000,000 to be spent in New South Wales or in any other State?

We have taken over old-age pensions, which were said by the Treasurer at the time to be costing about ^i,000,000 a year. They cost £1,500,000 now, they will cost £2,000,000 a year before the matter is finally settled, and the total will be £3,000,000 a year when invalid pensions are included. We propose to build railways from east to west, and from north to south. We are going to take over the debts which South Australia has incurred in the Northern Territory. We propose to attempt to develop the Northern Territory, and we contemplate building a Federal Capital. things under from £20,000,000 ^30,000,000 or £40,000,000. have to borrow that money, and pay interest on it. Defence will cost £3,000,000 at least, and old-age and invalid pensions £3,000,000, and we shall have to pay .£1,000,000 in interest. We shall have to find, therefore, £7,000,000 out of the little Customs revenue which will be left to us. That is about all that we should have to fall back upon. We might put revenue duties on tea, kerosene,, and cotton goods. Those are about the only large importations that are free at present, and how much could be squeezed out of them ? If we got £1,500,000 a year out of them we should be very lucky. Yet, after paying 25s. per head to the States, we shall have to pay our way out of the balance of the Customs and Excise revenue, and out of what little revenue we can produce from the balance of our importations. I feel, therefore, that within a very short time, probably within the time of many members now in the House, the Commonwealth Parliament will be in the greatest financial difficulty, and I do not think that States can block us. Do honourable memour borrowing power in the eyes of moneylenders will be more than £50,000,000. We shall have to pay a larger rate of interest in the future than we are paying now. The States are by degrees getting into the hands of a ring in London. The other day, the Premier of South Australia tried to place a loan outside that ring, and what a howl there was ! Inspired paragraphs appeared in the papers, and attempts were made at Home to block the loan. We cannot borrow £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 for the repayment of any existing debt when it falls due unless we go to the same people. From 3! per cent., our interest has now risen to about Mr Agar Wynne. 3! per cent., and before long it will be 4 per cent. That means a serious charge upon the people of Australia. Do honourable members think that the States will come to the Commonwealth Government and float their loans through us when their assets are better than our own? The security which the States offer to the money-lender is better than the Federal Parliament can give. We have no railways or other large revenue-earning, trading concerns, and, therefore, there is very little chance of our ever being asked to take over the debts of the States. In England, pensions were granted to the Duke of Marlborough and others for all time, We cannot do those and what has happened? . The Imperial to Government has had to pay enormous sums We shall to commute those pensions; but, if we enter into this agreement with the States, we shall never be in a position to commute the payments. We shall have to make them as long as ever the country and the Parliament are in existence. If we require money in time of war, how are we to get it? We shall have no importations if our ports, are blocked, and yet we shall have to pay 25s. per head to the States, whether it comes from Customs revenue or from any other source. It will probably mean that we shall not be able to pay even that 25s. per head to the States in time of war, but will have actually to repudiate the contract that we have entered into. I think the least that can be put into this Bill is some saving clause to protect us in time of war. As the agreement stands, we have not the slightest protection. We are entering into this contract, and will have to carry it out, whether we want to or not, or else repudiate our liability. There is no provision whatever to suspend the contract except by the cumbersome system cf taking a vote of the people, and then three bers think fhat we can afford to take a referendum of the people on the question when the enemy's fleet is on its way to Australia? It takes something like sixty days now to take a vote. referendum to see whether we can protect ourselves or not. is a nice position in which to place the Commonwealth Parliament and the people of Australia!

His statement has been ridiculed to-day as having reference only to the private conversations of individual members-. I take it, however, that a Government Whip, when he professes to carry a message from the Prime Minister to a Government supporter, does not occupy the position of a private member, and it is strange that that kind of influence should be used. stand why it should be. I fully appreciated the statement by the. Prime Minister that be desired the frankest expression of the judgment of every honourable member on this momentous question. That is a proper position to take up, for this question is far above all party considerations. should not be dealt with from Government, Opposition, Labour, or anti-Labour points of view, for it goes to the very root and existence of this Parliament. We have been told to-day that we are constantly hearing in this House the parrot-like cries of "" Commonwealth interests "" and "" the National Parliament."" I should like to know where such cries should be raised, if not in the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Then we have the statement that has been made that certain honourable members opposite would vote against this agreement if they were free. It is difficult to understand how the supporters of the Government can be said to be otherwise than free in view of the statement by the Prime Minister, but it is a fact that several honourable members have openly declared themselves in favour of a limitation of the agreement, and yet have voted against an amendment designed to indicate to the Government the desire of the Committee that a limitation should be imposed. Take for instance, the honourable member for Wimmera, who, on the motion for leave to introduce this Bill, saidPerhaps in the course of ten or fifteen or views of the various State Premiers; but I twenty years further experience may suggest the think there is a middle course which would renecessity of making another alteration of the lieve much of the existing difficulty, and enable Constitution. Mr Wise. At another part of his speech, he saidI f the State debts were taken over automatically by the Commonwealth Parliament-and I very much regret that that is not made an integral part of this scheme-thi s Parliament would become the supreme financial power, so far as Australia is concerned. Then he went on to sayOur circumstances change rapidly. Public services come into existence one year which were hardly thought of the year before, so that the States should recognise that it is unreasonable to make an agreement of this kind perpetual. . . . I hope that in Committee it will be found, possible to meet the wishes of many honourable members, who, like myself, think that the payments to the States should be limited to a term of years. We were told on the floor of the House that a friendly arrangement had been made with the Prime Minister that a test vote should be taken to determine whether there should be a limitation to the agreement, on I fail to underthe motion for the omission of the word "" The"" from clause 3, and that honourable members would be perfectly free to vote as they pleased. Yet we found the honourable member for Wimmera voting for the retention of that word, and I venture to say that he will vote against the amendment now before us. I fail to understand why It he should have gone back on the opinion that he expressed in this House only a week or two ago. I come now to the honourable member for Kooyong, who went into the financial question rather elaborately, and submitted a scheme dealing with the whole of the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth. Speakingon the motion for leave to introduce this Bill, he saidI never contemplated any change in the Constitution, but regarded it as a matter of trust between the representatives of the States and the representatives of the Commonwealth, holding the opinion that it is quite competent for us to enter into an obligation for a period of years that will be as binding as any Constitutional enactment. I have not yet seen or discovered any reason for a referendum on the question. The proposal for the taking over of the State debts is quite a different matter; but, in regard to the Braddon section, I regard a referendum as unnecessary at present, in insisting that it is necessary to have the arrangement in black and white, we are practically taking up the position that we cannot trust ourselves . and also a want of confidence in the State Parliaments. He went on to sayThe Ministry, with their wider knowledge, may feel that a referendum is absolutely necessary, seeing that they are in possession of the the whole of this House-becaus e it is not .a party question, but rather a family matter, concerning our own brothers and sisters-to come to an agreement universally acceptable. And yet the honourable member voted against the amendment to omit "" The."" Was any influence brought to bear upon him, either in the House or outside ? He also saidI think that if the agreement were limited to, say, the next ten years, we shall in that period have a development which will surprise us all. . If honourable members sitting behind the Government were' free to vote as they pleased, why did the honourable member for Kooyong vote against the amendment? The honourable member for Lang, who was the last to speak to the amendment for the omission of the word "" The,"" saidI do not regard the agreement as perfect, especially bearing in mind the commitments of the Commonwealth. Evidently the honourable member recognises that we have a lot of commitments, and does not know how they are going to be metI should like to see an arrangement come to is even more important than the nnancial one. which, whilst insuring the solvency of the States, would be sufficiently elastic to enable us to reguIt published that statement on the 19th late our expenditure and income in accordance August.

I have now quoted statements made by four Ministerial supporters, some of whom, like the honourable member for Kooyong, are of considerable standing. Had they voted according to their expressed opinions in this House, there would have been no doubt as to the result of the amendment in question. himself is an example of inconsistency. gave the honourable member credit for having a little more brains than the honourable member for Fremantle has, although that is not saying very much. The honourable member for Flinders has replied already to the charge of inconsistency levelled at him by the honourable member for Fremantle, and the same charge is made against me because I said, in 1907, that I was prepared to support the arrangement which the honourable member then suggested. have not varied in my view of the subject; but, even if I had, two years have elapsed since the speech in question was made, whereas not two weeks have elapsed since some of the speeches from which .1 have just quoted were delivered. Indeed, that by the honourable member for Lang was delivered almost immediately before the Committee proceeded to a division last Friday morning. keeper? upon myself the responsibility of looking after the honourable member for Echuca. The most unsatisfactory feature of the Premiers' Conference is that it was held in secret. 'We know that it is alleged that at the back of the whole proposal is the promise of the influence and assistance of the State Premiers at the next general election. The facts cannot be quoted too often, because they are pregnant with meaning. The Argus has been quoted today as having desired an agreement for a period of three years. When it did not secure that, it made this commentThe Prime Minister thinks the political factor Issues not merely nnancial, but of serious Conference. A failure on the part of the Commay be held to prove the failure of the Fusion, and may result in dividing the House Representatives once more into its three On the 2 oth August, it wroteThe agreement was drafted and drawn out ready for signature. It provides Mr Deakin with a definite something to fight for at the March elections, and it assures him and the Fusion party the support of the State Premiers. That is the only explanation of the action of the Prime Minister and his colleagues in reversing their former position, and undoubtedly it explains why the Conference took place in secret. Some honourable I certainly members have resented, and very properly resented, the threats of the State Premiers as to what they intend fo do at the next Federal election, and it may be just as well to quote the exact words used .by them. Mr Kidston, Premier of Queensland, referring to the possibility of some honourable members, whom he described as "" malcontents,"" joining with others to defeat this agreement, saidI If that were the case, they would have a.very important .fight on their hands within the next six months.

357,Mr Wise,"I should be sorry to takeHe went on to sayThere was no other honourable course for the Federal Government than to ratify that agreement or refuse that agreement. For the benefit of those who were trying to interfere with the carrying out of this agreement, he would just like to point out that it was quite possible that, if they succeeded in their present aims, and prevented that agreement from being submitted to the people for ratification, this very undesirable result might come about-that the State might elect senators who would prevent any alteration of the Braddon clause' whatsoever until a reasonable settlement was come to. If that is not the most outrageous threat for a State Premier to make in regard to members of this House, I do not know what is. It is a distinct threat that, at the next general election, the State Premiers will run candidates for the Senate, who will be pledged, not to attend to the interests of Australia or of the States,"" but to allow no alteration of the Braddon section, which every one admits cannot continue, until a reasonable settlement of the financial situation is arrived at-. It is like holding a revolver at a man's head. Then, again, Mr Wade, Premier of New South Wales, saidI t would be suicidal to accept this reduced amount, and then to subject the States to the uncertainty and unrest arising from the knowledge that in future years the whole question would be re-opened, with a strong probability that the amount repayable to the States would be further reduced. I ask the Prime Minister, who talks about the ease with which the Constitution can be amended, when this agreement becomes irksome, what he has to say to that statement? It will be seen that Mr Wade contemplates absolute permanenceIt was generally understood that the question was one to be determined by the Commonwealth electors, and that if the Federal Parliament refused to allow the question to be submitted for decision the States should continue to work to secure a permanent agreement. It would, therefore, be necessary in the forthcoming general election to endeavour to secure a pledge from all candidates that they would support a proposal to make the agreement permanent, and that they would vote for its being remitted to the electors by next Parliament. He did not see what was to be gained by any further conference of Premiers. I cannot see, how, in view of the words of the Constitution, he could say it was "" generally understood,"" because the people generally understood that their representatives in this Parliament should have sole control. We should be unworthy of our position in this House, if , under' a threat like that, we were to vote against our convictions, as the honourable member for KooMr Wise. yong, the honourable member for Wimmera, and the honourable member for Lang, according to their utterances, appear to have done. It is a source of considerable regret to me that we have heard so few honourable members on the Government side. There are some, like the honourable member for Maribyrnong, who are supposed to have been Liberals all their lives, whom I should have been very glad to hear explain their reasons for supporting the proposal. That honourable member's former colleagues in the party-the honourable member for Corio, and, particularly, the honourable member for Batman, who are younger by some years than himself-hav e had no hesitation whatever in expressing themselves, even in the face of what we know was tremendous influence brought to bear to induce them to take a different view. There are other honourable members whom I should have liked to hear; but some, who have spoken, have attempted to create discord by making it appear that members of the Opposition are all eager to defeat the proposal for the purpose of injuring the Government. But a Government cannot be injured or defeated unless the combination formed is for the purpose of displacing them; and the combination the otherevening was one that had no possibility of office, and was formed for no such possibility ? It is, therefore, nonsense to say that honourable members on this side are eager to injure the Government. I am quite satisfied that, if we allowed this measure to go through, we would do the Government infinitely more damage than by opposing it. ' In the case of the direct Opposition, it would very much hasten the day when they would be able to bring into force or, what would be better, see their opponents bring into force, their much-desired land tax. But the Opposition recognises that this measure ought not to be the sport of parties, seeing that it is all-important to the future of Australia. If this agreement be embodied in the Constitution, nothing but discord and disunion can follow. We have had pointed out, over and over again, the influences that would be brought to bear to prevent any amendment of the Constitution in the future. We should find a minority, or certain States, standing in the way of an amendment; and what would happen? The Prime Minister, 1 think, said that friction would die away in future years-that the division between State Rights and the National interest would disappear. That, however, is not the teaching of history. We know that in the United States the State Rights question did not die out, but increased in intensity until it could only be settled on the disastrous fields of the Civil War. the British Empire may stop us from civil war; but many things may happen to bring disaster nearly as great, in attempts to amend the Constitution. Honourable members should reflect what an awful responsibility is placed upon them. it. member who recognises the responsibility less than others, it is the honourable member for Indi. cognise the responsibility not to sow seeds of disunion and leave a crop of trouble to be reaped by their children. agreement be embodied in the Constitution, I shall feel sufficiently sore to wish that those responsible may live long enough to reap the whirlwind. that they will yet rise to the occasion. Are honourable members who will vote for the proposal going to 'be honest enough at the elections to advocate its adoption on the platform? will altogether drop the subject. never was a more momentous question before this Parliament; and the Prime Minister himself has said it is the gravest that ever arose. at this very early stage, we are asked to give the Federation a death blow-if not to wipe it out altogether, to place it , as the honourable member for Flinders very effectively said, on the low road of subserviency for all time. bers prepared to take that responsibility, sitting here as the representatives of the people of all Australia, and with the National interests to guard? to ask for the support of the Premiers at the next elections, and, surrendering their great powers and responsibilities, prove themselves absolutely unworthy of the trust reposed in them? not be the case; but that the measure will not be carried, and that whatever is to be done at the end of next year, this matter will be fought out on the platform, when members will be free to advocate their views without any question of party. would not be wise to allow the question to be put without saying a few words. I desire to refer very briefly to one or two remarks made by the Prime Minister and other of a permanent arrangement. speakers, notably the honourable member for North Sydney, as to the action of the Opposition in supporting the amendment. The inference that the speakers attempted to It is probable that our being part of draw is that the Opposition are supporting a proposal with which they do not agree; but, as a matter of fact, our present action is the only one we could take, holding the views we do on the question before us. We are not able to obtain what we desire; and, therefore, our duty is to get that which is as near to our policy as possible, with the assistance of other honourable members, who. have practically the same ideas, but who If there is one honourable also are unable to have their particular views adopted. It will not be inappropriate if I say that we are indebted to the I appeal to those who do rehonorable member for Mernda for the way in which he has treated this subject. If any man in this Parliament has taken great If this pains to present the National cause, as apart from the parochial cause, it is the honourable member. If in the earlier Parliaments, more serious thought had been given to his I hope, however, speeches and recommendations, we should not have been in our present trouble.

386,Mr Fisher,"I do not doubt the honmore strongly to the honourable member's mind. honourable member for Wide Bay to say last night that he preferred not to put the arrangement in the Constitution at all. on that point. I stated again and again that I did not think it advisable to embody any arrangement arrived at in the Constitution, but when in an official position I said, speaking on behalf of the Government, that we would guarantee to the States at least £5,250,000 per annum for all time, and that if there was any surplus revenue above that the States could share it on a per capita basis. Surely that is clear and distinct enough. I do not think the Commonwealth has any desire to rob the States of a share of the Customs and Excise revenue, but I have held from the first, and hold to-day that whatever money is credited to the States should be paid in interest on the debts already incurred by them. My great objection to the agreement, as was effectively pointed out this afternoon by the honourable member for Parkes, is that whereas the allocation of the revenue between the States and the Commonwealth is mandatory, the great question of the State debts is simply left to an investigatory tion, and it is dragging Commonwealth Committee. Readigg that agreement as a layman, I find not a word in it to bind the States to do anything so far as the debts are concerned. They simply say they will take that great question into consideration, and that there shall also be an investigation of the little differences between the calculations of Commonwealth and State officers regarding the transfer of the State properties. That paltry little matter is to come in with the other great question, which indicates to my mind that there was at the Conference a process of bargaining on small matters, and that great and important issues were lost sight of. £9,000,000 a mere nothing? of the whole of the transferred properties; but the difference at most is about 10 per cent. The only point raised in the document is whether certain properties shall be considered transferred properties; but it is not suggested that the difference will amount to more than £1,000,000, or £2,000,000 at most. of the cost of the transferred properties was paid out of loan money ? Is the Commonwealth to pay twice for any part of these properties? took over the transferred properties at the valuation of, say, £9,000,000, it would credit the States accordingly in connection with the transfer of the debts. twice over, if we took over the whole of the debts. will be allocated for the payment of interest on the debts, and surely the States will be credited with the value of such transferred properties as have been constructed with loan money. The Prime Minister, and other speakers on his side, have tried to make the public believe that it will have the same opportunity to amend the Constitution later as it has now. They omit to say that at the present time the Premiers of the States and the Commonwealth Government are in complete agreement-a n arrangement which, on their own admission, is of great political significance. The Premiers have stated openly, and it has been published in the press that, unless the Commonwealth Government stands by them, they will oppose it at the election. This is a political as well as a financial combinapolitics into the gutter. It is the beginning of arrangements which may be made by Governments to carry out political ideas or to maintain office. Could the naked truth be put before the people, they would be indignant, and would declare that Federation was brought into existence for other purposes. It was created to deal with, not local matters, but great national questions, and to inculcate the National spirit. I doubt if any country would be great without tlie association of the national idea with the National Parliament. If within the first ten years of the Federation, we give away our powers, the growth of the national sentiment, and the. political and industrial progress of the Commonwealth, will be retarded. In saying that, I do not speak as one who is personally in favour of unification, because I am not; and by way of making a positive statement, rather than of correcting the mis-statements of others, I say that it is not true that the Labour party favours unification.

WhatI desire is to remove the misapprehension in the minds of a large number of representatives of the States.

I did my best to persuade him to the contrary, but without avail; and a feeling of the kind is very prevalent, though I do not say it is found amongst those holding responsible positions. That view, however, has been used by a prejudiced press in order to prevent the debts being taken over. The Commonwealth credit should be better than that of the States, or the Commonwealth should cease to exist.

At the Adelaide Conventhat tion in 1897, Sir George Turner saidI simply say that if we are to give the Commonwealth power to take over the debts, let it be the power to take over all the debts at the time the transaction is carried out. Otherwise I think that if the debts of one State are taken over there will be a reduction of interest, or else they will be worth more because they belong to the Commonwealth. Mr J. Henry, Sir Edmund Barton, and the honourable member for Denison, also spoke of the advantage to be gained by a consolidation of the debts, the last-named sayingWe ought not to be six separate peoples, with six separate interests, but one people with one interest.

Mr Dobson and Sir Edmund Barton spoke to the same effect. Let me make a rather more lengthy quotation from a Conference reportThe only benefit which we can hope to gain from the Federal Government taking, over our debts, or any portion of our debts, will arise from this. There would be only one borrower on the money' market instead of seven borrowers, each competing with the others, and the one borrower would be in a more advantageous position for negotiating loans, and might obtain better terms for that reason. So far as I can see, Sir George Turner, from your proposal and from the proposal made by Sir Frederick Holder, no federalization of the States debts is possible at the present time; and we might consider whether any other action that we could take would give us the benefits which we hope would accrue from the federalization of the States debts. It was hoped that the one borrower, instead of seven, would get more advantageous terms, and that the amount of the interest bill wealth would get for their loans would probe slightly better. That was said by Mr Kidston. Mr must admit that what you call the cut-throat"" policy adopted by the different by substituting Commonwealth for State credit must be neutralized if the same policy we get this statementHad it not been that the Treasurers-seein g they are, to a certain extent, faced with almost immediate conversion saw some possibility of making better terms through the Commonwealth than their States could make independently, I do not think we should have had a Conference at all. That was said by the Honourable J. Gardner, Treasurer of Western Australia, on the 8th February, 1904.' The last Conference, however, declined to have anything to do with the transference of the State debts, desiring to continue the old system -unde r which six borrowers competed in the money market-possibl y with the Commonwealth as a seventh competitor. I cannot conceive of a more humiliating position for the Federation. The National Parliament was created to deal with the transference of the State debts and other nationalquestions, but, after nine years, the best arrangement the Prime Minister can propose is for the setting aside of the transfer of the State debts and the distribution of the Commonwealth revenue in such a way that the State debts may never be transferred to the Commonwealth. The other night, the honourable member. for We could Moreton said that he is in favour of the proposal for the distribution of the revenue, and that the Government would get no help from him so far as the taking over of the State debts was concerned, because he thought that the Commonwealth had already too much power, and had misused some of it. He is therefore content to allow the States to continue in the old way. Let me iriake one more quotation. Mr Kidston, speaking at the Sydney Conference, in 1906, saidI f the amount of the debt were fixed, then in fifty years or in twenty years the whole balance might be altered. In any case, it would do two things, both of which are eminently desirable. It would create an Australian stock, and make the Federal debt an investment which would, at any rate, bring better prices to the seller. A little later, he saidI venture to say that, taking a broad view of financial affairs, and looking more than ten years ahead, this proposal shows, not only a broad Australian spirit, but would establish the ing for guidance. financial stability of the States, and end the whole of the trouble that now exists. I have another statement by the present Treasurer, but I need not read it to honourable members. vernment has not faced this question as it should have done The action of Ministers in putting on one side the transfer of the State debts at the dictation of the Premiers is not statesmanlike nor advantageous to the people. sult of the division may be, I shall take every opportunity to inform the people that it would be to their disadvantage to em-' body the agreement in the Constitution. I shall not hesitate to do that, even though the view I take may be unpopular. I shall do so because I think that the arrangement, i if inserted in the Constitution, will be mischievous. temporary advantage, but it will be establishing a precedent which, I hope, no future Government will follow. matter before I conclude. Ministers have denied that pressure has been put on. their followers regarding this matter. I take no exception to honourable members voting as they choose, but my candid opinion is that, but for the influence of the Government, and the promise to the Premiers, not twenty members would vote for the proposal. orable members opposite would vote against it? this side are at liberty to vote as they please on this auestion. a meeting, then? The Prime Minister said, by way of excuse, that there had been a meeting of his party, but that he had not taken a vote on this question. Ministerial party meetings are held. is admitted that there are such meetings. If votes are not taken at them, I do not know how the wishes of the party are deteimined. In any case, I do not see what advantage he gained by the statement. Judging by what the honourable member for Balaclava said when he was discussing the election of a Speaker, a party vote was taken by which he felt himself bound. Whether members opposite are bound on the question before us is not now in issue. What has happened is that the Government, which claims to have the national interests at heart, has surrendered them to the States at a time when the people are lookI quoted the late Sir Henry Parkes on a previous occasion as saying that, although he represented the State which had more to lose than any To my mind, the Goother, he was prepared to give up everything, trusting the people to decide according to their intelligence and lights. It would be well for Australia had we now a Prime Minister who would take up such a statesmanlike attitude. If we cannot Whatever the retrust the people to do the right thing at every election, it is a serious reflection on them. To put the agreement into the Constitution is to declare that this generation is wiser than those which will follow it. I again express regret that the consolidation of the State debts is not made mandatory, and the distribution of the revenue left for further investigation. The Prime MinThe Government may gain a ister said that if the Conference had had more time, it could have settled everything. He can have more time. He can Just one other appeal to the electors on the subject. We are quite ready to do so. The position would remain as it is now. It would not be affected by anything done in this Parliament. Surely the Prime Minister does not desire us to believe that the States would mistrust him? The States would be perfectly secure if he and his party went to the election under those conditions, and if the Government are so confident of their position, why do they not take the chance to settle the matter in that way? Why is the Prime Minister so anxious to put the arrangement in the Constitution without any mandate from the people? He is doing this without a mandate, and at a time when there is no opportunity to advise and enlighten the people as to what the proposal really means. He is doing it at the close of a Parliament, when what is practically the biggest question that has It is nothing to me how yet been discussed here has received very It scant attention. All of us are very poorly informed about it, and it would have been well for this Parliament if , in its earlier days, it had devoted more time to the financial question, so that honourable members and the public would have been better informed regarding all its phases, and better able to give an intelligent vote on it. [8.32] -The address delivered by the Leader of the Opposition was full of information, and took a broad view of the financial question. I refer more particularly to the large question of taking over",67,Thomson Th E Sented To Anything Without Consultation

456,Mr Henry Willis (Robertson),"the State debts, and the honourable member's statement that he would not restrict the borrowing of the States. I wish to make a point of that, because that matter will have to be considered at some future time, and the fact that the Labour party are not in favour of restricting the borrowing of the States must, I think, make them strong when the question has to be decided as between the States and the Commonwealth. This debate has been full of interest, and the amount of special pleading resorted to must have aroused a great deal of admiration on the part of honourable members. f thought the Prime Minister acquitted himself excellently, as he always does. The honourable member for .Herbert stated that in this debate the point had been overlooked that, when the Constitution was before the Convention, equal representation in the Senate for every State was insisted upon. As it would be most difficult to take out of the Constitution anything which the States did not want taken out, the States knew that they were secure once they got that provision in, because before it could be taken out they themselves would have to vote in favour of that course. During the dinner hour I looked up the figures to ascertain what the proportion would be, and I found that 20.14 P er c e n t . of the population could prevent 79.86 per cent, of the population from taking out of the Constitution anything that had once been put into it. Thus, less than twenty-one persons out of every 100 could prevent the other seventy-nine persons from giving effect to their wishes. Of course, it was that provision that caused the small States to come into the Federation. They are very strong in the Senate, and will always be so, because we cannot take that representation from them without their consent. Therefore, I say we should not put into the Constitution anything that we may afterwards wish to take out. If we do put anything into the Constitution, and desire at some future time to take it out, although we have 79 per cent, of the people on our side, the other 21 per cent, can prevent us. The Prime Minister says that we would only wish to take the proposed provision out at a time of financial stress. Of course, nothing would be more easy at such a time, because,, as soon as there is financial stress, as soon as we are attacked by the enemy, we are one people, solid and inseparable. we could do anything in that regard. point ? the point at all. The point is that when the enemy attacks us, and there is a time of financial stress"", our prosperity leaves us, and poverty and privation overtake us„ Then, of course, we speak with one voice and act as one man. Under this agreement, the State of New South Wales is called upon to pay 4s. 7d. per head of population more than she ought to. The State of Western Australia is losing ios. per head of population. Still, Western Australia was amply represented at the Conference, and, as a result, obtained a special concession in the shape of a cash payment of £3,250,000. The State of New South Wales, on the other hand, lost about £500,000 a year through not being adequately and faithfully represented. Mr Wade said that "" he got the worse of the bargain at the hands of the Commonwealth,"" but accepted the situation. I doubt that statementMr Wade was outmanoeuvred by the other State Premiers -for I decline to believe that the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth would penalize any one State. He dare not suggest it, for has he not at his elbow the Minister of Defence, who is the exLeader of the Opposition and the second part of the Fusion, to represent the interests of New South Wales? I take it that this agreement was not the agreement of the Commonwealth, but the agreement of the States. Indeed, sufficient evidence is forthcoming to show that the Prime Minister said, "" We require a certain sum of money, and that sum we must have."" I thoroughly agree with that. He also said, "" You shall divide the balance amongst yourselves."" Then the representatives of the States began to wrestle, and when five men got at the throat of Mr Wade, he cried for mercy, panic had arrested him. They said to him, "" You shall be allowed to go back to your State with an agreement, which you alone over-estimate the value of, properly signed, provided that you give to Western Australia £3,250,000 in hard cash."" Queensland got what she wa>, -entitled to, all but 9d. per head of population, so that no clamour can be expected from that quarter at present. Mr Wade, however, when he returned to Sydney, said that he was badly treated. Then, of course, If that is so, there should be a re-opening of the door of the room, where that meeting was held, and the",69,Thomson Th E Sented To Anything Without Consultation

458,Mr Henry Willis,"No, it is not-public should 'MIOW what was said, so that they could judge whether Mr Wade was fairly or unfairly treated. If he was fairly treated, let us have it upon record. I have read the report of the Conference, and, while there is a 'summary of other questions that were discussed, there is not a single word as to the means by which the Conference arrived at the 25s. per head of population arrangement. Throughout the discussion, we can understand from a remark dropped, Hansard was told not to .jeport certain matters. It appears, therefore, that, the Conference conspired against giving the public any information as to the means by which they arrived at their decision. I say, again, that we ought to put into the Constitution nothing that we may wish to take out of it. We can"" arrive at a temporary understanding until the great question of consolidating the public debt is dealt with. When that time arrives, the whole question can be re-opened, and no harm will have been done in the meantime. That would be ih accordance with the fourth plank of our charter-the Fusion agreement. In June last, the honourable member for Ballarat was interviewed, and gave the press official information, which was published under the headings of "" The Basis of Fusion,"" "" Official Agreement."" The report read in this wayThe leader of the Opposition ( Mr Deakin) to-day made public the policy which was agreed to by all parties sitting behind him. The basis of 30s. per annum to the States. If such of Fusion is as follows4. Pending the preparation of a complete scheme adjusting the future financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, an interim arrangement to be proposed under which the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth shall be dealt with. An interim arrangement was to be entered into, so that we might at some future time have a discussion upon the broad question of taking over the State debts. I therefore fall back upon that fourth plank, and I expect the Prime Minister to fulfil the compact that he entered into with us. I also expect the honourable member for Parramatta, as representing the other side of the Fusion, to see that the arrangement is faithfully kept. the Fusion. fusion is cominginto general use as applied to this party, but I prefer the word coalition. You can have a coalition if there are differences between you. In a fusion, both sides have to give away something, but, as the Prime Minister gave nothing away, there could have been no fusion, but there could have been a coalition. There has been a good deal of discussion on the amendment now put forward by the honourable member for Mernda. The same honourable member moved an amendment last week which was regarded as a test motion. A test vote has been taken in the same way hundreds of times in Parliament as an indication of what the House wants. In this case,what the House wanted was a review of the agreement. The exact proposal of any one honourable member might not be the exact proposal of others. I disagree with the honourable member for Mernda's proposal; but the effect of carrying it will be to stipulate that the agreement shall be terminable. The question of whether it shall cease to operate when the amount returnable to the States under it reaches £7,500,000 per annum, or twenty-five years hence, is of no consequence at' this stage. The main question is whether or not it shall be terminable, and it is that fact that enables the honourable member to obtain considerable support for his amendment. The honourable member has referred to those who are acting with him, and I cannot help saying that if he had to rely only upon their arguments, the acceptance of his amendment would be unlikely. The honourable member for Parkes has declared that he would favour a per capita allowance an allowance were made, it would be impossible to carry on the affairs of the Commonwealth. member would have to find more revenue. honourable member for Parkes evidently has not carefully studied the question. His proposal would mean a return to the States of £6,500,000 per annum; and the Commonwealth, instead of receiving £2,300,000, would get only £1,400,000. In round figures, the Commonwealth' would have a shortage of £1,000,000. He has also shown his failure to study the question carefully by his statement that as the population increased, the revenue from the Customs Tariff would decrease. Mi.

I simply desired to ventilate the fact that, under this agreement, New South Wales would suffer a loss for all time of something like £500,000 per annum. portunity later on to utilize the disagreements amongst honourable members who cannot make their logic tally, and to give a vote to prevent the passing of this agreement, and so to cause it to be reviewed. As a matter of fact, I think I scored last week; instead of being disappointed I was elated. The vote that I gave led to the Chairman being called upon to give his casting vote, which I may say in passing is as powerful as is that of any honourable member. In the Senate, when the voting is equal, the question passes in the negative, but the vote of the Chairman of Committees in this House is equal to that of any other honourable member. Had you; Mr Chairman, in your wisdom, given your vote last Friday against instead of in favour of the amendment, no one could have questioned your decision. I desire this agreement to be reviewed. I do not think any State will suffer if it is. If the cure it, I should have a review of the Premiers again assemble in Conference I am satisfied that they will meet with open doors, and that the public will know their reasons for arriving at a decision. If it is decided that New South Wales must make a sacrifice, she will then do so with her eyes open. impecunious States that must be assisted, then I am sure honourable members will hurry to their assistance. But I do not think that any State is seeking relief at the door of another. own. which the honourable member is a representative, is losing ad. per head more than she ought to lose under this agreement. New South Wales is the greatest State in the world, but Queensland will be as great. Future Premiers of those States, with a better idea of the responsibilities devolving upon them as the representatives of millions of people, may say that this is an inequitable adjustment. But, although the people of those two States, representing two-thirds of the population of the Commonwealth, may ask for a modification of the agreement, their voices will be as voices in the wilderness,, if it is embodied in the Constitution, without any limitation, since it will be open to 21 per cent, of the people, if the ratio of population in the several States remains as at present, to outvote 79 per cent. It is a situation of that kind that will bring about a civil war. To avert the disI knew that I should have an optant possibility of such a catastrophe we federated, and if the Federation is now used to impose upon the people unification a civil war will be brought about in the distant future. We should put nothing in the Constitution that we may wish to take out ; and a revision of this agreement would be a good thing for the Commonwealth. I absolve this Government from any participation in the injustice done to New South Wales. ThoughI have said a good deal about the financial agreement, I have never imputed any blame to the Commonwealth Government in this connection. I worked with some of them for nine years, and found them straightforward,broad minded men; and I decline to think that they were a party to the unjust agree-, ment which took away £400,000 per annum for all time from tbe people of New South Wales, and as time runs on this sum will increase.

I desire the Premiers to be heard, and the Prime Minister to be heard, and to see the latter as firm as when he said, "" We require £2,373,100, and not a penny If it is said that there are less will be taken."" That is the voice of a strong man, such as we require to lead us. If we have a strong man,we shall see him through, but for one who vacillates, we can have nothing but disgust. I ask the Prime Minister to do his best to bring about another meeting of Premiers, and see if they cannot come to an arrangement which will be satisfactory to New South Wales and do justice to every State. like the honourable member and distinguished gentleman who has just resumed his seat, I approach this subject without any special knowledge whatsoever.

I , at first, sat at the feet of the honourable member for Mernda in a worshipful frame of m in d; but, after considerable labour, I came to the conclusion I was not capable of thoroughly understanding his proposal. Then1 sat at the feet of the honourable member for Parkes, and, though I found my resting place slightly more comfortable, I confess that, even there, I could not get the solace and comfort I was looking for. I have also sat at the feet of sundry other financial authorities in the House, including the many different feet of the honourable member fOr Robertson. I can remember that honourable member taking quite a different stand from-that he has adopted this evening. I can remember his. posing as the champion of nationalism in this Parliament, whereas to-night I have heard from him nothing but a sort of furtive bleat on behalf of moribund parochialism, from the State, the representation of which he adorns. mad. was the fact that, after listening with considerable interest, and even greater pleasure, I am now in some doubt as to what the honourable member is going to do in regard to the particular amendment before the Chair. So far as I can understand, the honourable member professes himself anxious to have his own scheme carried into effect, and he is in favour of a reopening of the question. He is in favour of a Constitutional amendment, though not the Constitutional amendment now proposed. The present alternative appears to be one form of Constitutional amendment as against another form of Constitutional amendment. On that point, the honourable member, in the exuberance of his eloquence, forgot to enlighten poor ignorant honourable members, such as the humble gentleman addressing the Committee. The first thing that interests me ""in the present situation is the altogether hopeful re-arrangement of parties; and I use the word "" par:ies "" in its broad sense, because I should be the last to crack any party whip on a subject of this kind. When this session opened, I can remember my honourable friends opposite accusing the archangel of liberalism, the present Prime Minister, of appalling .backsliding in venturing to ally himself with such 'Tory fossils as the honourable member for Parkes, the honourable member for Flinders, and a number of others. I now find that the Opposition realize the inherent merits of the honourable member f c i Flinders and the honourable member for Parkes; and I am glad, because I have long since recognised those merits myself. NowI hold that the fact that certain honourable members on the Government benches are, on this B ill , working in the same direction as members of the Opposition gives no one any justification or cause to complain of their party loyalty. We had an honourable member this afternoon talking of "" lip loyalists"" amongst the Government supporters! The term is an offensive one at any time, and not only offensive, but unjust, when applied to a number of honourable members who have the misfortune to be opposed to the Government on a non-party question which they regard as of great. importance. For instance, we have had the honourable member for Flinders attacked in the press, and in the House, in a way which reflects little credit on the attackers. What is this quesO'MALLEY -It made me tion ? It is essentially a non-party question. If honourable members can see their W h a t made me madder way to support the Government, as I am supporting them, well and good; but, if they cannot, surely this is not an occasion to have the party whip cracked at them in the press and in this House? I am glad to say that neither the Leader of the Government nor the Ministry have endeavoured to take any such action; but I find that their example has not been followed by certain members who belong to what I might call "" the pack "" for it is noticeable that certain kinds of politicians, like certain types of animals, find it safer to hunt in packs. . Those, gentlemen may feel bitterly resentf u l at an honourable member having sufficient individuality to have an opinion of his own and sufficient courage to back it . For my part, greatly as I have always admired the keen perception and breadth of view of the honourable member for Flinders, I never had greater admiration than for his courage all through this business. I say that, even whilst I disagree with h i m ; and the man who does not recognise grit and courage, in a great national crisis of this kind, is not fit for a place in this House. It is rather a pity that the f u l l sense of this Chamber cannot be taken on this question.

It is quite possible that Constitutional amendments may be proposed in the future and passed in a haphazard way. We may have an amendment, as serious as the one now proposed, carried in the Committee stage by a catch division, only the third reading requiring the statutory majority. I suggest that if we could ascertain what is the real opinion of honourable members in the Chamber, it would make our position much stronger before the country. What honourable members are asked to do, is not only to give a vote here, but to back their opinion on the public platform at the next general election ; and if we are in a position to say that the decision arrived at was, in the whole course of the Bill, by an absolute majority of this and another place, our position would be, as I say, infinitely stronger on the public platform. I suggest that the Ministry might consult with honourable members opposite, and see whether some sound-way of carrying out this idea can be arrived at. bers are against the agreement-certainl y the honourable member for South Sydney is. not desire to advise anybody to give a pair to an absentee unless we have a written assurance from the latter. assurance of the honourable member for -South Sydney. for Flinders has said that we must, on this question, range ourselves into Federalists and anti-Federalists; but I venture to dis-' ing that by what has happened in the Dast. agree with him. I think the honourable member underestimates enormously the strength of the Federal feeling throughout Australia. In portions of my own electorate, which, nine years ago, were I have already given strongly anti-Billite, the younger community are beginning to be Australians, as distinguished from New South Welshmen. That process is going on all over Australia; and, therefore, it behoves every one who wishes for a union of the Australian people to do nothing to interfere with the even flow of that Federal sentiment. If a party or a section of this Committee show themselves anxious to starve other public agencies in which they are not directly interested, it will materially interfere with that even flow; and I say that as a man who looks, forward to a unified Australian people in the future, when such a thing can be safely brought about, though certainly not now. The last thing we ought to do is to show ourselves at this juncture grasping in dealing with Australian finances. We ought not to be grasping, in view of all that has been said here-in view of all the vituperation that has been hurled on State members and State Premiers-o r say that they, who are our partners in the responsibility for the administration of the affairs of Australia, shall have no financial guarantee from year' to year, on which to properly base their Estimates. that point. there should be a constitutional amendment, I have only to say that one of the hard and fast character suggested by the honourable member would be more difficult to revoke than that proposed by the Government. otherwise two nights ago.

When speaking on the Government programme, I took the liberty of classifying honourable members on this side as those who were Ministerialists rather than Fusionists, and those who were Fusionists rather than Ministerialists.

I say that we have no right, by any legislative act, to obstruct unification. I am opposed to unification; but those who are Liberals have no right to prevent others from doing what they think proper. I have no desire to traverse ground which has already been covered. Those who oppose the agreement do so deliberately, and have given many arguments in support of their position. They realize that a strain is being put on the party allegiance. on the casting vote of the Chairman, they are bound to again do what they think necessary to prevent the ratification of an agreement which they regard as dangerous to the community. If we are defeated tonight, we must nevertheless oppose the third leading of the measure. If we are not ready to do that, we must be fooling the The party Committee, or the country, or ourselves. What is taking place now is the commencement of a large and powerful agitation. D i d I desire to take the convenient course, I should not oppose the agreement. There is to be a struggle on the platforms, and those who are against the agreement must avail themselves of every opportunity to state their reasons. now ? cause the Prime Minister said two days ago: "" If this Bill is not carried, I shall take it to the country.""'

516,Mr Wilks,"The honourable membergo. Personally, I am against putting the arrangement in the Constitution, and, in any case, I believe in a time limit. But my tribute to the honourable member for Mernda is that, for the sake of the solidarity of the party to which I belong, I am prepared to put the arrangement in the Constitution with a time limit. I am prepared to agree to put it in the Constitution ful in this battle, either in this Chamber, or for fifteen years, and no longer, that being outside, it means good-bye to the indepenthe period when it is estimated that the population will have increased sufficiently to bring the amount paid to the States to £7,500,000. I am prepared to make another concession to show my loyalty to the party. If the Prime Minister will put to the people, by a referendum, two distinct questions-first , the proposal to pay 25s. per capita, and to place the arrangement in the Constitution; and, secondly, the same proposal limited to a period of yearsI shall support him. Surely that is not the attitude of a man who is opposing the Government simply for the sake of hostility. It is known that the return of the honourable member for Brisbane has given the Government their majority on this question. That honourable member is unacquainted with the facts of the case, and has not favoured the Committee with his opinion. It rests with him to decide the matter, and I ask the honourable member for Wentworth, who is so fervent an admirer of courage and political righteousness, why he did not appeal to the honourable member for Brisbane to explain to the Committee and to the country his reasons for voting for the agreement. We have not heard a word from him-perhap s another evidence of Ministerial discipline. I belong to the Liberal party, and to me the only charm in public life is the preservation of one's own election, and obtaining a mandate from individuality. If a man has no personality and does not desire to assert his individuality, let him get nearest to the side whose general politics agree with his. On general politics, the Opposition side is nearer to me, and the only point on which I fight them is the question of the surrender of one's individuality and personality. is quite wrong. the Labour party by their works. I am not new to public life, or to the disciplinary methods practised by the political Labour forces of Australia. I may be wrong in my judgment or dull of perception, but I hold the opinion that that side has become so disciplined that this side is trying to imitate it. The present case is a very clever imitation of the discipline exercised by the Labour party. I am old-fashioned enough to believe that Liberalism cannot be associated with Cabinet direction, and Cabinet discipline. I do not blame the Prime Minister, or his Cabinet, for fighting for the agreement, but if they are successdence of any member who belongs to this party. I shall tell the 30,000 electors of my constituency that if they are going to do the behests of Gregory Wade, no matter how able he may be, they had better not exercise their franchise at all, but place it in his hands. This is the battle of Nationalism, and the fight is not for the supremacy of a Parliament, but for the supremacy of the people. The people employ two agencies-the Commonwealth and the State Governments and it would be to descend to 'the lowest depths of humbug to say that the average elector is prepared to cast a clear and intelligent vote on the question, or is fully acquainted with all the details of this intricate scheme. The very men who claim that he is, know that it is impossible for him to be so, seeing that they themselves have only arrived at the agreement after manv vears of struggle. The Prime Minister himself less than twelve months ago gave to the public in this Chamber a very different idea from that which he expresses to-day as the Leader of a Fusion Ministry. If the Government and the State Premiers are sosatisfied with their position, and want toappeal to the public, what is to prevent their submitting the question at the next: the people, as the honourable member for Robertson suggested? In that case everv one of their supporters who binds himself to the scheme on the platform, and is returned, will be in duty bound to see them through. Both as a citizen and a candidate, I shall do my best to. resist the embodying of the agreement' in the Constitution, and ami prepared to take the consequences. I ask for no favour from the Ministry or the Labour party. If I did not think the question was worth fighting for, what would be the use of bothering over it ? ' When the fight does take place, every arfcof cajolery, and every piece of instructivepress work, will be brought into play or* behalf of the agreement, and almost the whole of the powerful press of Australia",77,Willis That Is To Desired To Show That The Honorablemember

518,Mr Wilks,"I am prepared to gaugewill paint the picture to the public as attractively as they can. That being so, it is just as well to prepare for the struggle. The people of New South Wales must be told, as the honourable member for Robertson said, that those who vote for the 25s. per capita arrangement will be making a very serious attack upon that State. The people of New South Wales, if they assent to the agreement, will be mulcted to the extent of about £600,000 per annum. That is the price which they will pay for a continuance of national life. I believe they are prepared to pay it, but it is asking them too much to expect them to place the agreement in the Constitution in such a way that it cannot be reviewed when found necessary. The amendment of the honourable member for Mernda is simply the re-enactment of the Braddon section as it now stands in the Constitution, tempered by experience. The honourable member asks that ""that section, the term of which is about to expire, shall be superseded by his scheme, which will practically last for fifteen years. That is the point upon which all this terrible struggle is taking place. The honourable member and those who support him are called traitors to the Fusion Ministry, and recreant to their principles, although they simply ask that the Braddon section, with all its safety, shall be extended for fifteen years, and that, then, those who compose the Federal Parliament shall review the matter. fifteen years, surely the Parliament and the electors of that day will be in a better posithat, if immigration is encouraged, the tion to decide.

They have had experience of us for ten years, and have no reason to doubt -us. We have treated them more than liberally; we have even given them more than their three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, and yet they turn round and say that the National Parliament should not be trusted. Thev want everything in the bond. I am told that if the arrangement is put into the Constitution, it can be removed, but if that is so, why do Mr Kidston, Mr Wade, and others fight so strenuously to get it into the Constitution? Minister, who has fought his battle both hard and well. and Company had any spark of manly feeling in them, they would, knowing that honMr Wilks. orable members in this House are equally divided on the question, release the Prime Minister from his position. If they had no intention of placing a heavy manacle on the Federation, they would voluntarily accept a time limit of fifteen years; but the fact that they are holding back in the traces shows that they are fighting for their pound of flesh. They know that once they get this provision in the Constitution, they will have gained all that they desire. The Customs taxation today amounts to 50s. per capita, of which, under the agreement, 25s. is to go to the Commonwealth, and 25s. to. the States. Those who believe in lessening Customs taxation see no ray of hope there. Whether Protectionists or Free Traders, those who wish to take that form of indirect taxation as far as possible off the backs of the masses, know that to place this arrangement in the Constitution will defeat their hopes. the free list. for Melbourne Ports, as a Protectionist, realizes the position, and I , as one who does not believe in high Customs taxation, can realize it also. I believe that the less taxation you have the better, so long as you have efficiency of government. I intend to vote for the amendment, not that I am any' more enamoured of it than the With a further experience of Prime Minister is, but it brings me nearer the goal of a time limit, and it is possible 6,000,000 standard of population will be reached in ten years. The honourable member for Wentworth must have thought we were children when he told us that if the amendment is adopted the State authorities will try to restrict the growth of population, and that they will be opposed to immigration. I never heard a more absurd statement. Every immigrant is worth thousands of pounds to the _ State that secures him, and the honourable member for Wentworth must think we are very foolish if he imagines that we will accept his statement that the State Premiers, in order that this agreement shall not be disturbed forfifteen years, will discourage immigration.

In all my experience of public life, I have never known a man more quickly become a supporter of a Government than has the honourable member for Indi in this instance; and, no doubt, he is a hard fighter and a loyal friend. first lieutenant of the Fusion Ministry can disagree with his own Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister can disagree with himself in twelve months, the only proper course is to have the question threshed out at the ballot-box. This is a new question for the public; and it is fair that they should be given reasonable time to form their opinion. A strong agitation and a strong battle will eventuate; and the public ought to know why we so strongly object to this agreement being made part of the Constitution. any of the Ministry, think that this opposition is merelv for the sake of embarrassing the Government, let them say so; and we can choose our own course of action. My conclusion may be erroneous; but my idea of a Liberal party is one which allows each man to exercise his own judgment on his own responsibilitv. Of course, I cannot ask the Prime Minister to so protect me at the coming elections; and I shall have to take mv own risk. I prefer that the matter should be decided at a general election rather than by means of a referendum. If the Prime Minister will put the question so as to boldly provide for a limitation of time, I shall be satisfied, but failing that I shall vote for the amendment, not because I am impressed with the amount proposed, but because I regard it as a means wherebv a limitation may be imposed. think that the wisdom of the House is with those who are opposed to the proposal of the Government. As one who has taken some interest in the referendum I object strongly to the Prime Minister or anv one else saying that the referendum proposed is a fair one, because it is impossible to have a fair referendum under our Constitution. In no Democratic Constitution can they find such a provision as that now submitted by the Government. The only similar case is that associated with what is known as the ""Spoils Campaign"" in to be Switzerland-that is the only example as degraded and infamous as that now before us. It had to do with the disposal of the surplus Customs revenue in Switzerland : and the Switzers rose in their might and exercised the power they possessed under their Constitution. The account in the Referendum in Switzerland, by M. Simon Deploige, is as followsThe third voting, which took place in 1894, created an enormous amount of excitement in Switzerland, and was known as "" the Spoils Campaign."" In 1850 the Customs duties yielded If the between four and five million francs. In 1894 they had increased to thirty-five millions. As a result there was a considerable surplus, which has been employed in subsidizing railways, in vast works of fortifications, in grants to native manufacturers, and in erecting public buildings. Some cantons were thus subsidized at the rate of 1 franc 35 cents per head of the population, while others obtained 154 francs. The mutual jealousy of the cantons was aroused, and an initiative amendment was set on foot signed by 67,828, by which the surplus was to be distributed among the cantons at the rate of 2 francs per head. That means is. iod. and not 25s. per If the Prime Minister, or he? dThe Swiss are always very chary of expenditure. Thus the amendment .was speedily calculated to appeal to them. Pamphlets were circulated giving an account of the salaries of the public officials, and brilliant schemes were propounded as to what the cantons could do with the money. The Opposition were quite as active, for the initiative was an attack upon the whole system of Federal finance and administration. Just as this is an attack on the Federal fin ances and administrationI f an amendment could be thus incorporated into the Constitution, by which the people shou'd be paid 2 francs a head the canton to snend the money as they liked, with no supervision from the central ' Government, if",81,Crouch Th E Honourable Member Has No

562,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [10.5],"I was practically turning the Federation into a company for the distribution of dividends to the shareholders. I take it that there is an attempt to compel the Commonwealth to distribute money in the same wayAfter a period of great political agitation in which 496,601 voters out of 700,000 registered electors went to the polls, the motion was lost by 205,177 votes. An act of religious intolerance, an extremely advanced socialistic measure, and the attempted pillage of the Federal Treasury to the tune of six million francs, has been the result of the latest experiment in direct legislation. The fact that the last two were rejected is not a guarantee that such things will always be rejected, and the submitted an amendment for which I innew Federal initiative has been the cause of great anxiety in Switzerland. Once this provision is inserted in the Constitution, as we are told in the splendid articles in the Age, 90,000 electors mav frustrate the will of 900,000 electors. We have a record of forty-two referendums; and it is shown that smaller States always object to any advance or change, especially when there is a money interest attached. When the people _jire without power there is degradation, but, with power, there is good government. If we had' the initiative, there would be no fear of the State Premiers, some of whom exist on a majority of one, and can only be regarded as the puppets of the day. We are the dominant Legislature, elected on the widest franchise in the world, and it is monstrous to suggest that we should go cap in hand to the Premiers, .and humbly bow to their decision. As the honourable member for Darwin has said, if this agreement is once placed in the Constitution, it may take as bloody a war as that which occurred in America, to secure its removal. The honourable member for Dalley, in his outspoken way, has touched the acorn of the oak which it is desired to grow. He suggested that it was, perhaps, because the partu behind the Prime Minister feared the rising Democracy, that they desired to shelter behind the parochial powers of the Premiers. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to thunder that the State Parliaments are elected by the same people who elect the Commonwealth Parliament; but the statement is not correct, because in the States tliere are second Chambers which are not elected on the same franchise that is enjoyed under the Commonwealth. the voters in New South' Wales cannot elect a single member to the second chamber in that State; and yet the Prime Minister has the audacity to make the stateDr. Maloney. ment to which I have referred. Sir Charles Dilke, one of the greatest of international authorities, has stated that the Legislative Council of Victoria has twice brought the people of the State to the verge of civil war. It does not matter how brilliant an orator a man may be, there is danger when he can be induced to change his mind when surrounded by half-a-dozen of his colleagues. The Prime Minister is the key of the Government arch. If he were removed, the Cabinet would fall to pieces. The honourable member for Mernda, unmoved by efforts to shift him from his position, has tend to vote. I should have preferred a proposition to the effect that the Commonwealth should take over the debts of the States and control them. Why should we not provide that, after meeting the expenditure of the Commonwealth for each nnancial year, the balance of Customs and Excise revenue should be divided f r o ratd amongst the States? provided for in mv scheme. honourable friend's scheme has my loyal support. If the people of Australia had the power which the Switzers have of expressing their will by means of a referendum, I have no doubt as to what their decision would be. Indeed, if we had elective Ministers in this country, such a proposal as that now submitted by the Government would never have been laid before the Parliament. There were fewer heartburnings after the selection of the last Labour Government than there have beer* after the appointment of any Government of which I have had knowledge; because the members of the Fisher Administration were elected fairly and squarely. The present Government was chosen purely in accordance with the will of the Prime Minister, who, consequently, became a dictator. We have got rid of the dictatorship of the Throne, and yet we permit a dictator, in the person of the Prime Minister, to control our affairs. Do honourable members realize that if such a proposal as that made by the Government for the payment of 25s. per head to the States were made in Eng-land, it would bring the Treasury to bankruptcy ? Imagine the Chancellor of the All Exchequer having to pay 25s. per head in respect of each inhabitant of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. It would mean an expenditure of £50,000,000 per annum.

564,Dr. Maloney,"I know that, and myshall be told, no doubt, that there is unification ih Great Britain, vvhich is controlled by one Parliament. one Parliament in Australia, so that the second Chambers of the States might be swept into the limbo of oblivion. Prime Minister is bartering away his reputation as a Liberal by bringing forward such an infamous proposal as that before us; for I can apply to it no milder term. I would go to any length to prevent the B ill becoming law in its present shape. I do not take up this attitude of opposition to it because 1 am afraid of the people. But this Government would only trust the people when they were bound and manacled. I will resist to the utmost of my power this attempt to enable the dead hand of the past to grasp the throat of the National Legislature of the future. No Parliament, and no Government, has the right to inflict upon unborn generations laws that are practically irrevocable. The time for the enactment of laws similar to those of the Medes and Persians has for ever fled. bodied in the Constitution, will form the subject of continual bickering in the future. It will be a disgrace to our civilization. If the Government have any doubt upon the matter, why do they not seek to embody in our Constitution a provision similar to that which is contained in section 118 of the Swiss Constitution, which providesThe Federal Constitution may at any time be amended wholly or partially. It then goes on to say that 50,000 electors, or approximately i j per cent, of them, have a right to demand the taking of a referendum upon a proposed amendment. Yet we are told that the agreement before us will be the subject of a referendum. zens, by their votes, could compel the Government to submit a simple question to the people. The Ministry simply seek to puzzle the electors, just as they were puzzled by the referendum which was taken in Victoria some time ago upon the question of religious instruction in State schools. I have pleasure in supporting the amendment, which, I hope, will, be carried. But even if it be defeated as the result of one honourable member putting in an appearance at the psychological moment, those who vote for it will have the satisfaction of knowing that they fought for the right, and refused to bow their heads to the dust at the behest of the State Premiers. If the agreement becomes law, I venture to prophesy that no provision in our charter of government will ever cause I wish we had only such continual worry and fighting as will this infamy which the Prime Minister is seeking to engraft upon one of the freest The Constitutionsin the world. considerable time past the States have endeavoured to saddle this Parliament with the cost of assisted immigration. I understand that the honourable member for Wentworth objects to the proposal of the honourable member for Mernda, on the ground that it would have the effect of restricting immigration. Buti f we accept the agreement in the form in which it is proposed by the Government, we shall have consented, not merely to incur the expenditure that is involved in the payment of olcT-age pensions, but also to defray the whole cost of immigration. The average cost of bringing an immigrant to the States is about £ 7 , and, under this agreement, in a little more than five years the States will be recouped more than that amount for every immigrant that they receive. It is idle for This agreement, if emthe Prime Minister to say that the people who have power to embody this agreement in the Constitution also have power to take it out again. W ill not any such proposal always require to run the gantlet of the two branches of the Legislature ? The very mc.ment that the proposed agreement is incorporated in the Constitution, all the efforts of the State Premiers will be directed to capture the Senate, with a view to rendering it impossible to remove it from that charter of government. But even if a proposal to that effect were adopted by both Houses, it would still be within the power of a minority of the electors to defeat the wishes of a majority. Some time ago, when the proposal that Parliament, should adjourn I only wish that our citiover the Premiers' Conference was submitted for our consideration, I appealed to the Prime Minister not to sacrifice the interests of this Parliament at that gathering. In the face 'of that warning, it has been deliberately sold; for if the agreement be adopted, this Parliament will unquestionably become subservient to the State Parliaments.

I venture to say that if a secret ballot were taken, it would not have twenty supporters in this House. When the honourable member for Mernda stated last night that many honourable members opposite would vote as he intended to vote, if they were free to do so, he stated only what is an open secret. There are very few members who favour the continuance of the proposed agreement for more than ten years. Yet the honourable member has been twitted with having disclosed private information. Such information is not private, but public. Why was not the Braddon section of the Constitution subject to alteration only by an amendment of the Constitution? Was not the object to enable this Parliament to deal with the matter?

A man, known by the banks of America as the credit man, is specially picked out to investigate the securities which are offered for great loans. It is in this way that money is obtained to carry on the activities of a great nation or a great State. Such an investigator would report that the States had their railways and lands, the power of levying taxation, and an income from Customs and Excise duties. Prior to Federation the whole c/f the 'Customs and Excise revenue formed part of the State assets, and since then three-fourths of it has been pledged to those who have lent Australia £48,000,000. None of us object to paying the States 25s. fer cafita. So far as the amount of the payment is concerned,, a splendid bargain was made with them, but it must be remembered that there is interest to be paid, and a good sinking fund should be established to wipe out the debtsBoth Federal and State representatives are .under an obligation to provide for the extinction of the debts. It goes without saying that the States have great interests in the revenues of the Commonwealth. But while I think that they should receive a larger payment, I do not wish to embody the arrangement in the Constitution, because to do so would be derogatory to the responsibility and to the supremacy of the Commonwealth Parliament. It would be derogatory to the Parliamentary standards of this nation. The designers of the Constitution specified thirty-nine powers to be exercised by the Commonwealth, reserving all others to the States. Now it is proposed to take from those thirty-nine powers that which makes us paramount. I do not rejoice when I see the flag of Victoria, New South Wales, or even Tasmania. them; but I rejoice when I see the Commonwealth Flag. Every citizen possesses a dual capacity and responsibility. His paramount allegiance is to the Commonwealth, and his subordinate allegiance to his State.

Total interest bill £6,109,564, and annual sinking fund £870,000, or a total of £6,979,564. My proposal is that we shall start our Federal stock at once, and that the States shall be relieved at once of the £6,109,564, but that we shall only take over the debt gradually, according to actuarial calculations, and as it falls due. But in addition to the £6,109,564 I also propose to insert a provision for a division in perpetuity of surplus Commonwealth revenue, because I think that those two things snould go together.

Honourable members know that my whole scheme rests on a national postal banking system.

I am told that if we put this agreement in the Constitution there is no danger of it ever say that, but there is no doubt that it is what they mean.

It is a When the Prime Minister argues that the proposal of the Government does not take anything away from this Parliament, and seeks to make it appear that the same taxpayers are concerned all the time, I think he must be impregnated with sophistical verbosity ! When I hear that 24s. 6d. per capita is all the money with which we shall have the right to deal, and that it will be a diminishing amount, I am reminded that it is already mortgaged. ' Through the arrival of Blucher, this great National Parliament is to lose that right for all time by one vote to-night. If the State Premiers, After 1910, we have the State Legislatures, and the State politicians believe that they ought to exercise this power of control, all they have to do is to unite and concentrate their money and energy upon securing a majority iri the Senate, when they can distribute the revenue as they like.

Although that principle is recognised by every civilized Government on the face of the earth, yet the Government and the Fusionists propose that we shall bear the odium of raising it, and that the State Parliaments shall spend it. There is' a vast difference between my proposal to take over £174,500,000 of the State debts in proportion to population, to pay £6,105,000 a year by way of interest, and to create a national sinking fund to pay off that debt, and the proposal to allow the States to continue to pile up .debts year after year until about thirty years hence, posterity will be told by the money-lenders of Europe that their security is not sufficient to enable them to raise any more loans. Government will then have to do something. National Government then. cognise that. In matters of national finance, I always turn to the United States because that country has had to fight several great wars, and has had to face the identical issues which we have to face. When the American Revolution was concluded, Hamilton established a sinking fund for the liquidation of the national debt. At the close of the American rebellion, the debt amounted to many millions. Every power which is That was only forty years ago, but the debt has now been reduced to £200,000,000. and there is sufficient gold in the country to liquidate it in its entirety, and to leave a surplus of ,£127,000,000. But that course cannot be adopted, because the National currency is founded upon Government bonds. These do not produce interest at more than i j per cent., and they are quoted at £ 1 1 5 , whereas British Consols which pay £ 2 9s. per cent, are quoted at £ 8 4 . From a Dictionary of American Politics, by Everett Brown and Albert .Strauss, I extract the followingSinking fund is a fund provided for the payment of a debt or obligation, and is formed by successively setting apart smaller amounts for this purpose. Even under the confederation an attempt was made by Alexander Hamilton to establish a sinking fund for the national debt; it was unsuccessful. The first sinking fund under the Government of the United States was created by Act of August 2, 1790. The present sinking fund to retire the national debt was established by Act of February 25, 1862. The Americans recognise that a nation cannot continue to pile up debts without becoming bankrupt. As subsequently modified, it sets apart all duties on imported goods as a special fund first, for the payment of interest on the public debt, and second, for the purchase every year of one per cent, of the national debt; bonds, so redeemed are to be cancelled and deducted from the outstanding indebtedness of the Government ; but in addition to the one per cent, thus redeemed there is to be purchased annually an amount of Government bonds equal to the annual interest on bonds previously bought for the sinking fund. The sinking fund is thus, as far as interest is concerned, in the position of any other holder of the Government's obligations, receiving interest on all the bonds that have been purchased for its accoimt, only the bonds belonging to it have been cancelled, and the debt is considered reduced by that amount. The Act of April 17th, 1876, provides that fractional currency redeemed by the Treasury shall constitute a part of the sinking fund. The estimated sinking fund requirement for the The National year ending July ist, 1888, is $46,817,785. either in 1902 or 1903. think so.",90,Crouch Th E Honourable Member Has No

That is an unrighteous bargain. said that. that they are unitedly to support the whitehaired boys opposite, who are virtually only their typewriters. As I said the other night regarding the statement of the Prime Minister that we cannot know what will happen twenty years hence, the statesman is the man who understands the present, and moulds the future. He thinks to-day what the crowd will think fifty years hence. When Sir Robert Peel carried his banking Bill in 1844, he was thinking what the people think to-day, seventy years later. He was a statesman, but Ministers are not. They are bob-tailed political hunkers, and But they propose to transfer in America would be called peanut politicians. They are willing to sacrifice their If the Commoncountry to obtain place and pay. The Attorney-General, at any rate, has been misled, because if ever there was a patriot in the South Australian Parliament, he was one.

They should have applied to the representatives of the States in this Parliament, instead of getting us to adjourn for a week, so that they might do their dirty work in secret. The Prime Minister, unfortunately, on the question of Nationalism and the rights of the people of this country, has acted like a great general who, on the eve of victory, deserts his army for the camp of the enemy. He has gone from the people to the camp of the boodleiers, and the marvellous part of it to me is that at the same time the honorWade, Kidston, and able member for Flinders has left the boodleiers to fight for the people.

A number of speeches have been delivered from the other side of the Chamber. the question on which the honourable member ranges himself. Mr J. H . CATTS' -The speakers have not members of the. Opposition been speaking late in the day, the Government would have consented to an adjournment. We are asked to speak when we should be resting. Apparently the Minister in charge of the Bill wishes to make this a trial of physical endurance, and to prevent the free and calm discussion of one of the greatest measures that has ever been before Parliament. cussing it now for three weeks. Mr J. H . CATTS -The Bill has been on the business-paper for three weeks, but the Government has deferred its consideration pending the return of the honourable member for Brisbane from England. The tactics adopted to bludgeon the measure through, would be a disgrace to any Parliament, let alone a national one. Ministers have pressure that they have been able to cause those who deliberately spoke against the agreement to go back on their political convictions, and vote for it. This, I shall prove by quoting passages from speeches delivered by the honourable members for Wimmera, Kooyong, Lang, and Bass. They deliberately expressed themselves in opposition to the proposal; but when the party whip cracked, they put their consciences into their pockets, and crossed the floor ta vote for it.",94,Poynton Wil L The Honourable Member

Mr J. H .

I should certainly be in favour of such 'payment being made for the next ten years, and rather than that the agreement should be' lost to us altogether, I should vote for its continuance for twenty or thirty years. As the honourable member for Parkes pointed out, we know more now concerning the finances of Australia than we did eight years ago, and our experience will be still broader ten years hence. If we agreed to make a fer cafita payment to the States of 25s. per annum for ten years, we should be able, at the end of that term, to decide whether to, let me say that I consider it an absothat payment should be continued, or whether it should be increased or reduced.

I should certainly to pair with him, and then should have be prepared to trust the people and their representatives to do what is right at the end of the ten years' period.

CATTS -He merely plays the game of the Prime Minister when the party whip is cracked, and he is practically told that if he does not march across to the other side with the Government and swallow his convictions he will not get support at the polls. thinks he might otherwise sacrifice a few votes at the polls, he crosses the floor and sacrifices his political conscience. What is the attitude of the honourable member for Lang, who sits on the back Government benches and prates to members on this side about who should come in to hear the prayers read ? He jeers and gibes at us because some of us do not always come in to make a quorum for the Government, while some of the Government's friends go off to earn large fees in the Courts. He impudently -makes 'out that we on this side object to the prayers being read, but what does this great Puritan 'himself do? He talks all over the Commonwealth about the sacredness of a member's independence, and the necessity for the assertion of his conscience, but on 4th November, as reported on page 5351 of tHamard, he saidI do not regard the agreement as perfect, especially bearing in mind the commitments of the Commonwealth. I should like to see an arrangement come lo which, whilst insuring the solvency of the States, would be sufficiently elastic to enable us to regulate our expenditure and income in accordance with our needs, without any further amendment of the Constitution in future, or recourse to additional taxation.

It is dividing the party on the Ministerial side of the House, and although it has not divided members on this side, it is dividing our party, because there is a very serious difference of opinion in the party on the question, especially in New South Wales. Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member, who was returned to Parliament by the miners of Lithgow as a Labour member, and deserted them, knows that any disruption in the Labour movement is serious, because it is one solid, united movement. Any disintegration amongst our forces is a very grave matter indeed. Mr J. H . CATTS -But it is there. The disagreement on the other side is also only temporary. For those honourable members to claim that it is a party issue on one side and not on the other is so much humbug.

The amendment of the honourable member for Mernda is not one which I can heartily endorse. choose between the proposal of the Government and the amendment, I shall vote for the amendment, inasmuch as it secures some finality. But, at the same time, I express my absolute dissent from a proposal to tie up this Parliament to raise heavy Customs duties from the people one moment longer than is necessary. I came into this Parliament as a reformer. I came here with the idea of reforming the basis of taxation. At one time the Minister of Defence was a strong believer in direct taxation. No member of the Government has expressed such abhorrence of Customs taxation as he has done. Yet he can now contemplate with perfect equanimity the exploitation of the working classes by means of Customs revenue duties. Those by whom he is surrounded do not seek to disguise the fact that they prefer to collect revenue from Customs duties rather than from direct taxation. To my mind it is criminal to place a constitutional embargo upon the electors should they desire to raise revenue from direct taxation rather than from Customs duties. When the Tariff was under consideration I was quite prepared to vote for protective duties on the understanding that effect was also to be given to the policy of new Protection. But on every occasion I have opposed the imposition of revenue duties. Whenever such duties were under consideration the Conservatives of this House rallied to the support of the Government, with the result that the Labour party were left alone in opposition to them. Thus we cannot be charged with having supported that portion of the Tariff which presses heavily upon the working classes. Under the Constitution, it is necessary that the Commonwealth shall raise four times as much revenue from any article as it may require. It is well known, too, that if a revenue duty of £ 1 be levied upon any article, the importer not only passes the duty on by charging it on to the price of goods, but also adds a profit upon the duty. In addition, wherever a duty, say, of i d. is charged upon any article the merchant adds a penny to its price. In the debate upon preferential trade which took place at the Conference of the Chambers of Commerce of the Empire, which was recently held in SydIt ney, Sir Albert Spicer, its President, saidI f we could import with some preference, say, from Canada, Australia, and India, without its affecting the price of the whole of the rest of If I have to the wheat it would be a different thing. The Duke of Devonshire made a statement some two or three years ago in the course of a great fiscal debate. Mr 'JOSEPH COOK -I s this reference by the honourable member relevant to the proposed agreement? I submit that he is discussing the question of preferential trade. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr very wide latitude has been allowed to other honourable members, and consequently I cannot prevent the honourable member from proceeding. Mr J. H . CATTS I am not discussing the question of preference. I am arguing that the adoption of the proposed agreement will involve the imposition of heavy revenue duties, and that for every pound raised in that way for Governmental purposes, the people have to pay an added amount such as shown by Sir Albert Spicer. The Minister of Defence very cunningly interrupted my quotation at its most effective point. Sir Albert Spicer saidI f we could import with some preference, say, from Canada, Australia, and India, without its affecting the price of the whole of the rest of the wheat it would be a different thing. The Duke of Devonshire made a statement some two or three years ago in the course of a great fiscal debate, that preference such as was suggested would mean an advantage to the self-governing Dominions of one and a half millions, but would cost the British consumer £10.000,000. That is to say, the self-governing Colonies would derive an advantage of £1,500,000, but the British consumer would have to pay £10,000,000. This shows how revenue duties would operate. Sir Albert Spicer addedThat was the statement of one of the most brainy men in England-on e who put the interests of the country above all party. We had an illustration of what a duty on wheat would mean in March this year. . The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. I would ask the honourable member not to proceed further on those lines. Mr J. H . CATTS I merely wish to point out that the imposition of Customs duties for revenue purposes involves the payment by the consumer of several times the amount of those duties. Consequently it is a system of taxation which should not Tariff, but to point out to the people that be resorted to. The quotation proceedsThe price of wheat in England was 35s. iod. the imposition of heavy Customs duties on and in Berlin 48s. iod., though the import duty the necessaries of life. I think, sir, that I there is only 7s. 2d. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN to raise a tremendous amount from the workIhe honourable member will not be in order ing classes by indirect taxation should not in pursuing that line of argument. Mr J. H . CATTS -My point be said that the necessary sum could be is, and I desire to show, that while a duty obtained by levying duties upon certain of 7s. 2d. per quarter was operative upon articles not in general consumption; but we wheat, the consumers were required to pay know that if duties were put upon such 13s. per quarter more for it. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN That circumstance might be used as an rive a huge revenue from the Customs, it argument upon the Tariff, but it has would be necessary, if this agreement were scarcely any bearing upon the question adopted, to levy duties on the necessaries which is before the Chair. Mr J. H . CATTS I am proving the honourable member for Denison was asked burden of revenue duties. I have only a during this discussion where the revenue few more words to quote. Mill saysA tax on any commodity, whether laid on raise £3,000,000 by means of duties on its production, its importation, its carriage from cotton-piece goods."" place to place, or its sale, and whether the tax mean?

Dealing with the importation of wheat into by levying duties on tea and kerosene, France and the United Kingdom during which he pointed out were great untapped the period from 1883 to 1898, Lord sources of revenue. I am opposed to the Avebury, in his notable book, shows that adoption of the agreement, because it would the consumers were called upon, to pay involve the imposition of heavy revenue fully 25 per cent, in addition to the duty duties on such articles used by the working thereon. I do not desire to weary honorclasses. I regret that there is a prospect able members by quoting the tables which of it being referred to the people with the are given for that period; but they show nominal endorsement of this Parliament, that if the average price of wheat was when, as a matter of fact, it can have 9s. 1 id., the consumers had to pay 2s. 6d. nothing of the kind.

There is another agreement, enthe matter further than to say that the tered into by the Prime Minister with the Chairman was just as entitled to give his late Premier of South Australia. But this vote, without any qualification, as was any Parliament has the power to decide the other honourable member. The leading question just as it has in the matter immepoints in the agreement have been admirdiately before us; and I do not see why ably dealt with by the honourable members there should be a referendum.

Does the honourable gentleman mean to tell us that the people will be satisfied with that reason ? 1 venture to say patriotism and love of country. that the Prime Minister himself would be one of the strongest opponents of a proposal ro impose direct taxation. Land taxation, and the adoption of this agreement, are entirely separate questions. Land taxation will only come up for consideration when we find that extra revenue is needed; and when that occurs, he will be a bold member who will be prepared to say to his electors, "" We in the Commonwealth Parliament have given away our revenue, and, therefore, we now desire to superimpose a Federal land tax on the land taxes imposed by the States."" Any member of Parliament who advocated such a policy would run the risk of having some one else put into his seat. I could imagine the Minister of Defence, if he were still a member of a State Parliament, going wholesouled for this agreement; because, if it were adopted, he would have no trouble about taxation for the rest of his life. He would have the satisfaction of knowing that if the members of the Federal Parliament did not do what he wanted them to do, it would be the simplest thing in the world to persuade the electors to replace the Federal members by others. But is that taking a national view of things? I venture to say that it would not be very long, under such conditions, before this Parliament became one of the most degraded Parliaments in the British Dominions. We cannot be a National Parliament if we are to do the bidding of the State Premiers whenever they meet in Conference. It is remarkable that we cannot obtain any statement from any Minister regarding the reasons which induced every one.of them to change his views on this question. There was absolute unanimity, up to the time of the late Conference, that we were to give to the States what we could afford -to say that if 1 were to walk down a street wards saw the light. dark recess to find the light. Indeed.^ we do not know whether there was a light there at all, and no one will tell us. The ""Minister of Defence has developed into one of the worse parochialists we have in this Parliament. He does not appreciate the powers which the Constitution has intrusted to us, and is ready to assist in giving them away. done for political purposes; but everything done by the Opposition is done from pure done by the Government party is done to help the Legislative Councils of the States, which have ever been the drag upon pro-"" gress in this country. This Parliament is being rapidly put in the same position as the State Parliaments occupy to-day. The Premiers of the States are limited to what the Legislative Councils will permit them to do. They have to do the bidding of the Legislative Councils. The present Government is prepared to do the bidding of the Premiers which are subservient to the Councils. ing to the honourable member's logic, this Parliament is doing the bidding of the Legislative Councils? Minister of Defence is helping in that process, and seems to glory in his shame. I take the same stand regarding the proposal of the honourable member for Mernda, as I did at the Brisbane Conference. That Conference adopted an infinitely better scheme than any. other that has been laid before this Parliament. It was better than the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda, and if there were a chance of carrying out the Brisbane scheme, it would be moved from this side of the chamber. I object to anything relating to our financial relations with the States being placed in the Constitution. The people were satisfied, in the first instance, to limit the Braddon section to ten years. They were content that this Parliament should then review the situation, recognising that we should undoubtedly be the better judges. member think that we are? in the Minister's constituency, and were to speak to fifty electors, not two of them would know much about this question.

A question of this great importance is not likely to engage the consideration of this Parliament for many years, and when we asked for time to consider the merits of the amendment, we made a reasonable request. In my opinion, the Prime Minister has not dealt fairly with those sitting on his side who disagree with his proposal. It is well known that the honourable member for Mernda submitted his first amendment with a statement that the test vote to be taken thereon was to be accepted by the Prime Minister as indicating the wish of the Committee for a reduction of the term of the agreement. never agreed to that. my honourable friend, I shall read exactly what the Prime Minister said. In his speech, the honourable member for Mernda saidI t was The amendment that I propose represents the least offensive or objectionable way of impugning any of the Government's actions. I understand from the Government that should the omission of this word be agreed to they will accept it as an indication of the opinion of the Committee that there should be a limitation of the term of the agreement. In reply to that statement, the Prime Minister saidWe do not undertake to accept the amendment, but we undertake to accept the vote on it as indicating that intention. That is, that he was going to accept the (Kalgoorlie) [3.3 vote on the amendment. he say ?

If there were any truth in that allegation, of course, we, as a party, sliould be ashamed to take up such an attitude, but those who make it know that in no sense of the word is the referendum provided for under the Constitution a true referendum, because, not only the vote of a majority of the people as a whole, but also the vote of a majority of the States is required to carry it. Our objection ail along to this kind of referendum has been that no Constitution should be hide-bound, and that there should always be a possibility of altering it if the people think fit. Those who placed this form of referendum in the Constitution, however, did so because they knew well that under it it would be hard to get fhe true opinion of the"" people, and that, the vested interests of the States would always be considered. Although there is a possibility that the people may accept"" this nnancial agreement at the ensuing referendum, I have a strong hope, and I believe there is a good fighting chance, that they will not. 1 f the State Righters had to fight the question against the full force of those who are supposed to be animated by the Federal we had the strong power of the Prime Minister and his Government, whom the people have looked upon as Nationalists, and if , in ""addition, the newspapers which -support them were advocating a national instead of a State Righters policy dictated by the State Premiers-ther e is no doubt that the people would refuse to sanction the agreement. But the Prime Minister is accepted by the people as an authority, and although he has fallen away from grace upon this occasion the people have not had an opportunity of finding it out. The public have no time to consider the true political situation. Even in Victoria, where the attitude of the Age has given the people an opportunity of seeing the fallacy of the proposal to alter the Constitution to suit the Federal Government and the State Premiers, I have found during the last three or four weeks that not only do they not understand the question, but they have never attempted to consider it. The matter will, therefore, be left at the election' to those who take the platform on one side or the other. We who are the remnants of the National party would have no fear of the result if we had behind us the power that we might expect to have on such a question, but, as matters stand, the people can be led astray by those who have gone over to the Little Australian party. The combined forces of the State Premiers and State Righters, aided by the Federal Government and their supporters, and by the press, may be able to achieve their purpose by misleading not only a majority of the people, but a majority of the States. Some of the small States seem anxious for this agreement in the belief that they will reap some benefit; but I think I can show the representatives of Tasmania that their State will find the proposal, if carried, really a detriment. The Prime Minister told us that if, after say three Parliaments, the arrangement was found not to work so beneficially as had been anticipated, the Constitution could be again altered; but we know that by that time the same influences will not be at work that are at work now-that only the three larger States might",108,Johnson I Would Point Out That A

But I will say that if he had given the question that consideration which it deserves, he would recognise that it will be much more difficult to restore the Constitution to its present form when once this agreement has been embodied in it, than it will be to amend it now. bers have been elected upon the principle of one adult one vote, they can truthfully urge that they represent the people of Australia in the fullest sense of the word, whereas the State Parliaments do not. like to ask the Government where they intend to raise the necessary revenue for the purpose of discharging Federal seeing that every form of direct taxation has already been exploited by the States. though the Government will give us no hint in that connection, I know that this Chamber contains a great number of RevenueTariffists, and that the imposition of revenue duties will probably be resorted to.

737,Mr Mathews,"Undoubtedly , besupporting the Ministry on this question to consider seriously, in their own interests if not in the interests of Australia, the position pared to agree to place the provision in the in which they are about to place themselves and the National Parliament. I cannot forego this opportunity of entering a protest against this inhuman method of proceeding with important legislation. I have had a little acquaintance with Parliamentary procedure, and in my opinion a Government which tries to force its business through by pushing honourable members to the breaking point, undermining their physical strength and laying them out, as it were, all over the chamber, is not worthy of the respect which is due to the governing body of a civilized community. It is really necessary that the constitution' and procedure of the House should be amended. We"" are considering a proposal by the honourable member for Mernda to amend a provision of the Constitution. No one has ever put a case more deliberately and concisely than he has done. No one need be told that there was earnestness behind every word he uttered. It was apparent to every one that he was not playing a game but saying what he believed to be in the best interests of Australia, not only for to-day, but for the time to come. After the able speeches which he and other Government supporters delivered one would have thought that their appeal would have induced the Prime Minister to waver, even though he has behind him the State Premiers, urging him on in his destructive attitude towards the Constitution. I do not wish to go over any ground which has already been covered by honourable members. Unless the constitution of this Parliament is altered, party government will be the ruination of the Commonwealth. It is not now a question of whether principles are valuable or essential to the Commonwealth. But it.is a question of whether party government is to control not only the welfare of the people of to-day but the destinies of those who are not yet born. The Prime Minister is seeking to place a. tremendous burden upon ourselves and posterity. In their desire to secure a reduction of the term of the agreement with the State Premiers, the honourable members for Mernda. Parkes, and Flinders have foregone their conviction regarding the unwisdom of inserting this provision in the Conslitution. They have met the Prime Minister further than I expected that they would do, because they have agreed to do that which they do not believe to be right or proper. In order to get a safe decision on this all-important question they are preConstitution for the time which is embodied in the amendment. It did strike me as an uncharitable and unpatriotic act on the part of the Prime Minister to refuse to give an ear to a very reasonable suggestion of that character. If the party had decided to alter the basis of the Fusion agreement on this question, then those who are pleading for consideration would not have had a cause for complaint. The Government have asked those honourable members not only to forfeit their individuality and independence, but also to accept an agreement which is not the outcome of reasoning amongst their own members. It does not even express the opinion of the Prime Minister or the Government. It is mere dictation by the State Piremiers whom the honourable gentleman and his supporters are over anxious to placate. Why? Because they desire to go to the country in unison with the State Governments. In other words, the reason why the honourable gentleman will not accept the amendment is because he fears for the political scalps of his supporters. He anticipates that if they appealed to the electors after having opposed the will of the State Premiers, the party of which he is the nominal but not the actual leader would not again hold a position in this House as a party. But notwithstanding all this sinking of individuality and sacrificing of the people's rights, I venture to predict that those who support the agreement will be disappointed with the result. It is pitiable to see men like the honourable member for Maribyrnong compelled to abandon every principle which they have espoused and every policy which they have advocated. The other day the honourable member had to vote against his convictions regarding gambling, and though he has been a life-long Protectionist, and a champion of -the down-trodden and oppressed, he is now compelled to vote for a proposal which will put shackles on the toilers, and rob them of the opportunity to live. Had he half-the courage of those who have taken an independent stand, he would not have tolerated the dictation to which he has been subjected. His lot is that of many others on the Ministerial side. The honourable member for Cook has convicted them out of their own mouths. He has read speeches in which honourable members",111,Johnson I Would Point Out That A
738,Mr Webster (Gwydir) [4.6 A.m.],"have declared that the nnancial arrangement should be for a limited time, and has pointed out that those who made them had the audacity to vote against the proposals which they advocated. Let me quote another short passage from the remarks of the honourable member for Bass. It is to be found in Hansard, page 5850. said I am not disposed to vote for the agreement being fixed for all time, but I am certainly in favour of it being embodied in the Constitution in the terms of the Braddon section, its operaof the first to write to the Sydney press, as tion to be for ten years, and until Parliament otherwise provides. That proposition is not so liberal as the amendment of the honourable member for Mernda Surely the members of this Legislature ten years hence could be trusted just as we are to deal with the affairs of Australia! Those are the sentiments of a statesman, but what is the action of the man? If the Federal Parliament ten years hence seeks to deal unfairly by the States it will be for the people to change its Parliament, and to return men who will do what is best for Australia as a whole. Yet a week or two afterwards the honourable member gave a vote which showed that his words were so much deception. It is his vote which will make it possible for the agreement to be adopted. I would rather leave public life than do what he has done, and would never face an audience if I could be accused of such inconsistency. ber never change his mind? to change. have a mind like that of the Minister of Defence. I listened to thc. speech of the honourable member for Parkes with great admiration, because I enjoy a good speech and good arguments, and admire a man who has the courage of his opinions, and will not be driven. I respect men who fight bravely and fairly. It is being said that the issue now is, Are we prepared to trust the people? We on this side can trust the people, and always do so. We ate here because we trust them and they trust us. Men on this side of the House have never obtained their positions by the influences that have sometimes secured the return of men on the other side. If the Government will submit the question to a referendum to be decided by a majority of the people alone I will agree to withdraw: my opposition to this clause, but I shall never consent to a mockery in the name of a referendum. The true referendum is a valuable instrument of government, and one of the strongest supports of modern Democracy. It was because of the proHe vision that an amendment of the Constitution should require not only a majority of the people, but also a majority of the StatesthatT opposed the Constitution Bill when it was first put before the people. I was one soon as I read that infamous section, pointing out that tlie Constitution was an ironbound one, which, if adoped, would fetter the people, restrict their liberties, and deny the right of the majority to rule. I fought the Bill on the platform throughout the campaign in the first fight, and although I was away in the back-blocks crippled with an injured arm when the second fight came on, so determined was I to protest against the proposal that I addressed meeting after meeting against the Bill; while in intense pain. That was in a place where the people carried the Bill at the first referendum, but reversed that vote at the second. I am therefore not fighting something which I have not fought all along. I realized from the beginning that section 128 of the Constitution was not only not Democratic, but absolutely retrogressive. I fought it not because I had a stake in the country other than the interest which any man with a family has, but because I felt it my duty to defend the rights and liberties of the people. To show what a real referendum means, let me quote what has one been written on the subject by Nathan Cree, who was cited by Mr Isaacs during the discussion when the Constitution was first formulated. He saysDirect popular legislation, under proper modes and forms, is at once democratic nnd conservative. It accords with the tendencies and spirit of the time; it w ill , we think, prove to be a calming and a conservative institution. It will remedy some serious imperfections of our present system of law making, and some evils of our political life. Those evils are very prevalent in this discussion to-dayIt will abate the rigour of our party system, break the crushing and stifling power of our great party machines, and give freer play to the political ideas, aspirations, opinions, and feelings of tlie people. It will tend to relieve us from the dominance of partisan passions, and have an elevating and educative influence upon the voters, by inducing them to consider measures upon their merits, as schemes of",112,Johnson I Would Point Out That A

741,Mr Webster,"I should be sorry topublic policy, instead of as mere party proposals. Public spirit will thus be cultivated and intellectual exertion stimulated amongst the masses. That is the referendum that I advocateone that will tend to do away with party strife and party government as illustrated in this Parliament. But for party needs and party domination, the amendment of the Constitution now proposed would not have a chance of going through this Parliament. It is only because men are absolutely whipped into violating their own convictions in the interests of the Government that we must unfortunately look forward to a clause of this kind being carried within the next few hours. I have here a still higher authority in Lecky, who says on page 240 of his book, Democracy and LibertyI f the electorate is to judge policies, it is important question of this kind cannot be surely less likely to err if it judges them on a clear and distinct issue. In such a case it is most likely to act independently, and not at the dictation of party wire-pullers. It is to be remembered, too, that the referendum is not intended as a substitute for representative Government. All the advantages of parliamentary debate would still remain. PoUcies would not be thrown before the electorate in a crude, undigested, undeveloped state. All measures would still pass through Parliament, and the great majority would be finally decided by Parliament. It would only be' in a few cases, after a measure had been thoroughly discussed in all its bearings, after the two Houses had given their judgment, that the nation would .be called to adjudicate. The referendum would be an appeal from a party majority, probably made up of discordant groups, to the genuine opinion of the country, it would be an appeal on a question which had been thoroughly examined, and on which the nation had every means of arriving at a conclusion. It would be a clear and decisive verdict on .1 matter on which the two branches of the Legislature had differed. That, of course, refers to a true referendum, and not to a mockery and a fraud like that in our Constitution. What Lecky says is exemplified by the position here today. The Government are not anxious to have this question put to a referendum in the true sense of the word, by means of which the same power could undo the decision at a later day. under our form of referendum, though a majority will decide whether or not the agreement shall be placed in the Constitution, a minority will be able to prevent its being taken out. That is contrary to the principle of a true referendum. It is not necessary to dilate further on the sound judgment qf the able writers I have quoted. This measure has been laid before honourable members in a most' unfair and inconsiderate fashion. We are compelled to stay here all night when we might very well have been permitted to adjourn. Such a procedure will not tend to facilitate the business of the Government; it never has done so in any Parliament I have known, and cannot have any other effect than to cause honourable members to take a more antagonistic view than they otherwise would of future measures. When I regard the Government's attitude, I feel like one prepared to almost do murder; because the Bill is one of the worse that could be inflicted upon a free people. It is of no use appealing to the Geovernment, however, because the Prime Minister is only doing what he is ordered to do. He is no more a free man than are some of those who follow him; and it is pitiable that an alldecided on the independent votes of honourable members, without an obligation being cast on them by those who dominate their political future. In all Parliaments, such an undertaking as that given by the Prime Minister the other night to regard the division as a test one would be respected; and I think it was accepted in good faith by the honourable member for Mernda and others. However, the honourable member for Brisbane has returned, unfortunately for this country; and I say that without any disrespect to the man. It would have been a very small sacrifice if he had been detained, and the people saved from this legislation-greate r sacrifices have been made with less justification. The honourable member for Brisbane was taken into the Cabinet only at the last moment, and is obviously under an obligation to the Ministry. Such are the men who have to decide the destinies of this country, who are to jeopardize the welfare of our children, as well as of their own, by fettering them financially, not for a yea*or two, but for all time! A big responsibility rests on the Government; but what do they care for responsibility ? Have they ever had any respect for principle. Did not the Prime They know that Minister, not twelve months ago, enunciate opinions exactly opposite to those he holds now? The Prime Minister has supporters who have always.been his echo, and who follow him, as the faithful dog does its master, without any thought at a l l ; they feel their own Weakness, and seek all the shelter ' that he can afford them from the political winds that blow. The Prime Minister is the only membei of the Government who has spoken. Even the Postmaster-General, who is rightly regarded as a high Constitutional authority, and whose view we should like to hear, is not permitted to speak. WellI remember reading in the newspapers in p.re-Federal days, about the efforts made by the honourable gentleman to conduce to a decision of the momentous question which was then before the public. He, more probably than any other man, influenced the adoption of the method by which the question of Federation was settled. He insisted that Federation should be based upon the people's will, and that every man should have a vote. He was a. consistent Democrat at that time. But now he is a member of the party which says that the manhood of Australia shall not be permitted to decide this question. He would render it possible for a minority to overrule of business to bring forward in the meana majority of the electors of this country. vention, I voted for the Braddon section beof this Chamber, why not grant an adjourning made permanent. the honourable gentleman should confess to that blemish on his own keenness of perception. was approved by the people in that form. all the States. What is more, I point out to the honourable gentleman that if the Braddon section in its original form had been adopted, we could not have paid old-age pensions. years, the Commonwealth one-fourth nf Customs and Excise revenue would have been insufficient for our needs, and the Braddon section would have broken down. gard to a proposed alteration of the Constitution could have been .taken man's idea of Democratic government has become very dim. I am astonished that a man of his intelligence; who has written a treatise on the Constitution which is creditable to him and a guide, to us-that a man who has held such a prominent position as a Federalist-shoul d believe that the provision made in our Constitution for the holding of a referendum is of a -Democratic character when it means that 80,000 people can override 900,000. A man who calls that a Democratic provision is not to be trusted by the people. If he fell into so serious an error while he was young and his mind was still versatile, it is not wonderful that as a member of the present Government he should hold that the .people can secure an alteration of the Constitution by means of the provision contained within the four corners of that document. T. venture to say that had the Postmaster-General been a private member sitting in one of the corner seats we should have had from him a display of keen argument and oratorical effort in opposition to the proposal of the Government. But he dare not speak on this important question. We are now making history, but, unfortunately, we are making history that will not be creditable to us. We can only enter our protest against what is being done. But I may make this appeal to the Government. They might agree to adjourn this matter for three weeks. They have plenty time. If they are anxious to secure an expression of opinion from all the members ment until a member of this Parliament who is at present absent from the country can be in attendance? The honourable member to whom I refer is one whom all. of us profess to respect. He is rightly regarded as a high authority. He is about to return to Australia, and will be in his place here in three weeks time. session before three weeks are over. Before the expiration of ten understood that we are not to be asked to do much more than bullock this measure through. A Government which would deprive a member of this Parliament of an opportunity of exercising his vote on so important a question make it plain that they are not anxious to secure a full expression of the opinion of honourable members. They brought forward other Bills pending the return of Colonel Foxton, and under the circumstances I think it is orily fair that they should consent to a short adjournment of this discussion to permit of the return of the honourable member for South Sydney, who ""is expected here within The next three weeks. Who would ever have imagined that the Commonwealth Government would be under the wing of Gregory Wade? A few years ago the idea would have been regarded as a preposterous one. To-day the position is a scandal. The Government are so indifferent to the rights of the Commonwealth as to permit themselves to be dictated to by Gregory Wade.

775,Mr Webster,"It is the duty of the-As the Prime Mimster is now present, may I point out to him that this is a matter of so much importance that the usual time and opportunity ought to be granted for discussing it in a rational way f I do not think that reasonable facilities have been afforded to Parliament to consider it. According to the Prime Minister's own statement, it is a matter of the greatest consequence to the Commonwealth. It is all important, not only to members of this Parliament, but perhaps also to generations yet unborn; but we are asked to rush it through without legitimate and reasonable criticism. It is all very well for honourable members opposite to smile, but they have got into a state of mind in which they do not desire discussion, or regard it as unnecessary. They do not wish light to be thrown on so important a matter, and think it a waste of time to do so, because they have some other object in view. The principle of Parliamentary representation, however, is deliberation upon all important matters, and I cannot do more than appeal to the Prime Minister to report progress until a later hour in the day, when the question may be more fully discussed, and honourable members will be more capable of doing justice to it. I had not an opportunity to address myself to the Prime Minister earlier in the evening on this matter. I remind him of his statement during the previous sitting, that he hoped that the matter would be brought to a conclusion at this sitting. Without a further word of explanation or intimation to this side, he determined to go on with it to the end, when he knew that the debate had not nearly been concluded. In the circumstances, does he intend to proceed ? ister) [5.28 a.m.] -The question whether proposed this stage of the measure has been sufficiently time as the Commonwealth shall have taken over debated is itself open to considerable deand relieved the various States of their existing bate ; but I think, with very little difference national debts to the following extent, namely : Of opinion.

We have had that debate; and I venture to submit, looking at results, that so far as this Chamber is concerned, its mind is made up on the particular issue before us. it is I debate, if it were thought worthwhile. I think that it will appear to honourable members, on reflection, that we have now disposed of this part of the measure. ference three weeks hence. ought to be closing the session. question ? position of the Leader of the Opposition is not one to be brushed aside lightly. His position and the seriousness of the question justify him in making it ; but on the other hand, he should consider the state of public business, the time of the session, and the fact that our differences have been, almost from the first, narrowed down to one; particular point, which we have now decided. If mv honourable friends weigh those circumstances against the considerations which they, have just urged, surely they will admit that the one counterbalances the other. In no spirit of unreasonable resistance, but as a deliberate judgment of my own, I submit that we have reached a stage both in the Bill and in the session, at which the least we can now do is to complete the work of this sitting by passing the rest of the Bill through Committee.

The amendment involves a national banking system, because one would be useless without the other. Amendment negatived. move That the following new section be inserted after proposed new section 94B :"" Whenever one per cent, of the electors of Australia, by initiative, petition that the financial question shall be placed before the electors being presented to the Prime Minister of the day, it shall be mandatory on the Government to place such question before the electors, and if such question be affirmed by a majority of the electors and a majority of the States, it shall be mandatory on the Government of the day to bring in a B i ll to carry out such affirmation."" This amendment means the initiative, which is necessary to make the referendum complete. The percentage of electors is different in Switzerland ; but I thought it wise to fix it here at 1 per cent., representing about 40,000 electors. There must be an officer to accept such a petition, and I propose to make him the Prime Minister of the day; and when the petition has must take steps to enable a clear referendum to be taken. With the splendid facilities presented by our Postal Department, we could, without any extra expense whatever, have the referendum votes collected, because there is not the absolute need for secrecy that there is in voting for a Parliamentary representative. Names of al! the electors appear, of course, on the rolls, and each could be easily supplied with a voting paper, and thus enabled to express his or her opinion. The amendment, so far as the nnancial question is concerned, would give the electors here the right that is enjoyed in Switzerland, namely, the right of the initiative. I should have preferred to make the amendment apply to the financial or any other question, but that, of course, would not be in order in this Bill. If this Chamber is Democratic, and honourable members possess the national instinct to promote the welfare of the country, it would be well, in the dying days of the last session of the third Parliament, to give this right to the Australian people. regard to the divisions that have been taken on this Bill, I am sure the Prime Minister, in his long political career, has never gone through a similar experience. He has never had to withstand such leading articles as have appeared in that splendidly equipped journal, the Age, which, while admitting his own innate ability, may be said to have enabled him to reach the position he occupies to-day. The leading article, even so late as to-day, must have caused the honourable gentleman to cast a glance back to past years, and to reflect how this newspaper-, in season and oiit of season, used to support him. There is no doubt that, if the Age had decided in favour of the referendum, when the Commonwealth was established, the Constitution of Australia, on such petition would have been different to-day. As I gather that this is almost the last important measure that we shall deal with during the present session, I ask the Prime Minister whether he is not prepared to trust the people in the matter ? If not, it is all balderdash and nonsense to say that the Government are prepared to trust the people at all. My amendment affords a means of allowing the people to register their will more effectively than they can do in any other way. If the Prime Minister would give to the people of this country an opportunity of expressing their views by means of the referendum, he would add a glory to his name, which I should like to see him been lodged, the Government achieve, and it would be said of him in days to come that he really trusted his fellow Australians. Amendment negatived. --There are one or two amendments which I should like to submit, dealing with points which have really not been considered in connection with the amendments upon which we have already voted. But it is quite evident that the Prime Minister desires to stifle discussion as far as possible. No question of such momentous importance has arisen before. The issue does not merely affect the present Parliament, but all succeeding Parliaments. I have never known such an important question to be treated in such a way by a Government majority which is gloriously uncertain, but which, because of its uncertainty, is. anxious to close debate. Quite a number of amendments might have been submitted, with the object of improving the proposals of the Government. If the matter under discussion were an ordinary one, we Having might look forward to having our fight over again after the next election. But it",118,Paiks
786,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [5,39]-I,119,Paiks
787,Mr Fisher (Wide Bay) [5.46 A.m.].,"is not an ordinary question. This is the first really important .proposal to amend the Constitution that has come before the Federal Parliament. In my opinion, it has been treated in a manner quite out of keeping with the importance of it. I say, deliberately, that, in my opinion, discussion through any unfortunate circumstance at has been stifled by the manner in which business has been conducted. Other important matters are discussed for days at ordinary sittings, and no complaint is made. this matter for weeks. The honourable member, apparently,, thinks that because the Bill has stood upon the notice-paper for weeks, we have had weeks of discussion. had on the motion for the second reading. no discussion on the motion for the second reading. second-reading speeches on the motion for leave to introduce the Bill. interjections show that those who have made up their minds on tliis question have no clear recollection of what occurred. has corrected himself, and now. says that we' had a debate on the motion for leave to introduce the Bill. of Commons many important measures are discussed at length on the motion for leave to introduce. They are also discussed at the subsequent stages; and that in a Parliament which has a great deal more to do than we have. The point which I wish to make clear is that quite a number of amendments have been prepared; but I do not think that they can be submitted under present circumstances. ' To propose them might seem to be an effective way of preventing the Bill from becoming law. I do not wish to have any misapprehension. and hope, that it may be possible to prevent the Bill from passing in this Parliament, so that the question may be submitted to the country as a political issue, enabling the that it would inflict an absolute injustice supporters of the Government to go before the electors and secure a mandate from them. At present the Government and their supporters have no mandate. There is not a single honourable member on the Government side who can claim that he has a mandate from the people to take proceedings for an alteration of the Constitution in the way proposed. Consequently, the Government have not the authority of the electors behind them. All that we ask is that they shall go before the electors, and then, if they can secure a majority, they will be entitled to rush through Parliament a Bill of this kind in their own way. At present, they have not such a mandate. If the next election the Government should secure a majority, it will be able-if its members do not alter their opinion againto claim in the next Parliament that effect should be given to the principle of this measure. What injury can be done to the States by. allowing the question to go to the people free from the embarrassments attaching to a constitutional referendum? It is not a light question. I feel that it is useless to appeal to honourable members who have made up their minds. They have acted as they have done, not because they had a mandate from the people, but because they have come to the conclusion that they can secure some advantage for themselves and their party. This procedure, however,-1 regard as a travesty on representative government. If a Government can come into office, and, by means of combinations formed outside, secure the passage of a Bill of this kind, then good-bye to the. representative system He of government.

Does he think that this is a personal matter? How can it affect me or the party to which I belong? The issue is not a social one, nor is it a political I think, issue in the ordinary sense of the term. Why should I whine about it? Why should any honourable member be interested in a proposal of this kind if he did not think upon the Commonwealth? It is quite true that if the people understood the question as we do, it would be determined very speedily. But it is not to be placed before them in a proper way, and when once the agreement has been embodied in the Constitution it may not be possible for a succeeding Parliament to undo the mischief.

The State bondholders in consenting to convert would require'the payment of the interest now given by the States, and, on maturity, the return of the f u l l value of the bonds. could induce a bond-holder to consent to a reduction in interest on a security that was good?

No one will suryear. a couple of millions is not very much. The main point, however, is that this clause does not relieve the States of one penny of responsibility for any debts taken over. We give the States nothing by it. We merely tell them that when we take over the debts we will pay their interest for them, but will charge it to them.

It is true that 25s. per capita can be credited by the Commonwealth at any time to the payment of interest towards the indebtedness of the States, but whenever the Commonwealth has taken over sufficient debts for the interest on them to absorb the sum which the Commonwealth allots to the States as a right, if then the Commonwealth by its improved credit can pay off that indebtedness, the States, and not the Commonwealth, will under this proposal of the Government get the benefit, and the Commonwealth become nothing more nor less than a glorified agency of the States. If it makes a profit, the States take it. If it makes a loss, the States have to bear it. That is not satisfactory. Yet that is not only proposed by the Government, but supported by the godfather of. this proposition. orable member think we can discuss that question on the Bill dealing with the State debts? important issue affecting the standing of the Commonwealth and the position of the States, we are told that we ought to deal with the question on some other measure. we have are in the Constitution. think it is a pleasure to me to be continually extent, and it comes to be recognised as an inviting the attention, of honourable members to matters of this kind. The proposal of the Government and the Premiers of the States is to take away from the Federal Parliament that initiative and independence which is its undoubted right, and which the framers of the Constitution intended it to have. That power is to be delegated to the States, and all that the Commonwealth is asked to do is to act as a glorified agency of fact which, must not be forgotten, because the States. It is obvious that it can mean nothing else, although the Prime Minister shakes his head. If the Commonwealth makes a profit by means of its credit, it ought to be entitled to put that profit into now. a fund of its own, manage the debts, and wipe them off if it can Mr W. H .

IRVINE (Flinders) [6.34 a.m.] -The amendment of the Constitution proposed in this section is undoubtedly, as the Prime Minister pointed out, merely consequential on what we have passed. But the consequences it involves are a good deal more important than the Prime Minister or the right honourable member for East Sydney have recognised. It is quite true that the effect of the clause is to take out one portion of section 105, and substitute for it another portion that has exactly the same meaning, only that it uses different language applicable to the new conditions. But I do not think the arguments of the Leader of the Opposition can be lightly dealt with, so far as this ""is a clause in a Bill containing the provision for the allocation of 25s. per head to the States, which we have just passed. It is undoubtedly true, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, that the clause, taken in conjunction with the one giving a permanent and increasing endowment of 25s. per head to the States, has this effect: ' When we take over the debts of the States, and when, we [propose to convfert those debts and create a Commonwealth stock, I quite agree, as the honourable member for East Sydney has said, that we shall not immediately derive any great benefit from' the lessening of the. interest. But when we establish a Commonwealth stock of any considerable important stock on the London money market-whe n it ultimately attains, as it ought to attain, the same position as the Canadian stock-w e ought to gain considerable advantage in the course of years.

889,Mr Kingo ' Malley,"He is a""constituare required in addition to a knowledge of the points which have been raised. instance, there is a knowledge of the history of the question. One proposal submitted at the Convention was that the State debts should be taken over by the Commonwealth, but at the instance of the honourable member for East Sydney that proposition was altered and made optional. But there was a guiding principle laid down, namely that the Commonwealth should take over the State debts wthout any indemnity from the States. Mr W. H . IRVINE -But that proposal was not carried. But it was part of an attempt which was made in advance to settle the financial question. There was a desire on the part of the delegates to the Federal Convention, that the States should receive a certain proportion of the Customs and Excise revenue. One means of insuring, that was that the Commonwealth should take over the whole liability for the State debts. was not adopted by the Convention. _ All that was done was to adopt a provision enabling the Commonwealth to take over the debts. There was no connection between the Braddon clause and the optional provision for taking over the debts, subject to an indemnity. If I wanted to strengthen that position more, I could show that it was pressed upon the Convention that it ought to provide for the Commonwealth assuming the liability without any indemnity, as a means of thus assuring a proportional charge on revenue to the States, and two analogies were pointed out, namely, the cases of America and Canada where that course was taken. It is a curious fact that in Canada, not only did they take over the whole of the debts without any recourse to the Provinces, but actually fixed the payments to the Provinces, showing that they did not regard their right to get a fair proportion of the revenue as having any connection with the debts whether there was any indemnity or not. When the first referendum was taken in New South Wales the people by a. majority accepted tbe Constitution with the so-called Braddon"" blot"" and the provision with reference to the debts. But it was not accepted by the required majority. There we had a popular acceptance of a fixed payment of three-fourths of the Customs and Ex[203]2 rise revenue for ever coupled with the very_ provis on which is now objected to by : For the honourable member for Flinders. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That Bill was not carried. the States except New South Wales. Here is a point to show how little the honourable member knows of what was in the mind of the Convention. When the Braddon clause was being altered to limit its operation to a period of ten years, was a single word said about a connection between the two provisions? ber for Flinders oay a single word then about the alleged connection? No; he has found a mare's nest. So far from there being any connection in policy between this clause and other parts of the Bill, I do not believe that a single member of the Cabinet except myself saw the provision until it was printed I was responsible for the drafting, and I put in this provision simply as a necessary draftBut it ing clause. The only alteration which has been made has been to put in the word ""charges,"" -because it is doubtful whether otherwise we could debit the States with the charges for conversion. Under the Bill the surplus revenue will be abolished, and therefore we had to change the terminology. Another section of the Constitution is proposed to be repealed, but this allusion is very pertinent to the observations of fhe honourable member for Flinders. It does not seem as if he quite realizes the force of the Bill. It seeks to repeal section 94, under which, although the Braddon provision may be abolished at the end of the year, we are under an obligation to pay the surplus revenue to the States. In future there will be no surplus payable to the States, so that we shall be absolutely independent in every sense of the term. For the last six or seven years we have been paying to the States a. surplus that we could not spend, and it may be that for some time to come, owing to our increasing Customs revenue, there will be a very large surplus which, were this section not repealed, would have to be handed to the States. Let me point out here, that for the last three or four years the stock of New South Wales of the same term, and carrying the same rate of interest, has stood better in the market than has been that of Canada.

In the Convention I pointed out that it was folly to expect, perhaps for generations to come, a large saving on the issue of Commonwealth stock, because it will be found that even then-in 1898-Ne w South Wales stock was quite as good as the so called better-priced Canadian stock. My honourable friends on the other side, as well as some honourable members on my side, have talked much about the difficulty of altering the Constitution under a double referendum. In the first place, we have been very properly' told that it is the one taxpayer who in any event will be asked to re-apportion the revenue. impugning the intelligence of the electors of the small States to say that they would be utterly incapable of suffering anxiety for an amendment, when under this adjustment it may or may not be found that the States are getting much money which they do not require, and the Commonwealth too little. From the Swiss Constitution was taken the very provision which gives us a double referendum. Between 1874 and 1903 eleven amendments were carried under the double referendum, several of them involving large surrenders of revenue. They were not directly financial provisions, but they involved large sacrifices of revenue in connection with transfers from the Cantons. fundamental amendments have been carried under the Swiss double referendum involving an enormous sacrifice of power. That does not bear out the assertion that the States will never give up anything. We have heard a great deal about the States, but what are they? Are they not the people? In connection with amendments of the Constitution, we shall be dealing only with this Legislature and with the people. Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [7.17 .i.m.] -The Attorney-General has said that I have changed my legal opinion upon this point in connection with my policy, which is rather a serious allegation. Afr. W. H . IRVINE -The facts are these: I wrote a paper which was put before the Hobart Conference, in which I submitted the view, which I subsequently expressed, that there are twp Wal interpretations which can be put upon the words ""take over""; that they may refer to a taking over by the Commonwealth as agent for the States, which would leave the Sta'.es the legal debtors, or that a novation may be contemplated, the Commonwealth becoming the debtor in place of the States. I expressed myself, though with some doubt, as rather in favour of the latter interpretation. That has nothing to do with the position'which I am taking now. Whether the legal relation of debtor and creditor is left unchanged so far as the States and those from whom they have borrowed are concerned, or whether the Commonwealth becomes the debtor, the financial results of any conversion will be the same. I merely wish, to remove an impression which, being created by what has been said by the Attorney-General, might be injurious to It is rather me. Air.

This clause offers the only opportunity tn discuss it in connection with the continuous payment of a fixed sum to the States. [7.28 a.m.] I should like to remove what seems to be a misconception in the matter. It the Commonwealth paid out of its Treasury any portion of the sinking fund, or the principal, or the interest, there would be a great deal in the contention of the honourable member for Boothby, but it would not do so. The debt can be paid off only in two ways --by a sinking fund whicb gradually liquidates it, or by paying the principal when it becomes due. If it is done by a sinking fund, the annual contribution to that fund JOHN FORREST -The honourable comes, not from the Commonwealth funds, but from the funds of the States, He should study the and there can be no sinking fund unless a special agreement is arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States. The Constitution provides that if the Commonwealth does become responsible for the interest, the States are to be charged It wishes to run the amount, which it pays, so that, as the Leader of the Opposition said, the Commonwealth becomes a. kind of agent for the States in die matter. T corroborate the Attorney-General's remarks. All through the Convention the idea was that the States were to get thc benefit of any transaction about the debts. There was no idea of the Commonwealth reaping the benefit. States' money was used. matter In a practical way.

As I say, the Commonwealtb could not derive any pecuniary advantage, unless it added .another and such a project would be preposterous, placing the Commonwealth in a most ridiculous light. There would be endless disputations as to whether the State was really paying a lower rate of interest than it could have obtained for itself; and one of my reasons for supporting the payment of 25s. per head is that the Commonwealth and the State finances can be managed each on a. different basis. a.m.] I remember when Sir Frederick Holder, at the Melbourne Convention, fought a battle all day in an endeavour to persuade the members of that Convention not to provide in the Constitution that the Commonwealth "" shall "" take over the debts, and how the honourable member for East Sydney, after the word had been inserted at the instigation of Sir George Turner, managed, by his wonderful eloquence, persuasive power, and domination over the assembly, to have the word removed. In the course of the speech which the right honourable member then made-and I may say that it had a wonderful effect on mehe said that, as the debts fell due, the Commonwealth would issue Commonwealth bonds or debentures, and, going to the creditors of the States, say, "" Here is a better security; what are you prepared to do?"" sion in the Constitution that the Commonwealth may take over the debts, if we do not go into the markets of the world and bargain to buy those debts as cheaply as possible for the benefit of the Australian' taxpayer? The Leader of the Opposition says that we shall make a great saving of at least £ per cent., but I think that there will be no such saving for many years to come, unless the Commonwealth and the States unitedly operate a banking institution. The six States will have to go into the market in competition with each other, and do the best they can in the redemption, the renewal, and conversion of their loans; and I venture to say that New South Wales and Victoria, with this provision for the payment of 25s. per head, would .be able to borrow money more cheaply in the London market than the Commonwealth could. I make that prediction, which I desire honourable members to note well, because later on I shall be saying, "" I told you so."" However, if the Government had the ability, and undertook the responsibility of tackling this question, as I propose-if per cent, as a sort of charge; they combined the taking over a certain amount of the debts and the institution of a National Bank-the y could carry on the States while the latter could watch the market in London, New York, or Paris, until they were able to borrow money at a low rate when there was a glut. There could, in this way, be a great saving, but, otherwise, there can be none. A saving of J per cent, on the total debt at present, would mean about ^600,000 a year. But there will be no \ per cent. Last year the Pennsylvania Railway Company, of the TJnited States, went into the Parismarket, and borrowed at 2f per cent, at par; whilst the big State of New South Wales sold her bonds on the London market at £ f i per £,100 below par. The honourable member for Flinders is one of the recognised constitutional lawyers of the Commonwealth. He appears in nearly every great constitutional case. He stands up and points out what this provision means. Yet laymen, who know less about the Constitution than a one-eyed bat knows about past centuries, absolutely contradict him and question his constitutional advice. Mr W. H . IRVINE I think it only right to say that I defer entirely to the opinion expressed by the members of the Convention as to the intentions of the framers. able to persuade honourable members to listen to me, I could have shown them w'hat I believe to be the only way out of this tremendous sea of financial trouble into which we are getting. I have pointed out the only method of salvation. By putting this 25s -per capita provision in the Constitution, the Commonwealth will only be half a revenue controller.

If a State provides a sinking fund in connection with its debts, it will be entitled to the 25s., able member for Flinders, and the Attorbecause it will find the money to liquidate its own debts. Buti f we establish a sinking fund without consulting tbe States, we do it at our risk, and have to take the responsibility. We must still continue to pay the 25s. per head till the Constitution is altered. not be such fools as to provide a sinking fund without making an arrangement with the States. indeed be foolish to do so. The only State, so far as I know, that has a satisfactory sinking fund is Western Australia. Other States have their sinking funds, but occasionally absorb them. Suppose that in the interest of Australia the Commonwealth Parliament said that the debts ought to be liquidated by establishing a sinking fund. Even so, we could not establish such a fund without consulting the States; or if we did we must continue paying them 25s. per head. This is not a satisfactory position. It means that we have to go to the States and get their consent to the establishment of a sinking fund. Leader of the Opposition has, therefore, made it clear that there is a very great deal in his contention that we cannot move without the consent of the States'. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [7.54 a.m.] -Afte r listening to the speech^ of the right honourable member for East Sydney, I desire to say that he has converted me on one point, at all events. He has conveyed to my mind a different impression from that which I formerly entertained. Of course, he speaks as a member of the Convention, and one of its leading members. He tells us what the members of thc Convention contemplated, namely, that the benefit of the conversion and renewal of loans should go to the States, and not to the Commonwealth. I must fully accept that assurance, and I do accept it. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [7.55 a.m.]. On a question like this, which I am sure no honourable member understands too well, it is much to be regretted that the Government should persist in pushing forward the measure after we have been sitting in this chamber over twenty hours. a Governor General's ball, otherwise they would have consented to an adjournment of the debate at 10 o'clock last night. Mr J. H . CATTS --We find the honourable member for East Sydney, the honorney-General, three constitutional authorities, differing amongst themselves as to the effect of this clause. Mr J. H . CATTS -It appeared a little while ago that there was some room for a difference of opinion amongst them. Yet the. Government expect honourable members who have not Had a legal training to deal with this question after a sitting which has already extended almost twenty-four hours. This is another instance of the way in which the Ministry are prepared to sacrifice the powers and privileges of the Commonwealth. They are quite willing to make this Parliament subservient to the Parliaments of the States. "" He that is servant amongst you is greatest of all "" appears to be their doctrine. Evidently they think that the way to become great is to allow the Commonwealth to fetch and carry for the States. The position of this Parliament is being absolutely degraded by them. Under our Constitution, the Commonwealth next year would have been able to exercise supreme control over the Customs and ExThe cise revenue.. Before the powers and privileges of the Commonwealth in respect of surplus revenue were bartered away, this Parliament possessed certain powers in regard to the transfer of the State debts. But now that we have sacrificed our constitutional powers, the Government tell us that' they are merely proposing a continuation of the policy which was decided upon by the 1 Federal Convention, and that, in reality, this proposal represents only a consequential amendment. Section 87 of our Constitution provides that certain revenues may be allocated towards the payment of interest upon the State debts for a period of ten years, after which the section is inapplicable. But under this Bill, we are asked to return to the States a contribution of 2 53. per capita in perpetuity.

Thus, any alteration of the Constitution -will be rendered impossible. I have not read the debates of the' Federal Convention very closely, but I do not know what was in the minds of the delegates in regard to the policy which should be adopted by the -Commonwealth in respect of the consolidation of the State debts. I certainly understood that the Commonwealth would be able to take over those debts, to manage them .in the way that it thought best, to allocate, any saving of interest which might be effected"" to a sinking fund, and thus, in a -certain number of years to liquidate them. But I now find that no such proposal is placed before us. We are merely asked to continue a large public debt, ancl to sanction the heavy drain which must be made upon the labour of Australia to pay interest «ipon it. I view the situation with the -utmost dismay. It comes to me as a tremendous shock. Mr J. H . CATTS -Of course, it is not awful to the Minister of Defence, who entered political life with the idea of doing some good for his fellows. I did hope that it would be possible for the Commonwealth to establish a National Bank jointly owned by the Commonwealth and"" the States, which might .handle the State debts, effect enormous savings, and provide a sinking fund for their liquidation in a comparatively short period. But the temporary arrangement which was made in the Constitution for dealing with the surplus revenue is sought to be perpetuated, the Commonwealth, is simply to handle the State debts as a kind of head clerk for the States, and the hope of many persons that uncler Commonwealth management the State debts might be extinguished in the course of a few years is to be disappointed. with the intention of dealing with this question at the first available opportunity, but after having been in attendance here for nearly twenty-two hours, I am not in a condition to do so. We were charged 'by our constituents with grave responsibilities, and we have been endeavouring to discharge our duty to the best of our abilitv. cided to make this dual inequitable arrangement with the States,, no matter what views ftonorable members on this side may hold with regard to dealing with the public debts. All that they are concerned about is to get this wretched agreement put through. that there is a price behind the agreement-the support of the State Premiers and the State politicians. Mr J. H . CATTS -It appears that there is some price behind the agreement. One can hardly imagine public men in their senses adopting the attitude which has been taken up by the Government. Unhappily, we are on the eve of a general election, and their brainy supporters dare not press their views on this subject for fear pf encountering Ministerial opposition at the polls. This great question has been dealt with in a disgraceful manner. It is deplorable to think that the business of the House is conducted in such a way by the Government that honourable members who have placed before their constituents their ideas on questions of reform; have not an opportunity of intelligently dealing with them. I can only enter a protest against the Government proceeding with the Bill under existing conditions, but I trust that when the people get an opportunity at the ballot-box they will take drastic action to return to this House Nationalists, instead of the petty, parcchial-minded Constitution wreckers who now occupy the Treasury benches. The honourable member for East Sydney has explained that the intention of the draftsmen of the Constitution with regard to the taking over of the State debts was that any monetary benefit which might accrue through the action of the Commonwealth in dealing with stock should be credited to the States concerned, not to the Commonwealth. could derive a benefit.

If the Commonwealth were to borrow largely, in anticipation of the demands of the States, and at a rate of interest lower than that at which they could borrow individually, would it be. bound to let them have the money at. the rate of interest at which it borrowed? borrowing would be for a definite Commonwealth purpose, and the money borrowed could not be applied to any other purpose. struction of a railway to Western Australia could not be handed over to the States. member does.not follow me. If the members of the Convention, thought as the right honourable member does, they should not have spoken of a ""Commonwealth' ' stock. Assuming that ^20,000,000 worth of State loans fell due in five years time, and that the Commonwealth, desiring to benefit the people, authorized the borrowing of an equivalent amount, obtaining it at a lower rate than the States could individually borrow at, would it have to hand the money over to the States at that rate? Where the Commonwealth credit is obviously better than the State credit, which will benefit, the Commonwealth or the States? Is the Commonwealth to take all the risks of these transactions and the States to get the benefits? The whole arrangement seems to be ill-digested. Apparently it will be necessary that the money borrowed by the Commonwealth on behalf of a State shall be borrowed in the name of that State. According to the right honourable member for East Sydney, the Commonwealth will have to give reasons for the loans which it raises, specifying that it is 1 borrowing on behalf of New South Wales, Victoria, or some other State, and the States will have to be credited and debited accordingly. Under this system money may be borrowed at different rates of interest at practically the same time. If Here is a Comseparate loans were floated on behalf of two or more States, they might be raised, at different rates of interest, and the States concerned would be credited and debited accordingly. If that is the view which wastaken at the Convention, 'it is a very narrow and unsatisfactory one, and evidences much short-sightedness. I never heard it stated before. The view which I have always heard advocated is that there would be a Commonwealth stock-that the Commonwealth would take over the debts of the States and be responsible for principal and interest, improving the credit of Australia by substituting one stock for many. I think that is the generally held view. Now we are told by the honourable member for East Sydney that the Commonwealth is merely to be an agent between lenders and the borrowing States. If that is so, the arrangement will not accomplish what the people had in their minds when voting for the Constitution. Money borrowed for the conMr W. H .

Apparently the Commonwealthcould do nothing without the leave of the States. On that point I should like to say a great deal, but this is not the time to doso.

It seems to me that those who aregetting the immediate benefit of a loan should provide for its ultimate repayment. Economy is a virtue which should be morepractised in Australia.

In ordinary circumstances under thc new sessional order we should meet at n o'clock. I move That the House, at its rising, adjourn until 3 o'clock p.m. this day. Question resolved in the affirmative. That thc House do now adjourn. It struck me in listening to the debate during the whole of last night that special consideration ought to be paid on this occasion to the Hansard, staff. The debate has not been an ordinary one. In fact, it has been a very heavy one, and I could not help feeling the sincerest sympathy with those officers in having to keep in constant touch with an exceedingly difficult debate all through the long hours of yesterday morning, afternoon, and evening and early this morning. I hope that particular attention will be given to the matter. I should like to bring under your notice There also, sir, the fact that certain officers connected with the Hansard staff are not permanently employed. Wc surely ought to see if we cannot do something for them. Question resolved in the affirmative.
