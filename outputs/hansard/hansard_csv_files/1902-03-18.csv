Has the Government information of any alleged ""preferences or discriminations"" made by any State as to railways in operation at the present time? 2. If so, can the Minister let the House know the particulars ? the honourable member's questions are as follow :1 and 2. The Government is aware that there are preferential rates in connection with some of the State-owned railways, and I have been in communication with the Minister for Railways in each State with a view to ascertaining what has been done to abolish such rates. The gist of the -replies received is as follows :RE New South Wales -Has been for years endeavouring to deal with the matter, without successIn 1895 arrived at an arrangement with Victoria and South Australian Railway Commissioners, but it was rejected by Victorian Government. Nothing beiug done at present. Victoria -Numerous conferences amongst the heads of the Railway departments of the various States. No result. Seems not likely the desired end be accomplished by mutual consent. Only body likely to effectually settle question is federal one. South Australia -Long been the wish of that State to bring the rates ot all States into line ; but immediate effect, but whose f u l l scope and although attended several conferences, been unsuccessful. The Commissioner of Public Works has requested railway commissioner to report further. 31.1.1902 -Report from railway commissioner to the effect that this important question has frequently been discussed at meetings of the various railway commissioners, but the only practical steps towards assimilation of classes of goods and rates to be levied were taken by South Australian and Victorian commissioners, but it being shown that South Australia would probably benefit and Victoria lose, the Government of the latter State could not sanction scheme. He is of opinion that early steps are necessary to prevent quotation of rates for drawing traffic of another State, or hindering its natural flow. Queensland -Commissione r bas not been approached by other States, consequently taken no action. Glad to carefully consider the question. i Western Australia -Question of bringing local rates into line with those of other States will receive consideration. 19.12.01 -Revision of railway tariff being considered, and will be proceeded with when political crisis settled. Question of Western Australian rates being brought into line with those of other States will be considered. 31.1.1902 -Nothin e yet settled; matter still under consideration. General) I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The measure which I have -the honour to submit involves a somewhat abrupt passage from the class of business in which honourable members have been for some time engaged. We have been long immersed in the consideration of a mass of details, and apparently endless particulars, relating to the industrial and commercial life of the States. The issues presented to us were necessarily debated in a somewhat feverish spirit of partisanship. We are now asked to make a sudden transition to an entirely different realm, to the consideration of matters wholly of principle. Though fully scanned, and must be deliberately considered, it is now submitted as a whole upon the ground that it represents a fulfilment of the purposes of the Constitution, is to be measured by this high standard, and judged not so much by its several details as by its ultimate results. The many items with which we lately dealt were those immediately and directly affecting the present, though they naturally have a continuing operation. The proposal now submitted is one which also will have its significance must be sought in the future. It is one of the constructive proposals outlined in the Constitution, needing to be regarded in its perspective, and in the light of its relations to the other great agencies created by that Imperial Act and studied by aid of the analogies furnished by somewhat similar bodies elsewhere. May I , then, trust that this measure will be considered, as it appropriately might be, in a judicial spirit, approached with an entire absence of party feeling; weighed without any considerations of personal antagonism, and, decided without calling into play those pecuniary interests so directly touched by the matters lately before the House?

17,Mr Deakin (Ballarat,"Attorneythe circumstances the House will, I trust, excuse any trespass on its indulgence, even if it take the shape of repetitions, in order that, without being unduly technical, I may endeavour to convey an appreciation of this measure as it .presents itself to me. The Bill is one that needs explanation. It is based upon positive provisions in the Constitution, with which it requires to be read, and, even when taken together with those provisions, provides means rather than ends, and calls for consideration, not only of the proposals as submitted, but also of the objects sought to be attained by them. This might be termed in most of its features a machinery measure, and as such, might receive scant justice at the hands of its critics, unless the functions it has to fulfil are taken into account. A t present it is no doubt as attractive to the ordinary member as would be the plans and specifications for an important edifice, and would convey to the layman about as small and insufficient an idea of that which is really to result from the carrying out of the propositions here embodied. This is in a sense a formal sketch of the institution sought to be established. It would be my duty to deal with it in the customary fashion-that is to say, by a somewhat close exposition of each of its particular features from the first clause to the last-ha d it not been made abundantly plain already that it is not so much any particular propositions included in this Bill, winch have first to be discussed as tlie fundamental issue, whether this Parliament is called upon at this time to establish a High Court, and, if so called upon, whether the means proposed are adequate, and not excessive. Judging from the press criticism which the B ill has received, there is a disposition to regard this court-thi s all-important portion of the Federal Constitution as what has been termed ""a splendid luxury."" The first thing, therefore, on which honourable members will require to be satisfied is that it is an absolutely essential portion of the Constitution under which we livethat it is charged with the highest responsibilities to the people of this continent-that its operations in the present and in the future are of the most direct and material interest to every class of the community. The question of expense must be taken into account, and I trust that every proposal to which the House assents will be approved only after honourable members have been convinced that it can be justified on the grounds of true economy-no t that of the penny wise and pound foolish order, but that which, having a due regard to the interest affected and the work to be done, measures cost by performance. The study of economy is one of the duties of members of the House, and there will be no attempt to pass it by, but an endeavour to show that this scheme is in the truest sense economical, taking into account the power and possibilities of this institution. May I , at the outset, endeavour to remove one of the gravest of misapprehensions-that this measure, because of its superficial appearance, is merely a lawyer's measure, and of interest to lawyers only. Asi t deals with legal forms and legal procedure, it is necessarily in that sense a lawyer's measure, and professional criticism is invited, and will be welcome in regard to every single detail. In that connection, members of the learned profession will find ample scope and verge enough for all their labours. But, so far from itsbeing merely a lawyer's measure, the criticism directed against it in this morning's newspapers appears to emanate solely from members of that profession, and as it is almost wholly hostile, honourable members have a preliminary and practical assurance that this is not a proposal made solely in the interests of the profession. TheB ill must be legal, because of the subject matter with which it deals, because it springs from a Constitution which, in one of its aspects, is simply a legal instrument, and depends on legal construction. But in its substance, in its influence, in its true character, this is not not merely a legal measure. It is a fundamental proposition for a structural creation which is the necessary and essential complement of a federal Constitution. As such it affects the whole of -the citizens of this community ; as such it touches every class ; as such it affects every calling. Indeed, although it relates to legal machinery, the purposes to be served by that machinery are but in a fractional sense legal, are in the main general, and in a very particular sense political-affectin g directly not only the businesses and bosoms of our population, but also the representatives of the people in both Chambers of this Parliament; affecting directly the Executive of this country; affecting, in fact, every portion of that Constitution of which this court is created to be the guardian. This Bill will be followed by almost wholly mechanical in characterthe Bill for procedure which honourable members see on the notice-paper, supplying the necessary setting for the courts now proposed to be created,' and suitably providing for the transaction of their business, that is if the House should see fit to give its assent to this Bill. These two measures, no doubt, will be found capable of improvement, and any suggestions for their improvement will receive most favorable consideration. this Bill requires to be dealt with as a whole, to be considered as practically embodying a single proposition, for the creation of a national court. To put this view, forced upon me, in a sense, by the apparent attitude of public opinion, it may be necessary to repeat many of the truisms of our federal debates, to recall those constitutional doctrines upon which great stress was laid at the Convention, and in the referendum campaigns throughout Australia. was not then, any more than it is now, truly, a question of details. What was submitted to the public of Australia then was the establishment integral part of a federal Though there are other considerations and other functions of this court of the highest importance with the most far-reaching influence, yet after all it is in that respect it must still be regarded, in order that the criticisms offered both upon the creation of the court, and upon the scale on which it, is sought to be established, are to be understood. In its other relations-that apart from those Constitutional the Bill is of the utmost importance. complete so radical a reform of the legal relations of the people of these States to each other that it might fairly be termed a revolution. tion accomplished not by destruction, but by construction, not by the taking away to any considerable extent of powers that exist, but by their being focussed in a new centre from which they may be radiated to the greater advantage of the whole of this community. order to grasp the position of this High Court, to ask themselves what is the exact change accomplished by the Commonwealth Act? Before it was passed we had these self-governing colonies under the Crown transacting the whole of their political business ; and fulfilling most of the needs of their inhabitants, subject only to the supervision Mr Dea\nn. another of the Imperial Parliament and its executive. The self-governing powers of the Legislatures of the States remain somewhat curtailed, it is true, and the control of the Imperial Government and Executive remains also somewhat diminished. Both the Imperial Parliament and the Crown have made what may be considered a surrender, as the Governments of the various States have made a surrender, in order to equip a new power intermediate between the Imperial But authority and the self-governing States, collecting within itself the interests, and accomplishing the purposes, of the whole of Australia. This is the constitutional change which has been effected by the Commonwealth Act. The creation of the High Cou rt, in its sphere, marks a precisely parallel change. We have had the courts of the States dealing with all the issues submitted to them by the people of their respective States, and the appeal from those It courts to the judicial committee of the Privy Council. We shall still have all these under this measure, but the Privy Council on its side has made a surrender, and the of a High Court as an courts of the States on their side have also Constitution. made a surrender, and . between the two we have interposed this third and intermediate body, the High Court, to which the judicial interests of Australia are committed, in the same way as their political interests are committed to this Parliament-that is, by the Constitution itself. This judiciary holds, therefore, in the sphere of law, precisely the same position, and exhibits precisely the is to say, same transformation as does the creation of operationsthe Commonwealth in the purely political It will world. This is the first consideration pointing to the power and quality of this court, which should give pause to those who think that its creation is a matter of such slight At the same time it is a revoluimportance that it can well be postponed or disregarded. The High Court, in its sphere, and the Parliament, in its sphere, are both expressions of the union of the Australian people. That union cannot be completed on the judicial side without the establishment of this court, any more May I ask honourable members, in than on the political side it ' 'could have been completed, or even commenced, without this Parliament. The federal functions have been divided broadly into two classes. Already the States have, once and for all, parted with, and handed over to the Commonwealth, the sole control of the Customs, the Defences, and the Post Office and Telegraph department. These are now federal departments, to which there will no longer be any analogy in the departments of States. But there are also State departments relating to lands, mines, railways, and other matters, wholly belonging to the States, over which the Federal Government has no control, and to which it has as yet no parallel amongst its departments. The federal judiciary falls into' neither of these and inevitably so, on large and simple classes. It is not to be a distinct and separate federal creation any more than it is to remain solely in the States. On the contrary, the judiciary will form one departand indeed incapable of being readily ment in which the States and the Commonwealth will continue to have concurrent powers, the one co-operating with and assisting the other. It is into an already existing judicial system that this High Court now makes its entrance, not by destruction of the State courts, but based upon them, and under this measure, vesting them with federal jurisdiction that they do not at present enjoy. Nor does this measure oust the appeal to the Privy Council. It gives us a new t court, strictly Australian and national, created for Australian and national purposes, and introduced into that judicial system, whose beginnings are in the minor courts of the States, and whose crown is to be found in the judicial committee of the Privy Council of Great Britain. Of this system it is to continue a part. If this measure were one merely for the creation of a new court, it would be of great importance, because the character of ^the channels through which justice flows can never be a subject of indifference to any class affected by them-and all classes are so affected. If it were proposed merely to add a new court to those at present in existence, its creation would be a matter for the greatest reflection, and might mark no inconsiderable stage in the development of these communities. But the point I am anxious to impress upon honourable members, before they take into consideration the particular criticisms that have been offered with cause of the general language employed, regard to this measure, is that this court has the division between the powers of a quite special and distinct and higher importance of its own. Owing to the federal Constitution introduced by the Commonwealth Act, a new state of affairs has been brought about, in which this court, in the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction, tive loss of power' and authority. On is given a most potent voice. It will define and determine the powers of the 31 K Commonwealth itself, the powers of the States, which subsist within it, and the the validity of the legislation flowing from them. All these have to be defined by this new court. Its first and highest functions as an Australian court-no t its first in point of time, but its first in point of importance w ill be exercised in unfolding the Constitution itself. That Constitution was drawn, lines, and its provisions were embodied in general language, because it was felt to be an instrument not to be lightly altered, altered; and, at the same time, was designed to remain in force for more years than any of us can foretell, and to apply under circumstances probably differing most widely from the expectations now cherished by any of us. Consequently, drawn as it of necessity was on simple and large lines, it opens an immense field for exact definition and interpretation. Our Constitution must depend largely for tlie exact form and shape which it will hereafter take upon the interpretations accorded to its various provisions. This court is created to undertake that interpretation. In addition, the Constitution involves a series of compacts compacts between the different States, studious of the interests of their own people, compacts which affect the present and future privileges of the people, compacts which affect the Treasuries of the States, and compacts which relate to the kinds of legislation to be undertaken by the Commonwealth. These compacts between State and State, and between the Commonwealth and its people as a whole, dealing with all classes and interests, are to be interpreted and safeguarded by this court. Further than that, how many of us yet realize-thoug h probably honourable members of this House are beginning to realize-the complex character of every federal system, and the specially complex character of that created by our Federal Act. How many realize that, be the Commonwealth, and those of the Imperial Parliament and Executive, is, as yet, vaguely defined. There is a large area of disputable territory, which has yet to be marked, either to our relative gain or relathe side -of the States-the opposite side -w e find ourselves confronted with six important self-governing bodies. The boundary line between our territory and theirs is as .yet equally unmarked, and upon many points is equally difficult to determine. The drawing of the line distinctly one sphere and the other, will depend more upon this court, than upon any other court within the Empire. interest, and have sometimes watched with concern, the work done by the various delimitationcommissions appointed by the great powers, whose task it has been to follow through the swamps and forests of Africa, or along tlie high steppes and mountains of central Asia, the delimitations of frontiers. A line is drawn between Wales and Victoria, from the source of the Murray in a geometrical line to the sea, traced by a cleared track, so that people may have no doubt as to the position of the boundary. missions had to peviortn, whilst beset with objective difficulties, were as nothing compared with the intricate .task which awaits the High Court of Australia. down as between this Commonwealth and the Empire, and between the Commonwealth and the States of which it is composed, boundary lines which may be equally plain for every man to see, and within which our citizens may transact their business in security, withoutthe hazard of finding themselves within the domain of some power upon whose legislative authority they did not calculate. It seems to me essential that sense of the term Australian. position has been made that we should depend for a time, at all events, upon the courts of the States, instead of having a court which shall be able to draw its members from every State; that we should accept judicial bodies, honourable and dignified, but limited in their jurisdiction, within certain boundaries, and-at present without authority to go beyond them, instead of creating a tribunal upon which several of the States can be represented their best men, and which would be Australian scope. The High Court ought to be a federal tribunal, because Without derogation from the ability displayed upon the benches by the State Judges-in word shall certainly fall from work has -been performed under circumstances which have rarely involved constitutional.appeals. Mr Deakin. the State Judges throughout Australia should have power to deal with tlie issues arising within their several .jurisdictions, no matter how complex they between may be, or how fateful their decisions may be to the other States whose Judges are not consulted. We are asked to accepta definiWe have read with tion of Australian interests in the first case from courts which it is no reflection to term provincial. We are to be satisfied with preliminary hearings that may result variously in different States, and to finally trust to the judicial committee of the Privy Council over-sea. The Privy Council have hitherto had to deal with only one federaNew South tion-that of Canada-and one thing we require to guard against is that our Constitution shall not be interpreted as if it were a copy of the Canadian Constitution. Thisi t is very far from being. We have to realize The tasks these comthat it will be necessary for us in the first instance to feel our way. Even the Privy Council, which, as lately constituted, is deserving of every respect, should not be It has to lay asked to undertake the task of considering, some of the momentous issues shortly to be submitted to it until they have been dealt with from the Australian aspect before a strictly Australian Court. Before we put so much in peril as would' be involved in the remission of these issues to any distant tribunal, we should take care that they have been submitted to a bench in which we have confidence, before which the Australian, and not merely the local, this court should be in every view has been thoroughly stated, and before The prowhiph the many distinctions of our Constitution from the Canadian and that of the United States have been clearly brought to mind. Then we -shall feel very muchless apprehension if any matter be subsequently remitted to the Privy Council than we could justifiably experience, especially in the earlier years of our history-and it is with these that we are now called upon to deal-if it were remitted in an imperfect shape. What are the three fundamentalby conditions to any federation authoritatively laid down 1 The first is the existence of a in character as well as in supreme Constitution ; the next is a distribution of powers under that Constitution; and the third is an authority reposed in a judiciary to interpret that supreme regard to which no Constitution and to decide as to the me-their precise distribution of powers. These are the three acknowledged characteristics and fundamental principles of every federation, It is also suggested that and if honourable members look at them for a moment, they will see that the first and second absolutely depend for their effect upon the third. The Constitution is to be the supreme law, but it is the High Court which is to determine how Ear and between what boundaries it is supreme. The federation is constituted by distribution of powers, and it is this court which decides the orbit and boundary of every power. Consequently, when we say that there are three fundamental conditions involved in federation, we really mean that there is one which is more essential than the others-the competent tribunal which is able to protect the Constitution, and to oversee its agencies. That bodj"" is the High Court. It is properly termed the "" keystone of the federal arch."" "" The legislature,"" as Marshall puts it , "" makes, the executiveexecutes, and the judiciary declares the law."" ""What the legislature may make, and what the executive may do, the judiciary in the last resort declares; so that the ties which unite the judiciary to the legislature-the Australian High Court to the Australian Parliament-ar e those of mutual association and dependence in the accomplishment of a common task. Court exists stitution against assaults. because our Constitution, although an Imperial Act, has a dual parentage. It proceeds from the people of the whole continent. the people of Australia, when they accepted the Constitution, required to be established for the purpose of insuring that there should not be a departure from the bond into which they thereby entered for themselves and for posterity. This Constitution is not the creation of our State Parliaments only, neither is it the creation of the Imperial Parliament only. It draws its authority directly from the electors of the Commonwealth, .and it is as their chosen and declared agent that the High Court finds its place in the Constitution which they accepted. To put this part of the case in a nutshell, I would say that our written Constitution, large and elastic as it is, is necessarily limited by the ideas and circumstances which obtained in the year 1900. as well as vague in other parts. Constitution remains verbally unalterable except by the process of amendment. Amendment is not nearly so difficult in our case as it is in the United 31 K 2 States, but still it remains difficult. As honourable members are aware, scarcely anv amendments have been made in the Constitution of the United States without a violent national convulsion. Of amendments of the Constitution in the ordinary constitutional fashion there are practically none. A t this very moment there are before the Congress sitting at AVashington no less than 44 Bills for amending the Federal Constitution, and it is the confident opinion of those who have watched the course of American legislation that not one of themis likely to become law owing to the complicated assents they have to secure. Under these circumstances, the Americans have found themselves with a Constitution which might have been a dead letter, and must have been a heavy burden, but for the fact that they had created a Supreme Court capable of interpreting it, a court which had the courage to take that instrument, drawn in the eighteenth century, and read it in the light of the nineteenth century, so as to relieve the intolerable pressure that was being put upon it by the changed circumstances of The High the time. It is not too much to say that, to protect the Conbut for the work done in tins direction by It exists the Supreme Court of the United States, we might not to-day see it as it is, still the revered bond of union of , 70,000,000 or 80,000,000 of free people. Precisely the. It is one of the institutions which same situation must arise in Australia, for although it be much easier to amend our Constitution, it is yet a comparatively costly and difficult task and one which will be attempted only in grave emergencies. In the meantime, the statute stands and will stand on the statute-book just as in the hour in which it was assented to. But the nation lives, grows, and expands. Its circumstances change, its needs alter, and its problems present themselves with new faces. The organ of the national life which preserving the union is yet able from time to time to transfuse into it the fresh blood of the living present, is the Judiciary the High Court of Australia or Supreme Courti n the United States. It is as one of the organs of Government which enables the Constitution to grow and to be adapted It was necessarily precise iri parts, to the changeful necessities and circumThat stances of generation after generation that the High Court operates. Amendments achieve direct and sweeping changes, but the court moves by gradual, often indirect, cautious, well considered steps, that enable the past to join the future, without undue collision and strife in the present. the Constitution something which is not there. if he takes the doctrine of implied powers as developed by the Supreme Court of the United States, I will undertake to say that the ablest of its earliest lawyers-eve n Hamilton or Madison-coul d not have discovered the faintest evidence of the existence of a power which now authorises many of the greatest operations of its Government, and which has been of incalculable advantage to the United States. Why1 Because the law, when in the hands of men like Marshall or those trained in his school, or of the great jurists of the mother country, becomes no longer a dead weight. Its .script is read with the f u l l intelligence of the time, and interpreted in accordance with the needs of the time. That task, of course, can be undertaken only by men of profound ability and long training. It is to secure such men that we desire the -establishment of a High Court in Australia. I do not propose to detain the House further upon these general considerations, except to say that in regard to my own .allusions, or the marginal notes to this Bill, I hope honourable members will not press references or analogies too closely. There is a warning note at the very commencement of the measure that the references given are to more or less analogous provisions, and in any remarks which I have made, or may make, in regard to the courts of Canada, or the United States, honourable members will understand that they are made with many .admitted reservations. Though they are useful analogies, they can easily be pushed too far, and for any body to mistake our -Constitution for a copy of either the United -States or the Canadian Constitutions would be to commit a grave and irreparable error. It resembles each, and yet it stands apart from both. The fact that we have blended in our Constitution some of the provisions -which exist in the United States, with others -which exist in the Canadian, Constitution, -of itself suffices to transform both, and as we have also introduced elements whose -existence is more express in tlie Constitution of the mother countiy, we have again transformed them. As a matter of fact, although if we take this Constitution in its construction, brick by brick, we shall find many which bear the stamp of the United States, many which bear the stamp of Canada, others which bear the stamp of Switzerland, and still others which bear the stamp of the United Kingdomthe parent State-ye t when they are united in an edifice built upon a different design, they lose in a great measure their former characteristics. This Constitution and this court are original structures in the true sense of the word. The courts of the countries I have mentioned, and their Constitutions, throw light upon our courts and Constitution, but still ours need to be interpreted from the first line to the last as distinctly independent. No one provision can be taken apart from the rest now that they have been blended together. They are co-operative necessarily, but have undergone changes such as one finds in chemistry. Each borrowed atom included in the whole suffers a sea-change into something which it was not in the original Constitution from which it is taken. As professional men know, it is a grievous error to suppose, that in reading the Constitution, when we find a clause which comes from the United States, we have simply to look at United States decisions ; that when we find a phrase from the Canada Constitution, we have but to look at the Canadian decisions ; or that when we find something from the English Constitution, we have only to turn to our English constitutional law, and each of these points is settled. The Constitution must be read as a whole. All these elements are united in it ; but all are transformed, and none can be said to have the precise effect which it has in the place from which it is taken until the whole is considered as a whole. That must be donn in order to give consistent force and effect to every phrase, clause, line, and word. In these circumstances, when the new is old, and tlie old is new, the duty of interpreting the Constitution which devolves upon the High Court is no sinecure. It is a task which will tax the best brains that Australia can produce, and the object of this Bill is that the best brains that Australia possesses in this direction shall be devoted to it . Mr Bryce has remarked that no part of the United States Constitution is more misunderstood, especially by foreigners, than that relating to the judiciary. Judging by current criticism the same appears to be true of the place of the judiciary in our own Commonwealth.

19,Mr Deakin,"Perfectly true. Yetwords "" judicial power"" which honourable members will find at the very outset of the chapter of our Constitution which deals with the judicature are taken, it is true, directly from' the United States, Constitution, but under the United States Constitution these words are practically defined. In the Constitution of the Commonwealth there is no such definition. It does not follow, therefore, that the limit of the ""judicial power"" of the United States is necessarily the limit of the "" judicisil power ""here; as these words are used in tlie Constitution of the Commonwealth, their ambit may be much greater. Again the Supreme Court of the United States, as honourable members know, has no relation, except in federal matters, with the courts of the States. These stand apart independently, and arrive possibly at different conclusions on points of law. The High Court as created under our Constitution, on the contrary, while possessing all the federal jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States, is at the same time definitely atid permanently linked with all the courts of the States. It becomes the centre and crown of the whole set of State judicial systems, as well as the centre and crown of federal jurisdiction. stances, although the Supreme Court of the United States is the nearest tribunal to our own, there are extremely wide differences. What the United States court has been to tlie United States was foreseen ancl provided for in its Constitution. In the preamble to that Constitution the establishment of justice throughout the United States of America was placed in its very forefront as one of tlie very purposes for which it was created. It was .not necessary that those words should occur in the preamble to our Constitution, but our purpose was precisely the same. Why do those words occur, and why was that court created in the United States Constitution ? Because the previous confederation, without such a court, had collapsed ignominiously, one of the chief causes of its failure being that there was no national court in existence. precisely the same, because we have always over all State courts the judicial committee of the Privy Council. But the necessity which arose in America for the creation of an American court points the finger directly to the necessity which will obviously and necessarily-although , perhaps, not so manifestly-aris e in Australia for the creation of an Australian court. The special political function of the Supreme Court of the United States is that of pronouncing upon the validity of legislation-the function of determining whether an Act comes within the powers of Congress or is reserved to the State legislatures. That is a power which to foreigners appears almost inexplicable-so strange is it to their experience that any judicial body should have sovast a power. To us, as to our Canadian kinsman, and the founders of the American Republic, there is no such surprise. In the old colony days, before the American Constitution was established, the State courts were accustomed to pronounce upon their own statutes, and to determine whetheror not theyeonflicted with the Royal chartersunder which those colonies existed. So in Canada, since the establishment of the Union, without any obvious extension of authority, the supreme and local courts of that country have freely pronounced upon the validity of provincial acts, or upon thoseof the Dominion Parliament. In the discharge of their ordinary duties as courtsof the Empire these tribunals have setaside legislation which it was beyond the authority of either the greater or the lesserParliaments to pass. We had precisely similar experiences in these States when they were colonies. We have seen Actsrejected or set aside because they conflicted with the Constitutions of these colonies. There was, -therefore, neither to us nor to our American or Canadian kinsmen, anything startling in the exercise of this power, one of the most important intrusted to our High Court, and which in a degree will attach to every one of our courts. But while that is to be admitted by way of premise, honourable members will realize, I hope, that the creation of a federal Statei n Australia has transformed the situation, to such an extent, that what was an almost disused power exercised with extreme rarity, and on few points of importance, will under our changed circumstances, become one of the most transcendent Our position is not within the whole range of the Constitution. What laws have we in existence in this Empire of which we are a part t We have five separate sets and systems of law to which the High Court and its subsidiary courts will be called upon to give",22,Preferential Railwa Y Rates In The Many Of The Clauses Of This Bill Will Be Care

21,Mr Deakin,"Yes. In these circum-a separate and varied have, in the first place, such Imperial legislation as is expressly applied to us, or as may be expressly applied to us; and the question of the limits within which they may be applied, promises some very interesting discussions in the future. Commonwealth Constitution, which is itself an Imperial Act, but an Imperial Act of a remarkable and exceptional charactei*. It is exceptional, first of all, because it is a Constitution, carries with it not only the assent of the Parliament of Great Britain preliminary Australia. stitution in the third place we find Commonwealth legislation, which, within the limits of the Constitution, takes priority over all other local legislation. In the fourth place we find the Constitutions of the States, as they are, or as they may become. Although, standing on the same legal footing as other Imperial Acts, they, too, have a very different authority As constitutional. Acts they stand above the legislation of the States, which represent the fifth class of legislation. five gradations and power. We have Commonwealth legislation and State legislation proceeding in an -endless stream, with possibilities of Imperial legislation-three changing in character and the other two classes, the Commonwealth and ""the State Constitutions, requiring tion and re-interpretation. formerly in existence, of detennining the validity of a law of these colonies, by contrasting it with the Constitution which the colony had derived from the mother country, was really exercised on such settled lines, tliat it was all but dormant while the States were severally apart from each other, with few and costly legal relations between their citizens, and few opportunities for their legislation to clash either with the Constitution of the mother country or their own Constitutions. But with the existence of these five classes of legislation, the High Court must no wand for many years continue to be an actively and constantly operating power. The work before us, which I have already described as that of delimitation, now emerges in an entirely fresh way, and carries with it serious responsibilities. Consequently this power, although it is the same power as of old, will find Mr Deakin. authority. We a fruitful, and, for a long time, a steadily widening field within which to operate. The decisions, of the Court will be of the utmost importance to this House, and the Senate associated with it, to the Executive Government of the Commonwealth, and to Then there is the the people of the Commonwealth, whose powers, privileges, rights and liberties are to be yet strictly defined. Previously the condition of the States in this regard may be termed one of single-blessedness, with and secondly, because it few relations and responsibilities. Now we have entered into an indissoluble .but the relation of a most complex character, assent .of the people of carrying with it the gravest obligations, Under the Commonwealth Conand requiring the most serious guarantees. We have passed from the simple state of comparatively self-governing independence under the Crown to a state still under the Crown, in which complex federal machinery is required to be brought into play, not by our choice but by the very necessity of the situation. It is impossible to create a federation without havconstitutionally. ing divisions and distributions of powers, without having different organs of government possibly in conflict. Therefore, from Thus we have the necessities of federation, and as one of legislative authority of the inevitable consequences from which we cannot escape, we find ourselves in a new situation of comparative peril and serious responsibility. Hence we must classes of law constantly necessarily have an Australian court for the determination of principles which shall be common to the whole Continent, interpretabased upon a survey of the requirements The old power, of the whole people. If the legislative upon and executive powers of the States, the Commonwealth, and the Imperial Governments are to be judicially restrained each to its own sphere, we have before us a difficult task. Does anyone wonder,underthe circumstances, that we find in the Constitution a special chapter devoted to the establishment of a High Court, and that ten sections, numbered 71 to 80, like ten fingers, sustain in their grasp the judical power, and, in a sense, the legislative and executive power of the Commonwealth ? It is no common creation. Bearing in mind the cautions already given, let us consider for a moment the difference between tlie High Court provided for in our Constitution and the Supreme Court of Canada. In the first j>lace, the establishment of the Supreme Court of Canada was optional. All that was inserted in the Canadian Constitution was a simple power to create a court of appeal. In Canada the Executive Government exercises a veto over provincial legislation. is so. and still does so. No such power is vested in the Eederal Executive under our Constitution. If our Pederal Executive had the power to negative State Acts at its pleasure, there would be far less need than there is for the establishment of a High Court. It was perhaps because in Canada the task of keeping the provinces within their bounds was intrusted to the Eederal Government, that its Supreme Court occupies a relatively less exalted and responsible position than will be occupied by our High Court. In the British North America Act there are but six sections devoted to the judiciary, and five of .them are taken up with details which are disposed of in section 72 of our Constitution. So that, practically, the Supreme Court of Canada is the creation of one section, which provides for the establishment of a court of appeal, whereas our High Court is built up in a number of carefully.drawn sections, in which the range of its jurisdiction is clearly defined. It has been said with great. truth, comparing the Canadian Court with the Supreme Court of the -United States, that the Privy Council is the Supreme Court of Canada. Of course, the Supreme Court of Canada, like our own High Court, can determine the validity of laws just as does the .Privy Council. But the Privy Council is a body of heterogeneous jurisdiction, administering many different systems of laws, and if it be the Supreme Court of Canada, there is in this respect, at all events, a close analogy between it and our High Court. In its administration of a single system of law in a single area our court more closely resembles the House of Lords. In the United States the same relation between State Courts and the Supreme Court exists in matters of federal jurisdiction as will be established by this B ill between our State Courts and the High Court. In addition, our High Court will be endowed with a vastly wider appelate jurisdiction for all causes which come before the courts of the States. High Court will hold a relation in regard to the State Courts closely resembling that of the Supreme Court of Canada, where the two bodies are even more blended, owing to the power of appointing the Judges being so largely vested in the Federal Government. What, in my judgment, may be termed a defect in the Canadian system persists in. our It has always done so, own, and that is the possibility of an alternative appeal either to the local Supreme. Court or direct to the Privy Council. . Far greater unity would be imparted if all appeals had, in the first instance, to be made to the highest court in the Dominion, as I trust at some future date all appeals throughout Australia will be made ' in the first instance to our High Court.. Under our Constitution and under this B ill no new barrier is raised between the High Court and the State courts. On the contrary, they are united as closely as possible. I see no reason why, in the future, the natural development of our judicial system should not make that unity more pronounced, and the gradation more perfect. They constitute parts of one judicial system, and may readily be brought into complete harmony, though this is a merely speculative issue, to which I shall not do more than allude. The Bill which I amnowmore closely approaching makes no alteration in the relation established under the Constitution between our High Court and the Court of Final Appeal-the judicial committee of the Privy Council. Under section 74 of the Constitution, this Parliament has power to make laws limiting the matters in which leave may be asked to appeal to the Privy Council. That power is not exercised in the Bill. I shall presently call attention to one important change consequent upon the endowment of our State courts with federal jurisdiction, but, subject to one or two matters of that kind, the State courts are left in practically the same position as they occupied before. Of course honorable members are aware that it is not within our competency to undertake to alter the State courts. They are absolutely independent of us."" Their strength and jurisdiction, apart from their federal' jurisdiction, depends, not upon us, but upon the State Parliaments, under the Crown. There are no changes other than those presently noticed, occasioned either on the Imperial side or on the side of the State Our courts; We have done all that the Constitution empowers us to do to increase the usefulness of the State courts, and to remove the barriers which previously separated them, but which under federation became an anomaly.

That will be a matter for the States. But the passing of this Bill, introduces into the judicial realm a new body of exceptionally high character. If the members of the High Court, as we have every reason to suppose they will be, are the best men that Australia can produce, it is inevitable that the court will draw to itself, naturally and without coercion, a considerable share of tlie litigation which has hitherto flowed to the Supreme Courts of the States. may remain a sufficiency for the State courts for some time to come, owing to the growth of population and the increase of prosperity; Mr Deakin. cannot be denied that the business which will be done by the High Court will assist to relieve not only the State courts, but the Privy Council. will largely make its own work ! work, though it will make its own way. The work which, under other circumstances, would be done by the Supreme Court, will be done by the High Court. The High So far as the ConCourt will not be able to make business for permits us, we have increased itself. What makes business for it is the establishment of the Eederal Constitution. But we have gone further. The existence of the Federal Constitution is already sending into our State courts busiImmigration Restriction Act, the ness which they otherwise would not have had, and that will continue; but if a High Court of supreme ability and standing is created, not only will federal business be transacted by it , but, as it will be able to take State business as well, a number of litigants will prefer to go direct to it, instead of to the Therefore, State courts. There are, I submit, three principal questions to be asked regarding the Rill The first-Isi t within the ConstituIn the first tion ? I reply that it is; though upon certain points that may be a question practical^ I submit that it must be answered in the affirmative. Next, does the Bill provide for tlie exercise of all the powers which the Constitution commits to the which have been High Court? The answer is .that it : does ; it proposes to take the fullest adThe community relies vantage of all those powers. The last We are proud that upon question is, does it create all the courts few occasions have their which the Constitution authorizes this Parjudgments been reversed or liament to create? and the answer is "" No . "" In the 71st section of the Constitution, this Parliament is authorized to create, not only a High Court, but such other federal courts as it chooses, and no such courts are proposed under this Bill. It is proposed to take advantage of the third power to invest State courts with federal jurisdiction, but the only new court is the High Court. One suggestion so far favoured is that we should establish no High Court at all, and be content with the old State system, and the old appeal from the State courts to the Privy Council. This amounts to an endeavour to conduct a federal system upon purely provincial lines, which must inThere evitably fail. An alternative is that a of business "" scratch court,"" so to speak, should be constituted from time to time of the Chief Justices of the States. I say "" scratch but it court,"" because the proposal is, not that the",25,Preferential Railwa Y Rates In The Many Of The Clauses Of This Bill Will Be Care
24,Mr Joseph Cook,Then the High Court,26,Preferential Railwa Y Rates In The Many Of The Clauses Of This Bill Will Be Care
25,Mr Deakin,"It will not make its ownsame Judges should always sit, because obviously, with six States and their business to be iirst considered, they could not all regularly attend-som e are to attend at one time, others at another. Their coming is not to depend upon the importance of the business before the court, it is not to depend upon the federal issue submitted, but it is to depend upon the consent of the State Legislatures and the convenience of State administrations. That is what, without disrespect, I call a ""scratch court."" To a court constituted of ChiefJ ustices there is also a preliminary difficulty. In several instances the Chief Justice is Lieutenant Governor of his State', and exercises from time to time the duties of the head of the State, even while he continues to act as Chief Justice. I do not know whether the community as a whole, with the highest respect and regard for these gentlemen, would feel that they were placed in a proper position if, while they were Lieutenant-Governors of particular States, they were to sit upon cases determining the powers of those States in regard to the Federal Parliament. It would be held, if they decided against their States, that they did so in order to avoid the appearance of favouritism, and if they decided for their States, that they had succumbed to provincial interests. In either event their position would scarcely be tenable. If they are not Lieutenant-Governors of States they are men required to put the interests of tlie State which pays them first in the matter of the time they allot to the discharge of business. They could only make themselves available for federal business when their duties permitted. Having in view the problems already submitted to our courts, and awaiting decision regarding the future of this Commonwealth, it appears to me to be wholly unsatisfactory to say that the Federal Parliament, with all its powersnot its powers as a Parliament apart from other bodies, but the powers which it has to hold and exercise in the interests of its constituents-and the interests of the whole of the people of Australia are to be committed from time to time to courts constituted at the convenience and pleasure of the States, out of a shifting body of J udges. A t all events in the chief States of the union, they must sacrifice their State business if they undertake federal business. saving is there on the ground of economy, if we are to accept State Judges to do federal work, with a certainty that, in States like New South Wales, this must lead to the appointment of extra acting or permanent Judges to keep up with the State business? They must be paid for by the Commonwealth. It is true that those States whose Judges are fully occupied would be the only ones in which extra expenditure would be required; but would it be a satisfactory position for the Federal Government to pay the salaries of the new State Judges undertaking the business of the State Judges who had left for a federal court ? Under those circumstances, is it more advantageous and proper for the Federal Government to pay the salaries of some State Judges to do State business, in order that it may borrow other State Judges to do federal business ? In a State like New South Wales, where the business of the court is congested-accord ing to certain recent statements.made in them-n o Judge could be spared without the appointment of another to take his place. If the Federal Government is to pay any one to undertake judicial duties, surely it would prefer to pay Judges of its own choice to undertake that work ? The judgments of our own courts stand well, even when subjected to test at home, but they have not yet involved many delicate constitutional questions. In fact, I can recall constitutional cases dealt with in Australia by very able State benches, in an extremely unsatisfactory manner to a great number of the profession, and of the people of their States. Then again, although the judicial committee of the Privy Council as regards Canada, has given great satisfaction in its interpretation of the British North America Act, it has gradually established a line of interpretation in regard to that A ct which is at present a safeguard to the Dominion Parliament and its powers. Putting aside the fact that the Canadian Constitution is a much less emphatic departure from the British Constitution than is the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia, where, instead of subordinating its provinces to itself, we have left them as relatively independent as are the States under the United States Constitution. The people of Australia gave to this Parliament, as its first trustees, the dut} to preserve r their privileges, all that were granted to What them by this charter. Are we then in the first session of our Parliament to say-""AV e are willing to place your rights and powers between the upper millstone of the Privy Council and the lower millstone of provincial courts ?"" Who but ourselves will be held responsible if distinctively fedenal rights and privileges emerge, ground to impalpable powder ? We should be false to the task imposed upon us. This is no optional court of the Canadian fashion, but a court which, under a mandate of the Constitution, is required to be established. Asi t presents itself to my mind, the plain reading'of that mandate is that it shall be created at once. The language of tlie Constitution is thatThe judicial power of the Commonwealth shall in this continent about any matter whatbe vested in a Federal Supreme Court. Noti n State Courts, not in a combination of State Judges, not in the Privy Council even, but in a Eederal Supreme Court, "" to be called the High Court of Australia."" That is tlie absolute behest of the Constitution ; it is a command, which we can neither neglect nor ignore without failing in our legislative duty. The people of Australia accepted the Constitution with that mandate, which I never heard challenged on any platform. that part of it ? the honourable member's question to convey a reflection on the electors of Australia, but to inquire how far electors distinguished that particular proposal. thing done by the Federal Parliament. stood upon a platform upon which I did not explain or hear explained by another < speaker, the position which the High Court was to hold. This court was to be in one sense the custodian of the Constitution and a guarantee to the people, especially of States that were not to send a large number of representatives to this House. The first guarantee given to them was equal representation in the Senate, and the second guarantee, which weighed, to my knowledge, with thousands of them, was the impartial independent tribunal to interpret the Constitution. The people sanctioned it, aud protected it against encroachments from State Parliaments or Executives, or from its sacrifice by the Federal Parliaments or their Executive. This Bill is grafted upon those provisions in the Constitution. Werei t not for the express terms in which the judiciary is dealt with there much more would appear in this Bill. If honourable members will look at the chapter on the judicature they will find in section 71 that the High Court shall consist of not less than tliree Justices. Section 72 grants the usual guarantees to the Justices, to place them beyond the reach of improper influences. Section 73 provides for this court a complete and ample appellate jurisdiction over all the business of the State Courts. Honourable members will realize that though a Federal Court, it is not limited to matters of federal jurisdiction. The simplest suit between any two persons ever, may, subject to certain limitations imposed in this Bill, be brought to the High Court. sufficient money to take it there. court. The entire business which is now transacted, and all the business which can be transacted by the State courts of Australia, can be brought to the High Court on appeal. In this respect the conditions will differ materially from those which apply to the Supreme Court of the United States. Section 74 deals with appealsto the PrivyI do not understand Council. Constitutional appeals are to be finally and absolutely decided by the High Court unless the court itself sees fit to refer them to the Privy Council. This is a larger power than exists in Canada, in whose Constitution there is no hint of any such special authority, indeed the High Court will I do not think I ever be the only body in the outerempire intrusted with the performance 'of this high duty and this special responsibility. In section 75 this Parliament is constrained. Here tlie original jurisdiction of the High Court is provided for, and even Parliament is not to be allowed to reduce it . Section 76 provides that jurisdiction in four very important matters may be conferred upon the High Court by this Parliament, aud this Bill proposes to confer it . Section 77 confers an authority far wider than may appear to a cursory reader-to define the jurisdiction of tlie federal courts, and the extent to which the jurisdiction of the federal courts shall be exclusive, also conferring power to invest any of the State courts with federal jurisdiction. As will be seen in the sequel, these are very great powers, and they are to. be exercised under this. Bill.

31,Mr Deakin,"T h a t applies to everythe Commonwealth Government;, and"" the following section enables the Parliament to fix the quorum of Judges, whilst section 80 deals with trials by jury. Honourable members will see that in the Constitution, there is, so to speak, a small judiciary Act already passed. It is part of the Imperial Act, and is binding upon us. It expresses the will of the people, and declares not only that this court shall be established, but determines generally its jurisdiction, and many other matters in regard to it . Further, in express words it points to many particulars in which this Parliament is required to assume responsibility. Under section 71, we are required to determine tlie number of Judges-mor e than threeby section 72 we can make certain provisions with regard to their tenure of office; in section 73 we have not only, an appellate jurisdiction, but a restriction upon the power of Parliament to limit it . In section 74 we have power to limit appeals to the Privy Council. In section 75 we have the original jurisdiction fixed; and in section 76 the optional jurisdiction of the High Court. Under section 77 we are prevented from limiting the jurisdiction of the High Court, whose Judges are accorded an exceptional position. We can define the jurisdiction of any federal court other than the High Court. Again, by section 80 this Parliament cannot, without an amendment of the Constitution, enable an indictable offence to be tried without a jury, or to be tried outside the State in which the offence was committed. Thus we have laid down by the Constitution the main lines of construction for our judiciary, and have indicated to us the way in which this Parliament is called upon to complete tlie work. Before directing special attention to a few clauses of this Bill, may I be permitted to express the acknowledgments which are due to several gentlemen, and particularly to one, who have lent invaluable assistance in the preparation of this measure. It has been drafted for some twelve months, and I am under a debt which cannot be over-estimated to the Chief Justice of Queensland, Sir Samuel Griffith, uot only for the use which we have made of the statutory -work he has done in that State, but for the unstinted generosity with which he has supplied original drafts, criticisms, and suggestions for the shaping of this measure. Afteri t was put into form, I thought it right to. submit it to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the last Federal Convention, Senator Sir Josiah Symon, to whom also I am under a great obligation for criticisms and suggestions. Finally, I submitted it to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the Convention which was held in 1891, Mr Justice Clark, of Tasmania, who in the same way was good enough to read it with a critical eye. No one of these gentlemen, not even Sir Samuel Griffith, can be held to blame for any provision in this measure as it now appears. Many alterations have been made in detail, and some in principle, so that the Ministry, and the Ministry alone, are responsible for the form in which it now stands. Neither of the professional critics who have helped us would probably approve of all the contents of this Bill-o r perhaps of the Bill as a whole. I mention their names, not with a view to commend it to the consideration of honourable members, but in order to discharge the grave obligation under which I lie to men of such learning and experience for their great assistance. For the Bill as it stands we take the whole and sole responsibility. Every weakness in it is no doubt due to some of the alterations I myself have made. I am anxious, without undue delay, to recommend it to the lay members of the House. From my professional brethren I shall ask and expect the closest criticism-and have already invited it. .1 wish, however, to remove any apprehension that other honourable members may feel when they turn over the 22 pages of the Bill, and hastily scan its 80 clauses. I wish to tell those who shrink'from the task of endeavouring to assimilate those 80 clauses, added to the ten sections of the Constitution relating to the judiciary, that if they will give a cursory glance at the Constitution they may'drop 60 of these clauses' for the present, and find in the remainingscore, mostof them easilyintelligible, the gist of the measure. For instance, honourable members will, I am sure, turn with interest to clause 3, which provides that the High Court shall be constituted of the ChiefJ ustice and four other J ustices. That was the proposal adopted by the Convention in 1S91, and if it were justified by the condition of legal business, by the population and litigation of Australia then, it is doubly justified to-day. The next provisions of importance are to be found in clauses 9 to 11. They provide that until the principal seat of the High Court is fixed at the seat of the Government, it shall sit at such places as the Governor General shall from time to time appoint. Provision is also made for the establishment of registries in each State-one and that the sittings of the High Court shall be held from time to time at the principal seat of the court, and at each of the places at which there is a district registry. honourable members may pass on to the sixteenth clause, which enables a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State to be appointed to act as a Judge of the High' Court sitting in Chambers. This will qualify him to deal with those many necessaiy preliminary and intermediate steps which are usually taken on interlocutory without waiting for the attendance of a High Court Judge. Iu clause 23, all the jurisdiction which, under section 76 of the Constitution, can be conferred on the High Court is so conferred. Clauses 27 and 2S deal with appeals in one case from the Eederal courts, and in the other from the State courts, whilst clauses 29 to 31 fix the number of Judges to constitute courts for dealing with particular classes of cases. By clause 32 honourable members will notice that every Judge of the High Court is prohibited from sitting upon appeals from his own judgment. will find in clauses 35 and 36, perhaps, the most important provisions in the measure. These not only confer federal upon State courts, but define the jurisdiction which is exclusively in the High Court, and cannot be exercised by the State courts. Cl-ause 37 provides for appeals in matters of federal jurisdiction. valuable, because they enable suitors to have their cases removed from the State courts under certain circumstances as a right, and, under other circumstances, only if they are able to show sufficient cause to the High Court to justify transfer. although of far less moment in our judiciary than it is in the United States. Our general power of appeal in all matters from the State courts to the High Court would enable us to look without alarm upon the decision of Federal issues, or mixed Federal and State issues, by the State courts. There might be no necessity to remove a cause while an appeal, in any case, lies with the High Court. Clauses 48 and 49 provide for the salaries and pensions Mr Deakin. of the Judges of the High Court. I may now assume that I have directed the attention of honourable members to nearly every provision of special interest in the Bill. The principal provisions are contained in at least at its capitalthese twenty clauses, which should not present any great difficulties, and if printed in black letter, as they appropriately might be, would not alarm even"" lay inembers. Then They may be further reduced to seven clauses out of these upon which the attention of honourable members may be focussed. Mr O'MALLEY -The Chief Justice of America receives only £2,000. has heard of no proposal from me to reduce that amount. The seven clauses to applications, which I have called attention, are clause 23, which relates to the conferring of original jurisdiction; clause 27, which deals with appeals from Justices of the High Court; clause 28, dealing with appeals from the State courts; clause 35, which relates to the judicial power of the Commonwealth ; clause 36, having reference to State courts invested with federal jurisdiction ; clause 38, relating to the removal of cases as of right; and clause 41, to removal by order. I think that these seven clauses might be printed in gold letters to convey, not only an idea They of their relative importance to the rest of the measure, but because honourable members would then see that if they had jurisdiction mastered the few very vital and important considerations which are involved in those clauses, they would have a very adequate idea of the actual scope and intention of this Bill. In fact, if I may be as figurative Clauses 38 to 41 are as the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, I should say that out of the ten sections in the Constitution to which I have referred, the first seven are the seven branches of the candlestick of the Commonwealth law, by the light of which this such a Bill may be seen to fulfil the expectations This is a power of importance, of the people who accepted that great measure. PerhapsI can still more simplify the task for our weaker brethren, if _ I summarize in a few words the actual scope of federal jurisdiction. Matters within that jurisdiction mav be dealt with under this Bill either by Federal courts or by State courts invested with federal jurisdiction. In some matters the jurisdiction of Federal courts is exclusive. In all other matters the States are invested with a concurrent jurisdiction, although such matters",28,Preferential Railwa Y Rates In The Many Of The Clauses Of This Bill Will Be Care
32,Mr Deakin,"-The honourable membermay be removed to the High 'Court upon appeal or by order. When the Bill comes to deal with ihe State courts it first makes the jurisdiction exclusive!y federal, and, so far as -they now enjoy such jurisdiction, may be said to deprive them of it . The same clause then invests the State courts with the jurisdiction part of which may be said to have been withdrawn. This makes it perfectly clear that federal jurisdiction is vested in those courts subject to a condition which will presently appear. The jurisdiction of the Federal courts is exclusive in the matters mentioned in clause 36, paragraphs (a) to ( / ) . In suits which cannot be removed from the State courts, as of right, the appeal must be heard by State courts. matters, the State courts can exercise federal jurisdiction only as courts of first instance, and any appeal from them must go to the High Court. Finally, in all cases of federal jurisdiction, appeals from the Supreme Court go to the High Court. I need not dwell Upon the fact that certain inferior State courts are treated as courts of first instance, even when one inferior court is dealing with a case on appeal from another inferior court. In regard to removals, they are either as of right or by order of the High Court. Bemoval, as of right, may be made on application of the defendant in all suits involving matters of federal jurisdiction, except where the only ground of federal jurisdiction is that the suit relates to a matter of Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, or to a dispute between residents of different States, or between one State and the resident of another State. The removal cannot be made from the State court by a defendant resident in the Statei n which the case is being tried, then or where the suit, not being a matter of Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, relates solely to the possession or administration of property in a State. These provisions, honourable members will see, are intended to render it unnecessary to have cases removed from State courts in those matters which need to be dealt with either with special promptness as in the case of Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, where, perhaps, a ship has to be detained-o r in cases where the defendant's interests-the property being in his own State-ar e sufficiently protected by the fact that his State court is the tribunal before which it will be tried. Of course, any case, civil or criminal, involving a matter of federal jurisdiction, may be removed to the High Court on the application of any party for cause shown or upon the application of the Federal Attorney General, if he considers the matter one of such grave importance that in the interests of the State and of the parties themselves, it is desirable that it be at once removed to the High Court. W it h these safeguards, the restrictions proposed upon the jurisdiction conferred are made in the interests of litigants and to provide that the courts of the States shall be capable of being used in all possible disputes, when the circumstances to which I have just alluded exist. Sir JOH N QUICK -What is the original In other exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court1 that included in section 75 of the Constitution. The original jurisdiction contained in section 75 is made exclusive, except in regard to some of those matters set forth in sub-section (4). Matters between residents of different States, or between a State and a resident of another State, are omitted. All the remainder of the original jurisdiction conferred under section ""75 of the Constitution belongs only to the High Court. That is the only exclusive jurisdiction proposed in tlie Bill. Honourable members will perceive that the few matters which are to be tried in the High Court are practically those which are specially singled out in the Constitution itself. They are matters arising under any treaty, clearly of -federal and not of State concern; matters affecting consuls or other representatives of other countries as such, also a strictly federal matter; suits between the Commonwealth, or any person suing or being sued on behalf of the Commonwealth, and. a State or any person suing or being sued on behalf of a State. In addition paragraph (e) of clause 36 gives the High Court exclusive jurisdiction in suits against the Commonwealth, or against any person being sued on behalf of the Commonwealth ; and paragraph ( f ) confers similar jurisdiction in regard to matters in which a writ or order is sought to be obtained against an officer of the Commonwealth, in respect of some act done by . him in the execution of his duty. Paragraph (c) gives exclusive jurisdiction to the High Court in suits between States, or between I persons suing or being sued on behalf of I different States, or between a State and a",30,Preferential Railwa Y Rates In The Many Of The Clauses Of This Bill Will Be Care
33,Mr Deakin,"It is a little less thanperson suing or being sued on behalf of another therefore see that the only exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court relates to treaties, consuls, officers of the Commonwealth, suits against the Commonwealth, or suits by States, all of which matters are obviously not to be dealt with in the same federal fashion by any State court. Of course, cases under these classes will occur very rarely, but when they do occur they can be dealt with only by the High Court. Whereveri t is possible to confer upon the State courts original jurisdiction .we have done so. Section 76 of the Constitution gives us four optional classes of original jurisdiction. That is to say, it proAndes that all cases arising under the Constitution or under any laws made by this Parliament, and all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, or relating to subject matters claimed under the laws of. different States, may be part of the original jurisdiction of the High Court. This Bill makes them part of the original jurisdiction of the High Court, but it enables them to be dealt with, as also certain matters arising out of section 75 of the Constitution, by the State courts. The whole sweep of the original jurisdiction of the High Court is vested in the Eederal Courts, with the few special exemptions which I have named. MrO ' MALLEY claim against a Victorian, he can sue him in the State court instead of in the High Court? likes. I am about to ask the House to briefly consider the High Court in three aspects. First, as the head of ali the State systems, whether in regard to the jurisdiction which they at present enjoy, or that about to be granted to them; secondly, as the federal judiciary dealing with purely federal business; and thirdly, as the exponent of the Constitution. If honourable members look at clause 28 of the Bill, they will note that the appellate jurisdiction given to tlie High Court under section 73 of the Constitution is here made subject to certain limitations. before an appeal can. be made from a State court to the High Court, it must be shown that it relates to a matter involving, at least, If the High Court established, is the £300, unless special leave is given by the High Court, when there is no such restriction. If an important principle is involved an appeal will lie for threepence. In addition to that, having in view the power posState. The House will sessed by the Federal Parliament to legislate on certain special issues, we have introduced an entirely new qualification for appeals which does not exist under any Ordersi n Council relating to appeals from the State courts to the Privy Coun'cil. It is a qualification which does not exist in any form in any State, or in fact, so far as I know, anywhere else. An appeal will be received in any case which involves the status of any person under the federal laws relating to aliens, marriage, divorce, bankruptcy, or insolvency-al l matters of federal legislation. Without regard to any sum of money being involved, and without even requiring special leave to be granted, any matter relating to these various classes will be appealable to the High Court. That marks a step in liberality beyond anything of which I am aware. An appeal will also lie in criminal matters on questions of law to the -High Court. Such an appeal lies on writ of error, when questions of law are involved, to the Supreme Court of the United States. Under a provincial Act in Canada of doubtful validity, appeals to the Privy Council in criminal matters are forbidden. Ours, therefore, will be a national court of appeal. All civil and criminal cases even the decision of a single Judge-wil l be directly If a Tasmanian has a appealable to the High.

34,Mr Deakin,"ancl challenges comparison even with thegreat tribunals of the mother country-w e may hope to draw legal business -not only from our own States, but from that sister colony before it becomes-if ever it should happily becomea member of our union. The High Court will be an appellate tribunal for all cases judicable in the State Courts, and for all cases judicable in the Federal Courts. Its power of appeal covers the whole vast range of possible litigation in Australia. Nothing Federal or State is excluded from it . It . will be capable of entertaining appeals on questions of law, even from the Inter-State Commission when that body shall have been created. shall not repeat the contrast drawn already by anticipation between a body clothed with this vast appellate jurisdiction, and the United States Court, limited only to matters of Federal jurisdiction, or with the Canadian Court, which has not the special character of being a Court of final appeal on special constitutional questions. in this Bill affects the present right of appeal to the Privy Council. We may expect hereafter that in spite of the recent refusal to unite the two tribunals which at present exist in Great Britain, the one finally determining all Colonial and Imperial matters outside the United Kingdom, while the. other-the judicial division of the House of Lords-is the highest Court of Appeal to the people of the United Kingdom Empire. United Kingdom only. No appeal lies from the residents of the outer Empire to the judicial division of the House of Lords. They can. appeal only to the judicial committee of the Privy Council, a different although highly dignified body. When the sense of the equality of British citizenship has been borne home to the officially legal mind in England as it has been borne home already to political minds here and there, we shall probably .find these two tribunals united in onesinglelmperialCourtof Appeal; where the citizens within the United Kingdom and the citizens of the Empire without it will, alike obtain the final determination of important principles. Even distinguished members of the Privy Council and its critics in both the Commons and the Lords imply that this court, fully burdened with business, has no desire to see appeals from the courts of the Empire multiplied. It desires the growth in all parts of the Empire, of local courts themselves competent to undertake and. fulfil all the tasks cast upon judicial bodies, retaining only an appeal which shall preserve an unity of legal interpretation and which shall also preserve that sentiment of unity-fa r stronger than the necessity for similarity of interpretation-throughou t the Empire-whic h is strong in every one of its fractions. When that single tribunal shall have been established, and I think we may speak of it as no remote possibility, there will be still less desire that courts I of the mother country, 10,000 miles away, dealing with cases arising under so many different systems of law-the Dutch quasiRoman law, .which obtains at the Cape, Indian law, and tlie French law, maintained in Canada-shoul d be further burdened. There will be a desire that appeals, at all events from courts following the English Nothing system of jurisprudence, should not be multiplied ; that as far as possible, we should become self-judicable, so to speak, and capable of dealing finally with almost the the whole of our litigation within our own borders. W it h a single Imperial court, that will be more the ideal than it is to-day, although already aspired to by legal authorities of tlie highest standing. In these circumstances, we must feel the responsibility tliat lies upon us of preparing to meet the duties which will yet be cast upon us in greater measure. There is no desire to draw the decisions of all, or anyT h e people of the thing like the decision of all, our chief cases to the centre of the Empire. The ambition is to preserve a system of unity of interpretation, and under it to encourage our oversea courts to administer justice to their constituents, without appeal to London. some limit under section 741 we are already proposing what some critics deem too great a demand. It is necessary also that we should settle' the nature of our court, both as to the number of its judges and the character of those constituting it , before we can present our strongest case to His Majesty for any limitation of Privy Council appeals.

In the meantime, the trend of legal and ministerial opinion at home lies i u the direction of encouraging us to undertake all our own legal business for which we can providefittribunals. To return a moment to my rude comparison between the High Court of Australia and the Canadian Court. I should have remarked that its Supreme Court possesses one function which does not attach to our own High Court. It is capable of being consulted, and is required to give a formal opinion upon cases submitted to it by tlie Executive Government. Without admitting that this is an extension of judicial power deal of law expenses. because it gives in advance of any actual concrete test, judicial authority for what it is worth upon some abstract opiniona course which, like all short cuts, may in many cases prove to have been the longest way round. I do not think this power adds materially to the status of the court, although I ought to mention it, while pointing out on the other hand that to distinguish the respective spheres of the Dominion and Provinces in Canada is a much simpler matter than the delimitation of the powers of the Commonwealth and the States in Australia. Not only is there a federal veto upon provincial legislation in Canada, but there the provinces are reduced to the specific powers with which they are invested by the British North America Act. The unspecified margin of authority in every case lies on the side of the Dominion, and thus the advantage in every case lies on the side of the Dominion. This renders the path of its Supreme Court clear. Here the question will be much more critical to us. There is a greater responsibility upon our court since the responsibility, in our case, is cast upon us of showing the specific authority for our every claim, while the undefined powers and potencies all remain vested in the States. Not only will the task of our Courts be more difficult, but its findings will be matter of much more serious concern to the citizens and Parliament of the Commonwealth. Interpretation of the Constitution in our case is beset with much greater federal perils. Therefore, taking it as a whole, the High Court, as we propose to establish it , If it be necessary to legislate should compare more closely with the Supreme Court of the United States than with the Supreme Court of Canada. It will in the future rank with them as an agency of federal development and an exponent of federal relations of an entirely new type. Finally, let me draw attention to the High Court as the exponent of the Constitution. Here interesting problems beset us. The British North America Act, like our Constitution, is an Imperial Act. Although all Acts of the Imperial Parliament stand legally upon the Same footing, it is more and more admitted that, constitutionally, there is a wide distinction between measures such as the British North AmericaA ct and our Constitution, which are the fundamental law of great self-governing communities and ordinary measures in regard to minor and forI t appears to do so, mal matters of trifling concern which appear upon the statute-books side by side with them. The constitutional practice of the last half century probably justifies the assertion that when a Constitution has been granted by the Imperial Parliament to a self-governing member of the Empire, the Imperial Parliament will not seek to amend it, except in accordance with the wishes of the people to whom it applies. That constitutional practice is strengthening every day. The British North America Act does not contain within itself any power of amendment. Wheni t requires alteration-and it has been amended upon a number of occasions-the Canadian Parliament requests the intervention of the Imperial Parliament, which thereupon passes an A ct for the purpose. Only in that way, though wholly at the request and with the consent of the people of Canada, is the Canadian Constitution developing. It is not too great a claim to say that there is no prospect of interference on the part of the Imperial Government with the Constitution of the Dominion of Canada, unless at the request of its people. Such a request need never be made by the people of this Commonwealth, because our Constitution includes a power of amendment. One of its features which most struck its critics at home, and most amazed foreigners abroad was the fact that the Imperial Parliament had so lavish and absolute a trust in the people of this",33,Preferential Railwa Y Rates In The Many Of The Clauses Of This Bill Will Be Care
39,Mr Watson,It would save a great,34,Preferential Railwa Y Rates In The Many Of The Clauses Of This Bill Will Be Care
40,Mr Deakin,"Commonwealth, that it had under its own hand and seal endowed them with the power and the means of amending their Constitution, although that Constitution is in itself an Imperial Act. a further consideration. wealth Constitution stands apart from all other measures upon the statute-book of the Imperial Parliament, and, so far as I know, upon any statute-book. Certainly no Act of the United States or of Canada can show an equivalent authority to that under which our Constitution was drawn and passed. Its preamble Sets out in simple terms the statement of a fact whose transcendent importance has yet to be understood and exhausted. The people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, humbly relying on the. blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Pederal Commonwealth under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and under the Constitution hereby established. Por the first time in British history the special and express sanction of the people appears in the preamble of an Imperial Act in addition to the sanction given by the Imperial Parliament and by the Crown. That of itself is sufficient to distinguish our not err in giving the High Court the proConstitution from every other Act upon the Imperial statute-book, including the British North America Act. It is desirable and necessary that these distinctions should be drawn. They will hereafter require to be interpreted in support of special sections or of the whole of the Constitution. racter of our Constitution, coupled with the power of amendment contained within it, and the peculiar sanction given in its preamble, make it more essentially and absolutely a charter of entire self-government than any other Act to which the British Parliament has assented. All parts of that Constitution, as they have received the same sanction, merit our most careful consideration, and I submit that, as the Constitution requires the establishment of a High Court, it behoves this Parliament to provide for its establishment. The Judiciary Bill is necessary, because without the machinery which it contains, the High Court could neither be actually constituted nor proceed to employ the authority intrusted to it . The sketch which the. 'Constitution gives of the powers of the High Court justifies us in bringing forward the Judiciary Bill as an essential complement of the Constitution, and its necessary corollary. Without 31 L Chapter 3, the Constitution might not have been accepted in some of the States. If it be admitted that the provisions for the establishment of the High Court are among There is yet the most conspicuous features of the ConThe Commonstitution, and that the task of interpretation is as responsible and f r u it f u l as I claim it to be, it is surely not too much to contend that it is possible to fulfil our obligations to those who voted in such immense majorities for the acceptance of the Constitution, only by creating a High Court at the first opportunity. If it is created as proposed in the Bill, there will be a field wide and opportunities plentiful enough to enable it to take its stand beside any judicial tribunal in the world. The august and impressive Supreme Court of the United States; that historic and picturesque body, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the cream of English law and learning which is to be found in the judicial division of the House of Lords-majesti c as these are-ma) ' not, and should not long,, overshadow the High Court, which will interpret the Constitution and the legislation of the Commonwealth, and of the federated States. The people did minence which it has in the Constitution. May I quote the words of the greatestpolitical philosopher of our nation-Burk e -who , with marvellous prescience and foresight intoconstitutional principle, said thatWhatever is supreme in the State. . . . ought to give a security to its justice against its The wording and the chapower. It ought to make its judicature, as it were, something exterior to the State. If those words apply, as he applied them, to a unitary system of government, how much more do they apply to the Eederal Governments which have grown up since his day 1 We are thus face to face with the practical suggestions which have been made by some who are hostile to this Bill. They say""Even if we admit that a High Court must be established, and that it will not do to constitute it of the chance gatherings of State Judges,or even of Chief Justices, surely, as the Constitution suggests three Judges as a minimum, it would be possible to accept them instead of the five provided for in the Bill."" Are they then giving that security to justice demanded by Burke? Are they realizing what federal judicial responsibilities must be? The well-known constitutional authority, Dicey, saysFrom the fact that the judicial bench supports under Federal Constitutions the whole stress of the Constitution, .a special danger arises lest the fact is that with three J udges it only needs judiciary should be unequal to the burden laid to constitute a majority, a majority of one. upon them.

A court of only three Judges would help to induce litigants and suitors to go to the other side of the world in order to obtain a stronger Bench. Give them here a strong Bench of sufficiently eminent men, and they will be content to remain. The High Court is not the creation of this Bill, but really of the Constitution. That Constitution is federal, and federalism means litigation. A federal system is impossible apart from appeals to the arbiter that it Creates-to determine between the different bodies and institutions which are bound together by the very nature of the Federal Government. It is because under a federal system questions are often settled by litigation instead of by legislation, because the procedure to amend the Constitution involves so much time and expense-it is because this new legal situation is forced upon us that we . are faced with this Bill. AVe are not going out of our way to meet it. AVe are not creating the High Court with a view to the business which may come. AVe are creating it with a view to the difficulties already existing around us-becaus e of differences of opinion honestly entertained between the States and the Federal Government as to the respective spheres of their power and influence. The American Constitutionwritten Constitution as it is--is admitted to have been a growth. To a very large extent, it rests on what is called Judgemade law, that is to say, interpretation by the courts. of the English Constitution consists of Judge-made law. Many of our most fundamental principles and liberties are founded directly upon judicial decisions. Now for an illustration or two. The United States, when they commenced their career, had not as many people as are now living in Australia, and they were not scattered over so large an area. They were not rich except in resources. They created at once a Court consisting'of six Judges. M i \ HIGGINS -They had no alternative, and we have no power of vetoing State they had lost the Privy Council. content with a court of three Judges1 31 L 2 of having three Judgesi f we are to have a High Court at all. learned friend's experience supports me there. The United States when they united were extremely economical. Owing to difficulties of communication their commercial relations were much less close than ours, and their legal business was not a fraction of that which our court will possess from the very outset. Yet they created a court of six Judges. In the United States Supreme Court to-day it takes six Judges to pronounce a judgment. Of course, they have far more Judges now. They have nine Chief Judges, 55 federal Judges on circuit, 7S Judges with federal jurisdiction, and battalions of State Judges, besides. though. because, as is notorious, they secure the Services of those men who have achieved an independence by their labours at the bar. If honourable members are willing to introduce the same condition of"" things here, that is perfectly open to them.

If we are to have a court of three J udges only, that restriction must be struck If we out, or else honourable members must be content to let two Judges sit on an appeal from the third Judge.

The Is that the sort of equipment that would enable the High Court of Australia to occupy a proper position in the eyes of the public, or induce the people to receive its judgments with the respect they should deserve ? Although five J udges are to be appointed, any one J udge may try cases, and with aBench of five there' will be four Judges to whom an appeal can be made from the decision of a single Judge'. Honourable members will now see that five Judges is the lowest possible number court of three Judges, and it that will permit of their going on circuit in the different States, and will furnish a sufficient number to act as a Court of Appeal from the State courts and from the judgments given by a single High Court Judge. In our proposal we are more modest than either Canada or the United States, so far as the number of Judges is concerned. volving a constitutional point were to arise in Tasmania, would that be tried in the first instance by one Judge of the High Court? Who will appeal from a bench involving constitutional questions may arise in any court. It is conceivable that a case, involving a constitutional point, might originate in a police court in Tasmania. It would probably come before a Judge of the High Court on circuit in Tasmania, and there would be an appeal from him to the High Court, and then to the Privy Council, if it were thought necessary. Not only are five Judges required to enable the States to be visited, but to allow of a proper quorum being fixed in every case. We propose to fix the quorum of Judges for the trial of appeals from the State courts at four. We do that because the State courts almost invariably",37,Preferential Railwa Y Rates In The Many Of The Clauses Of This Bill Will Be Care

57,Mr Deakin,"It could be. Casesconsist of three J udges, and occasionally of more, and consequently it is necessary to have four Judges of the Federal Court of Appeal. The concurrence of th ree J udges will be necessary before a judgment is reversed or set aside. In the case of appeals from a Justice of the High Court, of a Judge of the Supreme Court of the State exercising federal jurisdiction, or of the Inter-State Commission, three Justices of the High Court are to sit on appeal. Appeals from the lower courts may be determined by two Judges. The power given to the High Court to refer matters to the Privy Council is to be exercised only upon the concurrence of three Judges-that is to say, three of the Judges must agree before the federal jurisdiction is parted with. Applications for leave or special leave to appeal to the High Court from the judgment of the Supreme Court of a State, or of any court of a State from which an appeal now lies to the Privy Council, are to be determined by not less than three J udges. It is further provided that no Judge is to be allowed to take part in dealing with any appeal from his own judgment. under all these circumstances, that we should have not less than five Judges. Now, I desire to say a word or two with regard to the salaries proposed to be paid. The standard in both the United States and Canada is much lower than we propose to adopt; but even our separate States pay larger sums to their Judges than Canada or the United States. In Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland they pay to their Chief Justices as high a salary as we propose for the Chief Justice of the High Court. Mr M!C.DONALD -D o not way in which that high salary was fixed in Queensland.. Justices of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland are fixed at £3,500. In every country it is necessary to adopt the scale of living and payment that is generally recog-nised; and we are proposing to pay the Chief Justice of the whole of Australia only the same salary as is already paid in three of the single States. We are proposing to pay to the Judges only the same salary as is paid to the occupants of the Supreme Court benches of Victoria and New South Wales, although the Judges of the High Court in -each case have to perform judicial functions f j r the whole Commonwealth. So far as Victoria is concerned, a reduction in the salaries of her Judges has been proposed for the future; but this decision has been arrived at largely in view of the establishment of the Federal High Court.* In South Australia the Chief Justice gets £2,000 a year; in Western Australia, £1,700, and in Tasmania, £ 1 , 5 0 0; but if we consider the business proposed to be done in the High Court as compared with that transacted in any of the States, I think we shall realize that the payment here proposed to be made is not at all out of proportion with what is being done in the most economical of the States. Unless we pay reasonably high salaries, we cannot expect to create such a tribunal as we all desire to see. If we pay less than is being given by the various States in order to bring ourselves down to the American standard, the States, instead of the Federal Government will secure the pick of the Australian bars, and the Federal Court will occupy an inferior standing in the public eye to those courts whose judgments it will be called upon to review. get the men of the necessary standing capable of making the necessary sacrifices of salary for the honour and dignity attaching to the position. Eveni n thatcase we could not altogether escape the tendency of the people to look, at these matters from a pecuniary stand-point. They would probably assign to our High Court Judges a position inferior to thatoccupied by the State Judges drawing higher salaries. W it h regard to our capacity to create a court for ourselves, I propose to mention the read a few words from the remarks which that distinguished historian and jurist, Mr Bryce, made during the discussion which The salaries of the Chief took place on the Commonwealth Bill in the Imperial Parliament. Mr Bryce, speaking, as he did, with intimate knowledge of the United States judiciary, saidAustralia has now a population of nearly 4,000,000. When the Supreme Court of the United States entered upon its functions at the end of the last century, and when, in particular, Chief Justice Jay was succeeded in 1800 by the great Chief Justice Marshal, one of the first constitutional jurists of modern times, or, indeed, of any times, the population of the United States was almost exactly the same as the population of the Australian colonies now. Yet it was found possible, from that population of 4,000,000, to secure a court which was in every way worthy of the",38,Preferential Railwa Y Rates In The Many Of The Clauses Of This Bill Will Be Care

Consequently, the outlay should be very small. insufficient work ? be insufficient federal work to warrant us in constituting special offices in each State until we know more of the business to be done. apply to the Judges as well ? will be required to go on circuit and to hear all cases of apj>eal as well as to transact all the business created under the Commonwealth. I will undertake to say that the five Justicesi t is proposed to appoint will find ample work from the first. AlreadyI have had communications from private litigants inquiring the date of the appointment of the High Court, as appeals which would otherwise go to the Privy Council are being held back pending the establishment of this tribunal. These litigants prefer that their cases should be tried by an Australian court. To spare two Judges really means little or no saving, and to have no Eederal Judges and trust entirely to the States can only save us little more. We cannot have State courts doing all our work without some payments to them and some staff. In this connection might I ask if honourable members realize how almost every State of the Union litigation involving federal issues has been commenced. It is now proceeding in Western Australia, Queensland, and New South Wales, and will be proceeding in Victoria within a few days. I am also in receipt of a communication from the Attorney-General of a State informing me that his State intends to commence a suit against the Commonwealth on one of the most serious issues next week. Have honourable members noticed how our Customs Act, our Excise Act, and qur Immigration Restriction Act have been challenged? I understand also that the Pacific Island Labourers Act is to be attacked as soon as the High Court is appointed. it is drawn. sense of the situation of a new Federal Constitution to make such an interjection. If ' the honourable and learned member gave the matter a moment's consideration he would see that if the pen of angels had drawn these measures the same results would have followed. They would have been challenged. It is not the form but tlie substance of the Acts at which this litigation is aimed. It is novel to the great body of the people of the various States. They have not yet realized the federal situation, consequently it need not occasion the slightest surprise if every principal Act on our statute-book, and the' Constitution itself, is being made the subject of litigation. Clearly there is work enough accumulating now to occupy five Judges for a considerable period. What is the saving which would beeffected by delay in the establishment of theproposed tribunal ? Honourable members will notice that we put down only the sum of £6,000 per year to provide for all its officers, say £7,000, including the salary of the Crown Solicitor. That, added to the £15,000 paid as salaries to the Judges, after allowing for their travelling expenses, associates, ifec, will bring the amount up to £30,000 as a maximum. Yet we spend three-quarters of a million sterling upon war ? Can we afford three-quarters of a million for war, and not £30,000 for justice? What increased expenditure does the decision which was recently arrived at in regard to the lowest-paid officers of the public service represent? In the Postal department alone much is involved already? Ini t means an increased outlay of £40,000 or £50,000 per year. If it were assented to in its f u l l ' form, it would perhaps mean another £40,000 annually over the whole service, so that the total sum would represent three times as much as tlie expenditure for creating the High Court of Australia, in order that all the citizens of the Commonwealth may share in the judicial as well as the political rights conferred upon them. If we measure the consequences to this Commonwealth of a single mistaken judicial decision, we swallow up the amount represented by the salaries of the officers of the. High Court for many years.

76,Mr Deakin,"Certainly not ; but I am of justice. But admitting all these in' citizenship in Australia. The Federal Government, with all its complex interrelations and co-operations, demands a law abiding people. No other can make it a success. We cannot omit a tribunal on a national scale and with national ideals. It demands practically-minded interpreters of the Constitution, not only on the bench but in Parliament. A distinguished philosophical writer, Dr. Burgess, has not. hesitated to claim that the real secret of the success of the development of the United States is to be found in the fact that its ""fathers"" were led by lawyers as eminent as Hamilton and Madison when the foundations of its Constitution were laid, and that since then it has been under the guidance of eminent members of the legal profession of both parties and upon its bench that its development has followed one consistent course. Above and beyond these we have the greatest name of all, the name of Abraham Lincoln, a hero and a liberal as well as a lawyer. The achievements of the United States under a federal form of Government have been possible because of the law-abiding characteristics of its people, and it is to this that we ourselves must trust in the future for the safe, harmonious, and f r u it f u l working of our Constitution. Federation is legalism. Yeti t was not the first field of legal conquest. Eveni n the mother country the struggle against priestly and kingly tyranny began in the law courts; and it was led by legal minds. The case which John Hampden resisted for 20s. of ship money, marked the beginning of that greatrevolution which permanently transferred at last all power to the hands of the nation, Magna Charta and the Bill of Bights are legal documents like our Constitution. They express the strength and character of the people, and remain with us the proudest of monuments and the richest of heritages. I trust then that this Bill will be considered in the light of history, and of federal principles, that it will be regarded as a fulfilment of the Constitution : that we shall create in it a tribunal worthy of the people for whom it will acb, and of their forefathers whose practical genius has been demonstrated in their capacity to adapt their institutions and forms of government so as to fulfil the' will of the people, and, while giving that will the fullest and freest course, impart to it the solemn sanction of the law.

By ajDpointing one commissioner instead of three, as originally proposed, a great amount of responsibility will be thrown upon the person selected, and it is necessary that we should be able to secure the best man available. A t the present time, in some of the States salaries nearly as large as £1,200 a year are given to officials who have in their charge merely the supervision of one department. I always believe in paying a man well, and expecting him to do his duty, ancl I do not think that £1,500 a year is too much for an official who will have to control the whole Commonwealth service. Sir WILLIAM !

No doubt many men would be willing-to accept the position at that salary, because of its permanency and its prestige. AVe want one of tlie best men in the country for this position. salary of the commissioner at £ 1 , 200 a year, the fact that other officers in the service are that suggestion. I move Eeceiving. a still larger salary will be a blow to his prestige. The Senate, by the amendment which they have made in clause 9, have placed in the Bill a different description of the commissioner and his office from that inserted by the members of this Chamber. The view taken by this committee in regard to the commissioner was that he should be the recommending agent to the Executive as to the grade ancl salary of every officer in the service. That work would involve the possession of large experience ancl matured judgment, and of qualities which would, belong only to a man above the ordinary level of the public service, or of persons outside the service. The members of the Senate apparently desire the commissioner to be merely a recording officer, subject to political influence, and at If there is any truth in this report, it is a the beck and call of the Minister, not a person who would be to the public service what a managing director would be to a business concern. hope that the commissioner will not be merely a recording agent, and that we shall obtain for the position an excellent man, whose qualifications and strength of character will enable him. to do his work thoroughly well. I think, however, that £1,200 a year would be a sufiicient salary to commence with. Why should not. the salary of the commissioner grow like that of other officers ? I presume it is not intended that the Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs shall remain at £800 a year always ; but that, in time, his salary will be as high as that of corresponding officers in the State service.

For the purposes of the Act an inspector will really be a State commissioner. He will have just as much responsibility as if he were called a commissioner, but he will have a great deal less salary than is paid to the higher officers he will control, .tn New South Wales he will have to control more than 100 officers getting a higher salary than his own. It is almost certain that the Minister will select the commissioner from within the service, because he cannot get an expert civil service commissioner elsewhere. My idea would have ,been to appoint the commissioner at a salary of £1,200 a yea) , and to give the 1 inspectors the maximum salary paid to administrative officers within the States---tlia t as the inspector in ""Victoria or New South is, £1,000 a year in New South Wales, and I think £900 a year in the other States. The commissioner may have technically more responsibility to bear, but on the State inspectors will devolve nearly all the responsible work attached to the States. It is anomalous that the commissioner should be paid a very great deal more than any administrative officer in the States, while inspectors are to be paid salaries very much below those of administrative officers. worth) -There is no analogy between an inspector and the commissioner, who has to determine a large number of things, and is really responsible for the whole service. Take the case of a great company whose chairman gets a salary of £5,000 or £6,000 a year, and whose other officers are paid in proportion. The business of an inspector will largely be the business of checking. member point to any case where a bank inspector gets less than one of the bank managers awav in the country ? many cases of thab kind. Often the head officer of a bank may ask a good accounbant, who has a fairly moderate salary, to check bhe books of a branch bank, whose manager is getting three times his salary. This is not a matter of administration; ib is a matter of checking administration, and mechanical work more or less, which requires the use of brains and intelligence. We cannot specify all the duties of a public service inspector. He must have his eyes open to every possible thing connected with the service. I do nob suggesb bhab he is simply on a par with an auditor : but he is, to a large extent, that class of man. I do nob see bhab a man who inspects and checks should get the same salary as a man who is doing a large amount of administrative and responsible work in bhe deparbmenbs. it left this House, was somewhat deficient. It put all the inspectors on the same plane as regarded salary and position, although the duties will vary very considerably in different States. The Senate might have better achieved its object by providing that the salary should nob be less bhan so much, nor more than so much. It is a foolish thing to put the inspector who looks after the officers in Tasmania on the same plane Wales. Whereas some thousands of men are employed in a large State, only a few hundred may be employed in a smaller State. The same class of man is not needed for the less difficult work as for tlie more difficult work. It is inevitable bhab we shall have differenb grades of ability amongst the six inspectors, and the inspector in a small State, if he has proved himself efficient, will look forward to promotion to an inspectorship in a larger Sbate. member for Bland was nob in the chamber, I bhink, when I spoke on bhis amendmenb.

That would meet the case, and thab is whab I am proposing now.

I think there will -be an inspector for Western Australia, and there may be one for Tasmania; but the salaries of those inspectors will not be as large as the salary of an inspector who has to deal with many more civil servants, as in Victoria, or New South Wales, or probably Queensland. The inspectors in the small States, who will probably be younger men, will look forward to stepping into positions, when vacant, in the larger States, at a better salary. what the Minister has just indicated, as the basis on which he will estimate the value of the inspectors, will not be the only consideration with him. In such States as Queensland and Western Australia, there is a great deal to be said with regard to the difficulties and discomforts of travelling. In Western Australia, that of itself would be a very considerable factor with many civil servants in considering an offer. Such matters are entitled to consideration by the Minister, and Avill go very far to weigh against any greater amount of work which an inspector may have to perform in more thickly populated States.

Clause 21(5) Upon the receipt of such report, and upon obtaining any further information which may be necessary, the commissioner shall determine whether such officer is entitled to the full amount or any part of the prescribed increase as a reward for earnest application to duty and meritorious public service, and in the case of a female as being as capable of satisfactorily performing the work as a male. (0) Every such officer shall be entitled, if of the age of 21 years, to a salary of £110 per annum, provided he has been employed for a period of not less than three years in the public service, o£ which one year has been in such division, and shows, by passing the prescribed examination, that he is capable of'doing the work of an office to which the salary of that amount is attached. Motion proposedTbat the committee agree to the Senate's amendment omitting the words ""and in the case of a -female as being as capable of satisfactorily performing the work as a male."" were inserted by this committee, but as they seem to make a distinction between males and females in the service, and the matter is somewhat in the discretion of the commissioner, we shall do no harm in agreeing to the amendment. no distinction will be made between male and female officers, if these words are omitted 1 think that the effect of the Senate's amendment will be quite the opposite of that stated by the Minister for Home Affairs. This question was thoroughly threshed out by honourable members on a previous occasion when a majority determined that if a female officer discharged the duties of her office as efficiently as they could be performed by a male, she should receive the same rate of remuneration. In this connection I should like to hear the views of the honourable and learned member for Indi who brought the matter forward. the recollection of honourable members that the words which it is now proposed to excise were inserted as a guarantee to the committee when they were altering the schedule, that they were not going beyond what was right and proper. Under that schedule, in its original form, the female officer was in all cases to receive less than the male up to a certain standard, beyond which she could not go. Thereupon the committee decided that if a woman could perform the duties of her office, as well as they could be discharged by a man, she should receive the same salary. The striking out of these words will not injure either male or female employee's, but I warn the Minister that I am not going to agree to all the amendments to this clause. that the Minister for Home Affairs should inform the committee of the position which he intends to assume in connection with this matter. I should also like to know whether it is true, as has been stated in the press, that the adoption of the minimum wage decided upon by this committee will result in an increased expenditure of £45,000 annually 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE As was pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Indi, these words were inserted because the schedule originally contained a provision that females should in all cases receive a lower salary than males. I do not intend at this moment to refer to the question of the extra cost which is involved in the proposal to pav a minimum wage of £110. Amendment agreed to. Motion proposedThat the committee agree to the Senate's amendment to omit the words ""shows by passing the prescribed examination,"" line 15, and to insert in lieu thereof the words "" provided thab he satisfies the commissioner."" Sir WILLIAM LYNE In this connection, I might mention that I have received a return relating to the number of persons employed in the professional, clerical, and general divisions of the Postal deparbmenb, who have been bhree years in bhe service, have attained the age of 21 years, and have been provided for on the draft Estimates for 1901-2 at a salary of less than £ 1 1 0 .

Sir WILLIAM LYNE that, but I have given the information supplied to me in regard to the three divisions. the number of males and females in the general division 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE ful l details. There are no females, but .27 mules in the professional divison, while the figures for the clerical division are as follow-New females; Victoria, 29 males, 193 females; Queensland, 7 males, no return as to females; South Australia, 56 males, 14 females; Tasmania, 20 males, 31 females; Western Australia, 2 males, 17 females. Coming to the general, or unclassified division, the figures are as follow:New South Wales, 702 males, 33 females; Victoria, 342 males, 89 females; Queensland, 30 males, noreturn as to females; South Australia, 59 males, 42 females; Tasmania, 11 males, 8 females. There is no return as to males in Western Australia, but there are 50 females. These figures of course apply only to those cases in regard to which this provision would be effective. The cost of the increases would be as follows:-Ne w South Wales, males £16,470, females £ 1 , 7 1 0; Victoria, males £7,750, females £7,550 ? Queensland, males £1,70S, no return as to females; South Australia, .males £3,300, females £3,200 ; Tasmania, males £S24, females £ 8 6 8 ; Western Aus. tralia, males£10,females£2,3S0 . This shows that, if no discretionary power were given to the commissioner, a very large sum would be required to be expended in an arbitrary way in order to meet the increased payments. The Government would like very much to be in a position to give the increases to the fullest extent; but we have to consider seriously whether we should be justified in expending at once so large a sum in giving these increases. Thusi t is that I propose to accept the Senate's I think so. I amendment of sub-clause (6) of clause 21, giving the commissioner a discretion. The same statement will apply to clause 25. In -administering this measure it will be my desire, as far as possible, to give females every opportunity of undertaking work which can be properly carried out by them at fair rates of pay, and not at starvation salaries. I fear that if the Bill were passed as it left this Chamber, originally, its effect would be to a great extent contrary to the intention of those who strongly I am aware of favoured some of the amendments made in this direction. In many cases there would be a disposition not to employ women. I did not think that would be the case when the Bill was last before us, but from information which I have gathered since, I I shall give the firmly believe that it would not be i u the best interests of the women, who should be allowed to do work which they are able to perform, to leave the clause as it first South Wales, 129 males, 8 passed this House. There should be some discretion to the commissioner, not only to retain females in the service who are able to do the work, but to take on others who can pass the necessary examination, or satisfy him of their fitness. I desire to again impress upon the committee that it is with a twofold object that I propose to accept this amendment. In the first place, my object is that we shall not do injury where we hope to do good. While in the New South Wales Legislature, I was always in favour of allowing the light work in our Post and Telegraph department to be performed, wherever possible, by women, who find it very difficult to obtain employment. I should be very sorry to see introduced into this Bill'a provision which would really be contrary to the intention of the committee in passing the clause as it left this Chamber previously. I hope the committee will accept the amendment. to the Minister for Home Affairs that tlie figures he has placed before us constitute an -excellent reason for postponing the consideration of this clause. We have had no opportunity of checking them, and seeing how far they justify the action of the Government.

It is unfair to ask us to come to a decision upon so important a matter before the production of those returns. What the returns will show will make no difference in the attitude which I take up, but I think that the committee is entitled to have a fair chance of considering these figures. The consideration of the amendment should be postponed until the return has been printed. Sir WILLIAM LYNE we have before us one of the most, if not the most important and debatable of the amendments made by the Senate, and I do not wish to ask honourable members to deal with it without due consideration. I was not aware that any return had been asked for such as has been referred to by the honourable member for Yarra, but I am prepared to obtain all the information possible, and to have it printed and circulated, together with the figures I have just quoted. This amendment, as well as the amendments of clauses 23 and 25, can stand over until ' to-morrow, so that I can distribute the necessary information amongst honourable members. I move' That the Senate's amendments in clauses 21,23, and 25 be postponed. that the return winch I asked for has not been laid on the table of the House. It would enable us to ascertain .how long the particular officers involved in this question have been employed, and that information would guide the committee in determining whether, or not this amendment, or any modification of it, should be agreed to. I do not think that the com.mittee will agree to strike out the principle of the' minimum wage altogether, as it would do by carrying this clause as amended' by another place. The figures given by the Minister show that the greatest proportion of the expenditure involved in the giving of these increases will be borne by the two largest States, and the necessary information should be obtainable within a few days. [IS MAR., 1902.] Bill. 10995 am in favour of postponing this and the other amendments to which reference has been made, in order that the figures quoted by the Minister may be printed, I desire to say that sub-clause (6) of clause 21, as amended by another place, would inflict a very great injustice upon tlie clerical, as opposed to the general division. It was proposed, under clause 25, as it left this Chamber, that any person in the general division of the age of 21, who had served three years, should receive a salary of not less than £ 1 1 0 per annum; while in the clerical division, earnest application and meritorious service alone entitle persons to a salary of £ 1 1 0 a year after so many years of service. This is a flagrant injustice, and at tlie proper time. I shall seek to amend the clause. Nor shall I recognise that I agree to that provision until it is laid down in what way the commissioner is to be satisfied. A similar provision is contained in the New South Wales Public Service Act, and there, after men have passed examinations, they find that they are no better off, and that they have still somebody to satisfy. The Postmaster General, when the Bill was before the Senate, clearly stated that the provision, so far as it related to the clerical division, would not affect his department, because the department had for some time past been in the habit of recognising a similar obligation. . It was to the application of the provision to the general division that the Government took exception. I am astonished to learn that they now propose to oppose its application to both divisions. wish to impress upon the Minister the necessity of obtaining the return asked for by the honourable member for Yarra. I am positive that if it is produced, it will be seen that there are many people over 21 years of age who have been a large number of years in the service, and who receive less than £110 a year. On the day following tliat upon which tlie honourable member for Yarra ""moved for his return, I was promised, by the Prime Minister a similar return in regard, to the persons in the clerical division of the -service.

I think it would be monstrous to give a salary of £110 per year to every person over 21 years of age who had been in the service for more than three years. Such a provision, if carried, would have the effect of prohibiting the further employment of women in the service. I do not hesitate to say that there are in clerical division. It is cases like that for the Post-office a large number of persons who are underpaid, and in whose cases the increase would be justifiable. Buti t would be au outrage to the country to give this increase in every case. We are shortly to be asked to discuss the Postal Rates Bill, and if we agree to this proposal we shall be told, when we ask for concessions for country districts in regard to postal and telegraph matters, that we cannot have them because of the increased expenditure forced upon the department. must be some misapprehension about the term of probation shall not in any case extend amount of money which the application of beyond twelve months."" the principle to which reference has been made will cost, ancl I ask the Minister to ascertain, for the information of the committee, what the actual cost per annum is likely to be.

If he does, it will reveal a state of like to offer. things which should make some Victorians blush.

If f u ll information is given, I am but I do not see why they should extend -sure that the committee will see that no the term. further wrong is done to these people, even though it mav cost £45,000 to prevent it am afraid that in New South Wales things are not much better in this particular than they are in Victoria. The reason for all these shocking cases is that opportunities for the promotion of junior officers do not occur frequently enough. There is no intention on the part of the department to sweat its officers. It may happen that where there amendment in clause 33 agreed to. are only a few chances of promotion, they may go to those who obtain the ear of the superior officer. I received to-day a letter I , therefore, whose contents no doubt are similar to those of letters received by many other honourable members. The writer has been in the postal service for nine years, and is now receiving a salary of only £ 8 0 per year, notwithstanding the fact that he has passed a technical examination in telegraphy, and an examination qualifying him for the which we are legislating, and I think that it will be well to postpone the consideration of the clauses now before us until we have exact information as to their effect.

In a doubtful case it would give the probationer a chance of six months' further trial before annulling his appointment.

I take up the position that no one should have a right to appointment before these men who are willing to serve their country, at their own expense in hundreds of cases with rifles and ammunition, and go to drill at very great inconvenience to themselves. They have a prior right, it appears to me, not only by this amendment, but also by what has been the practice in Victoria since 1883.

In bhe prisons and the asylums here you will find, I cannot acin the position of warders, men who have undergone a large amount of drill and discipline.

Such an idea is opposed to bhe very besb tra-dibions of the British race. .always set our face againsb anything of the kind. I detest amateurs of all kinds, and I would rather place my trust in a soldier who has 'been taught his business, than in a volunteer who frequently does more harm to his friends than bo his foes. The honourable member would, by his proposal, stimulate bhe whole of bhe active population to join .the military forces in order that .they might have a chance of securing a good Government billet. We should keep the civil departments entirely disassociated from the military, and -we should depend for the defence of our country upon men who are thoroughly trained ""for the purpose. The honourable member's arguments are not convincing, but where they are not absurd are , lamenbably weak, and I hope bhe committee will rejecb bhe amendmenb. order to show the utter selfishness of the proposal, it is sufficient to say bhat the men serving in Soubh Africa who return after the passing of this measure, will not be entitled bo appoinbment to the .public service until all the men who have stayed at home have been provided for. Amendment disagreed to. Amendments in clauses 40 and 41 agreed bo. Clause 43(1) No officer shall be promoted from a class in the professional division or clerical division to n higher class, or be transferred from one department to another, unless he has passed such examination as is prescribed for such class in the department in or to which he is promoted or transferred.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE I propose that we should agree with this amendment, beBut cause it is almost ridiculous to require an officer to pass an examination every time he passes from one class to another. After an officer has passed an examination for the firsb class, and has been in bhe service for some time, the commissioner should be in a position bo know whebher he is fit to be passed to the next class, without his undergoing another examination. rather a mistake to insist upon an examination of any kind, even for the professional class. There must be .an examination for admission to the service, and perhaps in conWe have nexion with some exceptional appointments, but if we insist that men who hawe attained a fair age shall go through a detailed examination in alii the technicalities of their professional work, we shall inflict great hardship in many cases.

He is thus reasonably assured that his case w ill be thoroughly inquired into.

In other words, even if he were previously insured,-he would be compelled to re-insure. So far as mere drafting is concerned, I think that the amendment is an improvement.

I thoroughly agree that that should be done. The Railways Commissioners of New South Wales have gazetted certain offices of which they are prepared to approve, and the Commonwealth departments should be able to do the same. This is not a question of boycotting companies; we say simply that the Government should be satisfied of the solvency and stability of the companies in which officers assure tlieir lives, so that they may have a reasonable prospect of obtaining the amount of their policies. That can be secured better by requiring them to assure thei r lives in companies which have their headquarters here. It may appear to be a narrow minded view to take, but until the Government arrange a system of State assurance, they should adopt this course. not more philanthropically than do the foreign offices, but if there were a crisis, Australian offices registered here would appeal to the Commonwealth Parliament for assistance. Whichever way we view this matter, we shall find that it will be in the interests of the Commonwealth administration, and in the interests of the officers themselves if the preference is given to offices which have tlieir head-quarters in Australia. . MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I hope that the Government will acceptthe Senate's amendment. It is very strange to hear honourable members who are continually crying out for British fair play, talking about boycotting societies which have complied with the laws of Australia, and challenged the Government to send an vjtuary to their offices. Offices whose headqaarters are elsewhere are absolutely under State assurance departments. That cannot be said of any Australian office; no man can say whether the local offices are sound or otherwise, or where their money is invested. There is no special standard of valuation whereby their policies can be valued, so that it can be said"" There is so much invested in Government bonds, and so much in lands."" Before the banks broke here in 1893, people told me that it would be impossible to find anything stronger in which to invest. W it h few exceptions, however, the local banks crossed the eternal stream; the only ones that did not go over were those having British connexions from which they could obtain foreign money. South Wales did not reconstruct. Mr O'MALLEY -But it has a British connection, and every ship that arrived here at the time brought money to it . We have certain laws which call upon foreign companies doing business here to deposit £10,000 in the case of Victoria, and £20,000 in the case of New South Wales. Those laws have been complied with, and I am prepared to wager a b it for the hospitals that the American companies have more in Victoria, in proportion to their assets, than has any other company which is doing business here. morrow and clear out.

Rotten as Tammany is, it does not beat Sydney, where we find the widow of every corporation labourer running dustcarts. The superintendent of the company is not appointed by Tammany Hall. Do honourable members fear legitimate competition? It is hard enough to get business for any but Australian companies as. it is. Every dollar which the American companies have put into their buildings is at the mercy of the people of the State, and the companies have behind them inexhaustible reserves, invested, not in bandicoot stations and fly-blistered, top-heavy institutions, but in ""United States bonds. I object to having my bread and butter taken from me. I am not going to be compelled to join the unemployed merely because I have become a Member of Parliament; and my work in connection with these companies keeps me out of the destitute asylum.

Mr O'MALLEY -The honourable member deserved that. I put him in, so that he is my child. The provision which I am discussing throws a doubt upon the stability of companies which are prepared to allow any investigation into their condition. If the Commonwealth liked to send actuaries to the city of Albany, or to the head-quarters of any of these companies, they would be ready to open their books to them, and to give them an absolute demonstration of their position. W ill honourable gentlemen say that all the companies which have their head-quarters in Australia, are sound ? I am prepared to go on to the public platform and show tliat many of them are not. I have been tilling brains for the last 26 years, and living upon other men's intelligence, and I say that there are companies having their head-quarters in Australia which, if they came under the Insurance department of the State of New York, would be closed before twelve o'clock to-morrow. Yeti t is proposed to shut out these American companies. Such a proposal is not wise, and I ask the committee for the sake of its own honour not to agree to it.

The assets should be of a substantial character, and if they 'were too fluid of course the Government would not approve of the offices. I feel quite certain that if the United States Government had a provision in their Public Service Act that the lives of their officers should be assured, they would take very good care that they were not assured in foreign companies without local assets. We ought not to exclude a British company. Surely we will accept the companies of the Empire-so long as they are approved by the Government. It would be a most undesirable thing to exclude British companies. I am hardly prepared to go so far as the amendment goes, and to accept without caution an office of a country with which we may be at war any day, and whose obligations to Great Britain may be cancelled. Great Britain may even be at war with America some day.

Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) I have the strongest objection to the retention of the words"" having its head office in Australia."" That is a disqualification and a limitation, which would be discreditable to the Eederal Parliament.

An exception oughb to be made in favour of our kinsmen if any is made. This disqualification would look as if it were aimed at certain great companies whose head offices are in the United States. It might be regarded by the people of the United States and investors as a blow aimed at those companies especially, and as an unfriendly act. The case might be met by giving to the Eederal Executive the power to approve of those companies in which civil servants might assure their lives, and we could trust the Government not to approve of companies which did not have a sufficient amount of assets in Australia to meet bheir obligations. I would suggesb bhe insertion of the words "" approved by the Governor General,"" after the word ""Australia.""

We should do a great injustice to our public officers if we deprived them of the opportunity to insure in some of the large British and Scottish offices which are doing business here. When I was in the United States some time ago, I made it my business to inquire very carefully into the standing of the large American companies, and I can fully endorse what has been stated by the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr every one of them has been able to secure O'M alley, as to the critical analysis which is the approval of the Executive. There 'is a made of all securities held by the insurance companies i u that country. We have no such provision in tlie Commonwealth, but it is highly desirable that some such law should be passed. MrL . E. GROOM (Darling Downs) I think the suggestion made by the Minister might be approved of. It is provided by the .Life Insurance Companies Act, which was passed in Queensland in 1901, that companies doing business in that ""State shall deposit with the Treasurer the sum of £10,000, to be invested by him in debentures or Government stocks, or that they shall deposit similar securities of the value of £10,000. already proved their bona fides, and as they are regulated by the State laws, any public officers of the Commonwealth in Queenland who may hold policies in these companies will be to some extent protected. These societies may all be approved of by the Minister with safety. very sorry to see the committee stultify itself in the way proposed. The clause, as it was passed by this committee, and sent to the Senate, was the subject of a very long discussion, and it was insisted upon hy this House, and finally agreed that the approved companies should have their head offices in Australia, because it was conshall effect an assurance of his life with some sidered desirable that we should keep within the Commonwealth the premiums paid by our own public servants. Australia needs cheap money, and we ought to do everything possible to make the Commonwealth a great financial centre. The Australian Mutual Provident Society proved a tower of strength in the 1893 crisis. When civil war raged in the United States, the Southern confederacy, in order to keep the money within their own territory, cancelled all obligations on the part of the residents in the southern States to the people against whom they were fighting, and, if war broke out between Great Britain and some foreign country, something similar might happen in our case. Our people might find tliat foreign companies would refuse to pay their policies. Nothing is to be gained from the introduction of the word ""approved."" A similar provision has existed in the Public ServiceA c t in Victoria for many years, but it has not affected the operations of the companies, because good deal of doubt about the position of at least one foreign company which is carrying on operations in our midst, and if this company were to be among those approved, the Commonwealth would be placed in an invidious position. We could not allow our public servants to be victimized by any company, and it is just as well, therefore, for us to have dealings only with such companies as we can closely supervise and control. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). -We shall get over all difficulty by inserting the word "" approved "" as has been proposed. Surely we can leave it to the Some of the companies have Executive to decide which companies should be approved. I hope that during the coming recess the Government will consider the question of instituting a national system of insurance. The Commonwealth should certainly undertake the insurance of the lives of its own servants, and should also arrange for taking all its own fire risks. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I think that under the circumstances a slight alteration of the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, might meet the case.

It is essential that we should have some governing power with regard to these societies, and I think that as far as our officers are concerned a State system of insurance might very reasonably be adopted.

I am desirous of the journey being made, if possible, direct from Melbourne to Orange, and thence on to the other Bites. The Minister, however, proposes to take honourable members to Sydney first, then to bring them back over the Southern line, and afterwards convey them to Orange, which would give them a totally wrong impression of the journey to that place from the Southern States. I fear that Orange is likely to be misjudged on account of the present way in which' it is proposed to reach that town. . worth) -Regarding the question of the Easter adjournment, I may mention that I spoke to the Prime Minister, pointing out that, in my judgment, a worse result would be yielded by breaking into two weeks than by working a little later during the present week, and adjourning over the whole of next week. According to present arrangements, I understand that we are to rise on Thursday week, and to resume the following Wednesday. Thus any honourable member from the adjoining States, who wishes to transact business at home, will arrive at his destination upon Friday, which is a holiday; Saturday and Monday are also holidays, and it will be necessary for him to leave for Melbourne on the Tuesday, so as to be here on Wednesday. It would be far better, in my opinion, to work the whole of Friday of the present week and into Saturday, so that honourable members may leave for their homes upon that afternoon, and then have the following week for purposes of of suggesting anything which would not give as good a result as the Government proposal, and I therefore ask the Attorney General to bring this matter before the Prime Minister to-morrow.

162,Mr Joseph Cook,"Afte r the Tariff is-line to Harden, and thence to Orange, which is almost a straight -line between Melbourne and Orange, I da, not know whether it is possible to do that. 1 thought that every objection which could possibly be urged had been met. The great objection raised in connection with the senatorial inspection was that Bombala was the last place visited. Upon this occasion I thought that that objection had been overcome. I will consider the question raised by the honourable member, and see if it is possible to meet him in this matter.. General) -Regarding the Easter adjournment, I shall be glad if the acting leader of the Opposition will consult honourable members upon his side of the Chamber with a view to acquainting the Government definitely as to what arrangement will best meet their .convenience. I might also make a similar request to honourable members upon the Government side of the House. Of course the extent of the Easter adjournment, like everything else, depends upon the transaction of public business ; but if we could first dispose of the Tariff, the length of the adjournment would, of course, be a comparatively unimportant matter. Question resolved in the affirmative. House.adjourned at 10.59 p.m. -",59,Adjournment Eastjsr Holidays Inspection Of Federal Capital Sitks
